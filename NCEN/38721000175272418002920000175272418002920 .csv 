"3628","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"3629","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Franklin Custodian Funds"
"3630","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"3631","Franklin US Government Securities Fund, Franklin Growth Fund,"
"3632","Franklin Utilities Fund, Franklin Dynatech Fund, Franklin"
"3633","Income Fund, and Franklin Focused Growth Fund"
"3634","(collectively the Funds) as of and for the year ended"
"3635","September 30, 2018, in accordance with the standards of"
"3636","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)"
"3637"," (PCAOB), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"3638","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"3639","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"3640"," for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"3641","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN,"
"3642"," but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"3643","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3644"," reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"3645","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"3646"," financial reporting."
"3647","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"3648"," and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"3649","  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"3650"," management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"3651","costs of controls.  A company's internal control over financial"
"3652"," reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"3653","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"3654"," of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"3655"," generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal"
"3656","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"3657","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"3658"," in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"3659"," and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"3660","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"3661"," to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"3662"," generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"3663"," expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"3664"," authorizations of management and directors of the company; and"
"3665","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"3666"," detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of"
"3667","a company's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"3668"," financial statements."
"3669","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"3670"," financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"3671","  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"3672"," periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"3673"," because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"3674"," with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3675","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"3676","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"3677"," or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"3678"," functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"3679","  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"3680","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"3681"," such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"3682"," misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial"
"3683","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3684","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3685"," reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"3686"," paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"3687"," in internal control over financial reporting that might be"
"3688","material weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB."
"3689","  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal"
"3690"," control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"3691"," controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be"
"3692"," a material weakness as defined above as of September 30, 2018."

"3723","Notice of Automatic Conversion of Class C Shares to Class A Shares"
"3724"," after 10-Year Holding Period"
"3725","At Board meetings held on February 26 and 27, 2018, the Board"
"3726","of Trustees approved an automatic conversion feature for the Fund's"
"3727"," Class C shares (which includes Class C1 shares as applicable)"
"3728","that will automatically convert shareholders' Class C shares into"
"3729"," Class A shares of the same Fund after they have been held for"
"3730"," 10 years. After conversion, your new shares will be subject to"
"3731"," Class A shares' lower Rule 12b-1 fees.  The conversion feature"
"3732"," will become effective on or about October 5, 2018.  Later that"
"3733","month Class C shares of the Fund that have been outstanding for"
"3734"," 10 years or more will automatically convert to Class A shares"
"3735","of such Fund on the basis of the relative net asset values of"
"3736","the two classes. Thereafter, Class C shares of the Fund will"
"3737","convert automatically to Class A shares of such Fund on a monthly"
"3738"," basis in the month of, or the month following, the 10-year"
"3739","anniversary of the Class C shares' purchase date. Class C shares of"
"3740"," the Fund acquired through automatic reinvestment of dividends or"
"3741","distributions will convert to Class A shares of the Fund on the"
"3742","conversion date pro rata with the converting Class C shares of"
"3743","the Fund that were not acquired through reinvestment of dividends"
"3744"," or distributions."
"3745","Shareholders will not pay a sales charge, including a contingent"
"3746"," deferred sales charge, upon the conversion of their Class C"
"3747","shares to Class A shares pursuant to this conversion feature."
"3748","The automatic conversion of the Fund's Class C shares into Class"
"3749"," A shares after the 10-year holding period is not expected to be"
"3750"," a taxable event for federal income tax purposes. Shareholders"
"3751","should consult with their tax advisor regarding the state and"
"3752","local tax consequences of such conversions."
"3753","Class C shares held through a financial intermediary in an omnibus"
"3754"," account will be converted into Class A shares only if the"
"3755","intermediary can document that the shareholder has met the"
"3756","required holding period. In certain circumstances, when shares"
"3757"," are invested through retirement plans, omnibus accounts, and"
"3758"," in certain other instances, the Fund and its agents may not have"
"3759"," transparency into how long a shareholder has held Class C shares"
"3760"," for purposes of determining whether such Class C shares are eligible"
"3761"," for automatic conversion into Class A shares and the financial"
"3762","intermediary may not have the ability to track purchases to credit"
"3763"," individual shareholders' holding periods.  This primarily occurs"
"3764","when shares are invested through certain record keepers for group"
"3765","retirement plans, where the intermediary cannot track share aging"
"3766","at the participant level.  In these circumstances, the Fund will"
"3767"," not be able to automatically convert Class C shares into Class A"
"3768"," shares as described above. In order to determine eligibility for"
"3769"," conversion in these circumstances, it is the responsibility of"
"3770","the shareholder or their financial intermediary to notify the Fund"
"3771"," that the shareholder is eligible for the conversion of Class C"
"3772","shares to Class A shares, and the shareholder or their financial"
"3773"," intermediary may be required to maintain and provide the Fund with"
"3774"," records that substantiate the holding period of Class C shares."
"3775"," It is the financial intermediary's (and not the Fund's)"
"3776","responsibility to keep records and to ensure that the shareholder"
"3777"," is credited with the proper holding period. Please consult with"
"3778"," your financial intermediary about your shares' eligibility for"
"3779","this conversion feature."
"3780","Also effective October 5, 2018, new accounts or plans may not be"
"3781","eligible to purchase Class C shares of the Fund if it is determined"
"3782"," that the intermediary cannot track shareholder holding periods to"
"3783","determine whether a shareholder's Class C shares are eligible for"
"3784"," conversion to Class A shares.  Accounts or plans (and their"
"3785","successor, related and affiliated plans) that have Class C shares"
"3786"," of the Fund available to participants on or before October 5, 2018,"
"3787"," may continue to open accounts for new participants in such share"
"3788","class and purchase additional shares in existing participant"
"3789"," accounts.  The Fund has no responsibility for overseeing, monitoring"
"3790"," or implementing a financial intermediary's process for determining"
"3791"," whether a shareholder meets the required holding period for"
"3792"," conversion."
"3793","A financial intermediary may sponsor and/or control accounts,"
"3794","programs or platforms that impose a different conversion schedule"
"3795"," or different eligibility requirements for the conversion of Class C"
"3796","shares into Class A shares. In these cases, Class C shareholders may"
"3797"," convert to Class A shares under the policies of the financial"
"3798","intermediary and the conversion may be structured as an exchange of"
"3799"," Class C shares for Class A shares of the same Fund. Financial"
"3800","intermediaries will be responsible for making such exchanges in those"
"3801"," circumstances. Please consult with your financial intermediary"
"3802","if you have any questions regarding your shares' conversion from"
"3803"," Class C shares to Class A shares."

"4320","Shares shall be issued except as the Board of Trustees may"
"4321","otherwise determine from time to time.  The Board of Trustees"
"4322"," may make such rules not inconsistent with the provisions of"
"4323","the 1940 Act as it considers appropriate for the issuance of"
"4324","Share certificates, the transfer of Shares of the Trust and"
"4325","each Series and Class thereof, if any, and similar matters."
