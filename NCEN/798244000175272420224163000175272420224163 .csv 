"8196","(United States), we considered the Trust's internal"

"8198","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"8199","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"8200","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"
"8201","the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the"
"8202","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"8203","the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"8204","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"8205","The management of the Trust is responsible for"

"8208","estimates and judgments by management are required to"

"8210","A company's internal control over financial reporting is"

"8213","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"8214","in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting"
"8215","principles. A company's internal control over financial"

"8217","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"8218","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
