<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>In planning and performing our audit of the
financial statements of Centre Funds, comprising Centre American Select Equity Fund, Centre Active U.S. Treasury Fund, and Centre
Global Infrastructure Fund (the &ldquo;Funds&rdquo;), as of and for the year or period ended September 30, 2018, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds&rsquo; internal control
over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for
the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds&rsquo; internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,
we express no such opinion.</P>

<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>The management of the Funds is responsible
for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates
and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund&rsquo;s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
A fund&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of a fund&rsquo;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>

<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>

<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>A deficiency in internal control over financial
reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing
their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the Funds&rsquo; annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</P>

<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>Our consideration of the Funds&rsquo; internal
control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose
all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds&rsquo; internal control over financial reporting
and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above
as of September 30, 2018.</P>
