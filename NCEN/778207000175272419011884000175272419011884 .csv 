"22716","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"

"23604","The sub-adviser may engage in frequent and active trading of portfolio"
"23605","investments to achieve the portfolio's investment objective. The portfolio"
"23606","does not directly invest in real estate."
"23607","The sub-adviser may, when consistent with the portfolio's investment"
"23608","objective, use futures, options, contracts for difference, forward contracts"
"23609","and/or swaps, including interest rate swaps and credit default swaps"
"23610","(collectively, commonly known as derivatives), for purposes of managing"
"23611","risk or to enhance total return. The portfolio may use foreign exchange"
"23612","swaps, spots  and forward contracts to maintain the currency exposure against"
"23613","the benchmark. The portfolio may also use derivatives for leverage."
"23614","The portfolio concentrates its investments in securities of issuers in the real"
"23615","estate industry. This portfolio is non-diversified."
"23616","PRINCIPAL RISKS:"
"23617","The portfolio will no longer be subject to the following principal risks:"
"23618","Fixed Income"
"23619","Securities; Interest Rate; and Prepayment or Call. These risks will be"
"23620","removed from"
"23621","the Principal Risks section of the Prospectus and Summary Prospectus."
"23622","In addition,"
"23623","the following principal risks will be added to the Principal Risks"
"23624","section of the"
"23625","Prospectus and Summary Prospectus as principal risks of investing in the"
"23626","portfolio:"
"23627","Currency Hedging - The portfolio may hedge its currency risk using"
"23628","currency futures, forwards or options. However, hedging strategies and/or"
"23629","these instruments may not always work as intended, and a portfolio may be"
"23630","worse off than if it had not used a hedging strategy or instrument."
"23631","Derivatives - Using derivatives exposes the portfolio to additional risks and"
"23632","can increase portfolio losses and reduce opportunities for gains when market"
"23633","prices, interest rates, currencies, or the derivatives themselves, behave in a"
"23634","way not anticipated by the portfolio. Using derivatives may have a leveraging"
"23635","effect, increase portfolio volatility and not produce the result intended."
"23636","Certain derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the"
"23637","size"
"23638","of the initial investment. Derivatives may be difficult to sell, unwind or"
"23639","value,"
"23640","and the counterparty may default on its obligations to the portfolio."
"23641","Derivatives are generally subject to the risks applicable to the assets,"
"23642","rates,"
"23643","indices or other indicators underlying  the derivative.  The value of a"
"23644","derivative may fluctuate more than, or otherwise not correlate well with, the"
"23645","underlying assets,  rates, indices or other indicators to which it relates."
"23646","Use of"
"23647","derivatives may have different tax consequences for the portfolio than an"
"23648","investment in the underlying security, and those differences may affect the"
"23649","amount, timing and character of income distributed to shareholders. The U.S."
"23650","government and foreign governments are in the process of adopting and"
"23651","implementing regulations governing derivatives markets, including"
"23652","mandatory clearing of certain derivatives, margin and reporting requirements."
"23653","The ultimate impact of the regulations remains unclear. Additional regulation"
"23654","of derivatives may make derivatives more costly, limit their availability or"
"23655","utility, otherwise adversely affect their performance, or disrupt markets. For"
"23656","additional information regarding derivatives, see More on Risks of Investing
in the Portfolios - More on Principal Risks: Derivatives in this prospectus."
"23657","In addition, the SEC has proposed a new rule that would change the"
"23658","regulation of the use of derivatives by registered investment companies, such"
"23659","as the portfolio. If the proposed rule, or a different rule, takes effect, it"
"23660","could"
"23661","limit the ability of the portfolio to invest in derivatives."
"23662","Growth Stocks - Returns on growth stocks may not move in tandem with"
"23663","returns on other categories of stocks or the market as a whole. Growth stocks"
"23664","typically are particularly sensitive to market movements because their market"
"23665","prices tend to reflect future expectations. When it appears those expectations"
"23666","may not be met, the prices of growth securities typically fall. Growth stocks"
"23667","as a group may be out of favor and underperform the overall equity market"
"23668","for a long period of time, for example,  while the market favors value"
"23669","stocks."
"23670","Leveraging - The value of your investment may be more volatile to the"
"23671","extent that the portfolio borrows or uses derivatives  or other investments,"
"23672","such as ETFs, that have embedded leverage. Other risks also will be"
"23673","compounded because leverage generally magnifies the effect of a change in"
"23674","the value of an asset and creates a risk of loss of value on a larger pool of"
"23675","assets than the portfolio would otherwise have. The use of leverage is"
"23676","considered to be a speculative investment practice and may result in the loss"
"23677","of a substantial amount, and possibly all, of the portfolio's assets. The"
"23678","portfolio also may have to sell assets at inopportune times to satisfy its"
"23679","obligations or meet segregation requirements."
"23680","Liquidity - The portfolio may make investments that are illiquid or that"
"23681","become illiquid after purchase. Investments may become illiquid due to the"
"23682","lack of an active market, a reduced number of traditional market participants,"
"23683","or reduced capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in"
"23684","securities. The liquidity and value of investments can deteriorate rapidly and"
"23685","those investments may be difficult or impossible for the portfolio to sell,"
"23686","particularly during times of market turmoil. Illiquid investments can be"
"23687","difficult to value. Markets may become illiquid when, for instance, there are"
"23688","few, if any, interested buyers or sellers or when dealers are unwilling to make"
"23689","a market for certain securities. As a general matter, dealers recently have"
"23690","been less willing to make markets for fixed income securities. If the portfolio"
"23691","is forced to sell an illiquid investment to meet redemption requests or other"
"23692","cash needs, the portfolio may be forced to sell at a loss. The portfolio may"
"23693","not receive its proceeds from the sale of securities for an extended period"
"23694","(for"
"23695","example, several weeks or even longer)."
"23696","Preferred Stock - Preferred stock's right to dividends and liquidation"
"23697","proceeds is junior to the rights of a company's debt securities. The value of"
"23698","preferred stock may be subject to factors that affect fixed income and equity"
"23699","securities, including changes in interest rates and in a company's"
"23700","creditworthiness. The value of preferred stock tends to vary more  with"
"23701","fluctuations in the underlying common stock and less with fluctuations in"
"23702","interest rates and tends to exhibit greater volatility. Shareholders of"
"23703","preferred"
"23704","stock may suffer a loss of value if dividends are not paid and have limited"
"23705","voting rights."
"23706","Warrants and Rights - Warrants and rights may be considered more"
"23707","speculative than certain other types of investments because they do not"
"23708","entitle a holder to the dividends or voting rights for the securities that may"
"23709","be"
"23710","purchased. They do not represent any rights in the assets of the issuing"
"23711","company, and cease to have value if not exercised prior to the expiration"
"23712","date."
"23713","PERFORMANCE:"
"23714","The portfolio's new primary benchmark will be the S&P Developed Property Net"
"23715","Total Return Index."
"23716","The Average Annual Total Returns table included in the Performance"
"23717","section of the Prospectus and Summary Prospectus will be deleted in its"

"24932","controls and related procedures, and that AUIM, TAM and TCI"
"24933","had received the consultant's written findings and implemented"

"24937","AUIM, TAM and TCI had already begun making revisions and"

"25081","Summary Prospectus will be deleted in its entirety and replaced with"
"25082","the"
"25083"," following:"
"25084","Under normal circumstances, the portfolio's sub-adviser, BlackRock"
"25085"," Investment"
"25086","Management, LLC (the sub-adviser), seeks to achieve the portfolio's"
"25087","objective"
"25088","by allocating substantially all of the portfolio's assets to a mix of"
"25089","exchange traded"
"25090","funds (ETFs) advised by an affiliate of the sub-adviser. The portfolio will"
"25091","normally emphasize investments in ETFs that pursue smart beta strategies"
"25092","that"
"25093","are designed to provide consistent exposure to systematic factors such as"
"25094","value,"
"25095","momentum, quality  and size. Smart beta strategies focus on one or more of"
"25096","these"
"25097","systematic factors and seek to capture broad, consistent drivers of return"
"25098","which"
"25099","cannot be isolated through traditional index strategies alone."
"25100","The portfolio normally targets an allocation of approximately 40% of its net"
"25101","assets to equity ETFs. Generally, the portfolio's strategic asset allocation"
"25102","over the"
"25103","long term is expected to be as follows: approximately 30% of the portfolio's"
"25104"," net"
"25105","assets in U.S. equity ETFs, approximately 10% of the portfolio's net"
"25106","assets in"
"25107","international equity ETFs, and approximately 60% of the portfolio's"
"25108"," net assets"
"25109","in"
"25110","fixed income ETFs. Typically, the portfolio is rebalanced to these"
"25111","strategic"
"25112","targets on a quarterly basis."
"25113","PRINCIPAL RISKS:"
"25114","The portfolio will no longer be subject to the following principal risks:"
"25115","Active"
"25116","Trading; Counterparty; Currency Hedging; Derivatives; Dollar Rolls; Early"
"25117","Close/Late Close/Trading Halt; Growth Stocks; High Yield Debt Securities;"
"25118","Leveraging; Model and Data; Tactical Asset Allocation; To Be Announced (TBA)"
"25119","Transactions; and Value Investing. These risks will be removed from the"
"25120","Principal
Risks section of the Prospectus and Summary Prospectus. In addition, the"
"25121"," following"
"25122","principal risks will be added to the Principal Risks section of the"
"25123","Prospectus and"
"25124","Summary Prospectus as principal risks of investing in the portfolio:"
"25125","Asset Allocation - The sub-adviser allocates the portfolio's assets among"
"25126","various asset classes and underlying ETFs. These allocations may be"
"25127","unsuccessful in maximizing the portfolio's return and/or avoiding investment"
"25128","losses, and may cause the portfolio to underperform."
"25129","Asset Class Variation - The underlying portfolios invest principally in the"
"25130","securities constituting their asset class (i.e., equity or fixed income)."
"25131","However,"
"25132","an underlying portfolio may vary the percentage of its assets in these"
"25133","securities"
"25134","(subject to any applicable regulatory requirements). Depending upon the"
"25135","percentage of securities in a particular asset class held by the underlying"
"25136","portfolios at any given time, and the percentage of the portfolio's assets"
"25137"," invested"
"25138","in various underlying portfolios,  the portfolio's actual exposure to the"
"25139","securities"
"25140","in a particular asset class may vary substantially from its target allocation"
"25141","for"
"25142","that asset class."
"25143","Smart Beta Investing- Smart beta strategies seek to capture broad, consistent"
"25144","drivers of return and to out-perform traditional index strategies."
"25145","These strategies"
"25146","may not work as intended. An underlying ETF pursuing a smart beta strategy"
"25147","may not achieve its objective and may not perform as well as other funds"
"25148"," using"
"25149","other asset management strategies."
"25150","PERFORMANCE:"

"36261","or as required by law, there is no limit on the amount of a"

"36263","may be invested in a particular type of security or investment."
"36264","Transamerica 60/40 Allocation VP: The portfolio invests its"
"36265","assets in a"
"36266","combination of Transamerica funds (underlying portfolios)."
"36267","Transamerica Asset"
"36268","Management, Inc. (the Investment Manager) selects the"
"36269","combination and"
"36270","amount of underlying portfolios to invest in based on the"
"36271","portfolio's investment"
"36272","objective."
"36273","Under normal circumstances, the portfolio expects to"
"36274","allocate its assets among"
"36275","underlying portfolios with the goal of achieving exposure"
"36276","targets over time of"
"36277","approximately 60% of its net assets in equities and approximately"
"36278","40% of its net"
"36279","assets in fixed income. The portfolio's equity allocation"
"36280","is initially expected to"
"36281","consist of investments in Transamerica International Equity"
"36282","Index VP and"
"36283","Transamerica U.S. Equity Index VP and the portfolio's fixed"
"36284","income allocation is"
"36285","initially expected to consist of investments in Transamerica"
"36286","Core Bond. (See the"
"36287","List and Description of Underlying Portfolios section of"
"36288","the prospectus for"
"36289","more information about the underlying portfolios). These"
"36290","allocations reflect the"
"36291","Investment Manager's present strategy for asset allocation"
"36292","during normal market"
"36293","conditions, and may be changed at any time without notice to"
"36294","shareholders and"
"36295","without shareholder approval. In the short-term, actual asset"
"36296","allocations may vary"
"36297","due to short-term changes in cash flows caused by purchases"
"36298","and redemptions in"
"36299","the portfolio. In attempting to respond to adverse market or"
"36300","other conditions or to"
"36301","process a large purchase or redemption within the portfolio,"
"36302","the Investment"
"36303","Manager may allocate the assets of the portfolio without limit"
"36304","to a Transamerica"
"36305","government money market fund that normally invests principally"
"36306","in U.S."
"36307","government securities and/or repurchase agreements fully"
"36308","collateralized by U.S."
"36309","government securities."
"36310","Each underlying portfolio has its own investment objective,"
"36311","principal investment"
"36312","strategies and investment risks. The underlying portfolios"
"36313","may invest in"
"36314","derivatives such as futures, contracts, options and swaps."
"36315","The sub-adviser for"
"36316","each underlying portfolio decides which securities to purchase"
"36317"," and sell for that"
"36318","underlying portfolio. The portfolio's ability to achieve its"
"36319"," investment objective"
"36320","depends largely on the performance of the underlying portfolios"
"36321"," in which it"
"36322","invests."
"36323","The portfolio may be a significant shareholder in certain"
"36324","underlying portfolios."
"36325","The portfolio may invest its assets in cash, cash equivalent"
"36326","securities or short-"
"36327","term debt securities, repurchase agreements and money market"
"36328","instruments."
"36329","Under adverse or unstable market, economic or political"
"36330","conditions, the portfolio"
"36331","may take temporary defensive positions in cash and short-term"
"36332","debt securities"
"36333","without limit. Although the portfolio would do this only in"
"36334","seeking to avoid"
"36335","losses, the portfolio may be unable to pursue its investment"
"36336","objective during that"
"36337","time, and it could reduce the benefit from any upswing in the"
"36338","market. To the"
"36339","extent that the portfolio has any uninvested cash, the"
"36340","portfolio would also be"
"36341","subject to risk with respect to the depository institution"
"36342","holding the cash."
"36343","Transamerica International Equity Index VP: Under normal"
"36344","circumstances,"
"36345","the portfolio invests at least 80% of its net assets, plus"
"36346","the amount of any"
"36347","borrowings for investment purposes, in securities listed in"
"36348","the MSCI(r) Europe,"
"36349","Australasia, Far East (MSCI EAFE) Index (the Index). Under"
"36350","normal circumstances, however, the portfolio intends to invest"
"36351","substantially all of its assets in securities of companies"
"36352","included in the Index (including ADRs and"
"36353","Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs)) or in other investments"
"36354","in an effort to"
"36355","create a portfolio of securities with generally the same"
"36356","risk and return"
"36357","characteristics of the Index, including index futures contracts."
"36358","The Index is"
"36359","designed to represent the performance of approximately 1,000"
"36360","large and mid-cap"

"36509","The value of your investment in a portfolio changes with the values of that"

"36516","MORE ON PRINCIPAL RISKS:"
"36517","The following provides additional information regarding the principal"
"36518"," risks of"
"36519","investing in each portfolio."
"36520","Asset Allocation: The Investment Manager or a sub-adviser may allocate a"
"36521","portfolio's assets among various asset classes and underlying portfolios."
"36522"," These"
"36523","allocations may be unsuccessful in maximizing a portfolio's return and/or"
"36524","avoiding investment losses, and may cause a portfolio to underperform."
"36525","Asset Class Variation: Certain portfolios may invest in underlying portfolios."
"36526","The underlying portfolios invest principally in the securities constituting"
"36527"," their"
"36528","asset class (i.e., equity or fixed income). However, an underlying portfolio"
"36529"," may"
"36530","vary the percentage of its assets in these securities (subject to any"
"36531","applicable"
"36532","regulatory requirements). Depending upon the percentage of securities in a"
"36533","particular asset class held by the underlying portfolios at any given time,"
"36534"," and the"
"36535","percentage of the portfolio's assets invested in various underlying"
"36536","portfolios,the"
"36537","portfolio's actual exposure to the securities in a particular asset class"
"36538"," may vary"
"36539","substantially from its target allocation for that asset class."
"36540","Counterparty: A portfolio will be subject to credit risk (meaning the"
"36541","risk of"
"36542","adverse changes in an issuer's real or perceived financial strength) with"
"36543"," respect to"
"36544","counterparties to derivatives, repurchase agreements and other financial"
"36545","contracts"
"36546","entered into by the portfolio or held by special purpose or structured"
"36547","vehicles."
"36548","Adverse changes to counterparties may cause the value of financial"
"36549","contracts to"
"36550","go down. If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform"
"36551","its"
"36552","obligations, the value of your investment in the portfolio may decline."
"36553","Credit: The value of your investment in a portfolio could decline if the"
"36554","issuer of a"
"36555","security held by the portfolio or another obligor for that security (such"
"36556","as a party"
"36557","providing insurance or other credit enhancement) fails to pay, otherwise"
"36558","defaults,"
"36559","is perceived to be less creditworthy, becomes insolvent or files for"
"36560","bankruptcy."
"36561","The value of your investment in a portfolio could also decline if the"
"36562","credit rating"
"36563","of a security held by the portfolio is downgraded or the credit quality or"
"36564"," value of"
"36565","any assets underlying the security declines. A decline may be significant,"
"36566","particularly in certain market environments. If a single entity provides"
"36567","credit"
"36568","enhancement to more than one portfolio's investments, the adverse effects"
"36569","resulting from the downgrade or default will increase the adverse effects"
"36570","on a"
"36571","portfolio. If a portfolio enters into financial contracts (such as certain"
"36572","derivatives,"
"36573","repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and when-issued,"
"36574","delayed"
"36575","delivery and forward commitment transactions), the portfolio will be subject"
"36576"," to"
"36577","the credit risk presented by the counterparty. In addition, a portfolio may"
"36578"," incur"
"36579","expenses in an effort to protect the portfolio's interests or to enforce"
"36580","its rights."
"36581","Credit risk is broadly gauged by the credit ratings of the securities"
"36582"," in which a"
"36583","portfolio invests. However, ratings are only the"
"36584","opinions of the companies issuing them and are not guarantees as to quality."
"36585","Securities rated in the lowest category of investment grade (Baa/BBB or Baa-"
"36586","/BBB-) may possess certain speculative characteristics."
"36587","A portfolio is subject to greater levels of credit risk to the extent"
"36588"," it invests in"
"36589","below investment grade debt securities (that is, securities rated"
"36590"," below the"
"36591","Baa/BBB categories or unrated securities of comparable quality), or"
"36592"," junk"
"36593","bonds. These securities have a higher risk of issuer default because,"
"36594"," among other"
"36595","reasons, issuers of junk bonds often have more debt in relation to total"
"36596","capitalization than issuers of investment grade securities. Junk bonds are"
"36597","considered speculative, tend to be less liquid and are more difficult"
"36598","to value than"
"36599","higher rated securities and may involve significant risk of exposure to"
"36600","adverse"
"36601","conditions and negative sentiments. These securities may be in danger of"
"36602"," default"
"36603","as to principal and interest. Unrated securities of comparable quality"
"36604","share these"
"36605","risks."
"36606","A portfolio may invest in securities which are subordinated to more senior"
"36607","securities of the issuer, or which represent interests in pools of such"
"36608","subordinated"
"36609","securities. A portfolio is more likely to suffer a credit loss on subordinated"
"36610","securities than on non-subordinated securities of the same issuer. If"
"36611","there is a"
"36612","default, bankruptcy or liquidation of the issuer, most subordinated"
"36613","securities are"
"36614","paid only if sufficient assets remain after payment of the issuer's non-"
"36615","subordinated securities. In addition, any recovery of interest or principal"
"36616"," may take"
"36617","more time. As a result, even a perceived decline in creditworthiness of"
"36618"," the issuer"
"36619","is likely to have a greater impact on subordinated securities."
"36620","Currency: The value of investments in securities denominated in foreign"
"36621","currencies increases or decreases as the rates of exchange between those"
"36622","currencies and the U.S. dollar change. Currency conversion costs and"
"36623","currency"
"36624","fluctuations could reduce or eliminate investment gains or add to investment"
"36625","losses. Currency exchange rates can be volatile, and are affected by"
"36626","factors such"
"36627","as general economic conditions, the actions of the U.S. and foreign"
"36628","governments"
"36629","or central banks, the imposition of currency controls, and speculation."
"36630","Depositary Receipts: Depositary receipts may be less liquid than the"
"36631","underlying"
"36632","shares in their primary trading market. Any distributions paid to the"
"36633","holders of"
"36634","depositary receipts are usually subject to a fee charged by the depositary."
"36635"," Holders"
"36636","of depositary receipts may have limited voting rights, and investment"
"36637","restrictions"
"36638","in certain countries may adversely impact the value of depositary receipts"
"36639","because such restrictions may limit the ability to convert equity shares"
"36640","into"
"36641","depositary receipts and vice versa. Such restrictions may cause equity shares"
"36642"," of"
"36643","the underlying issuer to trade at a discount or premium to the market"
"36644","price of the"
"36645","depositary receipts."
"36646","Derivatives: Derivatives involve special risks and costs and may result"
"36647"," in losses"
"36648","to a portfolio, even when used for hedging purposes. Using derivatives"
"36649","can"
"36650","increase losses and reduce opportunities for gains when market prices,"
"36651","interest"
"36652","rates or currencies, or the derivatives themselves, behave in a way not"
"36653","anticipated"
"36654","by a portfolio, especially in abnormal market conditions. Using derivatives"
"36655"," may"
"36656","have a leveraging effect, which may increase investment losses and may"
"36657","increase"
"36658","portfolio volatility, which is the degree to which the portfolio's share"
"36659","price may"
"36660","fluctuate within a short time period. Even a small investment in derivatives"
"36661"," can"
"36662","have a disproportionate impact on a portfolio. Certain derivatives have the"
"36663","potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of the initial"
"36664","investment. This"
"36665","risk is greater for forward currency contracts, swaps and other"
"36666","over-the-counter"
"36667","traded derivatives. The other parties to derivatives transactions"
"36668","present the same"
"36669","types of credit risk as issuers of fixed-income securities. Derivatives"
"36670","also tend to"
"36671","involve greater liquidity risk and they may be difficult to value."
"36672","A portfolio may"
"36673","be unable to terminate or sell its derivative positions. In fact, many"
"36674","over-the-counter derivatives will not have liquidity except through"
"36675"," the"
"36676","counterparty to the instrument. Derivatives are generally subject to"
"36677"," the risks"
"36678","applicable to the assets, rates, indices or other indicators underlying"
"36679","the"
"36680","derivative. The value of a derivative may fluctuate more than, or"
"36681","otherwise not"
"36682","correlate well with, the underlying assets, rates, indices or other"
"36683","indicators to"
"36684","which it relates. A portfolio's use of derivatives may also increase"
"36685","the amount of"
"36686","taxes payable by shareholders. The U.S. government and foreign"
"36687","governments are in the process of adopting and implementing regulations"
"36688","governing derivatives markets, including mandatory clearing and on-facility"
"36689","execution of certain derivatives, margin and reporting requirements."
"36690","The ultimate"
"36691","impact of the regulations remains unclear. Additional regulation of"
"36692","derivatives"
"36693","may make derivatives more costly, limit their availability or utility,"
"36694","otherwise"
"36695","adversely affect their performance, or disrupt markets. For derivatives"
"36696"," that are"
"36697","required to be cleared by a regulated clearinghouse, a"
"36698","portfolio may be exposed to risks arising from its relationship with a"
"36699"," brokerage"
"36700","firm through which it would submit derivatives trades for clearing. A"
"36701","portfolio"
"36702","would also be exposed to counterparty risk with respect to the clearinghouse."
"36703"," In"
"36704","addition, the SEC has proposed a new rule that would change the"
"36705","regulation of"
"36706","the use of derivatives by registered investment companies, such as"
"36707"," the portfolio."
"36708","If the proposed rule, or a different rule, takes effect, it could"
"36709","limit the ability of"
"36710","the portfolio to invest in derivatives."
"36711","Derivatives may be used by a portfolio for a variety of purposes,"
"36712","including:"
"36713","..	As a hedging technique in an attempt to manage risk in the"
"36714","portfolio's"
"36715","portfolio"
"36716","..	As a means of changing investment characteristics of the"
"36717"," portfolio's portfolio"
"36718","..	As a means of attempting to enhance returns"
"36719","..	As a means of providing additional exposure to types of"
"36720","investments or"
"36721","market factors"
"36722","..	As a substitute for buying or selling securities"
"36723","..	As a cash flow management technique"
"36724","Using derivatives, especially for non-hedging purposes, may involve"
"36725"," greater risks"
"36726","to a portfolio than investing directly in securities, particularly"
"36727","as these"
"36728","instruments may be very complex and may not behave in the manner"
"36729","anticipated"
"36730","by the portfolio. Risks associated with the use of derivatives are"
"36731","magnified to the"
"36732","extent that a large portion of the portfolio's assets are committed"
"36733","to derivatives in"
"36734","general or are invested in just one or a few types of derivatives."
"36735","Use of"
"36736","derivatives or similar instruments may have different tax consequences"
"36737"," for a"
"36738","portfolio than an investment in the underlying security, and those"
"36739","differences"
"36740","may affect the amount, timing and character of income distributed to"
"36741","shareholders."
"36742","When a portfolio enters into derivative transactions, it may be"
"36743","required to"
"36744","segregate assets, or enter into offsetting positions, in accordance"
"36745","with applicable"
"36746","regulations. Such segregation will not limit the portfolio's exposure"
"36747"," to loss,"
"36748","however, and the portfolio will have investment risk with respect to"
"36749"," both the"
"36750","derivative itself and the assets that have been segregated to cover"
"36751","the portfolio's"
"36752","derivative exposure. If the segregated assets represent a large"
"36753","portion of the"
"36754","portfolio's portfolio, this may impede portfolio management or the"
"36755","portfolio's"
"36756","ability to meet redemption requests or other current obligations."
"36757","Some derivatives may be difficult to value, or may be subject to the"
"36758"," risk that"
"36759","changes in the value of the instrument may not correlate well with"
"36760","the underlying"
"36761","asset, rate or index. In addition, derivatives may be subject to market"
"36762"," risk, interest"
"36763","rate risk and credit risk. A portfolio could lose the entire amount"
"36764","of its investment"
"36765","in a derivative and, in some cases, could lose more than the principal"
"36766"," amount"
"36767","invested. Also, suitable derivative instruments may not be available"
"36768"," in all"
"36769","circumstances or at reasonable prices. A portfolio's"
"36770","sub-adviser may not make use of derivatives for a variety of reasons."
"36771","Risks associated with the use of derivatives are magnified to the"
"36772","extent that an"
"36773","increased portion of a portfolio's assets are committed to derivatives"
"36774"," in general or"
"36775","are invested in just one or a few types of derivatives."
"36776","Derivatives may include, but are not limited to, the following:"
"36777","..	Options. An option is an agreement that, for a premium"
"36778"," payment or fee,"
"36779","gives the option holder (the buyer) the right but not the obligation"
"36780"," to buy (a"
"36781","call option) or sell (a put option) the underlying asset (or"
"36782","settle for cash"
"36783","an amount based on an underlying asset, rate or index) at a specified"
"36784"," price"
"36785","(the exercise price) during a period of time or on a specified date."
"36786","Investments in options are considered speculative. The portfolio may"
"36787"," lose the"
"36788","premium paid for them if the price of the underlying security or other"
"36789"," asset"
"36790","decreased or remained the same (in the case of a call option) or"
"36791","increased or"
"36792","remained the same (in the case of a put option). If a put or call"
"36793","option"
"36794","purchased by the portfolio were permitted to expire without being"
"36795"," sold or"
"36796","exercised, its premium would represent a loss to the portfolio."
"36797","Investments in foreign currency options may substantially change a"
"36798","portfolio's exposure to currency exchange rates and could result in"
"36799","losses to the portfolio if currencies do not perform as a sub-adviser"
"36800","expects. There is a risk that such transactions could reduce or preclude"
"36801","the opportunity for gain if the value of the currency moves in the"
"36802","direction opposite to the position taken. Options on foreign currencies"
"36803","are affected by all of those factors which influence foreign exchange"
"36804","rates and foreign investment generally. Unanticipated changes in"
"36805","currency prices may result in losses to a portfolio and poorer overall"

"36807","contracts. Options on foreign currencies are traded primarily in the OTC"
"36808","market, but may also be traded on U.S. and foreign exchanges."
"36809","Foreign currency options contracts may be used for hedging purposes or"
"36810","non-hedging purposes in pursuing a portfolio's investment objective,"
"36811","such as when a sub-adviser anticipates that particular non-U.S."

"36822","..	Forwards and Futures Contracts. The use of futures contracts is a"
"36823","highly"
"36824","specialized activity which involves investment techniques and risks different"
"36825","from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. A"
"36826","futures contract is a sales contract between a buyer (holding the long"
"36827","position) and a seller (holding the short position) for an asset with"
"36828"," delivery"
"36829","deferred until a future date. The buyer agrees to pay a fixed price at the"
"36830","agreed future date and the seller agrees to deliver the asset. The"
"36831","seller hopes"
"36832","that the market price on the delivery date is less than the agreed upon"
"36833","price,"
"36834","while the buyer hopes for the contrary. The liquidity of the futures markets"
"36835","depends on participants entering into off-setting transactions rather than"
"36836","making or taking delivery. To the extent participants decide to make or take"
"36837","delivery, liquidity in the futures market could be reduced. In addition,"
"36838","futures"
"36839","exchanges often impose a maximum permissible price movement on each"
"36840","futures contract for each trading session. The portfolio may be disadvantaged"
"36841","if it is prohibited from executing a trade outside the daily"
"36842","permissible price"
"36843","movement. Moreover, to the extent the portfolio engages in futures contracts"
"36844","on foreign exchanges, such exchanges may not provide the same protection"
"36845","as US exchanges. The loss that may be incurred in entering into futures"
"36846","contracts may exceed the amount of the premium paid and may be potentially"
"36847","unlimited. Futures markets are highly volatile and the use of futures may"
"36848","increase the volatility of the portfolio's NAV. Additionally, as a"
"36849","result of the"
"36850","low collateral deposits normally involved in futures trading, a relatively"
"36851","small"
"36852","price movement in a futures contract may result in substantial losses to the"
"36853","portfolio. Investment in these instruments involve risks, including"
"36854","counterparty risk (i.e., the counterparty to the instrument will not"
"36855","perform or"
"36856","be able to perform in accordance with the terms of the instrument), hedging"
"36857","risk (i.e., a hedging strategy may not eliminate the risk that it is"
"36858","intended to"
"36859","offset, and may offset gains, which may lead to losses within the portfolio)"
"36860","and pricing risk (i.e., the instrument may be difficult to value)."
"36861","..	Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts: In connection"
"36862","with its"
"36863","investments in foreign securities, a portfolio also may enter into"
"36864","contracts"
"36865","with banks, brokers or dealers to purchase or sell securities or foreign"
"36866","currencies at a future date. A foreign currency forward exchange"
"36867","contract is a"
"36868","negotiated agreement between the contracting parties to exchange a"
"36869","specified"
"36870","amount of currency at a specified future time at a specified rate."
"36871","The rate can"
"36872","be higher or lower than the spot rate between the currencies that are the"
"36873","subject of the contract. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts may be"
"36874","used to protect against uncertainty in the level of future foreign currency"
"36875","exchange rates or to gain or modify exposure to a particular currency. In"
"36876","addition, a portfolio may use cross currency hedging or proxy hedging with"
"36877","respect to currencies in which the portfolio has or expects to have"
"36878","portfolio or"
"36879","currency exposure. Cross currency hedges involve the sale of one currency"
"36880","against the positive exposure to a different currency and may be used for"
"36881","hedging purposes or to establish an active exposure to the exchange rate"
"36882","between any two currencies. Investments in foreign currency forward"
"36883","exchange contracts may substantially change a portfolio's exposure to"
"36884","currency exchange rates and could result in losses to the portfolio if"
"36885","currencies do not perform as its sub-adviser expects. A sub-adviser's"
"36886"," success"
"36887","in these transactions will depend principally on its ability to predict"
"36888","accurately the future exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S."
"36889","dollar. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts may be used for non-"
"36890","hedging purposes in seeking to meet the applicable portfolio's investment"
"36891","objectives, such as when the sub-adviser anticipates that particular"
"36892"," non-U.S."
"36893","currencies will appreciate or depreciate in value, even though securities"
"36894","denominated in those currencies are not then held in the portfolio's"
"36895","investment portfolio. Investing in foreign currency forward exchange"
"36896","contracts for purposes of gaining from projected changes in"
"36897","exchange rates, as opposed to hedging currency risks applicable to a"
"36898","portfolio's holdings, further increases the portfolio's exposure to foreign"
"36899","securities losses. There is no assurance that a sub-adviser's use of currency"
"36900","derivatives will benefit a portfolio or that they will be, or can be, used at"
"36901","appropriate times."
"36902","..	Swaps. Swap contracts, including credit default swaps, involve"
"36903","heightened"
"36904","risks and may result in losses to the portfolio. Swaps may in some cases be"
"36905","illiquid and difficult to value, and they increase credit risk since the"
"36906","portfolio"
"36907","has exposure to both the issuer of the referenced obligation and the"
"36908","counterparty to the swap. If the portfolio buys a credit default swap,"
"36909","it will be"
"36910","subject to the risk that the credit default swap may expire worthless, as the"
"36911","credit default swap would only generate income in the event of a default on"
"36912","the underlying debt security or other specified event. As a buyer, the"
"36913","portfolio would also be subject to credit risk relating to the"
"36914","seller's payment"
"36915","of its obligations in the event of a default (or similar event). If"
"36916","the portfolio"
"36917","sells a credit default swap, it will be exposed to the credit risk"
"36918","of the issuer of"
"36919","the obligation to which the credit default swap relates. As a seller, the"
"36920","portfolio would also be subject to leverage risk, because it would be liable"
"36921","for the full notional amount of the swap in the event of default (or similar"
"36922","event). Swaps may be difficult to unwind or terminate. Credit default swaps"
"36923","may in some cases be illiquid, and they increase credit risk since the"
"36924","portfolio"
"36925","has exposure to the issuer of the referenced obligation and either their"
"36926","counterparty to the credit default swap or, if it is a cleared transaction,"
"36927"," the"
"36928","brokerage firm through which the trade was cleared and the clearing"
"36929","organization that is the counterparty to that trade. Certain index-based"
"36930"," credit"
"36931","default swaps are structured in tranches, whereby junior tranches assume"
"36932","greater default risk than senior tranches. The absence of a central exchange"
"36933","or market for swap transactions may lead, in some instances, to difficulties"
"36934","in"
"36935","trading and valuation, especially in the event of market disruptions. New"
"36936","regulations require many kinds of swaps to be executed through a centralized"
"36937","exchange or regulated facility and be cleared through a regulated"
"36938","clearinghouse. Although this clearing mechanism is generally expected to"
"36939","reduce counterparty credit risk, it may disrupt or limit the swap market and"
"36940","may not result in swaps being easier to trade or value. As swaps become"
"36941","more standardized, the portfolio may not be able to enter into swaps that"
"36942","meet its investment needs. The portfolio also may not be able to find a"
"36943","clearinghouse willing to accept the swaps for clearing. In a cleared swap, a"
"36944","central clearing organization will be the counterparty to the transaction."
"36945","The"
"36946","portfolio will assume the risk that the clearinghouse may be unable to"
"36947","perform its obligations. The new regulations may make using swaps more"
"36948","costly, may limit their availability, or may otherwise adversely affect their"
"36949","value or performance."
"36950","Emerging Markets: Investments in the securities of issuers located in or"
"36951","principally doing business in emerging markets bear heightened foreign"
"36952","investments risks. Emerging market countries typically have economic and"
"36953","political systems that are less fully developed, and that can be expected"
"36954"," to be"
"36955","less"
"36956","stable. For example, the economies of such countries can be subject to"
"36957","rapid and"
"36958","unpredictable rates of inflation or deflation. Emerging market countries"
"36959","may have"
"36960","policies that restrict investment by foreigners or that prevent foreign"
"36961","investors"
"36962","from withdrawing their money at will. Emerging market securities are often"
"36963","particularly sensitive to market movements because their market prices tend to"
"36964","reflect speculative expectations. Some emerging market countries are"
"36965","especially"
"36966","vulnerable to economic conditions in other countries. Low trading volumes may"
"36967","result in a lack of liquidity and in extreme price volatility. A portfolio"
"36968","investing in"
"36969","emerging market countries may be required to establish special custody or"
"36970","other"
"36971","arrangements before investing. An investment in emerging market securities"
"36972","should be considered speculative."
"36973","Equity Securities: Equity securities represent an ownership interest"
"36974","in an issuer,"
"36975","rank junior in a company's capital structure and, consequently, may"
"36976","entail greater"
"36977","risk of loss than debt securities. Equity securities include common and"
"36978"," preferred"
"36979","stocks. Stock markets are volatile. Equity securities may have greater price"
"36980","volatility than other asset classes, such as fixed income securities,"
"36981","and fluctuate in"
"36982","price based on changes in a company's financial condition and overall"
"36983","market and"
"36984","economic conditions. Because a company's equity securities rank junior in"
"36985","priority to the interests of bond holders and other creditors, a company's"
"36986","equity"
"36987","securities will usually react more strongly than its bonds and other debt to"
"36988","actual"
"36989","or perceived changes in the company's financial condition or prospects. If the"
"36990","market prices of the equity securities owned by a portfolio fall, the value of"
"36991","your"
"36992","investment in the portfolio will decline. If a portfolio holds equity"
"36993"," securities"
"36994","in a"
"36995","company that becomes insolvent, the portfolio's interests in the company will"
"36996","rank junior in priority to the interests of debtholders and general"
"36997","creditors of"
"36998"," the"
"36999","company."
"37000","Extension: When interest rates rise, repayments of fixed income securities,"
"37001","particularly asset- and mortgage-backed securities, may occur more slowly than"
"37002","anticipated, extending the effective duration of these fixed income"
"37003","securities at"
"37004","below market interest rates and causing their market prices to decline more"
"37005","than"
"37006","they would have declined due to the rise in interest rates alone. This may"
"37007"," cause a"
"37008","portfolio's share price to be more volatile or go down."
"37009","Fixed-Income Securities: The value of fixed-income securities may go up or"
"37010","down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably, due to general market conditions,"
"37011","such as real or perceived adverse economic or political conditions,"
"37012"," inflation,"
"37013","changes in interest rates, lack of liquidity in the bond markets or adverse"
"37014","investor"
"37015","sentiment. In addition, the value of a fixed income security may decline if"
"37016"," the"
"37017","issuer or other obligor of the security fails to pay principal and/or"
"37018"," interest,"
"37019","otherwise defaults or has its credit rating downgraded or is perceived"
"37020","to be less"
"37021","creditworthy, or the credit quality or value of any underlying assets declines."
"37022"," If"
"37023","the value of fixed-income securities owned by a portfolio fall, the value of"
"37024","your"
"37025","investment will go down. The value of your investment will generally go down"
"37026","when interest rates rise. Interest rates have been historically low. A general"
"37027","rise in"
"37028","interest rates may cause investors to move out of fixed-income securities on a"
"37029","large scale, which could adversely affect the price and liquidity of"
"37030","fixed-income"
"37031","securities. A rise in rates tends to have a greater impact on the prices of"
"37032","longer"
"37033","term or duration securities."
"37034","If interest rates rise, repayments of fixed-income securities may occur more"
"37035","slowly than anticipated by the market. This may drive the prices of these"
"37036","securities"
"37037","down because their interest rates are lower than the current interest"
"37038","rate and they"
"37039","remain outstanding longer. This is sometimes referred to as extension risk."
"37040","Many issuers have a right to prepay their securities. If interest rates fall,"
"37041"," an issuer"
"37042","may exercise this right. If this happens, a"
"37043","portfolio will be forced to reinvest prepayment proceeds at a time"
"37044","when yields on"
"37045","securities available in the market are lower than the yield on the"
"37046","prepaid security."
"37047","This is sometimes referred to as prepayment or call risk."
"37048","Focused Investing: To the extent a portfolio invests in a limited number of"
"37049","countries, regions, sectors, industries or market segments, or in a limited"
"37050","number"
"37051","of issuers, the portfolio will be more susceptible to negative events"
"37052","affecting"
"37053","those countries, regions, sectors, industries, segments or issuers, and the"
"37054","value of"
"37055","its shares may be more volatile than if it invested more widely. Local events,"
"37056","such"
"37057","as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters may"
"37058","disrupt a"
"37059","country's or region's securities markets. Geographic risk is especially"
"37060","high in"
"37061","emerging markets."
"37062","Foreign Investments: Investments in securities of foreign issuers (including"
"37063","those denominated in U.S. dollars) or issuers with significant exposure"
"37064","to foreign"
"37065","markets are subject to additional risks. Foreign countries in which a"
"37066","portfolio may"
"37067","invest may have markets that are less liquid, less regulated and more"
"37068","volatile than"
"37069","U.S. markets. The value of a portfolio's investments may decline because of"
"37070","factors affecting the particular issuers as well as foreign markets and"
"37071","issuers"
"37072","generally, such as unfavorable or unsuccessful government actions,"
"37073"," reduction of"
"37074","government or central bank support, political or financial instability or"
"37075","other"
"37076","adverse economic or political developments. Values may also be affected by"
"37077","restrictions on receiving the investment proceeds from a foreign country."
"37078","Less information may be publicly available about foreign companies than about"
"37079","U.S. companies. Foreign companies are generally not subject to the same"
"37080","accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards as are U.S."
"37081","companies."
"37082","Some securities issued by non-U.S. governments or their subdivisions,"
"37083","agencies"
"37084","and instrumentalities may not be backed by the full faith and credit of"
"37085","such"
"37086","governments. Even where a security is backed by the full faith and credit"
"37087","of a"
"37088","government, it may be difficult for the portfolio to pursue its rights"
"37089","against the"
"37090","government. Some non-U.S. governments have defaulted on principal and"
"37091","interest payments. In certain foreign markets, settlement and clearance"
"37092","procedures may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not"
"37093","typically associated with settlement and clearance of U.S. investments. In"
"37094","addition, a portfolio's investments in foreign securities may be subject"
"37095"," to the risk"
"37096","of nationalization or expropriation of assets, imposition of currency"
"37097"," exchange"
"37098","controls or restrictions on the repatriation of foreign currency,"

"37106","tax considerations may apply."
"37107","Certain foreign markets may rely heavily on particular industries or foreign"
"37108","capital and are more vulnerable to diplomatic developments, the imposition of"
"37109","economic sanctions against a particular country or countries, organizations,"
"37110","entities and/or individuals, changes in international trading patterns, trade"
"37111","barriers, and other protectionist or retaliatory measures. Economic sanctions"
"37112","could, among other things, effectively restrict or eliminate a portfolio's"
"37113","ability to"
"37114","purchase or sell securities or groups of securities for a substantial period"
"37115"," of time,"
"37116","and may make the portfolio's investments in such securities harder to value."
"37117","International trade barriers or economic sanctions against foreign countries,"
"37118","organizations, entities and/or individuals, may adversely affect a portfolio's"
"37119","foreign holdings or exposures. Investments in foreign markets may also be"
"37120","adversely affected by governmental actions such as the imposition of capital"
"37121","controls, nationalization of companies or industries, expropriation of assets,"
"37122"," or"
"37123","the imposition of punitive taxes. Governmental actions can have a significant"
"37124","effect on the economic conditions in foreign countries, which also may"
"37125","adversely"
"37126","affect the value and liquidity of a portfolio's investments. For example, the"
"37127","governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial"
"37128"," restrictions"
"37129","on foreign investing in their capital markets or in certain sectors or"
"37130","industries. In"
"37131","addition, a foreign government may limit or cause delay in the"

"37133","repatriation of its currency which would adversely affect the U.S."
"37134","dollar value"
"37135","and/or liquidity of investments denominated in that currency. Any of"

"37237","maturity or"
"37238","duration of a"
"37239","fixed-income security, the greater the impact of a rise in interest"
"37240"," rates on the"
"37241","security's value. In addition, different interest rate measures"
"37242","(such as short- and"
"37243","long-term interest rates and U.S. and foreign interest rates),"
"37244","or interest rates on"
"37245","different types of securities or securities of different issuers,"
"37246"," may not necessarily"
"37247","change in the same amount or in the same direction. When interest"
"37248"," rates go down,"
"37249","the income received by a portfolio, and the portfolio's yield, may"
"37250","decline. A"
"37251","general rise in interest rates may cause investors to move out of"
"37252","fixed income"
"37253","securities on a large scale, which could adversely affect the price"
"37254","and liquidity of"
"37255","fixed income securities and could also result in increased redemptions"
"37256"," from the"
"37257","portfolio. The maturity of a security may be significantly longer"
"37258","than its duration."
"37259","A security's maturity and other features may be more relevant than"
"37260"," its duration in"
"37261","determining the security's sensitivity to other factors affecting"
"37262","the issuer or"
"37263","markets generally such as changes in credit quality or in the yield"
"37264","premium that"
"37265","the market may establish for certain types of securities."
"37266","Duration is a measure of the expected life of a fixed-income security"
"37267"," that is used"
"37268","to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest"
"37269"," rates."
"37270","Fixed-income securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to"
"37271","changes in interest rates, usually making them more volatile than"
"37272","securities with"
"37273","shorter durations. Similarly, a portfolio with a longer average portfolio"
"37274"," duration"
"37275","will generally be more sensitive to changes in interest rates"
"37276","than a portfolio with a"
"37277","shorter average portfolio duration. By way of example, the price of a bond"
"37278","portfolio with an average duration of five years would be expected to fall"
"37279","approximately 5% if interest rates rose by one percentage point."
"37280","Certain fixed-income securities pay interest at variable or floating"
"37281"," rates. Variable"
"37282","rate securities tend to reset at specified intervals, while floating rate"
"37283"," securities"
"37284","may reset whenever there is a change in a specified index rate. In most"
"37285"," cases,"
"37286","these reset provisions reduce the impact of changes in market interest"
"37287","rates on the"
"37288","value of the security. However, some securities do not track the"
"37289","underlying index"
"37290","directly, but reset based on formulas that may produce a leveraging effect;"
"37291"," others"
"37292","may also provide for interest payments that vary inversely with market rates."
"37293"," The"
"37294","market prices of these securities may fluctuate significantly when interest"
"37295"," rates"
"37296","change. A portfolio's yield may decline due to a decrease in market interest"
"37297","rates."
"37298","Inflation protected debt securities may react differently from other types of"
"37299"," debt"
"37300","securities and tend to react to changes in real interest rates. Real interest"
"37301"," rates"
"37302","represent nominal (stated) interest rates reduced by the expected impact of"
"37303","inflation. In general, the price of an inflation protected debt security can"
"37304","fall when"
"37305","real interest rates rise, and can rise when real interest rates fall. Interest"
"37306"," payments"
"37307","on inflation protected debt securities can be unpredictable and will"
"37308","vary as the"
"37309","principal and/or interest is adjusted for inflation."
"37310","Large Capitalization Companies: A portfolio's investments in large"
"37311","capitalization companies may underperform other segments of the market"
"37312","because they may be less responsive to competitive challenges and"
"37313","opportunities"
"37314","and unable to attain high growth rates during periods of economic expansion."
"37315"," As"
"37316","a result, the portfolio's value may not rise as much as, or may fall more than,"
"37317"," the"

"37319"," capitalizations."
"37320","Legal and Regulatory: Legal and regulatory changes could occur that may"
"37321","adversely affect a portfolio, its investments, and its ability to pursue"
"37322","its"
"37323","investment strategies and/or increase the costs of implementing such"
"37324","strategies."
"37325","New or revised laws or regulations may be imposed by the U.S. Securities"

"37335","or self-regulatory organizations."
"37336","Liquidity: A portfolio may make investments that are illiquid or that"
"37337","become"
"37338","illiquid after purchase. Investments may become illiquid due to the lack of"
"37339","an"
"37340","active market, a reduced number of traditional market participants, or"
"37341","reduced"
"37342","capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in securities."
"37343"," The"
"37344","liquidity and value of investments can deteriorate rapidly and those"
"37345","investments"
"37346","may be difficult or impossible for a portfolio to sell, particularly"
"37347","during times of"
"37348","market turmoil. Markets may become illiquid when, for instance, there"
"37349","are few, if"
"37350","any interested buyers or sellers or when dealers are unwilling to make"
"37351","a market"
"37352","for certain securities. As a general matter, dealers recently have been"
"37353","less willing"
"37354","to make markets for fixed income securities. Illiquid investments can be"
"37355","difficult"
"37356","to value. If a portfolio is forced to sell an illiquid investment to meet"
"37357"," redemption"
"37358","requests or other cash needs, the"
"37359","portfolio may be forced to sell at a loss. In addition, securities, once"
"37360","sold by a"
"37361","portfolio, may not settle for an extended period (for example, several"
"37362","weeks or"
"37363","even longer). The portfolio will not receive its sales proceeds until"
"37364","that time,"
"37365","which may constrain the portfolio's ability to meet its obligations"
"37366","(including"
"37367","obligations to redeeming shareholders). Further, when there is illiquidity"
"37368"," in the"
"37369","market for certain investments, a portfolio, due to limitations on"
"37370","illiquid"
"37371","investments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of exposure"
"37372","to a certain"

"37374","Management: Each portfolio is subject to the risk that the investment"
"37375","manager's"
"37376","or sub-adviser's judgments and decisions may be incorrect or otherwise"
"37377"," may not"
"37378","produce the desired results. The value of your investment in a portfolio"

"37396","manager or"
"37397","sub-adviser may not work as intended. In addition, a portfolio's investment"
"37398","strategies or policies may change from time to time. Those changes may"
"37399","not lead"
"37400","to the results intended by the investment manager or sub-adviser and"
"37401","could have"
"37402","an adverse effect on the value or performance of the portfolio. Any"
"37403","of these things"
"37404","could cause a portfolio to lose value or its results to lag relevant"

"37406","other funds with similar objectives."
"37407","Market: The value of a portfolio's securities may go up or down, sometimes"

"37414","the"
"37415","same impact on all types of securities. The value of securities also may"
"37416","go down"

"37424","In the past decade, financial markets throughout the world have experienced"
"37425","increased volatility, depressed valuations, decreased liquidity and"

"37432","The U.S. government and the Federal Reserve, as well as certain foreign"

"37436"," efforts are"
"37437","perceived by investors as being unlikely to achieve the desired results."
"37438","The"

"37440","withdrawal of Federal Reserve or other U.S. or non-U.S. governmental or"
"37441"," central"
"37442","bank support, including interest rate increases, could negatively affect"
"37443"," financial"
"37444","markets generally, increase market volatility and reduce the value and"

"37460","and financial difficulties, the value and liquidity of a portfolio's"
"37461","investments may"
"37462","be negatively affected."
"37463","Europe. A number of countries in Europe have experienced severe economic and"
"37464","financial difficulties. Many non-governmental issuers, and even certain"
"37465","governments, have defaulted on, or been forced to restructure, their debts;"
"37466","many other issuers have faced difficulties obtaining credit or refinancing"
"37467","existing obligations; financial institutions have in many cases required"
"37468","government or central bank support, have needed to raise capital, and/or have"
"37469","been impaired in their ability to extend credit; and financial markets in"
"37470","Europe and elsewhere have experienced extreme volatility and declines in"
"37471","asset values and liquidity. These difficulties may continue, worsen or spread"
"37472","within and without Europe. Responses to the financial problems by European"
"37473","governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and"
"37474","reforms, may not work, may result in social unrest and may limit future"
"37475","growth and economic recovery  or"
"37476","have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by"
"37477","governments and others of their debt could have additional adverse effects on"
"37478","economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In"
"37479","addition, on June 23, 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved"
"37480","withdrawal from the European Union. On March 29, 2017, the United"
"37481","Kingdom formally notified the European Council of its intention to leave the"
"37482","European Union; as a result, the United Kingdom will remain a member state,"
"37483","subject to European Union law with privileges to provide services under the"
"37484","single market directives, for at least two years from that date. Given the size"
"37485","and importance of the United Kingdom's economy, uncertainty about its"
"37486","legal, political, and economic relationship with the remaining member states"
"37487","of the European Union may continue to be a source of instability. Moreover,"
"37488","other countries may seek to withdraw from the European Union and/or"
"37489","abandon the euro, the common currency of the European Union. A number"
"37490","of countries in Europe have suffered terror attacks, and additional attacks may"
"37491","occur in the future. The Ukraine has experienced ongoing military conflict;"
"37492","this conflict may expand and military conflicts could potentially occur"
"37493","elsewhere in Europe. Europe has also been struggling with mass migration"
"37494","from the Middle East and Africa. The ultimate effects of these events and"
"37495","other socio-political or geopolitical issues are not known but could profoundly"
"37496","affect global economies and markets. Whether or not a fund invests in"
"37497","securities"
"37498","of issuers located in Europe or with significant exposure to European issuers"
"37499","or countries, these events could negatively affect the value and liquidity of"
"37500","the fund's investments."
"37501","New Portfolio: If a portfolio is newly-formed, investors in the portfolio bear"
"37502","the"
"37503","risk that the sub-adviser may not be successful in implementing its investment"
"37504","strategy, and may not employ a successful investment strategy, or that the"
"37505","portfolio may fail to attract sufficient assets under management to realize"
"37506","economies of scale, any of which could result in the portfolio being"
"37507","liquidated at"
"37508","any time without shareholder approval and at a time that may not be"
"37509","favorable for"
"37510","all shareholders. Such a liquidation could have negative tax consequences for"
"37511","shareholders and will cause shareholders to incur the expenses of liquidation."
"37512","Passive Investment (Transamerica 60/40 Allocation VP): Because the sub-"
"37513","adviser of an underlying portfolio seeking to track an index does not select"
"37514","individual companies in the index that the underlying portfolio tracks, the"
"37515","underlying portfolio may hold securities of companies that present risks"
"37516","that an"
"37517","investment adviser researching individual securities might seek to avoid."
"37518","Passive Strategy/Index (Transamerica International Equity Index VP and"
"37519","Transamerica U.S Equity Index VP): The portfolio is managed with a passive"
"37520","investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged"
"37521","index"
"37522","of securities, regardless of the current or projected performance of its"
"37523","underlying"
"37524","index or of the actual securities comprising its underlying index. This"
"37525","differs"
"37526","from an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a"
"37527","benchmark"
"37528","index. As a result, the portfolio's performance may be less favorable than"
"37529"," that of a"
"37530","portfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The structure and"
"37531","composition of the portfolio's underlying index will affect the performance,"
"37532","volatility, and risk of the underlying index and, consequently, the"
"37533","performance,"
"37534","volatility, and risk of the portfolio."
"37535","Prepayment or Call: Many fixed income securities give the issuer the"
"37536","option to"
"37537","repay or call the security prior to its maturity date. Issuers often"
"37538","exercise this right"
"37539","when interest rates fall. Accordingly, if a portfolio holds a fixed"
"37540","income security"
"37541","subject to prepayment or call risk, it will not benefit fully from"
"37542","the increase in"
"37543","value that other fixed income securities generally experience when"
"37544","interest rates"
"37545","fall. Upon prepayment of the security, a portfolio would also be forced"
"37546"," to reinvest"
"37547","the proceeds at then current yields, which would be lower than the yield"
"37548","of the"
"37549","security that was paid off. This may adversely affect a portfolio's net"
"37550","asset value."
"37551","In addition, if a portfolio purchases a fixed income security at a premium"
"37552"," (at a"
"37553","price that exceeds its stated par or principal value), the portfolio may"
"37554"," lose the"
"37555","amount of the premium paid in the event of prepayment."
"37556","Small and Medium Capitalization Companies: Investing in small- and"
"37557","medium-sized companies involves greater risk than is customarily"
"37558","associated"
"37559","with more established companies. The prices of securities of small and"
"37560"," medium"
"37561","capitalization companies generally are more volatile than those of large"
"37562","capitalization companies and are more likely to be adversely affected"
"37563","than large"
"37564","capitalization companies by changes in earnings results and investor"
"37565","expectations"
"37566","or poor economic or market conditions. Securities of small and medium"
"37567","capitalization companies may underperform large capitalization companies,"
"37568"," may"
"37569","be harder to sell at times and at prices the portfolio managers believe"
"37570"," appropriate"
"37571","and may offer greater potential for losses. Smaller capitalization companies"
"37572"," often"
"37573","have limited product lines, markets, or financial resources and their"
"37574","management"
"37575","may lack depth and experience. Such companies usually do not pay significant"
"37576","dividends that could cushion returns in a falling market."
"37577","Underlying Portfolios: When a portfolio invests its assets in various"
"37578"," underlying"
"37579","portfolios, its ability to achieve its investment objective depends"
"37580","largely on the"
"37581","performance of the underlying portfolios in which it invests. Investing"
"37582"," in"
"37583","underlying portfolios subjects the portfolio to the risks of investing"
"37584","in the"
"37585","underlying securities or assets held by those underlying portfolios."
"37586","Each of the"
"37587","underlying portfolios in which the portfolio may invest has its own"
"37588","investment"
"37589","risks, and those risks can affect the value of the underlying portfolios'"
"37590"," shares and"
"37591","therefore the value of the portfolio's investments. There can be no"
"37592","assurance that"
"37593","the investment objective of any underlying portfolio will be achieved."
"37594","To the"
"37595","extent that the portfolio invests more of its assets in one underlying"
"37596"," portfolio than"
"37597","in another, the portfolio will have greater exposure to the risks of"
"37598","that underlying"
"37599","portfolio. In addition, the portfolio will bear a pro rata portion of"
"37600","the operating"
"37601","expenses of the underlying portfolios in which it invests."
"37602","Valuation: Many factors may influence the price at which a portfolio"
"37603","could sell"
"37604","any particular portfolio investment. The sales price may well differ -"
"37605","higher or"
"37606","lower - from the portfolio's last valuation, and such differences could be"
"37607","significant, particularly for illiquid securities, securities priced"
"37608","based upon"
"37609","valuations provided by third-party pricing services that use matrix or"
"37610","evaluated"
"37611","pricing"
"37612","systems, and securities that trade in relatively thin markets and/or"
"37613","markets that"
"37614","experience extreme volatility. If market conditions make it difficult"
"37615","to value some"
"37616","investments, the portfolio may value these investments using more subjective"
"37617","methods, such as fair value methodologies. Investors who purchase or redeem"
"37618","portfolio shares on days when the portfolio is holding fair-valued"
"37619","securities may"
"37620","receive a greater or lesser number of shares, or greater or lower redemption"
"37621","proceeds, than they would have received if the portfolio had not"
"37622","fair-valued the"
"37623","securities or had used a different valuation methodology. The value of foreign"
"37624","securities, certain fixed income securities and currencies, as"
"37625","applicable, may be"
"37626","materially affected by events after the close of the markets on which they are"
"37627","traded, but before a portfolio determines its net asset value."
"37628","The portfolio's ability"
"37629","to value its investments may be impacted by technological issues"
"37630"," and/or errors by"
"37631","pricing services or other third party service providers."
"37632","MORE ON CERTAIN ADDITIONAL RISKS:"
"37633","The following provides additional risk information regarding investing in the"
"37634","portfolios."
"37635","Absence of Regulation: A portfolio may engage in over-the-counter (OTC)"
"37636","transactions, which trade in a dealer network, rather than on an exchange. In"
"37637","general, there is less governmental regulation and supervision of"
"37638","transactions in"
"37639","the OTC markets than of transactions entered into on organized exchanges."
"37640","Transactions in the OTC markets also are subject to the credit risk of the"
"37641","counterparty."
"37642","Cash Management and Defensive Investing: The value of investments held by"
"37643","a portfolio for cash management or defensive investing purposes can fluctuate."
"37644","Like other fixed income securities, cash and cash equivalent securities"
"37645"," are subject"
"37646","to risk, including market, interest rate and credit risk. If the"
"37647","portfolio holds cash"
"37648","uninvested, the portfolio will be subject to the credit risk of the depository"
"37649","institution holding the cash, it will not earn income on the cash and"
"37650"," the portfolio's"
"37651","yield will go down. If a significant amount of the portfolio's assets"
"37652"," are used for"
"37653","cash management or defensive investing purposes, it may not achieve its"
"37654","investment objective."
"37655","Conflicts of Interest: TAM and its affiliates are engaged in a variety of"
"37656","businesses and have interests other than that of managing the portfolios. The"
"37657","broad range of activities and interests of TAM and its affiliates gives"
"37658"," rise to actual,"
"37659","potential and perceived conflicts of interest that could affect the"

"37665","provide as issuers of variable insurance contracts. TAM's investment"
"37666"," decisions"
"37667","and the design of portfolios may be influenced by this. For example,"
"37668","a portfolio"
"37669","being managed or designed in a more conservative fashion may help reduce the"
"37670","risk to the Transamerica insurance companies that provide guaranteed benefits"
"37671","under variable insurance contracts and facilitate their provision of those"
"37672","guaranteed benefits and may also have the effect of limiting the amount of"

"37752","Transactions by the Asset Allocation Funds may be disruptive to the"

"37755","portfolio may experience large redemptions or investments due to"

"37760","an adverse impact"
"37761","on an underlying portfolio's performance. In the event of such redemptions"

"37763","investments, an underlying portfolio could be required to sell securities"
"37764","or to"
"37765","invest cash at a time when it may not otherwise desire to do so."
"37766","Such transactions"
"37767","may increase an underlying portfolio's brokerage and/or other"
"37768"," transaction costs."
"37769","In addition, when an Asset Allocation Fund owns a substantial portion of an"
"37770","underlying portfolio's shares, a large redemption by the Asset Allocation"
"37771","Fund"
"37772","could cause actual expenses to increase, or could result in the underlying"
"37773","portfolio's current expenses being allocated over a smaller asset"
"37774"," base, leading to"
"37775","an increase in the underlying portfolio's expense ratio. Redemptions of"
"37776","underlying portfolio shares could also accelerate the realization of"
"37777","taxable capital"
"37778","gains in an underlying portfolio if sales of securities result in"
"37779","capital gains. The"

"37782","purchases, redeems, or owns a substantial portion of an underlying portfolio's"

"37784","When possible, TAM and/or the sub-adviser will consider how to minimize"

"37789"," over a"
"37790","period of time, although there can be no assurance that such actions"

"37793","Operational: Your ability to transact with a portfolio or the valuation"
"37794"," of your"

"37808","occurrence of"
"37809","such failures. A portfolio and its shareholders could be negatively"
"37810","impacted as a"
"37811","result."
"37812","Redemption: A portfolio may experience periods of heavy redemptions that"
"37813","could cause the portfolio to liquidate its assets at inopportune"
"37814","times or at a loss or"
"37815","depressed value, particularly during periods of declining or illiquid"
"37816"," markets. In"

"37818","Redemption risk is greater to the extent that a portfolio has investors"

"37823","The redemption by one or more large shareholders of their holdings in a"

"37832","Regulatory: The U.S. government is in the process of adopting and"
"37833","implementing regulations governing derivatives markets, including mandatory"
"37834","clearing of certain derivatives, margin, reporting and registration"
"37835","requirements."
"37836","The ultimate impact of the regulations remains unclear. Additional"
"37837"," U.S. or other"
"37838","regulations may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of"
"37839","derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of"
"37840","derivatives. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act (the Reform Act)"
"37841","substantially increases regulation of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives"

"37843"," reporting"
"37844","requirements on transactions involving instruments that fall within the Reform"
"37845","Act's definition of swap and security-based swap, which terms generally"
"37846","include OTC derivatives, and imposing registration and potential substantive"
"37847","requirements on certain swap and security-based swap market participants. In"
"37848","addition, under the Reform Act, a portfolio may be subject to additional"
"37849","recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Other future regulatory developments"
"37850","may also impact a portfolio's ability to invest or remain invested in certain"
"37851","derivatives. Legislation or regulation may also change the way in which a"

"37853","regulation that"

"37855","financial derivative product is not known at this time, and there can be no"
"37856","assurance that any new governmental regulation will not adversely affect the"
"37857","portfolio's ability to achieve its investment objective."
"37858","Securities Lending: Each portfolio may lend securities to other financial"
"37859","institutions that provide cash or other securities as collateral."
"37860","When a portfolio"
"37861","lends portfolio securities, its investment performance will continue"
"37862"," to reflect"
"37863","changes in the value of the securities loaned, and the portfolio"
"37864"," will also receive a"
"37865","fee or interest on the collateral. Securities lending involves the risk"
"37866"," that the"
"37867","borrower may fail to return the securities in a timely manner or at"
"37868","all. As a result,"
"37869","a portfolio may lose money and there may be a delay in recovering the"
"37870"," loaned"
"37871","securities. A portfolio could also lose money if it does not recover"
"37872"," the securities"
"37873","and/or the value of the collateral falls, including the value of"
"37874","investments made"
"37875","with cash collateral."
"37876","Strategy: Securities and investment strategies with different"
"37877","characteristics tend"
"37878","to shift in and out of favor depending upon market and economic conditions as"
"37879","well as investor sentiment. A portfolio may outperform or underperform other"
"37880","funds that employ a different style or strategy. A portfolio may employ a"
"37881","combination of styles that impact its risk characteristics."
"37882","Tax: In order to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company (a"
"37883","RIC) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, each portfolio"
"37884","must meet certain requirements regarding the composition of its income, the"
"37885","diversification of its assets, and the amounts of its distributions."
"37886","In particular, a"
"37887","portfolio must generally diversify its holdings so that, at the end of"
"37888","each quarter"
"37889","of each taxable year, at least 50% of the value of the portfolio's total"
"37890","assets is"
"37891","represented by (1) cash and cash items, U.S. government securities,"
"37892","securities of"
"37893","other regulated investment companies, and (2) other securities, with such"
"37894","other"
"37895","securities limited, in respect of any one issuer, to an amount not greater"
"37896","than 5%"
"37897","of the value of the portfolio's total assets and to not more than 10% of"
"37898","the"
"37899","outstanding voting securities of such issuer. If a portfolio were to fail"
"37900"," to meet any"
"37901","of these requirements, the portfolio might not be eligible for treatment"
"37902"," as a RIC,"
"37903","in which case it would be subject to federal income tax on its net income at"
"37904","corporate rates (without reduction for distributions to shareholders). The"
"37905","portfolio may be able to preserve its RIC qualification by meeting certain"
"37906","conditions, in which case it may be subject to certain additional taxes."
"37907","Any income a portfolio derives from investments in certain hard asset ETFs,"
"37908","such as certain commodity ETFs, and from other non-qualifying sources must be"
"37909","limited to a maximum of 10% of the portfolio's gross income. If a"
"37910","portfolio fails"
"37911","to meet the 10% requirement, the portfolio may be subject to the"
"37912","federal income"
"37913","tax consequences described in the preceding paragraph. A"
"37914","portfolio may invest no more than 25% of its total assets in the securities of"
"37915","entities treated as qualified publicly traded partnerships for federal"
"37916","income tax"
"37917","purposes. If a portfolio fails to meet the 25% requirement, the portfolio"
"37918"," may be"
"37919","subject to the federal income tax consequences described in the preceding"
"37920","paragraph."
"37921","To Be Announced (TBA) Transactions: Although the securities that are"
"37922","delivered in TBA transactions must meet certain standards, there is a risk"
"37923"," that the"
"37924","actual securities received by a portfolio may be less favorable than what"
"37925"," was"
"37926","anticipated when entering into the transaction. TBA transactions also"
"37927","involve the"
"37928","risk that a counterparty will fail to deliver the security, exposing the"
"37929","portfolio to"
"37930","further losses. Whether or not the portfolio takes delivery of the securities"
"37931"," at the"
"37932","termination date of a TBA transaction, it will nonetheless be exposed to"

"40123","Fund Expenses"
"40124","During times of market volatility or decline, assets of your"
"40125"," portfolio may"
"40126","decline significantly, causing total annual fund operating expenses"
"40127"," (as a"
"40128","percentage of the value of your investment) to become higher than"
"40129"," the numbers"
"40130","shown in your portfolio's Annual Fund Operating Expenses table under"
"40131"," Fees
and Expenses in this prospectus."
"40132","The total annual fund operating expenses of your portfolio may not"
"40133","correlate to"
"40134","the ratios of expenses to average net assets shown for your portfolio"
"40135"," in the"
"40136","financial highlights table. The amounts shown in the financial"
"40137"," highlights table"
"40138","do not include, as applicable, acquired (i.e., underlying) funds'"
"40139","fees and"
"40140","expenses and may include other expense items and/or reimbursements"
"40141","which"
"40142","are not reflected in your portfolio's total annual fund operating"
"40143","expenses."
"40144","The Other expenses items in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses"
"40145","table for"
"40146","your portfolio include fees for custodial and legal services."
"40147","Other expenses"
"40148","also include various other expenses applicable to each share"
"40149","class of your"
"40150","portfolio."
"40151","Share Classes"
"40152","Transamerica Series Trust (TST) has two classes of shares, an"
"40153","Initial Class and"
"40154","a Service Class. Initial Class shares and Service Class shares have"
"40155","different"
"40156","expense structures. Initial Class shares can have up to a maximum"
"40157","Rule 12b-1 fee"
"40158","equal to an annual rate of 0.15% (expressed as a percentage of average"
"40159","daily net"
"40160","assets of the portfolio), but the portfolios have not been charged and"
"40161","do not intend"
"40162","to pay any distribution fees for Initial Class shares through May 1,"
"40163","2018. The"
"40164","portfolios reserve the right to pay such fees after that date."
"40165","Service Class shares have a maximum Rule 12b-1 fee equal to an annual"
"40166"," rate of"
"40167","0.25% (expressed as a percentage of average daily net assets of the"
"40168"," portfolio)."
"40169","These fees and expenses will lower investment performance."
"40170","Opening an Account"
"40171","Federal regulations may require the portfolio to obtain, verify and"
"40172","record certain"
"40173","information from you and persons authorized to act on your behalf in order to"
"40174","establish an account. Required information includes name, date of"
"40175","birth (for an"
"40176","individual), permanent residential address or principal place of"
"40177","business and"
"40178","Social Security Number or Employer Identification Number. The portfolio may"
"40179","also ask to see other identifying documents. If you do not provide the"
"40180","information, the portfolio may not be able to open your account. Identifying"
"40181","information must be provided for each trader on an account. The portfolio may"
"40182","also place limits on account transactions while it is in the process"
"40183"," of verifying"
"40184","your identity. If the portfolio is unable to verify your identity, or"
"40185","that of another"
"40186","person(s) authorized to act on your behalf, or if the portfolio"
"40187","believes it has"
"40188","identified potentially criminal activity, the portfolio reserves the"
"40189","right to take"
"40190","action it deems appropriate or as required by law, which may include"

"40207","variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies."
"40208","However, it is"

"40210","contracts and"

"40219","variable annuity contract owners and variable life insurance"
"40220","policy owners, and"
"40221","would have to determine what action, if any, should be taken"
"40222","in the event of such"
"40223","a conflict. If such a conflict occurred, an insurance company"
"40224","participating in a"
"40225","portfolio might be required to redeem the investment of one or"
"40226","more of its"
"40227","separate accounts from the portfolio, which might force the"
"40228","portfolio to sell"
"40229","securities at disadvantageous prices."
"40230","Shares are purchased and redeemed at their net asset value per"
"40231","share (NAV)"
"40232","without the imposition of any sales commission or redemption"
"40233"," charge. (However,"
"40234","certain sales or other charges may apply to the policies or"
"40235","annuity contracts, as"
"40236","described in the product prospectus.)"
"40237","Payment for shares redeemed is normally made within seven days"
"40238","after receipt of"
"40239","a notice of redemption in good order, except that payments of"
"40240","redemptions may"
"40241","be postponed beyond seven days under certain circumstances,"
"40242","such as when the"
"40243","New York Stock Exchange is closed (other than on weekends or"
"40244","holidays) or"
"40245","trading is restricted, if an emergency exists, or otherwise as"
"40246","permitted by order of"
"40247","the SEC or authorized by law."
"40248","Under normal circumstances, the portfolios expect to meet"
"40249","redemption requests"
"40250","by using cash or cash equivalents and/or selling a portfolio's"
"40251","securities to"
"40252","generate cash. The portfolios also may pay redemption proceeds"
"40253","using cash"
"40254","obtained through borrowing arrangements that may be available"
"40255","from time to"
"40256","time."
"40257","Shares will normally be redeemed in cash, although each portfolio"
"40258"," retains the"
"40259","right to redeem its shares in kind (for example, if a portfolio"
"40260","reasonably believes"
"40261","that a cash redemption may have a substantial impact on a portfolio"
"40262"," and its"
"40263","remaining shareholders)."
"40264","Under adverse or unstable market, economic or political conditions,"
"40265"," when an"
"40266","increased portion of a portfolio's securities may be comprised of"
"40267","less-liquid"
"40268","investments, or during extraordinary or emergency circumstances,"
"40269","the portfolios"
"40270","may be more likely to pay redemption proceeds with cash obtained"
"40271","through short-"
"40272","term borrowing arrangements (if available) or redeem their shares"
"40273","in kind."
"40274","Market Timing/Excessive Trading"
"40275","Some investors try to profit from various short-term or frequent"
"40276","trading strategies"
"40277","known as market timing. Examples of market timing include switching"
"40278"," money"
"40279","into portfolios when their share prices are expected to rise and"
"40280","taking money out"
"40281","when their share prices are expected to fall, and switching from one"
"40282"," portfolio to"
"40283","another and then back again after a short period of time. As money"
"40284","is shifted in"
"40285","and out, a portfolio may incur expenses for buying and selling"
"40286","securities."
"40287","Excessive purchases, redemptions or exchanges of"
"40288","portfolio shares may disrupt portfolio management, hurt portfolio"
"40289","performance"
"40290","and drive portfolio expenses higher. For example, a portfolio may"
"40291","be forced to"
"40292","liquidate investments as a result of short-term trading and incur"
"40293","increased"
"40294","brokerage costs or realize capital gains without attaining any"
"40295","investment"
"40296","advantage. These costs are generally borne by all shareholders,"
"40297","including long-"
"40298","term investors who do not generate these costs."
"40299","The Board of Trustees has approved policies and procedures that"
"40300","are designed to"
"40301","discourage market timing or excessive trading, which include"
"40302","limitations on the"
"40303","number of transactions in portfolio shares. If you intend to engage"
"40304","in such"
"40305","practices, we request that you do not purchase shares of any of the"
"40306"," portfolios."
"40307","Each portfolio reserves the right to reject any request to purchase"
"40308","shares,"
"40309","including purchases in connection with an exchange transaction, which"
"40310","the"
"40311","portfolio reasonably believes to be in connection with market timing"
"40312"," or excessive"
"40313","trading."
"40314","The portfolios rely on the insurance companies that offer shares of"
"40315","the portfolios"
"40316","as investment options for variable contracts to monitor market timing"
"40317","and"
"40318","disruptive trading by their customers. The portfolios seek periodic"
"40319","certifications"
"40320","from the insurance companies that they have policies and procedures"
"40321"," in place"
"40322","designed to monitor and prevent market timing and disruptive trading"
"40323","activity by"
"40324","their customers, and that they will use their best efforts to prevent"
"40325"," market timing"
"40326","and disruptive trading activity that appears to be in contravention"
"40327","of the"
"40328","portfolios' policies on market timing or disruptive trading as"
"40329"," disclosed in this"
"40330","prospectus. The portfolios also may instruct from time to time the"
"40331","insurance"
"40332","companies to scrutinize purchases, including purchases in connection"
"40333","with"
"40334","exchange transactions, that exceed a certain size. Each portfolio"
"40335","reserves the"
"40336","right, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, to reject,"
"40337","delay, restrict or"
"40338","refuse, in whole or in part, any request to purchase shares, including"
"40339"," purchases in"
"40340","connection with an exchange transaction and orders that have been"
"40341","accepted by"
"40342","an intermediary, which it reasonably determines to be in connection"
"40343","with market"
"40344","timing or disruptive trading by a contract or policy owner (a contract
 owner) or"
"40345","by accounts of contract owners under common control (for example, related"
"40346","contract owners, or a financial adviser with discretionary trading"
"40347","authority over"
"40348","multiple accounts). The portfolios apply these policies and procedures to all"
"40349","investors on a uniform basis and do not make special arrangements or grant"
"40350","exceptions to accommodate market timing or disruptive trading."
"40351","While the portfolios discourage market timing and excessive short-term"
"40352","trading,"
"40353","the portfolios cannot always recognize or detect such trading."
"40354","The portfolios' distributor has entered into agreements with intermediaries"
"40355","requiring the intermediaries to provide certain information to help identify"
"40356","harmful trading activity and to prohibit further purchases or exchanges by a"
"40357","shareholder identified as having engaged in excessive trading. There is no"
"40358","guarantee that the procedures used by financial intermediaries will"
"40359"," be able to"
"40360","curtail frequent,"
"40361","short-term trading activity. For example, shareholders who seek to engage in"
"40362","frequent, short-term trading activity may use a variety of strategies"
"40363"," to avoid"
"40364","detection, and the financial intermediaries' ability to deter such"
"40365","ctivity may be"
"40366","limited by the capabilities of operational and information systems."
"40367","Due to the"
"40368","risk that the portfolios and financial intermediaries may not detect"
"40369","all harmful"
"40370","trading activity, it is possible that shareholders may bear the risks"
"40371","associated with"
"40372","such activity."
"40373","Investors should also review the prospectus that describes the variable"
"40374","contracts"
"40375","that they are purchasing to learn more about the policies and procedures"
"40376","used by"
"40377","insurance companies to detect and deter frequent, short-term trading."
"40378","Reallocations in underlying portfolios by an Asset Allocation Fund in"
"40379","furtherance of a portfolio's objective are not considered to be market"
"40380"," timing or"
"40381","excessive trading."
"40382","Additional Information"
"40383","This prospectus and the SAI provide information concerning the portfolios that"
"40384","you should consider in determining whether to purchase shares of a portfolio. A"
"40385","portfolio may make changes to this information from time to time. Each"
"40386","portfolio's investment objective may be changed by the Board without"
"40387","shareholder approval. Each portfolio's investment strategies and policies"
"40388"," may be"
"40389","changed from time to time without shareholder approval, unless specifically"
"40390","stated otherwise in this prospectus or in the SAI."
"40391","A portfolio that has a policy of investing, under normal circumstances,"
"40392"," at least"
"40393","80% of its net assets (plus the amount of any borrowings for investment"
"40394","purposes) in the particular type of securities suggested by its name will"
"40395"," provide"
"40396","its shareholders with at least 60 days' prior written notice before making"
"40397","changes"
"40398","to such policy. Such notice will comply with the conditions set forth in any"
"40399","applicable SEC rules then in effect."
"40400","Neither this prospectus nor the SAI is intended to give rise to any contract"
"40401","rights"
"40402","or other rights of any shareholder, other than any rights conferred explicitly"
"40403","by"
"40404","federal or state securities laws that may not be waived."
"40405","The portfolios enter into contractual arrangements with various parties,"
"40406"," including"
"40407","the portfolios' investment manager, who provides services to the portfolios."
"40408","Shareholders are not parties to, or intended (or third-party) beneficiaries"
"40409","of"
"40410","those contractual arrangements."
"40411","To the extent authorized by law, the portfolios reserve the right to"
"40412","discontinue"
"40413","offering shares at any time, to merge or liquidate a class of shares or to"
"40414"," cease"
"40415","operations entirely."
"40416","Abandoned or Unclaimed Property"
"40417","Every state has unclaimed property laws that generally provide for escheatment"
"40418","to the state of unclaimed property under various circumstances. In addition"
"40419"," to the"
"40420","state unclaimed property laws, we may be required to escheat property pursuant"
"40421","to regulatory demand, finding, agreement or settlement. To help prevent such"
"40422","escheatment, it is important that you keep your contact and other"
"40423","information on"
"40424","file with us up to date, including the names, contact information and"
"40425","identifying"
"40426","information for customers, beneficiaries and other payees. Such updates"
"40427","should"
"40428","be communicated in a form and manner satisfactory to us. Individual states"
"40429","may"
"40430","have their own requirements. For more information regarding escheatment and"
"40431","unclaimed property in your state, ask your salesperson or visit your financial"
"40432","intermediary's website."
"40433","Sending Forms and Transaction Requests in Good Order"
"40434","We cannot process your requests for transactions relating to the portfolios"
"40435"," until"
"40436","they are received in good order. Good order means the actual receipt of the"
"40437","instructions relating to the requested transaction in writing (or, when"
"40438","appropriate,"
"40439","by telephone or electronically), along with all forms, information and"
"40440","supporting"
"40441","legal documentation necessary to effect the transaction. This information and"
"40442","documentation generally includes, to the extent applicable to the transaction:"
"40443"," your"
"40444","completed application; the transaction amount (in dollars, shares or percentage"
"40445","terms); the names, portfolio and account number(s) and allocations to and/or"
"40446"," from"
"40447","the portfolio accounts affected by the requested transaction; the signatures"
"40448","of all"
"40449","owners (exactly as registered on the account) if necessary; Social Security"
"40450","Number or Taxpayer I.D.; and any other information or supporting"
"40451","documentation that we may require, including any spousal or joint owner's"
"40452","consents and signature guarantees. With respect to purchase requests, good
order also generally includes receipt of sufficient funds to effect any"
"40453","purchase."
"40454","We may, in our sole discretion, determine whether any particular transaction"
"40455","request is in good order, and we reserve the right to change or waive any good"
"40456","order requirements at any time. Received or receipt in good order generally"
"40457","means that everything necessary must be received by the portfolios, at our"
"40458","mailing address specified in this prospectus. We reserve the right to reject"
"40459","electronic transactions that do not meet our requirements."
"40460","How Share Price Is Determined"
"40461","The price at which shares are purchased or redeemed is the NAV that is next"
"40462","calculated following receipt and acceptance of a purchase order in good"
"40463","order or"
"40464","receipt of a redemption request by the portfolios' distributor (or other"
"40465"," agent)."
"40466","When Share Price Is Determined"
"40467","The NAV of all portfolios (or class thereof) is determined on each day the"
"40468"," New"
"40469","York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is open for business. The NAV is not determined"
"40470","on days when the NYSE is closed (generally New Year's Day, Martin Luther"
"40471","King"
"40472","Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor"
"40473","Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas). Foreign securities may trade in their primary"
"40474","markets on weekends or other days when a portfolio does not price its shares"
"40475","(therefore, the value of a portfolio's foreign securities may change on"
"40476","days when"
"40477","shareholders will not be able to buy or sell shares of the portfolios). These"
"40478","securities will be valued pursuant to the portfolios' Pricing and Valuation"
"40479","procedures for such securities."
"40480","Purchase orders received in good order and accepted, and redemption orders"
"40481","received in good order, before the close of business of the NYSE, usually 4:00"
"40482","p.m. Eastern Time, receive the NAV determined as of the close of the NYSE that"
"40483","day . Purchase and redemption requests received after the NYSE is closed"
"40484","receive"
"40485","the NAV determined as of the close of the NYSE the next day the NYSE is open."
"40486","Purchase orders for shares of the asset allocation portfolios that are"
"40487","received in"
"40488","good order and accepted before the close of business of the NYSE receive"
"40489","the"
"40490","NAV determined as of the close of the NYSE that day. Purchase orders for"
"40491","shares"
"40492","of the underlying constituent portfolios will be placed as determined by"
"40493","the"
"40494","portfolio's sub-adviser (and such asset allocation portfolio will receive"
"40495","the price"
"40496","for shares of the underlying portfolios on the day the order is placed)."
"40497","How NAV Is Calculated"
"40498","The NAV of each portfolio (or class thereof) is calculated by taking the"
"40499","value of"
"40500","its net assets and dividing by the number of shares of the portfolio (or class)"
"40501"," that"
"40502","are then outstanding."
"40503","The Board has approved procedures to be used to value the portfolios'"
"40504","securities"
"40505","for purposes of determining the portfolios' NAV. The valuation of the securities"
"40506"," of"
"40507","the portfolios is determined in good faith by or under the direction of the"
"40508","Board."
"40509","While the Board has primary responsibility to shareholders for valuation of"
"40510","portfolio securities, the Board has delegated certain valuation functions for"
"40511"," the"
"40512","portfolios to TAM."
"40513","In general, securities and other investments (including shares of ETFs) are"
"40514","valued"
"40515","based on market prices at the close of regular trading on the NYSE."
"40516","Portfolio"
"40517","securities (including shares of ETFs) listed or traded on domestic"
"40518","securities"
"40519","exchanges or the NASDAQ/NMS, including dollar-denominated foreign"
"40520","securities or ADRs, are valued at the closing price on the exchange or"
"40521","system"
"40522","where the security is principally traded. With respect to securities traded"
"40523"," on the"
"40524","NASDAQ/NMS, such closing price may be the last reported sale price or the"
"40525","NASDAQ Official Closing Price (NOCP). If there have been no sales for that"
"40526","day on the exchange or system where the security is principally traded,"
"40527","then"
"40528"," the"
"40529","value should be determined with reference to the last sale price, or the"
"40530","NOCP,"
"40531"," if"
"40532","applicable, on any other exchange or system. If there have been no sales"
"40533","for that"
"40534","day on any exchange or system, a security is valued at the closing bid"
"40535"," quotes on"
"40536","the exchange or system where the security is principally traded, or at"
"40537"," the NOCP,"
"40538"," if"
"40539","applicable. Foreign securities traded on U.S. exchanges are generally priced"
"40540","using"
"40541","last sale price regardless of trading activity. Securities traded"
"40542","over-the-counter are"
"40543","valued at the last bid price. The market price for debt obligations is"
"40544","generally the"
"40545","price supplied by an independent third party pricing service, which may use"
"40546","market prices or quotations or a variety of fair value techniques and"
"40547","methodologies. Short-term debt obligations that will mature in 60 days or less"
"40548"," are"
"40549","valued at amortized cost, unless it is determined that using this method would"
"40550"," not"
"40551","reflect an investment's fair value. The prices that the portfolio uses may"
"40552","differ"
"40553","from the amounts that would be realized if the investments were sold and the"
"40554","differences could be significant, particularly for securities that trade in"
"40555","relatively"
"40556","thin markets and/or markets that experience extreme volatility. Foreign"
"40557","securities"
"40558","generally are valued based on quotations from the primary market in which"
"40559","they"
"40560","are traded, and are converted from the local currency into U.S. dollars"
"40561","using"
"40562","current exchange rates. Market quotations for securities prices may be"
"40563","obtained"
"40564","from automated pricing services. Shares of open-end funds (other than ETF"
"40565","shares) are generally valued at the NAV reported by that investment company."
"40566","ETF shares are valued at the most recent sale price or official closing"
"40567","price on the"
"40568","exchange on which they are traded."
"40569","When a market quotation for a security is not readily available (which may"
"40570","include closing prices deemed to be unreliable because of the occurrence of a"
"40571","subsequent event), a valuation committee appointed by the Board may, in good"
"40572","faith, establish a value for the security in accordance with fair valuation"
"40573","procedures adopted by the Board. The Board reviews all fair value"
"40574","determinations"
"40575","typically at its regularly scheduled meetings. The types of securities for"
"40576"," which"
"40577","such fair value pricing may be required include, but are not limited to:"
"40578","foreign"
"40579","securities, where a significant event occurs after the close of the foreign"
"40580","market"
"40581","on which such security principally trades that is likely to have changed the"
"40582","value"
"40583","of such security, or the closing value is otherwise deemed unreliable;"
"40584","securities of"
"40585","an issuer that has entered into a restructuring; securities whose trading has"
"40586"," been"
"40587","halted or suspended; fixed-income securities that have gone into default and"
"40588","for"
"40589","which there is no current market value quotation; and securities that are"
"40590","restricted"
"40591","as to transfer or resale. The portfolios use a fair value model developed"
"40592","by an"
"40593","independent third party pricing service to price foreign equity securities"
"40594","on days"
"40595","when there is a certain percentage change in the value of a domestic equity"
"40596","security index, as such percentage may be determined by TAM from time to time."
"40597","Valuing securities in accordance with fair value procedures involves greater"
"40598","reliance on judgment than valuing securities based on readily available market"
"40599","quotations. The valuation committee makes fair value determinations in good"
"40600","faith in accordance with the portfolios' valuation procedures. Fair value"
"40601","determinations can also involve reliance on quantitative models employed by a"
"40602","fair value pricing service. There can be no assurance that a portfolio could"
"40603","obtain"
"40604","the fair value assigned to a security if it were to sell the security at"
"40605","approximately"
"40606","the time at which the portfolio determines its NAV."
"40607","Distributor"
"40608","Transamerica Capital, Inc. (TCI), located at 1801 California Street, Suite"
"40609"," 5200,"
"40610","Denver, CO 80202 underwrites and distributes all classes of portfolio shares"
"40611","and"
"40612","bears the expenses of offering these shares to the public. TCI is an affiliate"
"40613"," of the"
"40614","investment manager and the portfolios."
"40615","Distribution Plan"
"40616","Each portfolio has adopted a Rule 12b-1 Plan under the Investment Company Act"
"40617","of 1940 (the Plan) for each class of shares."
"40618","The Plan permits the use of portfolio assets to pay distribution and service"
"40619","fees"
"40620","for the sale and distribution of its shares. These fees are used to pay TCI,"
"40621","broker-"
"40622","dealers, financial intermediaries and other professionals who sell portfolio"
"40623","shares"
"40624","and provide ongoing services to shareholders and to pay other marketing and"
"40625","advertising expenses."
"40626","Under the Plan, each portfolio pays the following distribution and service"
"40627","fees (as"
"40628","a percentage of the portfolio's average daily net assets):"
"40629","..	Initial Class - Up to 0.15%"
"40630","..	Service Class - Up to 0.25%"
"40631","As of the date of this prospectus, the portfolios have not been charged and"
"40632"," have"
"40633","not paid any 12b-1 fees with respect to Initial Class shares, and will not"
"40634","be"
"40635","charged or pay any 12b-1 fees on Initial Class shares through May 1, 2018."
"40636","You"
"40637","will receive written notice prior to the charging and payment of any fees"
"40638","under"
"40639","the Plan relating to Initial Class shares. Each portfolio may, however, be"
"40640","charged"
"40641","and pay fees relating to Service Class shares."
"40642","Because these fees are paid out of each portfolio's assets on an ongoing"
"40643"," basis,"
"40644","over time these fees will increase the cost of your investment and may cost"
"40645"," you"
"40646","more than paying other types of sales charges."
