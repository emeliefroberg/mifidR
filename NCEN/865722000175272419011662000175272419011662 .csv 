"2621","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"2622","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of"
"2623","a company's assets that could have a material"
"2624","effect on the financial statements."
"2625","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2626","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"2627","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"2628","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2629","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"2630","procedures may deteriorate."
"2631","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"2632","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"2633","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"2634","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"2635","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2636","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"2637","possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual"
"2638","or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"2639","on a timely basis."
"2640","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2641","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2642","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"2643","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"2644","weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB.  However, we noted"
"2645","the following deficiency in the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2646","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"2647","securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as"
"2648","defined above as of December 31, 2018."
"2649","Management and PwC identified that at December 31, 2018 management's"
"2650","controls were ineffective related to internal control over"
"2651","financial reporting specific to the monitoring of market events"
"2652","following the close of trading in foreign stock markets that"
"2653","assist in determining the reliability of the values of the"
"2654","foreign securities held by the Funds and which may require the"
"2655","use of fair valuation factors to account for changes in the values"
"2656","of those securities subsequent to the local close of the foreign market"
"2657","but prior to the net asset calculation of the Funds. This material"
"2658","weakness did not result in misstatements in the Funds' interim"
"2659","or annual financial statements.  However, this material weakness could"
"2660","result in misstatements of security values and unrealized gains or"
"2661","losses and associated disclosures that would result in a material"
"2662","misstatement of the financial statements that would not be prevented"
"2663","or detected. As a result, a material weakness exists at"
"2664"," December 31, 2018 for the Funds."
"2665","Effective November 1, 2018 the Registrant's controls were further"
"2666","enhanced through the implementation of a daily secondary review of"
"2667","market events following the close of trading on foreign stock markets"
"2668","to ensure the appropriate application of market level fair value."
"2669","We have not performed any procedures to assess this corrective action,"
"2670","including its sufficiency in addressing the material"
"2671","weakness described above."
"2672","This report is intended solely for the information and use of the"

"2908","Section 7.	WAIVER OF NOTICE BY CONSENT OF ABSENT SHAREHOLDERS."
"2909","  Attendance by a Shareholder, in person or by proxy, at a meeting"

"2912"," for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting,"
"2913"," to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not"

"2916","Declaration of Trust or these By-Laws, a written waiver thereof,"
"2917"," executed before or after the time notice is required to be given,"

"2924","the meeting shall have the right to do so either in person or by"
"2925"," one or more agents authorized by a written proxy executed by the"
"2926"," Shareholder and filed with the secretary of the Trust before being"
"2927"," voted; provided, that an alternative to the execution of a written"
"2928"," proxy may be permitted as described in the next paragraph of this"
"2929"," Section 8.  A proxy shall be deemed executed if the Shareholder's"
"2930","name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting,"
"2931"," telegraphic or electronic transmission (as defined in Section 3806"
"2932"," of the DSTA) or otherwise) by the Shareholder or the Shareholder's"
"2933"," attorney-in-fact.  A valid proxy that does not state that it is"
"2934","irrevocable shall continue in full force and effect unless (i)"
"2935"," revoked by the person executing it before the vote pursuant to"
"2936"," that proxy is taken (a) by a writing delivered to the Trust"
"2937","stating that the proxy is revoked, (b) by a subsequent proxy"
"2938"," executed by such person, (c) attendance at the meeting and"
"2939","voting in person by the person executing that proxy, or (d)"
"2940","revocation by such person using any electronic, telephonic,"

"2942","Trustees for authorizing the proxy to act; or (ii) written"
"2943","notice of the death or incapacity of the maker of that proxy"
"2944"," is received by the Trust before the vote pursuant to that"
"2945","proxy is counted; provided, however, that no proxy shall be"
"2946"," valid after the expiration of eleven (11) months from the"
"2947"," date of the proxy unless otherwise expressly provided in"
"2948","the proxy.  The revocability of a proxy that states on its"
"2949","face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the"
"2950"," provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State"
"2951","of Delaware. Unless revoked, any proxy given in connection"
"2952"," with a postponed or adjourned meeting for which a new"
"2953","record date is fixed shall continue to be valid so long"
"2954","as the Shareholder giving such proxy is a Shareholder of"
"2955","record on such new such record date."
"2956","With respect to any Shareholders' meeting, the Board, or,"
"2957"," in case the Board does not act, the president, any vice"
"2958"," president or the secretary, may permit proxies by electronic"
"2959"," transmission (as defined in Section 3806 of the DSTA),"
"2960","telephonic, computerized, telecommunications or other reasonable"
"2961"," alternative to the execution of a written instrument authorizing"
"2962"," the holder of the proxy to act.  A proxy with respect to Shares"
"2963","held in the name of two or more Persons shall be valid if executed,"
"2964"," or a permitted alternative to execution is used, by any one of"
"2965","them unless, at or prior to the exercise of the proxy, the secretary"
"2966"," of the Trust receives a specific written notice to the contrary"
"2967"," from any one of them.  A proxy purporting to be by or on behalf"
"2968","of a Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or"
"2969","prior to its exercise and the burden of proving invalidity shall"
"2970"," rest with the challenger.  Unless otherwise specifically limited"
"2971"," by their terms, proxies shall entitle the Shareholder to vote at"
"2972"," any adjournment or postponement of a Shareholder meeting."
"2973","Subject to the provisions of the DSTA, the Declaration of Trust"
"2974"," or these By-Laws, the General Corporation Law of the State of"
"2975"," Delaware relating to proxies, and judicial interpretations thereunder,"
"2976"," shall govern all matters concerning the giving, voting or validity of"
"2977"," proxies, as if the Trust were a Delaware corporation and the"
"2978"," Shareholders were stockholders of a Delaware corporation."
"2979","Section 9.	INSPECTORS.  Before any meeting of Shareholders,"
"2980"," the chairperson of the Board, or in the absence of the chairperson"
"2981"," of the Board, the president of the Trust, or in the absence of the"
"2982"," president, any vice president or other authorized officer of the"

"2987","of the Board, the president of the Trust, or in the absence of the"
"2988","president, any vice president or other authorized officer of the Trust,"

"2994"," the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies;"

"3953","ARTICLE III SHARES"
"3954","Section 1.	Division of Beneficial Interest."
"3955","(a)	The beneficial interest in the Trust shall be divided into"
"3956","Shares, each Share without a par value.  The number of Shares in the"
"3957"," Trust authorized hereunder, and of each Series and Class as may be"
"3958"," established from time to time, is unlimited.  The Board of Trustees"
"3959"," may authorize the division of Shares into separate Classes of Shares"
"3960"," and into separate and distinct Series of Shares and the division of"
"3961"," any Series into separate Classes of Shares in accordance with the"
"3962"," 1940 Act.  The different Series and Classes shall be established"
"3963"," and designated pursuant to Article III, Section 6 hereof.  If no"
"3964"," separate Series or Classes of Series shall be established, the"
"3965"," Shares shall have the rights, powers and duties provided for"
"3966","herein and in Article III, Section 6 hereof to the extent relevant"
"3967"," and not otherwise provided for herein, and all references to"
"3968","Series and Classes shall be construed (as the context may require)"
"3969"," to refer to the Trust."
"3970","(i)	The fact that the Trust shall have one or more established"
"3971"," and designated Classes of the Trust, shall not limit the authority"
"3972"," of the Board of Trustees to establish and designate additional"
"3973"," Classes of the Trust.  The fact that one or more Classes of the"
"3974"," Trust shall have initially been established and designated without"
"3975"," any specific establishment or designation of a Series (i.e.,"
"3976","that all Shares of the Trust are initially Shares of one or more"
"3977"," Classes) shall not limit the authority of the Board of Trustees"
"3978"," to later establish and designate a Series and establish and"
"3979","designate the Class or Classes of the Trust as Class or Classes,"
"3980"," respectively, of such Series."
"3981","(ii)	The fact that a Series shall have initially been established"
"3982"," and designated without any specific establishment or designation of"
"3983"," Classes (i.e., that all Shares of such Series are initially of a"
"3984","single Class) shall not limit the authority of the Board of Trustees"
"3985"," to establish and designate separate Classes of said Series.  The"
"3986","fact that a Series shall have more than one established and designated"
"3987"," Class, shall not limit the authority of the Board of Trustees to"
"3988","establish and designate additional Classes of said Series."
"3989","(b)	The Board of Trustees shall have the power to issue"
"3990"," authorized, but unissued Shares of the Trust, or any Series"
"3991"," and Class thereof, from time to time for such consideration"
"3992"," paid wholly or partly in cash, securities or other property,"
"3993","as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Trustees,"
"3994"," subject to any requirements or limitations of the"
"3995","1940 Act.  The Board of Trustees, on behalf of the Trust, may"
"3996"," acquire and hold as treasury shares, reissue for such consideration"
"3997"," and on such terms as it may determine, or cancel, at its discretion"
"3998"," from time to time, any Shares reacquired by the Trust.  The Board"
"3999","of Trustees may classify, reclassify or convert any unissued Shares"
"4000"," or any Shares of the Trust or any Series or Class thereof, that"
"4001"," were previously issued and are reacquired, into one or more Series"
"4002"," or Classes that may be established and designated from time to"
"4003","time and, in connection therewith, cause"
"4004","some or all of the Shareholders of the Trust, such Series or Class"
"4005"," to become Shareholders of such other Series or Class."
"4006","Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust and any Series thereof"
"4007"," may acquire, hold, sell and otherwise deal in, for purposes of"
"4008"," investment or otherwise, the Shares of any other Series of the"
"4009"," Trust or Shares of the Trust, and such Shares shall not be deemed"
"4010"," treasury shares or cancelled."
"4011","(c)	Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Article III,"
"4012"," each Share shall entitle the holder to voting rights as provided"
"4013"," in Article V hereof.  Shareholders shall have no preemptive or"
"4014"," other right to subscribe for new or additional authorized, but"
"4015"," unissued Shares or other securities issued by the Trust or any"
"4016"," Series thereof.  The Board of Trustees may from time to time"
"4017","divide or combine the Shares of the Trust or any particular Series"
"4018"," thereof into a greater or lesser number of Shares of the Trust or"
"4019"," that Series, respectively.  Such division or combination shall not"
"4020"," materially change the proportionate beneficial interests of the"
"4021","holders of Shares of the Trust or that Series, as the case may be,"
"4022"," in the Trust Property at the time of such division or combination"
"4023"," that is held with respect to the Trust or that Series, as the case"
"4024"," may be."
"4025","(d)	Any Trustee, officer or other agent of the Trust, and any"
"4026"," organization in which any such Person has an economic or other"
"4027","interest, may acquire, own, hold and dispose of Shares in the Trust"
"4028"," or any Series and Class thereof, whether such Shares are authorized"
"4029"," but unissued, or already outstanding, to the same extent as if such"
"4030"," Person were not a Trustee, officer or other agent of the Trust; and"
"4031"," the Trust or any Series may issue and sell and may purchase such"
"4032","Shares from any such Person or any such organization, subject to"
"4033"," the limitations, restrictions or other provisions applicable to"
"4034"," the sale or purchase of such Shares herein and the 1940 Act."
"4035","Section 2.	Ownership of Shares.  The ownership of Shares"
"4036","shall be recorded on the books of the Trust kept by the Trust or"
"4037"," by a transfer or similar agent for the Trust, which books shall"
"4038"," be maintained separately for the Shares of the Trust and each"
"4039"," Series and each Class thereof that has been established and"
"4040"," designated.  No certificates certifying the ownership of Shares"
"4041"," shall be issued except as the Board of Trustees may otherwise"
"4042","determine from time to time.  The"
"4043","Board of Trustees may make such rules not inconsistent with the"
"4044"," provisions of the 1940 Act as it considers appropriate for the"
"4045","issuance of Share certificates, the transfer of Shares of the"
"4046"," Trust and each Series and Class thereof, if any, and similar"
"4047"," matters.  The record books of the Trust as kept by the Trust"
"4048","or any transfer or similar agent, as the case may be, shall be"
"4049"," conclusive as to who"
"4050","are the Shareholders of the Trust and each Series and Class"
"4051","thereof and as to the number of Shares of the Trust and each"
"4052"," Series and Class thereof held from time to time by each such"
"4053"," Shareholder."
"4054","Section 3.	Sale of Shares.  Subject to the 1940 Act and"
"4055","applicable law, the Trust may sell its authorized but unissued"
"4056"," Shares to such Persons, at such times, on such terms, and for"
"4057"," such consideration as the Board of Trustees may from time to"
"4058"," time authorize.  Each sale shall be credited to the individual"
"4059"," purchaser's account in the form of full or fractional Shares"
"4060","of the Trust or such Series thereof (and Class thereof, if any),"
"4061"," as the purchaser may select, at the net asset value per Share,"
"4062"," subject to Section 22 of the 1940 Act, and the rules and"
"4063","regulations adopted thereunder; provided, however, that the"
"4064"," Board of Trustees may, in its sole discretion, permit the"
"4065","Principal Underwriter to impose a sales charge upon any such"
"4066","sale.  Every Shareholder by virtue of having become a"
"4067","Shareholder shall be bound by the terms of this Declaration"
"4068","of Trust."
"4069","Ownership of Shares shall not make any Shareholder a"
"4070","third-party beneficiary of any contract entered into by"
"4071"," the Trust or any Series."
"4072","Section 4.	Status of Shares and Limitation of Personal"
"4073"," Liability.  Shares shall be deemed to be personal property"
"4074","giving to Shareholders only the rights provided in this"
"4075","Declaration of Trust, the By-Laws, and under applicable law."
"4076","  Ownership of Shares shall not entitle the Shareholder to"
"4077","any title in or to the whole or any part of the Trust Property"
"4078","or right to call for a partition or division of the same or"
"4079","for an accounting, nor shall the ownership of Shares constitute"
"4080"," the Shareholders as partners.  Subject to Article VIII, Section"
"4081"," 1 hereof, the death, incapacity, dissolution, termination, or"
"4082","bankruptcy of a Shareholder during the existence of the Trust and"
"4083"," any Series thereof shall not operate to dissolve the Trust or"
"4084","any such Series, nor entitle the representative of any deceased,"
"4085"," incapacitated, dissolved, terminated or bankrupt Shareholder to"
"4086"," an accounting or to take any action in court or elsewhere against"
"4087"," the Trust, the Trustees or any such Series, but entitles such"
"4088","representative only to the rights of said deceased, incapacitated,"
"4089"," dissolved, terminated or bankrupt Shareholder under this Declaration"
"4090"," of Trust.  Neither the Trust nor the Trustees, nor any officer,"
"4091","employee or agent of the Trust, shall have any power to bind"
"4092","personally any Shareholder, nor, except as specifically provided"
"4093"," herein, to call upon any Shareholder for the payment of any sum"
"4094"," of money other than such as the Shareholder may at any time"
"4095","personally agree to pay.  Each Share, when issued on the terms"
"4096","determined by the Board of Trustees, shall be fully paid and"
"4097"," nonassessable.  As provided in the DSTA, Shareholders shall"
"4098","be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability as"
"4099","that extended to stockholders of a private corporation organized"
"4100","for profit under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware."
"4101","Section 5.	Power of Board of Trustees to Make Tax Status Election."
"4102","  The Board of Trustees shall have the power, in its discretion, to"
"4103","make such elections as to the tax status of the Trust and any Series"
"4104"," as may be permitted or required under the Code, without the vote of"
"4105"," any Shareholder."
"4106","Section 6.	Establishment and Designation of Series and Classes."
"4107","  The establishment and designation of any Series or Class shall be"
"4108"," effective, without the requirement of Shareholder approval, upon"
"4109","the adoption of a resolution by not less than a majority of the"
"4110"," then Board of Trustees, which resolution shall set forth such"
"4111","establishment and designation whether directly in such resolutions"
"4112"," or by reference to, or approval of, another document that sets"
"4113"," forth the designation or otherwise identifies such Series or"
"4114"," Class, including any registration statement of the Trust and"
"4115","any amendment of this Declaration of Trust, and may provide,"
"4116","to the extent permitted by the DSTA, for rights, powers and duties"
"4117"," of such Series or Class (including variations in the relative"
"4118","rights and preferences as between the different Series and Classes)"
"4119"," otherwise than as provided herein.  Any action that may be taken by"
"4120"," the Board of Trustees with respect to any Series or Class, including"
"4121"," any addition, modification, division, combination, classification,"
"4122","reclassification, change of name or termination, may be made in the"
"4123","same manner as the establishment of such Series or Class."
"4124","Each Series shall be separate and distinct from any other Series,"
"4125"," separate and distinct records on the books of the Trust shall be"

"4128"," for separately from the assets and liabilities of the Trust or any"
"4129"," other Series.  Each Class of the Trust shall be separate and distinct"
"4130"," from any other Class of the Trust.  Each Class of a Series shall be"
"4131"," separate and distinct"
"4132","from any other Class of the Series.  As appropriate, in a manner"
"4133"," determined by the Board of Trustees, the liabilities belonging to"
"4134"," any such Class shall be held and accounted for separately from the"
"4135"," liabilities of the Trust, the Series or any other Class and separate"
"4136"," and distinct records on the books of the Trust for the Class shall"
"4137","be maintained for this purpose.  Subject to Article II hereof, each"
"4138","such Series shall operate as a separate and distinct investment medium,"
"4139"," with separately defined investment objectives and policies."
"4140","Shares of each Series (and Class where applicable) established and"
"4141"," designated pursuant to this Section 6, unless otherwise provided"
"4142"," to the extent permitted by the DSTA, in the resolution establishing"
"4143"," and designating such Series or Class, shall have the following"
"4144"," rights, powers and duties:"
"4145","(a)	Assets Held with Respect to a Particular Series.  All"
"4146","consideration"

"4153"," such proceeds in whatever form the same may be, shall irrevocably"
"4154"," be held with respect to that Series for all purposes, subject only"
"4155","to the rights of creditors with respect to that Series, and shall be"
"4156"," so recorded upon the books of account of the Trust.  Such"

"4158","thereof, from whatever source derived, including, without limitation,"
"4159"," any proceeds derived from the sale, exchange or liquidation of such"
"4160"," assets, and any funds or payments derived from any reinvestment of"
"4161"," such proceeds, in whatever form the same may be, are herein referred"
"4162"," to as assets held with respect to that Series.  In the event that"
"4163"," there are any assets, income, earnings, profits and proceeds thereof,"
"4164"," funds or payments"
"4165","which are not readily identifiable as assets held with respect to any"
"4166"," particular Series (collectively General Assets), the Board of"

"4168"," Trustees, shall allocate such General Assets to, between or"
"4169","among any one or more of the Series in such manner and on such"
"4170","basis as the Board of Trustees, in its sole discretion, deems"
"4171"," fair and equitable, and any General Asset so allocated to a"
"4172"," particular Series shall be held with respect to that Series."
"4173"," Each such allocation by or under the direction of the Board of"
"4174"," Trustees shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders"
"4175","of all Series for all purposes."

"4180"," contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to such Series."
"4181","  Such liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges, reserves"
"4182","and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with"
"4183"," respect to a particular Series are herein referred to as liabilities
 held with respect to that Series.  Any liabilities, debts,"

"4187"," shall be allocated by the Board of Trustees, or an appropriate officer"
"4188"," as determined by the Board of Trustees, to and among any one or more"
"4189"," of the Series in such manner and on such basis as the Board of Trustees"
"4190"," in its sole discretion deems fair and equitable.  Each allocation of"

"4196"," Series, or who have a"
"4197","claim or contract that has been allocated to any particular Series,"
"4198","shall look exclusively to the assets of that particular Series for"
"4199"," payment of such credit, claim, or contract.  In the absence of"
"4200","an express contractual agreement so limiting the claims of such"
"4201","creditors, claimants and contract providers, each creditor, claimant"
"4202"," and contract provider shall be deemed nevertheless to have impliedly"

"4549","directors, shareholders, partners or employees of the Trustees,"
"4550"," if any, shall be expected to devote their full time to the"
"4551"," performance of such duties.  The Trustees, or any Affiliate,"

"5189","liability, expense or obligation may be allocated and charged by"
"5190"," the Board of Trustees between"
"5191","or among the Trust and/or any one or more Series (and Classes) in"

"5209"," upon the Board of Trustees to bring the subject action unless an"
"5210"," effort to cause the Board of Trustees to bring such an action is"
"5211","not likely to succeed.  For purposes of this Section 4, a demand on"
"5212"," the Board of Trustees shall only be deemed not likely to succeed"
"5213","and therefore excused if a majority of the Board of Trustees, or a"
"5214"," majority of any committee established to consider the merits of"
"5215","such action, is composed of Trustees who are not independent
 trustees (as such term is defined in the DSTA)."

"5226","Trustees shall be entitled to retain counsel or other advisors"
"5227"," in considering the merits of the request and shall require an"
"5228"," undertaking by the Shareholders making such request to reimburse"
"5229"," the Trust for the expense of any such advisors in the event that"
"5230"," the Board of Trustees determine not to bring such action."
"5231","For purposes of this Section 4, the Board of Trustees may designate"

"5475"," Act, the Board of Trustees, by vote of a majority of the Trustees,"
