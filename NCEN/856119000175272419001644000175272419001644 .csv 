"1877","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1878","To the Board of Trustees of Franklin Value Investors Trust"
"1879","and Shareholders of Franklin Balance Sheet Investment Fund,"
"1880","Franklin MicroCap Value Fund, and Franklin Small Cap Value Fund:"
"1881","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"1882","of Franklin Balance Sheet Investment Fund, Franklin MicroCap Value Fund,"
"1883","and Franklin Small Cap Value Fund (three funds constituting"
"1884","Franklin Value Investors Trust (the Trust)) (collectively, the Funds)"
"1885","as of and for the year ended October 31, 2018, in accordance with the"
"1886","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"1887","we considered the Trust's internal control over financial reporting,"
"1888","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"1889","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1890","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN,"
"1891","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"1892","of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"1893","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1894","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"1895","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1896","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1897","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"1898","costs of controls. A company's internal control over financial"
"1899","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1900","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1901","of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1902","accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles."
"1903","A company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1904","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1905","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1906","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"1907","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1908","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"1909","with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"1910","and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"1911","authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)"
"1912","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1913","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"1914","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1915","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1916","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"1917","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"1918","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1919","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1920","procedures may deteriorate."
"1921","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1922","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"1923","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1924","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"1925","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"1926","over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1927","possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual"
"1928","or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"1929","on a timely basis."
"1930","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial"
"1931","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"1932","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that"
"1933","might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1934","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1935","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trust's internal control over"
"1936","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"1937","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as"
"1938","defined above as of October 31, 2018."
"1939","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1940","management and the Board of Trustees of Franklin Value Investors Trust"
"1941","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be"
"1942","and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"2002","TO THE CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE PROSPECTUS"
"2003","OF EACH OF THE FUNDS LISTED BELOW"
"2004","Franklin Value Investors Trust"
"2005","Franklin Balance Sheet Investment Fund"
"2006","Franklin MicroCap Value Fund"
"2007","Franklin Small Cap Value Fund"
"2008","Notice of Automatic Conversion of Class C Shares to"
"2009","Class A Shares after 10-Year Holding Period"
"2010","At Board meetings held on February 26 and 27, 2018,"
"2011","the Board of Trustees approved an automatic conversion"
"2012","feature for the Fund's Class C shares (which includes"
"2013","Class C1 shares as applicable) that will automatically convert"
"2014","shareholders' Class C shares into Class A shares of the same Fund"
"2015","after they have been held for 10 years. After conversion, your new"
"2016","shares will be subject to Class A shares' lower Rule 12b-1 fees."
"2017","The conversion feature will become effective on or about"
"2018","October 5, 2018.  Later that month Class C shares of the"
"2019","Fund that have been outstanding for 10 years or more will"
"2020","automatically convert to Class A shares of such Fund on the"
"2021"," basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes."
"2022","Thereafter, Class C shares of the Fund will convert"
"2023","automatically to Class A shares of such Fund on a monthly basis"
"2024","in the month of, or the month following, the 10-year anniversary"
"2025","of the Class C shares' purchase date. Class C shares of the Fund"
"2026"," acquired through automatic reinvestment of dividends or distributions"
"2027"," will convert to Class A shares of the Fund on the conversion date"
"2028","pro rata with the converting Class C shares of the Fund that were"
"2029","not acquired through reinvestment of dividends or distributions."
"2030","Shareholders will not pay a sales charge, including a contingent"
"2031","deferred sales charge, upon the conversion of their Class C shares"
"2032","to Class A shares pursuant to this conversion feature."
"2033","The automatic conversion of the Fund's Class C shares into"
"2034","Class A shares after the 10-year holding period is not"
"2035","expected to be a taxable event for federal income tax purposes."
"2036","Shareholders should consult with their tax advisor regarding"
"2037","the state and local tax consequences of such conversions."
"2038","Class C shares held through a financial intermediary in an"
"2039","omnibus account will be converted into Class A shares only if"
"2040"," the intermediary can document that the shareholder has met the"
"2041","required holding period. In certain circumstances, when shares are"
"2042"," invested through retirement plans, omnibus accounts, and in"
"2043","certain other instances, the Fund and its agents may not have"
"2044"," transparency into how long a shareholder has held Class C shares"
"2045","for purposes of determining whether such Class C shares are"
"2046","eligible for automatic conversion into Class A shares and the"
"2047","financial intermediary may not have the ability to track purchases"
"2048","to credit individual shareholders' holding periods."
"2049","This primarily occurs when shares are invested through certain"
"2050"," record keepers for group retirement plans, where the intermediary"
"2051"," cannot track share aging at the participant level."
"2052","In these circumstances, the Fund will not be able to automatically"
"2053","convert Class C shares into Class A shares as described above."
"2054","In order to determine eligibility for conversion in these circumstances,"
"2055","it is the responsibility of the shareholder or their financial"
"2056"," intermediary to notify the Fund that the shareholder is eligible"
"2057","for the conversion of Class C shares to Class A shares, and the"
"2058","shareholder or their financial intermediary may be required to"
"2059","maintain and provide the Fund with records that substantiate the"
"2060"," holding period of Class C shares. It is the financial"
"2061","intermediary's (and not the Fund's) responsibility to keep"
"2062","records and to ensure that the shareholder is credited with"
"2063","the proper holding period. Please consult with your financial"
"2064","intermediary about your shares' eligibility for this conversion feature."
"2065","Also effective October 5, 2018, new accounts or plans may not be"
"2066","eligible to purchase Class C shares of the Fund if it is determined"
"2067"," that the intermediary cannot track shareholder holding periods"
"2068","to determine whether a shareholder's Class C shares are eligible"
"2069","for conversion to Class A shares.  Accounts or plans (and their"
"2070","successor, related and affiliated plans) that have Class C shares"
"2071","of the Fund available to participants on or before October 5, 2018,"
"2072"," may continue to open accounts for new participants in such share"
"2073","class and purchase additional shares in existing participant accounts."
"2074"," The Fund has no responsibility for overseeing, monitoring or"
"2075"," implementing a financial intermediary's process for determining"
"2076"," whether a shareholder meets the required holding period for conversion."
"2077","A financial intermediary may sponsor and/or control accounts, programs"
"2078"," or platforms that impose a different conversion schedule or different"
"2079","eligibility requirements for the conversion of Class C shares"
"2080","into Class A shares. In these cases, Class C shareholders may convert"
"2081","to Class A shares under the policies of the financial intermediary"
"2082","and the conversion may be structured as an exchange of Class C shares"
"2083"," for Class A shares of the same Fund. Financial intermediaries"
"2084","will be responsible for making such exchanges in those circumstances."
"2085","Please consult with your financial intermediary if you have any"
"2086"," questions regarding your shares' conversion from Class C shares"
"2087","to Class A shares."

"2618","No certificates certifying the ownership of Shares shall"

"2820","charged to and borne solely by such Class.  The"
"2821","bearing of expenses solely by a particular Class of Shares"
"2822","may be appropriately reflected (in a manner determined by the"
"2823","Board of Trustees) and may affect the net asset value"
"2824","attributable to,"
"2825","and the dividend, redemption and liquidation rights of, such Class."

"2841","Series shall be effected by the Trust other than from the assets"
"2842","held with respect to such Series, nor, except as specifically"
"2843","provided in Section 7 of this Article III, shall any Shareholder"
"2844","of any particular Series otherwise have any right or claim against"
"2845","the assets held with respect to any other Series or the"
"2846","Trust generally"
"2847","except, in the case of a right or claim against the assets"
"2848","held with respect to any other Series, to the extent that such"
"2849","Shareholder has such a right or claim hereunder as a Shareholder"
"2850","of such other Series.  The Board of Trustees shall have"
"2851","full discretion, to the extent not inconsistent with the 1940 Act,"
"2852","to determine which items shall be treated as income and which items"
"2853","as capital; and each such determination and allocation shall be"
"2854","conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders."
"2855","(d)	Voting.  All Shares of the Trust entitled to vote on a"
"2856","matter shall vote in the aggregate without differentiation"
"2857","between the Shares of the separate Series, if any, or separate"
"2858","Classes, if any; provided that (i) with respect to any matter that"

"2862","that affects only the interests of some but not all Classes,"
"2863","then only the Shares of such affected Classes, voting separately,"
"2864","shall be entitled to vote on the matter; and (iii)"
"2865","notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any matter as to"
"2866","which the 1940 Act or other applicable law or regulation"
"2867","requires voting, by Series or by Class, then the Shares of the"
"2868","Trust shall vote as prescribed in such law or regulation."

"2874","whole Share of the Trust or such Series, including rights with"
"2875","respect to voting, receipt of dividends and distributions,"
"2876","redemption of Shares and dissolution of the Trust or that Series."
"2877","(g)	Exchange Privilege.  The Board of Trustees shall have the"

"2886","otherwise required by applicable law, to combine the assets and"
"2887","liabilities held with respect to any two or more Series into"
"2888","assets and liabilities held with respect to a single Series;"
"2889","provided that upon completion of such combination of Series,"
"2890","the interest of each Shareholder, in the combined assets and"
"2891","liabilities held with respect to the combined Series shall"
"2892","equal the interest of each such Shareholder in the aggregate"
"2893","of the assets and liabilities held with respect to the"
"2894","Series that were combined."
"2895","	The Board of Trustees shall have the authority,"
"2896","without the approval, vote or consent of the Shareholders of"

"2917","a meeting of the Shareholders of such Class, provided a quorum of"
"2918","Shareholders of such Class are present, or by action of the"

"3828","such request to reimburse the Trust for the expense of any such"

"4483","Section 3806 of the DSTA."
"4484","Section 7.	WAIVER OF NOTICE BY CONSENT OF ABSENT SHAREHOLDERS."
"4485","Attendance by a Shareholder, in person or by proxy, at a meeting"
"4486","shall constitute a waiver of notice of that meeting with respect"
"4487","to that Shareholder, except when the Shareholder attends the"
"4488","meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning"
"4489","of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the"
"4490"," meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Whenever notice of"
"4491"," a Shareholders' meeting is required to be given to a Shareholder"
"4492","under the Declaration of Trust or these By-Laws, a written waiver"
"4493","thereof, executed before or after the time notice is required to be"
"4494"," given, by such Shareholder or his or her attorney thereunto"
"4495","authorized, shall be deemed equivalent to such notice.  The waiver"

"4497"," transacted at, the meeting."
"4498","Section 8.	PROXIES.  Every Shareholder entitled to vote for"
"4499","Trustees or on any other matter that may properly come before the"
"4500","meeting shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or"
"4501","more agents authorized by a written proxy executed by the Shareholder"
"4502"," and filed with the secretary of the Trust before being voted;"
"4503","provided, that an alternative to the execution of a written proxy"
"4504"," may be permitted as described in the next paragraph of this Section 8."
"4505"," A proxy shall be deemed executed if the Shareholder's name is"
"4506","placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting,"
"4507","telegraphic or electronic transmission"
"4508"," (as defined in Section 3806 of the DSTA) or otherwise)"
"4509"," by the Shareholder or the Shareholder's attorney-in-fact."
"4510","  A valid proxy that does not state that it is irrevocable shall"
"4511","continue in full force and effect unless (i) revoked by the person"
"4512"," executing it before the vote pursuant to that proxy is taken"
"4513","(a) by a writing delivered to the Trust stating that the proxy is revoked,"
"4514"," (b) by a subsequent proxy executed by such person,"
"4515","(c) attendance at the meeting and voting in person by the"
"4516"," person executing that proxy, or (d) revocation by such person"
"4517","using any electronic, telephonic, computerized or other alternative"
"4518","means authorized by the Trustees for authorizing the proxy to act; or"
"4519","(ii) written notice of the death or incapacity of the maker of that"
"4520","proxy is received by the Trust before the vote pursuant to that proxy"
"4521"," is counted; provided, however, that no proxy shall be valid after the"
"4522","expiration of eleven (11) months from the date of the proxy unless"
"4523","otherwise expressly provided in the proxy.  The revocability of a"
"4524","proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed"
"4525"," by the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the"
"4526","State of Delaware. Unless revoked, any proxy given in connection"
"4527"," with a postponed or adjourned meeting for which a new record date"
"4528","is fixed shall continue to be valid so long as the Shareholder"
"4529","giving such proxy is a Shareholder of record on such new such record date."
"4530","With respect to any Shareholders' meeting, the Board, or, in case the"
"4531","Board does not act, the president, any vice president or the secretary,"
"4532","may permit proxies by electronic transmission (as defined in"
"4533","Section 3806 of the DSTA), telephonic, computerized, telecommunications"
"4534"," or other reasonable alternative to the execution of a written instrument"
"4535"," authorizing the holder of the proxy to act.  A proxy with respect to"
"4536","Shares held in the name of two or more Persons shall be valid if executed,"
"4537","or a permitted alternative to execution is used, by any one of them unless,"
"4538"," at or prior to the exercise of the proxy, the secretary of the Trust"
"4539","receives a specific written notice to the contrary from any one of them."
"4540"," A proxy purporting to be by or on behalf of a Shareholder shall be deemed"
"4541"," valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise and the"
"4542","burden of proving invalidity shall rest with the challenger."
"4543","Unless otherwise specifically limited by their terms, proxies"
"4544","shall entitle the Shareholder to vote at any adjournment or"
"4545","postponement of a Shareholder meeting."
"4546","Subject to the provisions of the DSTA, the Declaration of"
"4547","Trust or these By-Laws, the General Corporation Law of the"
"4548","State of Delaware relating to proxies, and judicial interpretations"
"4549"," thereunder, shall govern all matters concerning the giving,"
"4550"," voting or validity of proxies, as if the Trust were a"
"4551","Delaware corporation and the Shareholders were stockholders"
"4552"," of a Delaware corporation."
"4553","Section 9.	INSPECTORS.  Before any meeting of Shareholders,"
"4554","the chairperson of the Board, or in the absence of the chairperson"
"4555","of the Board, the president of the Trust, or in the absence of the"
"4556"," president, any vice president or other authorized officer of the Trust,"
"4557"," may appoint any person other than nominees for office to act as"
"4558","inspector at the meeting or any adjournment.  If any person appointed"

"4561"," of the Board, the president of the Trust, or in the absence"
"4562"," of the president, any vice president or other authorized officer"
"4563"," of the Trust, shall appoint a person to fill the vacancy."

"4565","The inspector shall:"
"4566","(a)	determine the number of Shares and the voting power of each,"

"4585","the Declaration of Trust, the Trustee(s) then in office, regardless"
"4586","of the number and even if less than a quorum, shall have all the powers"
"4587"," granted to the Board and shall discharge all the duties imposed upon"
"4588","the Board by the Declaration of Trust and these By-Laws as though such"
