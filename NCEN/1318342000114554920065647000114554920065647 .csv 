"1083","in accordance with the standards of the"

"1085","Board (United States), we considered"
"1086","their internal control over financial"

"1097","Accordingly, we express no such"
"1098","opinion."
"1099","The management of the Fund is"
"1100","responsible for establishing and"
"1101","maintaining effective internal control"
"1102","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"1103","this responsibility, estimates and"
"1104","judgments by management are required"
"1105","to assess the expected benefits and"

"1136","Because of inherent limitations, internal"

"1146","A deficiency in internal control over"

"1156","that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"1157","a material misstatement of the companys"
