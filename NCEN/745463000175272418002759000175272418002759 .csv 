"763","and for the year ended September 30, 2018, in accordance with"
"764","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"765","(United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Fund's internal"
"766","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"767","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"768","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"769","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"770","N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"771","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"772","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"773","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"774","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"775","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"776","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"777","related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"778","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"779","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"780","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"781","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"782","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"783","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"

"785","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"786","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"

"792","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"793","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets"
"794","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"795","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"

"798","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"799","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"800","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"801","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"802","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"803","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"804","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"

"807","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
