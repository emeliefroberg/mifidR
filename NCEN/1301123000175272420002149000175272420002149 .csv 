"759","ended July 31, 2019, in accordance with the standards of"
"760","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"761","States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"762","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"763","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"764","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"765","the financial statements and to comply with the"
"766","requirements of Form N CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"767","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"768","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"769","we express no such opinion."
"770","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"771","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"772","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"773","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"774","are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"775","costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"776","financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"777","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"778","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"779","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"780","generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"781","A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"782","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"783","to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"784","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"785","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"786","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"787","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"788","in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures"
"789","of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"790","authorizations of management and directors of the funds;"
"791","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"792","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"793","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"794","effect on the financial statements."
"795","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"796","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"797","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"798","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"799","that controls may become inadequate because of changes"
"800","in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with"
"801","the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"802","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"803","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"804","control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"805","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to"
"806","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"807","material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"808","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"809","reporting, such that there is reasonable possibility"
"810","that a material misstatement of the funds' annual or"
"811","interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"812","detected on a timely basis."
"813","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"814","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"815","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"816","all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"817","material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"818","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"819","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal"
"820","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"821","including controls over safeguarding securities that we"
"822","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as"
"823","of July 31, 2019."
"824","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"825","use of management and the Board of Trustees of the Funds"
"826","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"827","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"

"857","Advisors LLC filed an application on October 7, 2003, and"
"858","amendments on June 3, 2004, July 15, 2005, October 6,"
"859","2006 and December 15, 2006. Applicants requested an order"
"860","under section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Investment Company Act of 1940"
"861","(the Act) granting an exemption from sections 12(d)(1)(A)"
"862","and (B) of the Act and under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the"
"863","Act granting an exemption from section 17(a) of the Act. The"
"864","order would permit certain management investment companies and"
"865","unit investment trusts registered under the Act to acquire"
"866","shares of certain open-end management investment companies and"
"867","unit investment trusts registered under the Act, including"
"868","those that operate as exchange-traded funds, that are outside"
"869","the same group of investment companies as the acquiring"
"870","investment companies."
"871","On December 14, 2006, a notice of the filing of the"
"872","application was issued (Investment Company Act Release No."
"873","27599). The notice gave interested persons an opportunity"
"874","to request a hearing and stated that an order disposing of"
"875","the application would be issued unless a hearing was ordered."
"876","No request for a hearing has been filed, and the Commission"
"877","has not ordered a hearing. The matter has been considered"
"878","and it is found, on the basis of the information set forth"
"879","in the application, as amended, that granting the requested"
"880","exemptions is appropriate in and consistent with the public"
"881","interest and consistent with the protection of investors"
"882","and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and"
"883","provisions of the Act."
"884","It is also found that the terms of the proposed"
"885","transactions are reasonable and fair and do not"
"886","involve overreaching, and the proposed transactions are"
"887","consistent with the policies of each registered investment"
"888","company concerned and with the general purposes of the Act."
"889","Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, that the relief requested under"
"890","section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act from sections 12(d)(1)(A)"
"891","and (B) of the Act and under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of"
