"1529","ended, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1530","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)"
"1531","(PCAOB), we considered the Fund's internal control"
"1532","over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1533","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1534","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1535","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"

"1537","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"1538","of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"1539","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1540","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"1541","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1542","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1543","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"1544","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1545","controls.  A fund's internal control over financial"

"1548","and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"1549","purposes in accordance with accounting principles"
"1550","generally accepted in the United States of America"

"1554","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1555","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"1556","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"

"1560","only in accordance with authorizations of management"

"1562","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1563","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"1564","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1565","statements."
"1566","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1567","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1568","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"

"1570","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"1571","changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance"
"1572","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1573","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1574","exists when the design or operation of a control does"
"1575","not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"1576","course of performing their assigned functions, to"
"1577","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A"

"1584","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
