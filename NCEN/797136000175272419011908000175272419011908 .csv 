"935","the United States of America (<B><I>&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;</I></B>). A company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes"
"936","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"937","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"938","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures"
"939","of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide"

"944","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
