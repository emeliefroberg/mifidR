"2058","Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"2059","First Investors Income Funds"
"2060","40 Wall Street"
"2061","New York, New York 10005"
"2062","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of First"
"2063","Investors Income Funds (comprising, respectively, the Balanced Income Fund,"
"2064","Floating Rate Fund, Fund For Income, Government Cash Management Fund,"
"2065","International Opportunities Bond Fund, Investment Grade Fund, Limited"
"2066","Duration Bond Fund and Strategic Income Fund) (the Funds), as of and"
"2067","for the year ended September 30, 2019, in accordance with the standards of"
"2068","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"2069","considered its internal control over financial reporting, including"
"2070","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"2071","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"2072","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"2073","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"2074","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"2075","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2076","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"2077","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.   In"
"2078","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"2079","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"2080","A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"2081","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"2082","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"2083","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2084","principles.   A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"2085","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"2086","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"2087","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"2088","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"2089","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"2090","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"2091","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"2092","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"2093","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"2094","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"2095","material effect on the financial statements."
"2096","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2097","may not prevent or detect misstatements.   Also, projections of any"
"2098","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"2099","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"2100","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2101","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"2102","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"2103","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"2104","detect misstatements on a timely basis.   A material weakness is a"
"2105","deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"2106","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"2107","material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial"
"2108","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
