"5126","the Tribune Company (&ldquo;Tribune&rdquo;) in 2007, when Tribune effected a leveraged buyout transaction (&ldquo;LBO&rdquo;) by"
"5127","which Tribune converted to a privately-held company. In his complaint, the plaintiff has alleged that, in connection with the LBO,"
"5128","Tribune insiders and shareholders were overpaid for their Tribune stock using financing that the insiders knew would, and ultimately"
"5129","did, leave Tribune insolvent. The plaintiff has asserted claims against certain insiders, major shareholders, professional advisers,"

"5150","their claims were preempted by Section 546(e) of the Bankruptcy Code&mdash;the statutory safe harbor for settlement payments. On"
"5151","April 12, 2016, the Plaintiffs in the SLCFC actions filed a petition seeking rehearing <I>en banc</I> before the appeals court."
"5152","On July 22, 2016, the appeals court denied the petition. On September 9, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari"
