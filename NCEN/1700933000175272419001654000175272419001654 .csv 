"563"," Report of Independent Registered Public"
"564","Accounting Firm"
"565","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"566","American Beacon Diversified Fund"
"567","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"568","statements of American Beacon Diversified Fund, a"
"569","series of American Beacon Institutional Funds Trust"
"570","(the Fund) as of October 31, 2018 and for the"
"571","year ended October 31, 2018, in accordance with"
"572","the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"573","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"574","Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"575","including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"576","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"577","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"578","financial statements and to comply with the"
"579","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the"
"580","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"581","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"582","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"583","such opinion."
"584","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"585","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"586","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"587","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"588","management are required to assess the expected"
"589","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's"
"590","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"591","designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"592","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"593","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"594","purposes in accordance with U.S. generally"
"595","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal"
"596","control over financial reporting includes those"
"597","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"598","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"599","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"600","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"601","reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"602","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"603","financial statements in accordance with U.S."
"604","generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"605","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"606","made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"607","management and trustees of the fund; and (3)"
"608","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"609","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"610","or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a"
"611","material effect on the financial statements."
"612","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"613","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"614","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"615","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"616","risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"617","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"618","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"619","deteriorate."
"620","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
