"1728","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1729","To the Board of Trustees of Franklin High Income Trust and"
"1730"," Shareholders of Franklin High Income Fund"
"1731","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"1732"," of Franklin High Income Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year"
"1733"," ended May 31, 2019, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1734"," Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we"
"1735","considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"1736","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1737","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"1738"," our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1739","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"1740"," an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"1741","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"1742","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"1743","over financial reporting."
"1744","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"1745","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1746","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"1747","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1748","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"1749","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"1750","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1751","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1752"," preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1753"," in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"1754"," A company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1755","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1756"," of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"1757"," the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"1758","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1759","necessary"
"1760"," to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"1761","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"1762","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"1763","accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"1764","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1765","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"1766"," or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material"
"1767"," effect on the financial statements."
"1768","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1769","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1770"," Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"1771","future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1772","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"1773","that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1774","procedures may deteriorate."
"1775","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1776","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1777","control does not allow management or employees,"
"1778","in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1779","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1780","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1781","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"1782","over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1783","possibility that a material misstatement of the company's"
"1784","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented"
"1785","or detected on a timely basis."
"1786","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"1787","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"1788","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1789","all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"1790","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"1791","established by the PCAOB. However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1792","in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and"
"1793","its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"1794","that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as"
"1795","of May 31, 2019."
