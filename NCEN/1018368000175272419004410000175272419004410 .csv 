"1047","Global Real Estate Investment Fund, Inc."
"1048","In planning and performing our audit of the"

"1090","or disposition of a company's assets that could have"
"1091","a material effect on the financial statements."
"1092","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1093","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1094","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1095","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"

"1097","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1098","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1099","deteriorate."
"1100","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1101","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1102","control does not allow management or employees,"
"1103","in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1104","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1105","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"1106","a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"1107","over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1108","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"1109","of the company's annual or interim financial"
"1110","statements will not be prevented or detected on a"

"1112","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control"

"1116","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1117","standards established by the Public Company"
"1118","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1119","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"1120","internal control over financial reporting and its"
