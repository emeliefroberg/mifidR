"4600","Funds have been named, and have received notice that they may be putative members of the proposed defendant class of shareholders,"
"4601","in a lawsuit filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on November 1, 2010, by the Official Committee"
"4602","of Unsecured Creditors of Tribune Company (the &quot;Committee&quot;). The Committee is seeking to recover all payments made to"
"4603","beneficial owners of common stock in connection with a leveraged buyout of the Tribune Company (&quot;LBO&quot;), including payments"
"4604","made in connection with a 2007 tender offer into which the Blue Chip and Equity Income Funds tendered their shares of common stock"
"4605","of the Tribune Company. On December 9, 2011, the Blue Chip Fund was reorganized into the Growth &amp; Income Fund pursuant to"
"4606","a Plan of Reorganization and Termination, whereby all of the assets of the Blue Chip Fund were transferred to the Growth &amp;"
"4607","Income Fund, the Growth &amp; Income Fund assumed all of the liabilities of the Blue Chip Fund, including any contingent liabilities"
"4608","with respect to pending or threatened litigation or actions, and shareholders of Blue Chip Fund became shareholders of Growth"
"4609","&amp; Income Fund. The adversary proceeding brought by the Committee has been transferred to the Southern District of New York"
"4610","and administratively consolidated with other similar suits as discussed below. In addition, on June 2, 2011, the Blue Chip and"
"4611","Equity Income Funds were named as defendants in a lawsuit brought in connection with the Tribune Company's LBO by Deutsche Bank"
"4612","Trust Company Americas, in its capacity as successor indenture trustee for a certain series of Senior Notes, Law Debenture Trust"
"4613","Company of New York, in its capacity as successor indenture trustee for a certain series of Senior Notes, and Wilmington Trust"
"4614","Company, in its capacity as successor indenture trustee for the PHONES Notes (together, the &quot;Bondholder Plaintiffs&quot;)"
"4615","in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The Blue Chip and Equity Income Funds have also been named in a similar suit filed"
"4616","on behalf of participants in Tribune defined-compensation plans (the &quot;Retiree Plaintiffs&quot;). As with the Bondholder Plaintiffs"
"4617","and the Committee, the Retiree Plaintiffs seek to recover payments of the proceeds of the LBO. (All of these suits have been removed"
"4618","to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and administratively consolidated with other substantially"
"4619","similar suits against other former Tribune shareholders (the &quot;MDL Proceeding&quot;)). On September 23, 2013, the Judge in"
"4620","the MDL Proceeding dismissed various state law constructive fraudulent transfer suits, resulting in the Funds being dismissed"
"4621","from the Bondholder and Retiree Plaintiffs' actions. On September 30, 2013, counsel for the plaintiffs in those suits appealed"
"4622","the MDL Judge's dismissal ruling to the Second Circuit. On March 24, 2016, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the MDL"
"4623","Judge's dismissal of the various state law constructive fraudulent transfer suits. In September 2016, the Bondholder and Retiree"
"4624","Plaintiffs petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Second Circuit's decision. The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on that"
"4625","request. On January 9, 2017, the Tribune MDL judge granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the Committee lawsuit alleging a"
"4626","single claim for intentional fraudulent transfer. An appeal of that decision to the Second Circuit is expected, but has not yet"
"4627","been made. The extent of the Funds' potential liability in any such actions has not been determined. The Funds have been advised"
"4628","by counsel that the Funds could be held liable to return all or part of the proceeds received in any of these actions, as well"
"4629","as interest and court costs, even though the Funds had no knowledge of, or participation in, any misconduct. The Equity Income"
"4630","Fund received proceeds of $1,526,566 in connection with the LBO, representing 0.24% of its net assets as of September 30, 2018."
"4631","The Blue Chip Fund received proceeds of $790,772 in connection with the LBO, representing 0.04% of the net assets of Growth &amp;"
"4632","Income Fund as of September 30, 2018. The Equity Income and Growth &amp; Income Funds cannot predict the outcomes of these proceedings,"
"4633","and thus have not accrued any of the amounts sought in the various actions in the accompanying financial statements.</P>"
