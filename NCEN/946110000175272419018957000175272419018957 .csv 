"1545","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"1546","Accounting Firm"
"1547","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"1548","Credit Suisse Opportunity Funds:"
"1549","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"1550","financial statements of Credit Suisse"
"1551","Floating Rate High Income Fund, Credit"
"1552","Suisse Multialternative Strategy Fund,"
"1553","Credit Suisse Strategic Income Fund and"
"1554","Credit Suisse Managed Futures Strategy"
"1555","Fund (the Funds), each a series of Credit"
"1556","Suisse Opportunity Funds, as of and for the"
"1557","year ended October 31, 2018, in accordance"
"1558","with the standards of the Public Company"
"1559","Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1560","States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"1561","control over financial reporting, including"
"1562","controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"1563","basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"1564","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1565","the financial statements and to comply with"
"1566","the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not"
"1567","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1568","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"1569","control over financial reporting."
"1570","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1571","Management of the Funds is responsible for"
"1572","establishing and maintaining effective"
"1573","internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"1574","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1575","judgments by management are required to"
"1576","assess the expected benefits and related"
"1577","costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"1578","over financial reporting is a process"
"1579","designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1580","regarding the reliability of financial"
"1581","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1582","statements for external purposes in"
"1583","accordance with generally accepted"
"1584","accounting principles.  A fund's internal"
"1585","control over financial reporting includes"
"1586","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"1587","to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1588","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1589","reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"1590","the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"1591","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1592","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1593","statements in accordance with generally"
"1594","accepted accounting principles, and that"
"1595","receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"1596","being made only in accordance with"
"1597","authorizations of management and trustees"
"1598","of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1599","assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1600","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,"
"1601","or disposition of the fund's assets that could"
"1602","have a material effect on the financial"
"1603","statements."
"1604","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1605","control over financial reporting may not"
"1606","prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"1607","projections of any evaluation of"
"1608","effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"1609","the risk that controls may become"
"1610","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"1611","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1612","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1613","A deficiency in internal control over"
"1614","financial reporting exists when the design or"
"1615","operation of a control does not allow"
"1616","management or employees, in the normal"
"1617","course of performing their assigned"
"1618","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"1619","on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"1620","deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,"
"1621","in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1622","such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"1623","that a material misstatement of the Funds'"
"1624","annual or interim financial statements will"
"1625","not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"1626","basis."
"1627","Our consideration of the Funds' internal"
"1628","control over financial reporting was for the"
"1629","limited purpose described in the first"
"1630","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"1631","disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"1632","that might be material weaknesses under"
"1633","standards established by the Public"
"1634","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1635","(United States).  However, we noted no"
"1636","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control"
"1637","over financial reporting and their operation,"
"1638","including controls over safeguarding"
"1639","securities that we consider to be a material"
"1640","weakness as defined above as of October 31,"
"1641","2018."
