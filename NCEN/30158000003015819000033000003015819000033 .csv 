"1109","<p style=margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;><font face=eyinterstate light lang=EN-US style=font-size:9.0pt;>The management of the Company is responsible for"

"1121","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1122","accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"1123","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"1124","authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"1125","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
