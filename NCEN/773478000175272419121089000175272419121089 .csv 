"1349","<TEXT>"
"1350","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1351","To the Board of Trustees of Franklin California Tax-Free"
"1352","Trust and Shareholders of Franklin California Intermediate-Term"
"1353","Tax-Free Income Fund"
"1354","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"1355","of Franklin California Intermediate-Term Tax-Free Income Fund"
"1356","(the Fund) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2019, in"
"1357","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1358","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Fund's"
"1359","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1360","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1361","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1362","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"1363","Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"1364","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"1365","financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion"
"1366","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"1367","financial reporting."
"1368","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1369","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1370","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1371","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1372","related costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"1373","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1374","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1375","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1376","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"1377","A company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1378","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1379","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1380","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"1381","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1382","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"1383","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1384","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only"
"1385","in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"1386","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1387","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1388","use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"1389","material effect on the financial statements."
"1390","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1391","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1392","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1393","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"1394","because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"1395","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1396","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1397","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"1398","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1399","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"1400","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1401","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1402","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1403","misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial"
"1404","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1405","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1406","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1407","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1408","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"1409","weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB. However, we"
"1410","noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1411","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1412","securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as defined"
"1413","above as of June 30, 2019."
"1414","This report is intended solely for the information and use of the"
"1415","Board of Trustees of Franklin California Tax-Free Trust and the"
"1416","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
