"14910","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"14911","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"14912","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"14913","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"

"14918","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"14919","statements and financial highlights for external"
"14920","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"

"14924","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"

"14935","that could have a material effect on the financial"
"14936","statements and financial highlights."
"14937","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"14938","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"14939","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"14940","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"14941","that controls may become inadequate because of changes"
"14942","in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with"
"14943","the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"14944","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"14945","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"

"14948","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"14949","A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
