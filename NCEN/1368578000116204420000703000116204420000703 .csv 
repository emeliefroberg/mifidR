"372","                 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"373"," To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"374","AINN Fund, a Series of MSS Series Trust"
"375","In  planning  and  performing  our audit of the financial statements of the AINN"
"376","Fund, a series of MSS Series Trust  (the  Fund) as of and for the period ended"
"377","June 3, 2019 (commencement of operations) through  May  31,  2020, in accordance"
"378","with  the  standards  of the Public Company Accounting Oversight  Board  (United"
"379","States)  (PCAOB), we considered  the  Fund's  internal  control  over  financial"
"380","reporting,  including  controls  over  safeguarding  securities,  as a basis for"
"381","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our  opinion  on"
"382","the  financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but"
"383","not for  the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"384","internal control  over  financial  reporting.   Accordingly,  we express no such"
"385","opinion."
"386","The  management  of  the  Fund  is responsible for establishing and  maintaining"
"387","effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.   In  fulfilling  this"
"388","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"389","expected benefits and related costs of  controls.   A company's internal control"
"390","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide  reasonable  assurance"
"391","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"392","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"393","accounting  principles  (GAAP).   A  company's  internal  control over financial"
"394","reporting  includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that (1) pertain  to  the"
"395","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"396","the  transactions  and  dispositions of the assets of the company;  (2)  provide"
"397","reasonable assurance that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to permit"
"398","preparation  of  financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"399","and  expenditures of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with"
"400","authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the company; and (3) provide"
"401","reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  of  unauthorized"
"402","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material"
"403","effect on the financial statements."
"404","Because of its  inherent  limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"405","may not prevent or detect material  misstatements.   Also,  projections  of  any"
"406","evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future  periods  are subject to the risk that"
"407","controls may become inadequate because of changes in  conditions,  or  that  the"
"408","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"409","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"410","or  operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"411","course   of   performing   their   assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"412","misstatements  on  a  timely basis. A material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or"
"413","combination of deficiencies,  in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"414","that there is a reasonable possibility  that  a  material  misstatement  of  the"
"415","Fund's  annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"416","on a timely basis."
"417","Our consideration  of  the  Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"418","for  the  limited  purpose described  in  the  first  paragraph  and  would  not"
"419","necessarily disclose  all  deficiencies  in internal control that might material"
"420","weaknesses under standards established by  the  PCAOB.   However,  we  noted  no"
"421","deficiencies  in  the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and their"
"422","operation, including  controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"423","be a material weakness as defined above as of May 31, 2020."
"424","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"425","Board of Trustees of the  AINN  Fund,  a  Series  of  MSS  Series  Trust and the"
"426","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should  not  be"
"427","used by anyone other than these specified parties."
