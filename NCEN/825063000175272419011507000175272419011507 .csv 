"5383","EXHIBIT ITEM: Copies of any material amendments to"
"5384","the registrant's charter or by-laws"
"5385","Amendment Effective February 1, 2018"
"5386","To the By-Laws of"
"5387","Franklin Mutual Series Funds"
"5388","(the Trust)"
"5389","WHEREAS, Article VIII, Section 2 of the By-Laws provides that"
"5390","the By-Laws may be amended by the Board of Trustees; and"
"5391","WHEREAS, by resolutions adopted October 23, 2017 at a meeting"
"5392","of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Board of Trustees unanimously"
"5393","authorized the By-Laws to be amended as set forth below."
"5394","NOW THEREFORE, the By-Laws are hereby amended as follows:"
"5395","1.	ARTICLE VII, Sections 3, 4 and 6 are replaced in"
"5396","their entirety with the following:"
"5397","*  *  *  *  *  *"
"5398","Section 3.	CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES.  No certificate or"
"5399"," certificates for Shares shall be issued to Shareholders and"
"5400"," no Shareholder shall have the right to demand or require that"
"5401","a certificate for Shares be issued to it.  The Trust shall"
"5402","adopt and use a system of issuance, recordation and transfer"
"5403","of its shares by electronic or other means."
"5404","Section 4.	LOST CERTIFICATES.  No new certificate for"
"5405","Shares shall be issued to replace an old certificate that"
"5406","is surrendered to the Trust for cancellation.  In case any"
"5407"," Share certificate or certificate for any other security is"
"5408","lost, stolen, or destroyed, such certificate shall be"
"5409","cancelled and the ownership of an uncertificated Share"
"5410","shall be recorded upon the books of the Trust, on such"
"5411","terms and conditions as the Board may require, including a"
"5412","provision for indemnification of the Board and the Trust"
"5413","secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to"
"5414","protect the Trust and the Board against any claim that may"
"5415","be made against either, including any expense or liability on"
"5416","account of the alleged loss, theft, or destruction of the certificate."
"5417","*  *  *  *  *  *"
"5418","Section 6.	TRANSFERS OF SHARES.  Shares are transferable,"
"5419","if authorized by the Declaration of Trust, only on the record books"
"5420","of the Trust by the Person in whose name such Shares are registered,"
"5421","or by his or her duly authorized attorney-in-fact or representative."
"5422"," Upon receipt of proper transfer instructions from the registered"
"5423","owner of certificated Shares, and upon the surrender for cancellation"
"5424","of such certificates representing the number of Shares to be"
"5425","transferred with an assignment and power of transfer endorsed"
"5426","thereon or attached thereto, duly executed, with such proof"
"5427","of the authenticity of the signature as the Trust or its"
"5428","agents may reasonably require, the Trust shall cancel the"
"5429","old certificate and record the transaction and ownership of"
"5430","uncertificated Shares upon the books of the Trust.  Upon"
"5431","receipt of proper transfer instructions from the registered"
"5432","owner of uncertificated Shares, such uncertificated Shares"
"5433","shall be transferred on the record books to the Person"
"5434","entitled thereto.  The Trust, its transfer agent or other"
"5435","duly authorized agents may refuse any requested transfer of"
"5436"," Shares, or request additional evidence of authority to safeguard"
"5437","the assets or interests of the Trust or of its Shareholders, in"
"5438"," their sole discretion.  In all cases of transfer by an"
"5439","attorney-in-fact, the original power of attorney, or an"
"5440","official copy thereof duly certified, shall be deposited"
"5441","and remain with the Trust, its transfer agent or other duly"
"5442","authorized agent.  In case of transfers by executors,"
"5443","administrators, guardians or other legal representatives,"
"5444","duly authenticated evidence of their authority shall be"
"5445","presented to the Trust, its transfer agent or other duly"
"5446","authorized agent, and may be required to be deposited and"
"5447","remain with the Trust, its transfer agent or other duly"
"5448","authorized agent."
"5449","Adopted and approved as of October 23, 2017 by the Board of Trustees."

"5512","TO THE CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE PROSPECTUS"
"5513","OF EACH OF THE FUNDS LISTED BELOW"
"5514","Franklin Mutual Series Funds"
"5515","Franklin Mutual Beacon Fund"
"5516","Franklin Mutual European Fund"
"5517","Franklin Mutual Financial Services Fund"
"5518","Franklin Mutual Global Discovery Fund"
"5519","Franklin Mutual International Fund"
"5520","Franklin Mutual Quest Fund"
"5521","Franklin Mutual Shares Fund"
"5522","Notice of Automatic Conversion of Class C Shares to Class A Shares after"
"5523","10-Year Holding Period"
"5524","At Board meetings held on February 26 and 27, 2018, the Board of Trustees"
"5525","approved an automatic conversion feature for the Fund's Class C shares"
"5526","(which includes Class C1 shares as applicable) that will automatically"
"5527","convert shareholders' Class C shares into Class A shares of the same Fund"
"5528","after they have been held for 10 years. After conversion, your new shares"
"5529","will be subject to Class A shares' lower Rule 12b-1 fees. The conversion"
"5530","feature will become effective on or about October 5, 2018.  Later that"
"5531","month Class C shares of the Fund that have been outstanding for 10 years"
"5532","or more will automatically convert to Class A shares of such Fund on the"
"5533","basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes. Thereafter,"
"5534","Class C shares of the Fund will convert automatically to Class A shares"
"5535","of such Fund on a monthly basis in the month of, or the month following,"
"5536","the 10-year anniversary of the Class C shares' purchase date. Class C"
"5537","shares of the Fund acquired through automatic reinvestment of dividends"
"5538","or distributions will convert to Class A shares of the Fund on the"
"5539","conversion date pro rata with the converting Class C shares of the Fund"
"5540","that were not acquired through reinvestment of dividends or distributions."
"5541","Shareholders will not pay a sales charge, including a contingent deferred"
"5542","sales charge, upon the conversion of their Class C shares to Class A shares"
"5543","pursuant to this conversion feature. The automatic conversion of the"
"5544","Fund's Class C shares into Class A shares after the 10-year holding period"
"5545","is not expected to be a taxable event for federal income tax purposes."
"5546","Shareholders should consult with their tax advisor regarding the state and"
"5547","local tax consequences of such conversions."
"5548","Class C shares held through a financial intermediary in an omnibus account"
"5549","will be converted into Class A shares only if the intermediary can document"
"5550","that the shareholder has met the required holding period. In certain"
"5551","circumstances, when shares are invested through retirement plans, omnibus"
"5552","accounts, and in certain other instances, the Fund and its agents may not"
"5553","have transparency into how long a shareholder has held Class C shares for"
"5554","purposes of determining whether such Class C shares are eligible for"
"5555","automatic conversion into Class A shares and the financial intermediary"
"5556","may not have the ability to track purchases to credit individual"
"5557","shareholders' holding periods.  This primarily occurs when shares are"
"5558","invested through certain record keepers for group retirement plans, where"
"5559","the intermediary cannot track share aging at the participant level.  In"
"5560","these circumstances, the Fund will not be able to automatically convert"
"5561","Class C shares into Class A shares as described above. In order to"
"5562","determine eligibility for conversion in these circumstances, it is the"
"5563","responsibility of the shareholder or their financial intermediary to"
"5564","notify the Fund that the shareholder is eligible for the conversion of"
"5565","Class C shares to Class A shares, and the shareholder or their financial"
"5566","intermediary may be required to maintain and provide the Fund with records"
"5567","that substantiate the holding period of Class C shares. It is the financial"
"5568","intermediary's (and not the Fund's) responsibility to keep records and to"
"5569","ensure that the shareholder is credited with the proper holding period."
"5570","Please consult with your financial intermediary about your shares'"
"5571","eligibility for this conversion feature."
"5572","Also effective October 5, 2018, new accounts or plans may not be eligible"
"5573","to purchase Class C shares of the Fund if it is determined that the"
"5574","intermediary cannot track shareholder holding periods to determine whether"
"5575","a shareholder's Class C shares are eligible for conversion to Class A"
"5576","shares.  Accounts or plans (and their successor, related and affiliated"
"5577","plans) that have Class C shares of the Fund available to participants on or"
"5578","before October 5, 2018, may continue to open accounts for new participants"
"5579","in such share class and purchase additional shares in existing participant"
"5580","accounts.  The Fund has no responsibility for overseeing, monitoring or"
"5581","implementing a financial intermediary's process for determining whether a"
"5582","shareholder meets the required holding period for conversion."
"5583","A financial intermediary may sponsor and/or control accounts, programs or"
"5584","platforms that impose a different conversion schedule or different"
"5585","eligibility requirements for the conversion of Class C shares into Class A"
"5586","shares. In these cases, Class C shareholders may convert to Class A shares"
"5587","under the policies of the financial intermediary and the conversion may be"
"5588","structured as an exchange of Class C shares for Class A shares of the same"
"5589","Fund. Financial intermediaries will be responsible for making such"
"5590","exchanges in those circumstances. Please consult with your financial"
"5591","intermediary if you have any questions regarding your shares' conversion"
"5592","from Class C shares to Class A shares."

"5601","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"5602","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"5603","Franklin Mutual Series Funds:"
"5604","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"5605"," of Franklin Mutual Shares Fund, Franklin Mutual Quest Fund,"
"5606","Franklin Mutual Beacon Fund, Franklin Mutual Global Discovery Fund,"
"5607","Franklin Mutual European Fund, Franklin Mutual Financial Services Fund,"
"5608","and Franklin Mutual International Fund (seven funds comprising"
"5609","Franklin Mutual Series Funds) (collectively, the  Funds) as"
"5610","of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, in accordance with"
"5611"," the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"5612","Board (United States), we considered the Funds internal"
"5613","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"5614","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"5615","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"5616","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"5617","Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"5618","on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"5619","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"5620","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"5621","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"5622","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"5623","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"5624","related costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"5625","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"5626","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"5627","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"5628","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"5629","A company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"5630","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"5631","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"5632","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"5633","the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"5634","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"5635","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"5636","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"5637","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"5638","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"5639","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"5640","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"5641","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"5642","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"5643","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"5644","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"5645","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"5646","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"5647","procedures may deteriorate."
"5648","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"5649","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"5650","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"5651","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness"
"5652","is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"5653","over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"5654","that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial"
"5655","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"5656","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"5657","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"5658","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"5659","control that might be material weaknesses under standards established"
"5660","by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"5661","However, we noted the following deficiency involving the control"
"5662","environment and its operation that we consider to be a material"
"5663","weakness as defined above relevant for the Funds. This deficiency"
"5664","was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of the"
"5665","procedures to be performed in our audits of the financial statements"
"5666","of the Funds for the year ended December 31, 2018, and this report"
"5667","does not affect our reports on the financial statements of the Funds"
"5668","dated February 20, 2019."
"5669","Management brought to our attention a control deficiency related to"
"5670","the Market Level Fair Value (MLFV) process which is used to determine"
"5671","which foreign portfolio equity securities should have adjusted values"
"5672","based on a fair value factor provided by various pricing vendors"
"5673","within the Funds. The resulting errors on the valuation of certain"
"5674","foreign portfolio equity securities on certain days where a factor"
"5675","should have been applied according to the pricing policies and"
"5676","procedures were the result of a deficiency in the operating"
"5677","effectiveness of a control in management's process, which is designed"
"5678","to have an independent review performed over the prepared trigger sheet"
"5679","in sufficient detail such that any breaches would be escalated timely"
"5680","to the valuation committee's attention.  The resulting errors would"
"5681","impact the valuation of investments and the corresponding change in"
"5682","unrealized gain/loss on the days when a fair value factor was not"
"5683","correctly applied to the foreign portfolio equity securities' price on"
"5684","that day. Management also has represented it has enhanced its"
"5685","procedures around the level of review performed over its MLFV process"
"5686","and daily trigger sheets.  This material weakness will not be"
"5687","considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a"
"5688","sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through"
"5689","testing, that these controls are operating effectively."
"5690","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"5691","management and Board of Trustees of Franklin Mutual Series Funds and"
"5692","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"5693","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"6128","ARTICLE III SHARES"
"6129","Section 1.	Division of Beneficial Interest."
"6130","(a)	The beneficial interest in the Trust shall be divided into Shares, each"
"6131","Share without a par value.  The number of Shares in the Trust authorized"
"6132","hereunder, and of each Series and Class as may be established from time to"
"6133","time, is unlimited.  The Board of Trustees may authorize the division of"
"6134","Shares into separate Classes of Shares and into separate and distinct Series"
"6135","of Shares and the division of any Series into separate Classes of Shares in"
"6136","accordance with the 1940 Act.  The different Series and Classes shall be"
"6137","established and designated pursuant to Article III, Section 6 hereof.  If no"
"6138","separate Series or Classes of Series shall be established, the Shares shall"
"6139","have the rights, powers and duties provided for herein and in Article III,"
"6140","Section 6 hereof to the extent relevant and not otherwise provided for"
"6141","herein, and all references to Series and Classes shall be construed"
"6142","(as the context may require) to refer to the Trust."
"6143","(i)	The fact that the Trust shall have one or more established and"
"6144","designated Classes of the Trust, shall not limit the authority of the Board"
"6145","of Trustees to establish and designate additional Classes of the Trust.  The"
"6146","fact that one or more Classes of the Trust shall have initially been"
"6147","established and designated without any specific establishment or designation"
"6148","of a Series (i.e., that all Shares of the Trust are initially Shares of one"
"6149","or more Classes) shall not limit the authority of the Board of Trustees to"
"6150","later establish and designate a Series and establish and designate the Class"
"6151","or Classes of the Trust as Class or Classes, respectively, of such Series."
"6152","(ii)	The fact that a Series shall have initially been established and"
"6153","designated without any specific establishment or designation of Classes"
"6154","(i.e., that all Shares of such Series are initially of a single Class)"
"6155","shall not limit the authority of the Board of Trustees to establish and"
"6156","designate separate Classes of said Series.  The fact that a Series shall"
"6157","have more than one established and designated Class, shall not limit the"
"6158","authority of the Board of Trustees to establish and designate additional"
"6159","Classes of said Series."
"6160","(b)	The Board of Trustees shall have the power to issue authorized, but"
"6161","unissued Shares of the Trust, or any Series and Class thereof, from time to"
"6162","time for such consideration paid wholly or partly in cash, securities or"
"6163","other property, as may be determined from time to time by the Board of"
"6164","Trustees, subject to any requirements or limitations of the"
"6165","1940 Act.  The Board of Trustees, on behalf of the Trust, may acquire and"
"6166","hold as treasury shares, reissue for such consideration and on such terms"
"6167","as it may determine, or cancel, at its discretion from time to time, any"
"6168","Shares reacquired by the Trust.  The Board of Trustees may classify,"
"6169","reclassify or convert any unissued Shares or any Shares of the Trust or any"
"6170","Series or Class thereof, that were previously issued and are reacquired,"
"6171","into one or more Series or Classes that may be established and designated"
"6172","from time to time and, in connection therewith, cause"
"6173","some or all of the Shareholders of the Trust, such Series or Class to become"
"6174","Shareholders of such other Series or Class.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,"
"6175","the Trust and any Series thereof may acquire, hold, sell and otherwise deal"
"6176","in, for purposes of investment or otherwise, the Shares of any other Series"
"6177","of the Trust or Shares of the Trust, and such Shares shall not be deemed"
"6178","treasury shares or cancelled."
"6179","(c)	Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Article III, each Share"
"6180","shall entitle the holder to voting rights as provided in Article V hereof."
"6181","Shareholders shall have no preemptive or other right to subscribe for new or"
"6182","additional authorized, but unissued Shares or other securities issued by the"
"6183","Trust or any Series thereof.  The Board of Trustees may from time to time"
"6184","divide or combine the Shares of the Trust or any particular Series thereof"
"6185","into a greater or lesser number of Shares of the Trust or that Series,"
"6186","respectively.  Such division or combination shall not materially change the"
"6187","proportionate beneficial interests of the holders of Shares of the Trust or"
"6188","that Series, as the case may be, in the Trust Property at the time of such"
"6189","division or combination that is held with respect to the Trust or that"
"6190","Series, as the case may be."
"6191","(d)	Any Trustee, officer or other agent of the Trust, and any organization"
"6192","in which any such Person has an economic or other interest, may acquire, own,"
"6193","hold and dispose of Shares in the Trust or any Series and Class thereof,"
"6194","whether such Shares are authorized but unissued, or already outstanding, to"
"6195","the same extent as if such Person were not a Trustee, officer or other agent"
"6196","of the Trust; and the Trust or any Series may issue and sell and may"
"6197","purchase such Shares from any such Person or any such organization, subject"
"6198","to the limitations, restrictions or other provisions applicable to the sale"
"6199","or purchase of such Shares herein and the 1940 Act."
"6200","Section 2.	Ownership of Shares.  The ownership of Shares shall be recorded"
"6201","on the books of the Trust kept by the Trust or by a transfer or similar"
"6202","agent for the Trust, which books shall be maintained separately for the"
"6203","Shares of the Trust and each Series and each Class thereof that has been"
"6204","established and designated.  No certificates certifying the ownership of"
"6205","Shares shall be issued except as the Board of Trustees may otherwise"
"6206","determine from time to time.  The"
"6207","Board of Trustees may make such rules not inconsistent with the provisions"
"6208","of the 1940 Act as it considers appropriate for the"
"6209"," issuance of Share certificates,"
"6210","the transfer of Shares of the Trust and each Series and Class thereof, if"
"6211","any, and similar matters.  The record books of the Trust as kept by the"
"6212","Trust or any transfer or similar agent, as the case may be, shall be"
"6213","conclusive as to who"
"6214","are the Shareholders of the Trust and each Series and Class thereof and as"
"6215","to the number of Shares of the Trust and each Series and Class thereof held"
"6216","from time to time by each such Shareholder."
"6217","Section 3.	Sale of Shares.  Subject to the 1940 Act and applicable law,"
"6218","the Trust may sell its authorized but unissued Shares to such Persons, at such"
"6219","times, on such terms, and for such consideration as the Board of Trustees"
"6220","may from time to time authorize.  Each sale shall be credited to the"
"6221","individual purchaser's account in the form of full or fractional Shares of"
"6222","the Trust or such Series thereof (and Class thereof, if any), as the"
"6223","purchaser may select,"
"6224"," at the net asset value per Share, subject to Section 22 of the 1940 Act,"
"6225","and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder; provided, however, that"
"6226","the Board of Trustees may, in its sole discretion, permit the Principal"
"6227","Underwriter to impose a sales charge upon any such sale.  Every Shareholder"
"6228","by virtue of having become a Shareholder shall be bound by the terms of"
"6229","this Declaration of Trust."
"6230","Ownership of Shares shall not make any Shareholder a third-party beneficiary"
"6231","of any contract entered into by the Trust or any Series."
"6232","Section 4.	Status of Shares and Limitation of Personal Liability."
"6233","Shares shall be deemed to be personal property giving to Shareholders only"
"6234","the rights provided in this Declaration of Trust, the By-Laws, and under"
"6235","applicable law.  Ownership of Shares shall not entitle the Shareholder to"
"6236","any title in or to the whole or any part of the Trust Property or right to"
"6237","call for a partition or division of the same or for an accounting, nor shall"
"6238","the ownership of Shares constitute the Shareholders as partners.  Subject to"
"6239","Article VIII, Section 1 hereof, the death, incapacity, dissolution,"
"6240","termination, or bankruptcy of a Shareholder during the existence of the"
"6241","Trust and any Series thereof shall not operate to dissolve the Trust or any"
"6242","such Series, nor entitle the representative of any deceased, incapacitated,"
"6243","dissolved, terminated or bankrupt Shareholder to an accounting or to take any"
"6244","action in court or elsewhere against the Trust, the Trustees or any such"
"6245","Series, but entitles such representative only to the rights of said deceased,"
"6246","incapacitated, dissolved, terminated or bankrupt Shareholder under this"
"6247","Declaration of Trust.  Neither the Trust nor the Trustees, nor any officer,"
"6248","employee or agent of the Trust, shall have any power to bind personally any"
"6249","Shareholder, nor, except as specifically provided herein, to call upon any"
"6250","Shareholder for the payment of any sum of money other than such as the"
"6251","Shareholder may at any time personally agree to pay.  Each Share, when"
"6252","issued on the terms determined by the Board of Trustees, shall be fully"
"6253","paid and nonassessable.  As provided in the DSTA, Shareholders shall be"
"6254","entitled to the same limitation of personal liability as that extended to"
"6255","stockholders of a private corporation organized for profit under the General"
"6256","Corporation Law of the State of Delaware."
"6257","Section 5.	Power of Board of Trustees to Make Tax Status Election."
"6258","The Board of Trustees shall have the power, in its discretion, to make such"
"6259","elections as to the tax status of the Trust and any Series"
"6260","as may be permitted"
"6261","or required under the Code, without the vote of any Shareholder."
"6262","Section 6.	Establishment and Designation of Series and Classes."
"6263","The establishment and designation of any Series or Class shall be effective,"
"6264","without the requirement of Shareholder approval, upon the adoption of a"
"6265","resolution by not less than a majority of the then Board of Trustees, which"
"6266","resolution shall set forth such establishment and designation whether"
"6267","directly in such resolutions or by reference to, or approval of, another"
"6268","document that sets forth the designation or otherwise identifies such Series"
"6269","or Class, including any registration statement of the Trust and any amendment"
"6270","of this Declaration of Trust, and may provide, to the extent permitted by"
"6271","the DSTA, for rights, powers and duties of such Series or Class (including"
"6272","variations in the relative rights and preferences as between the different"
"6273","Series and Classes) otherwise than as provided herein.  Any action that may"
"6274","be taken by the Board of Trustees with respect to any Series or Class,"
"6275","including any addition, modification, division, combination, classification,"
"6276","reclassification, change of name or termination, may be made in the same"
"6277","manner as the establishment of such Series or Class."
"6278","Each Series shall be separate and distinct from any other Series, separate"
"6279","and distinct records on the books of the Trust shall be maintained for each"
"6280","Series, and the assets and"
"6281","liabilities belonging to any such Series shall be held and accounted for"

"6371","related to the distribution of, and other identified expenses that should or"
"6372","may properly be allocated to, the Shares of a particular Class may be"
"6373","charged to and borne solely by such Class.  The bearing of expenses solely"
"6374","by a particular Class of Shares may be appropriately reflected (in a manner"
"6375","determined by the Board of Trustees) and may affect the net asset value"
"6376","attributable to, and the dividend, redemption and liquidation rights of,"
"6377","such Class.  Each allocation of liabilities, debts, obligations, costs,"
"6378","charges, reserves and expenses by or under the direction of the Board of"
"6379","Trustees shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders of all"
"6380","Classes for all purposes. All Persons who have extended credit that has"
"6381","been allocated to a particular Class, or who have a claim or contract that"
"6382","has been allocated to any particular Class, shall look, and may be required"

"6395","the assets held with respect to any other Series, to the extent that such"
"6396","Shareholder has such a right or claim hereunder as a Shareholder of such"
"6397","other Series.  The Board of Trustees shall have full discretion, to the"
"6398","extent not inconsistent with the 1940 Act, to determine which items shall"
"6399","be treated as income and which items as capital; and each such determination"
"6400","and allocation shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders."
"6401","(d)	Voting.  All Shares of the Trust entitled to vote on a matter shall"
"6402","vote in the aggregate without differentiation between the Shares of the"
"6403","separate Series, if any, or"
"6404","separate Classes, if any; provided that (i) with respect to any matter that"

"6638","the foregoing, all actions and omissions of the Trustees shall be"
"6639","evaluated under the doctrine commonly referred to as the business
judgment rule, as defined and developed under Delaware law, to the same"
"6640","extent that the same actions or omissions of directors of a Delaware"

"7055","have reopened or the period specified above shall have expired (as to"
"7056","which, in the absence of an official ruling by the Commission, the"

"7081","minimum investment required (which may vary by Series or Class), (iii) if"
"7082","the Share activity of the account or ownership of Shares by a particular"

"7162","and reasonably incurred in connection with such Proceeding if such Person"
"7163","acted in good faith or in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no"
"7164","reasonable cause to believe the conduct of such Person was"
"7165","unlawful.  The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order,"
"7166","settlement, conviction or plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall"
"7167","not of itself create a presumption that the Person did not act in good faith"

"7182","that indemnification of the Agent is proper in the circumstances by (i) a"
"7183","final decision on the merits by a court or other body before whom the"
"7184","proceeding was brought that the Agent was not liable by reason of"
"7185","Disqualifying Conduct (including, but not limited to, dismissal of either"
"7186","a court action or an administrative proceeding against the Agent for"

"7188","absence of such a decision, a reasonable determination, based upon a review"
"7189","of the facts, that the Agent was not liable by reason of Disqualifying"
"7190","Conduct, by (1) the"
"7191","vote of a majority of a quorum of the Trustees who are not (x)"

"7210","indemnification."

"7250","Board of Trustees to bring the subject action unless an effort to cause the"
"7251","Board of Trustees to bring such an action is not likely to succeed.  For"
"7252","purposes of this Section 4, a demand on the Board of Trustees shall only be"
"7253","deemed not likely to succeed and therefore excused if a majority of the"
"7254","Board of Trustees, or a majority of any committee established to consider"
"7255","the merits of such action, is composed of Trustees who are not"
"7256","independent trustees (as such term is defined in the DSTA)."

"7267","advisors in considering the merits of the request and shall require an"
"7268","undertaking by the Shareholders making such request to reimburse the Trust"
"7269","for the expense of any such advisors in the event that the Board of"
"7270","Trustees determine not to bring such action."
