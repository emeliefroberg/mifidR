"3127","<DESCRIPTION>AUDITOR'S LETTER"
"3128","<TEXT>"
"3129","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"3130","To the Shareholders and the Board of Trustees of The Alger Portfolios:"
"3131","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of The Alger"
"3132","Portfolios (the Trust), including Alger Capital Appreciation Portfolio,"
"3133","Alger Large Cap Growth Portfolio, Alger Mid Cap Growth Portfolio, Alger"
"3134","Weatherbie Specialized Growth Portfolio (formerly Alger SMid Cap Focus"
"3135","Portfolio), Alger Small Cap Growth Portfolio, Alger Growth & Income Portfolio,"
"3136","and Alger Balanced Portfolio, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019,"
"3137","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"3138","Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Trust's internal control over"
"3139","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"3140","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"3141","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"3142","Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"3143","effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"3144","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3145","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"3146","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"3147","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"3148","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A trust's internal"
"3149","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"3150","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"3151","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"3152","accepted accounting principles. A trust's internal control over financial"
"3153","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"3154","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"3155","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the trust; (2)"
"3156","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"3157","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"3158","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"3159","trust are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"3160","directors of the trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"3161","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"3162","disposition of a trust's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"3163","financial statements."
"3164","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"3165","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"3166","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"3167","become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of"
"3168","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3169","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"3170","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"3171","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3172","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"3173","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"3174","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"3175","the trust's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"3176","detected on a timely basis."
"3177","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting was"
"3178","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3179","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"3180","material weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB. However, we"
"3181","noted no deficiencies in the Trust's internal control over financial reporting"
"3182","and its operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, that we"
"3183","consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as of December 31, 2019."
"3184","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"3185","the Board of Trustees of the Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"3186","and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"3187","specified parties."
