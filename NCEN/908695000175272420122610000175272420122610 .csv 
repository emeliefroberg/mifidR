"9873","2019, in accordance with the standards of"
"9874","the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"9875","Board (United States), we considered the"
"9876","Trust's internal control over financial"
"9877","reporting, including controls over"
"9878","safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"9879","designing our auditing procedures for the"

"9883","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"9884","effectiveness of the Trust's internal control"
"9885","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"9886","express no such opinion."
"9887","The management of the Trust is responsible"
"9888","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"9889","internal control over financial reporting. In"
"9890","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"9891","judgments by management are required to"

"9898","for external purposes in accordance with"
"9899","U.S. generally accepted accounting"

"9917","acquisition, use or disposition of a trust's"
"9918","assets that could have a material effect on"
