"993","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"994","(United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Portfolios internal control over"
"995","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"

"1014","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"

"1021","<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>"
"1022","<p class=MsoNormal>Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
