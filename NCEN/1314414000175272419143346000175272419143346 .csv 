"863","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED"
"864","PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"865","To the Board of Trustees of Northern Lights"
"866","Fund Trust"
"867","and the Shareholders of Changing Parameters"
"868","Fund"
"869","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"870","statements of Changing Parameters Fund, a series"
"871","of shares of beneficial interest in Northern Lights"
"872","Fund Trust (the Fund), as of July 31, 2019, and"
"873","for the year then ended, in accordance with the"
"874","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"875","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we"
"876","considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"877","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"878","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"879","procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"880","opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"881","with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for"
"882","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"883","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"884","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no"
"885","such opinion."
"886","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"887","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"888","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"889","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"890","management are required to assess the expected"
"891","benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's"
"892","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"893","designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"894","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"895","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"896","purposes in accordance with accounting principles"
"897","generally accepted in the United States of America"
"898","(GAAP).  A company's internal control over"
"899","financial reporting includes those policies and"
"900","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"901","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"902","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"903","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"904","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"905","necessary to permit preparation of the financial"
"906","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that"
"907","receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"908","being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"909","of management and trustees of the company; and"
"910","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"911","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"912","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"913","assets that could have a material effect on the"
"914","financial statements."
"915","Because of inherent limitations, internal control"
"916","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"917","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"918","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"919","risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"920","of changes in conditions or that the degree of"
"921","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"922","deteriorate."
"923","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"924","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"925","control does not allow management or employees,"
"926","in the normal course of performing their assigned"

"982","Board (United States), we considered the"

"985","safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"986","designing our auditing procedures for the"

"990","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"991","effectiveness of the Funds internal control"
"992","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"993","express no such opinion."
"994","The management of the Funds is responsible"
"995","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"996","internal control over financial reporting."
"997","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"998","and judgments by management are required to"
"999","assess the expected benefits and related"
"1000","costs of controls.  A funds internal control"
"1001","over financial reporting is a process designed"
"1002","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1003","reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1004","preparation of financial statements for"
"1005","external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1006","accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"1007","A funds internal control over financial"
"1008","reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"1009","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"1010","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1011","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"1012","of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1013","reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1014","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1015","financial statements in accordance with GAAP,"
"1016","and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"1017","are being made only in accordance with"
"1018","authorizations of management and trustees of"
"1019","the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1020","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1021","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1022","of a funds assets that could have a material"
"1023","effect on the financial statements."
"1024","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1025","control over financial reporting may not"
"1026","prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"1027","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"
"1028","to future periods are subject to the risk"
"1029","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"1030","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1031","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1032","deteriorate."
"1033","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1034","reporting exists when the design or operation"
"1035","of a control does not allow management or"
"1036","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1037","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1038","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"1039","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"1040","deficiencies, in internal control over"
"1041","financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1042","reasonable possibility that a material"
"1043","misstatement of the Funds annual or interim"
"1044","financial statements will not be prevented"
"1045","or detected on a timely basis."
"1046","Our consideration of the Funds internal"
