"1213"," In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"

"1215","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"1216","and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1217","accounting principles.  A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"1218","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"1219","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1220","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1221","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"1222","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and"
"1223","(3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1224","use or disposition of a company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</p><p"

"1226","of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1227"," Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1228","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with"
"1229","the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</p><p style=font-family:Sans-Serif; font-size:10.0pt; font-style:normal;
