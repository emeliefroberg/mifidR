"8937","2018, in accordance with the standards of"
"8938","the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"8939","Board (United States), we considered the"
"8940","Funds' internal control over financial"
"8941","reporting, including controls over"
"8942","safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"8943","designing our auditing procedures for the"
"8944","purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"8945","financial statements and to comply with the"
"8946","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for"
"8947","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"8948","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control"
"8949","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"8950","express no such opinion."
"8951","The management of the Funds is responsible"
"8952","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"8953","internal control over financial reporting. In"
"8954","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"8955","judgments by management are required to"
"8956","assess the expected benefits and related"
"8957","costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"8958","over financial reporting is a process"
"8959","designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"8960","regarding the reliability of financial"
"8961","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"8962","statements for external purposes in"
"8963","accordance with U.S. generally accepted"
"8964","accounting principles. A fund's internal"
"8965","control over financial reporting includes"
"8966","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"8967","to the maintenance of records that, in"
"8968","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"8969","reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"8970","the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"8971","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"8972","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"8973","statements in accordance with U.S."
"8974","generally accepted accounting principles,"
"8975","and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"8976","fund are being made only in accordance"
"8977","with authorizations of management and"
"8978","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"8979","reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"8980","or timely detection of unauthorized"
"8981","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"8982","assets that could have a material effect on"
"8983","the financial statements."
"8984","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"8985","control over financial reporting may not"
"8986","prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"8987","projections of any evaluation of"
"8988","effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"8989","the risk that controls may become"
"8990","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"8991","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"8992","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"8993","A deficiency in internal control over"
"8994","financial reporting exists when the design or"
"8995","operation of a control does not allow"
"8996","management or employees, in the normal"
"8997","course of performing their assigned"
"8998","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"8999","on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"9000","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"9001","in internal control over financial reporting,"
"9002","such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"9003","that a material misstatement of the Funds'"
"9004","annual or interim financial statements will"

"9006","basis."
"9007","Our consideration of the Funds' internal"
"9008","control over financial reporting was for the"

"9011","disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"9012","that might be material weaknesses under"
"9013","standards established by the Public"
"9014","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"9015","(United States). However, we noted no"
"9016","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control"
"9017","over financial reporting and their operation,"
"9018","including controls over safeguarding"

"9037","Tribune Company"
"9038","Harbor Mid Cap Value Fund has been named as a"

"9041","FitzSimons (In re Tribune"
"9042","Co.), No. 12-2652 (S.D.N.Y.) (the FitzSimons action);"

"9046","Niese v. ABN AMRO Clearing Chicago LLC, No. 12-0555"
"9047","(S.D.N.Y.) (the"
"9048","Niese action), as a result of its ownership of shares in"
"9049","the Tribune Company"
"9050","(Tribune) in 2007, when Tribune effected a leveraged"
"9051","buyout transaction"
"9052","(LBO) by which Tribune converted to a privately-held"
"9053","company. The"
"9054","plaintiffs in these lawsuits have asserted claims for"
"9055","fraudulent conveyance"
"9056","against Harbor Mid Cap Value Fund and other former"
"9057","Tribune shareholders."
"9058","All three lawsuits have been consolidated with the"
"9059","majority of the other Tribune-"
"9060","related lawsuits in the multidistrict litigation proceeding"
"9061","In re Tribune Co."
"9062","Fraudulent Conveyance Litig., No. 11-2296 (S.D.N.Y.)"
"9063","(the MDL
Proceeding)."
"9064","On September 23, 2013, the District Court granted the"
"9065","defendants' omnibus"
"9066","motion to dismiss the Deutsche Bank and Niese actions,"
"9067","on the basis that the"
"9068","plaintiffs lacked standing. The plaintiffs appealed. On"
"9069","March 29, 2016, the U.S."
"9070","Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued its"
"9071","opinion on the appeal,"
"9072","affirming the district court's dismissal of those lawsuits."
"9073","The appeals court held"
"9074","that while the plaintiffs have standing under the U.S."
"9075","Bankruptcy Code, their"
"9076","claims were preempted by Section 546(e) of the"
"9077","Bankruptcy Code-the"
"9078","statutory safe harbor for settlement payments."
"9079","Plaintiffs sought rehearing en"
"9080","banc, which the Second Circuit denied.  On September"
"9081","9, 2016, the plaintiffs"
"9082","filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme"
"9083","Court challenging the"
"9084","Second Circuit's decision, which the shareholder"
"9085","defendants opposed.  On April"
"9086","3, 2018, Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas issued a"
"9087","Statement related to the"
"9088","petition for certiorari suggesting that the Second Circuit"
"9089","and/or District Court"
"9090","may want to take steps to reexamine the application of"
"9091","the Section 546(e) safe"
"9092","harbor to the previously dismissed state law"
"9093","constructive fraudulent transfer"
"9094","claims based on the Supreme Court's decision in Merit"
"9095","Management Group LP"
"9096","v. FTI Consulting, Inc.  On April 10, 2018, plaintiffs filed"
"9097","in the Second Circuit"
"9098","a motion for that court to recall its mandate, vacate its"
"9099","prior decision, and"
"9100","remand to the district court for further proceedings"
"9101","consistent with Merit"
"9102","Management.  On April 20, 2018, the shareholder"
"9103","defendants filed a response to"
"9104","plaintiffs' motion to recall the mandate.  On May 15,"
"9105","2018, the Second Circuit"
"9106","issued an order recalling the mandate in anticipation of
further panel review."
"9107","On May 23, 2014, the defendants filed motions to"
"9108","dismiss the FitzSimons"
"9109","action, including a global motion to dismiss Count I,"
"9110","which is the claim brought"
"9111","against former Tribune shareholders for intentional"
"9112","fraudulent conveyance under"
"9113","U.S. federal law. On January 6, 2017, the United States"
"9114","District Court for the"
"9115","Southern District of New York granted the shareholder"
"9116","defendants' motion to"
"9117","dismiss and denied plaintiff's request to amend the"
"9118","complaint. The Court's order"
"9119","is not immediately appealable, but the Court issued an"
"9120","order stating that it"
"9121","intends to permit an interlocutory appeal of the"
"9122","dismissal order, but will wait to"
"9123","do so until it has resolved outstanding motions to"
"9124","dismiss filed by other"
"9125","defendants.  Accordingly, the timing of the appeal is"
"9126","uncertain. On July 18,"
"9127","2017, the plaintiff submitted a letter to the District"
"9128","Court seeking leave to amend"
"9129","its complaint to add a constructive fraudulent transfer"
"9130","claim.  The Court denied"
"9131","the plaintiff's request without prejudice to renewal of"
"9132","the request in the event of"
"9133","an intervening change in the law. On March 8, 2018,"
"9134","plaintiff renewed his"
"9135","request for leave to file a motion to amend the"
"9136","complaint to assert a constructive"
"9137","fraudulent transfer claim based on the Supreme Court's"
"9138","ruling in Merit"
"9139","Management.  The shareholder defendants opposed"
"9140","that request.  On June 18,"
"9141","2018, the District Court ordered that the request would"
"9142","be stayed from pending"
"9143","further action by the Second Circuit in the still pending"
"9144","appeal, discussed above."
"9145","None of these lawsuits alleges any wrongdoing on the"
"9146","part of Harbor Mid Cap"
"9147","Value Fund. Harbor Mid Cap Value Fund held shares of"
"9148","Tribune and tendered"
"9149","these shares as part of Tribune's LBO. The value of the"
"9150","proceeds received by"
"9151","Harbor Mid Cap Value Fund was approximately"
"9152","$299,000. Harbor Mid Cap"
"9153","Value Fund's cost basis in the shares of Tribune was"
"9154","approximately $262,000."
"9155","At this stage of the proceedings, Harbor Mid Cap Value"
"9156","Fund is not able to"
"9157","make a reliable prediction as to the outcome of these"
"9158","lawsuits or the effect, if"
"9159","any, on the Fund's net asset value."
