"3993","in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on November 1, 2010, by the Official Committee of Unsecured"
"3994","Creditors of Tribune Company (the &quot;Committee&quot;). The Committee is seeking to recover all payments made to beneficial owners"

"3996","with a 2007 tender offer into which the Blue Chip and Equity Income Funds tendered their shares of common stock of the Tribune"

"4007","Blue Chip and Equity Income Funds have also been named in a similar suit filed on behalf of participants in Tribune defined-compensation"

"4009","recover payments of the proceeds of the LBO. (All of these suits have been removed to the United States District Court for the"
"4010","Southern District of New York and administratively consolidated with other substantially similar suits against other former Tribune"
"4011","shareholders (the &quot;MDL Proceeding&quot;)). On September 23, 2013, the Judge in the MDL Proceeding dismissed various state"
"4012","law constructive fraudulent transfer suits, resulting in the Funds being dismissed from the Bondholder and Retiree Plaintiffs'"
"4013","actions. On March 24, 2016, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the MDL Judge's dismissal of the various state law constructive"
"4014","fraudulent transfer suits. In September 2016, the Bondholder and Retiree Plaintiffs petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review"
"4015","the Second Circuit's decision. The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on that request. On January 9, 2017, the Tribune MDL judge granted"
"4016","the defendants' motion to dismiss the Committee lawsuit alleging a single claim for intentional fraudulent transfer. Settlement"
"4017","offers were made in January 2018 and April 2018, both of which were rejected. The extent of the Funds' potential liability in any"
"4018","such actions has not been determined. The Funds have been advised by counsel that the Funds could be held liable to return all"
"4019","or part of the proceeds received in any of these actions, as well as interest and court costs, even though the Funds had no knowledge"
"4020","of, or participation in, any misconduct. The Equity Income Fund received proceeds of $376,754 in connection with the LBO, representing"
"4021","0.33% of its net assets as of December 31, 2018. The Blue Chip Fund received proceeds of $288,456 in connection with the LBO, representing"
"4022","0.06% of the net assets of Growth &amp; Income Fund as of December 31, 2018. The Equity Income and Growth &amp; Income Funds cannot"
