"5340","Allocator Series, hereafter collectively referred to as the Funds)"
"5341","as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, in"
"5342","accordance with the standards of the"
"5343","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),"
"5344","we considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"5345","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"5346","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"5347","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"5348","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"5349","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"5350","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"5351","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"5352","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"5353","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"5354","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"5355","are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"5356","costs of controls.  A company's internal control over financial"
"5357","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"5358","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"5359","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"5360","generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control"
"5361","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"5362","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"5363","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"5364","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"5365","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"5366","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"5367","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"5368","the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"5369","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"5370","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"5371","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"5372","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"5373","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"5374"," reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"5375","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"5376","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"5377","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with"
"5378","the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"5379","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"5380","when the design or operation of a"
"5381","control does not allow management or employees,"
"5382","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to"
"5383","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness"
"5384","is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"5385","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that"
"5386","there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"5387","misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements"
"5388","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"5389","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"5390","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"5391","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"5392","control over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses"
"5393"," under standards established by the PCAOB.  However, we noted no"
"5394"," deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"5395","reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"5396","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material"
"5397","weakness as defined above as of December 31, 2018."

"5812","connection with or incidental to its trust purposes, to"
"5813","do everything necessary, suitable or proper for the accomplishment"
"5814","of such purposes or for the attainment of any object or the"
"5815","furtherance of any power hereinbefore set forth, either alone or"
"5816","in association with others, and to do every other act or thing"
"5817","incidental or appurtenant to, or growing out of, or connected"

"5819","The Trust shall not be limited to investing in obligations"
"5820","maturing before the possible dissolution of the Trust or one"
"5821","or more of its Series.  Neither the Trust nor the Board of"
"5822","Trustees shall be required to obtain any court order to deal"
"5823","with any assets of the Trust or take any other action hereunder."
"5824","The foregoing clauses shall each be construed as purposes,"
"5825","objects and powers, and it is hereby expressly provided that"
"5826","the foregoing enumeration of specific purposes, objects and"
"5827","powers shall not be held to limit or restrict in any manner the"
"5828","powers of the Trust, and that they are in furtherance of, and in"
"5829","addition to, and not in limitation of, the general powers conferred"
"5830","upon the Trust by the DSTA and the other laws of the State of Delaware"

"5833","ARTICLE III"
"5834","SHARES"
"5835","Section 1.	Division of Beneficial Interest."
"5836","(a)	The beneficial interest in the Trust shall be divided into"
"5837","Shares, each Share without a par value.  The number of"
"5838","Shares in the Trust authorized hereunder, and of each Series and"
"5839","Class as may be established from time to time, is unlimited."
"5840","The Board of Trustees may authorize the division of Shares into"
"5841","separate Classes of Shares and into separate and distinct Series"
"5842","of Shares and the division of any Series into separate Classes"
"5843","of Shares in accordance with the 1940 Act.  The different Series"
"5844","and Classes shall be established and designated pursuant to"
"5845","Article III, Section 6 hereof.  If no separate Series or Classes"
"5846","of Series shall be established, the Shares shall have the rights,"
"5847","powers and duties provided for herein and in Article III,"
"5848","Section 6 hereof to the extent relevant and not otherwise"
"5849","provided for herein, and all references to Series and Classes"
"5850","shall be construed (as the context may require) to refer to the Trust."
"5851","(i)	The fact that the Trust shall have one or more established"
"5852","and designated Classes of the Trust, shall not limit the authority"
"5853","of the Board of Trustees to establish and designate additional"
"5854","Classes of the Trust.  The fact that one or more Classes of the"
"5855","Trust shall have initially been established and designated without"
"5856","any specific establishment or designation of a Series (i.e.,"
"5857","that all Shares of the Trust are initially Shares of"
"5858","one or more Classes) shall not limit the authority of the Board"
"5859","of Trustees to later establish and designate a Series and establish"
"5860","and designate the Class or Classes of the Trust as Class or Classes,"
"5861","respectively, of such Series."
"5862","(ii)	The fact that a Series shall have initially been established"
"5863","and designated without any specific establishment or designation of"
"5864","Classes (i.e., that all Shares of such Series are initially of a"
"5865","single Class) shall not limit the authority of the Board of Trustees"
"5866","to establish and designate separate Classes of said Series."
"5867","The fact that a Series shall have more than one established and"
"5868","designated Class, shall not limit the authority of the Board of"
"5869","Trustees to establish and designate additional Classes of said Series."
"5870","(b)	The Board of Trustees shall have the power to issue authorized,"
"5871","but unissued Shares of the Trust, or any Series and Class thereof,"
"5872","from time to time for such consideration paid wholly or partly in"
"5873","cash, securities or other property, as may be determined from time"
"5874","to time by the Board of Trustees, subject to any requirements or"
"5875","limitations of the 1940 Act.  The Board of Trustees, on behalf of the"
"5876","Trust, may acquire and hold as treasury shares, reissue for such"
"5877","consideration and on such terms as it may determine, or cancel, at"
"5878","its discretion from time to time, any Shares reacquired by the Trust."
"5879","The Board of Trustees may classify, reclassify or convert any unissued"
"5880","Shares or any Shares of the Trust or any Series or Class thereof, that"
"5881","were previously issued and are reacquired, into one or more Series or"
"5882","Classes that may be established and designated from time to time and,"
"5883","in connection therewith, cause some or all of the Shareholders of the"
"5884","Trust, such Series or Class to become Shareholders of such other Series"
"5885","or Class.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust and any Series"
"5886","thereof may acquire, hold, sell and otherwise deal in, for"
"5887","purposes of investment or otherwise, the Shares of any other Series"
"5888","of the Trust or Shares of the Trust, and such Shares shall not be"
"5889","deemed treasury shares or cancelled."
"5890","(c)	Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Article III,"
"5891","each Share shall entitle the holder to voting rights as provided in"
"5892","Article V hereof.  Shareholders shall have no preemptive or other"
"5893","right to subscribe for new or additional authorized, but unissued"
"5894","Shares or other securities issued by the Trust or any Series"
"5895","thereof.  The Board of Trustees may from time to time divide or"
"5896","combine the Shares of the Trust or any particular Series thereof"
"5897","into a greater or lesser number of Shares of the Trust or that"
"5898","Series, respectively.  Such division or combination shall not"
"5899","materially change the proportionate beneficial interests of the"
"5900","holders of Shares of the Trust or that Series, as the case may be,"
"5901","in the Trust Property at the time of such division or combination"
"5902","that is held with respect to the Trust or that Series, as the"
"5903","case may be."
"5904","(d)	Any Trustee, officer or other agent of the Trust, and any"
"5905","organization in which any such Person has an economic or other"
"5906","interest, may acquire, own, hold and dispose of Shares in the Trust"
"5907","or any Series and Class thereof, whether such Shares are authorized"
"5908","but unissued, or already outstanding, to the same extent as if such"
"5909","Person were not a Trustee, officer or other agent of the Trust; and"
"5910","the Trust or any Series may issue and sell and may purchase such Shares"
"5911","from any such Person or any such organization, subject to"
"5912","the limitations, restrictions or other provisions applicable to the"
"5913","sale or purchase of such Shares herein and the 1940 Act."
"5914","Section 2.	Ownership of Shares.  The ownership of Shares shall"
"5915","be recorded on the books of the Trust kept by the Trust or by a"
"5916","transfer or similar agent for the Trust, which books shall be"
"5917","maintained separately for the Shares of the Trust and each Series"
"5918","and each Class thereof that has been established and designated."
"5919","No certificates certifying the ownership of Shares shall be issued"
"5920","except as the Board of Trustees may otherwise determine from time to"
"5921","time.  The Board of Trustees may make such rules not inconsistent"
"5922","with the provisions of the 1940 Act as it considers appropriate for the"
"5923","issuance of Share certificates, the transfer of Shares of the Trust"
"5924","and each Series and Class thereof, if any, and similar matters."
"5925","The record books of the Trust as kept by the Trust or any transfer"
"5926","or similar agent, as the case may be, shall be conclusive as to who"
"5927","are the Shareholders of the Trust and each Series and Class thereof and"
"5928","as to the number of Shares of the Trust and each Series and Class"
"5929","thereof held from time to time by each such Shareholder."
"5930","Section 3.	Sale of Shares.  Subject to the 1940 Act and applicable"
"5931","law, the Trust may sell its authorized but unissued Shares to"
"5932","such Persons, at such times, on such terms, and for such consideration"
"5933","as the Board of Trustees may from time to time authorize.  Each sale"
"5934","shall be credited to the individual purchaser's account in the form"
"5935","of full or fractional Shares of the Trust or such Series thereof"
"5936","(and Class thereof, if any), as the purchaser may select, at the"
"5937","net asset value per Share, subject to Section 22 of the 1940 Act,"
"5938","and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder; provided, however,"
"5939","that the Board of Trustees may, in its sole discretion, permit the"
"5940","Principal Underwriter to impose a sales charge upon any such sale."
"5941","Every Shareholder by virtue of having become a Shareholder shall be"
"5942","bound by the terms of this Declaration of Trust.  Ownership of Shares"
"5943","shall not make any Shareholder a third-party beneficiary of any"
"5944","contract entered into by the Trust or any Series."
"5945","Section 4.	Status of Shares and Limitation of Personal Liability."
"5946","Shares shall be deemed to be personal property giving to Shareholders"
"5947","only the rights provided in this Declaration of Trust, the By-Laws,"
"5948","and under applicable law.  Ownership of Shares shall not entitle the"
"5949","Shareholder to any title in or to the whole or any part of the Trust"
"5950","Property or right to call for a partition or division of the same or"
"5951","for an accounting, nor shall the ownership of Shares constitute the"

"5959","any such Series, but entitles such representative only to the"
"5960","rights of said deceased, incapacitated, dissolved, terminated or"
"5961","bankrupt Shareholder under this Declaration of Trust.  Neither"
"5962","the Trust nor the Trustees, nor any officer, employee or agent of the"
"5963","Trust, shall have any power to bind personally any Shareholder, nor,"
"5964","except as specifically provided herein, to call upon any Shareholder"
"5965","for the payment of any sum of money other than such as the Shareholder"
"5966","may at any time personally agree to pay.  Each Share, when issued on"
"5967","the terms determined by the Board of Trustees, shall be fully paid"
"5968","and nonassessable.  As provided in the DSTA, Shareholders shall be"
"5969","entitled to the same limitation of personal liability as that"
"5970","extended to stockholders of a private corporation organized for"
"5971","profit under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware."
"5972","Section 5.	Power of Board of Trustees to Make Tax Status Election."
"5973","The Board of Trustees shall have the power, in its discretion,"
"5974","to make such elections as to the tax status of the Trust and any"
"5975","Series as may be permitted or required under the"
"5976","Code, without the vote of any Shareholder."
"5977","Section 6.	Establishment and Designation of Series and Classes."
"5978","The establishment and designation of any Series or Class shall"
"5979","be effective, without the requirement of Shareholder approval,"
"5980","upon the adoption of a resolution by not less than a majority of"
"5981","the then Board of Trustees, which resolution shall set forth such"
"5982","establishment and designation whether directly in such resolutions"
"5983","or by reference to, or approval of, another document that sets"
"5984","forth the designation or otherwise identifies such Series or"
"5985","Class, including any registration statement of the Trust and"
"5986","any amendment of this Declaration of Trust, and may provide,"
"5987","to the extent permitted by the DSTA, for rights, powers and"
"5988","duties of such Series or Class (including variations in the"
"5989","relative rights and preferences as between the different"
"5990","Series and Classes) otherwise than as provided herein."
"5991","Any action that may be taken by the Board of Trustees with"
"5992","respect to any Series or Class, including any addition,"
"5993","modification, division, combination, classification,"
"5994","reclassification, change of name or termination, may be made"
"5995","in the same manner as the establishment of such Series or Class."
"5996","Each Series shall be separate and distinct from any other Series,"
"5997","separate and distinct records on the books of the Trust shall be"
"5998","maintained for each Series, and the assets and liabilities"
"5999","belonging to any such Series shall be held and accounted for"
"6000","separately from the assets and liabilities of the Trust or any"
"6001","other Series.  Each Class of the Trust shall be separate and distinct"
"6002","from any other Class of the Trust.  Each Class of a Series shall"
"6003","be separate and distinct from any other Class of the Series.  As"
"6004","appropriate, in a manner determined by the Board of Trustees, the"
"6005","liabilities belonging to any such Class shall be held and accounted"
"6006","for separately from the liabilities of the Trust, the Series or any"
"6007","other Class and separate and distinct records on the books of the Trust"
"6008","for the Class shall be maintained for this purpose.  Subject to Article"
"6009","II hereof, each such Series shall operate as a separate and distinct"
"6010","investment medium, with separately defined investment objectives"
"6011","and policies."
"6012","Shares of each Series (and Class where applicable) established and"
"6013","designated pursuant to this Section 6, unless otherwise provided"
"6014","to the extent permitted by the DSTA, in the resolution establishing"
"6015","and designating such Series or Class, shall have the following"
"6016","rights, powers and duties:"
"6017","(a)	Assets Held with Respect to a Particular Series.  All"
"6018","consideration received by the Trust for the issue or sale of"
"6019","Shares of a particular Series, together with all assets in which"
"6020","such consideration is invested or reinvested, all income, earnings,"
"6021","profits, and proceeds thereof from whatever source derived,"
"6022","including, without limitation, any proceeds derived from the sale,"
"6023","exchange or liquidation of such assets, and any funds or payments"
"6024","derived from any reinvestment of such proceeds in whatever form the"
"6025","same may be, shall irrevocably be held with respect to that Series"
"6026","for all purposes, subject only to the rights of creditors with"
"6027","respect to that Series, and shall be so recorded upon the books"
"6028","of account of the Trust.  Such consideration, assets, income,"
"6029","earnings, profits and proceeds thereof, from whatever source"
"6030","derived, including, without limitation, any proceeds derived"
"6031","from the sale, exchange or liquidation of such assets, and"
"6032","any funds or payments derived from any reinvestment of such"
"6033","proceeds, in whatever form the same may be, are herein referred to"
"6034","as assets held with respect to that Series.  In the event that"
"6035","there are any assets, income, earnings, profits and proceeds"
"6036","thereof, funds or payments which are not readily identifiable as"
"6037","assets held with respect to any particular Series (collectively"
"6038","General Assets), the Board of Trustees, or an appropriate officer"
"6039","as determined by the Board of Trustees, shall allocate such General"
"6040","Assets to, between or among any one or more of the Series in such"
"6041","manner and on such basis as the Board of Trustees, in its sole"
"6042","discretion, deems fair and equitable, and any General Asset so"
"6043","allocated to a particular Series shall be held with respect to"
"6044","that Series.  Each such allocation by or under the direction of"
"6045","the Board of Trustees shall be conclusive and binding upon the"
"6046","Shareholders of all Series for all purposes."
"6047","(b)	Liabilities Held with Respect to a Particular Series"
"6048","or Class.  The assets of the Trust held with respect to a particular"
"6049","Series shall be charged with the liabilities, debts, obligations,"
"6050","costs, charges, reserves and expenses of the Trust incurred,"
"6051","contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to such Series."
"6052","Such liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges, reserves and"
"6053","expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect"
"6054","to a particular Series are herein referred to as liabilities held
with respect to that Series.  Any liabilities, debts, obligations,"
"6055","costs, charges, reserves and expenses of the Trust which are not"
"6056","readily identifiable as being liabilities held with respect to any"
"6057","particular Series (collectively General Liabilities) shall be"
"6058","allocated by the Board of Trustees, or an appropriate officer as"
"6059","determined by the Board of Trustees, to and among any one or more"
"6060","of the Series in such manner and on such basis as the Board of"
"6061","Trustees in its sole discretion deems fair and equitable.  Each"
"6062","allocation of liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges,"
"6063","reserves and expenses by or under the direction of the Board of"
"6064","Trustees shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders"
"6065","of all Series for all purposes.  All Persons who have extended"
"6066","credit that has been allocated to a particular Series, or who have"
"6067","a claim or contract that has been allocated to any particular"
"6068","Series, shall look exclusively to the assets of that particular"
"6069","Series for payment of such credit, claim, or contract.  In the"
"6070","absence of an express contractual agreement so limiting the claims"
"6071","of such creditors, claimants and contract providers, each creditor,"
"6072","claimant and contract provider shall be deemed nevertheless to"
"6073","have impliedly agreed to such limitation."
"6074","Subject to the right of the Board of Trustees in its discretion"
"6075","to allocate General Liabilities as provided herein, the debts,"
"6076","liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or"
"6077","otherwise existing with respect to a particular Series, whether"
"6078","such Series is now authorized and existing pursuant to this"
"6079","Declaration of Trust or is hereafter authorized and existing"
"6080","pursuant to this Declaration of Trust, shall be enforceable"
"6081","against the assets held with respect to that Series only,"
"6082","and not against the assets of any other Series or the Trust"
"6083","generally and none of the debts, liabilities, obligations"
"6084","and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing"
"6085","with respect to the Trust generally or any other Series thereof"
"6086","shall be enforceable against the assets held with respect to"
"6087","such Series.  Notice of this limitation on liabilities between"
"6088","and among Series shall be set forth in the Certificate of Trust"
"6089","pursuant to the DSTA, and upon the giving of such notice in the"
"6090","Certificate of Trust, the statutory provisions of Section 3804"
"6091","of the DSTA relating to limitations on liabilities between and"
"6092","among Series (and the statutory effect under Section 3804 of"
"6093","setting forth such notice in the Certificate of Trust) shall"
"6094","become applicable to the Trust and each Series."
"6095","Liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges, reserves"
"6096","and expenses related to the distribution of, and other"
"6097","identified expenses that should or may properly be allocated"
"6098","to, the Shares of a particular Class may be charged to and"
"6099","borne solely by such Class.  The bearing of expenses solely"
"6100","by a particular Class of Shares may be appropriately reflected"
"6101","(in a manner determined by the Board of Trustees) and may affect"
"6102","the net asset value attributable to, and the dividend, redemption"
"6103","and liquidation rights of, such Class.  Each allocation of"
"6104","liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges, reserves and expenses"
"6105","by or under the direction of the Board of Trustees shall be conclusive"
"6106","and binding upon the Shareholders of all Classes for all purposes."
"6107","All Persons who have extended credit that has been allocated to a"
"6108","particular Class, or who have a claim or contract that has"
"6109","been allocated to any particular Class, shall look, and may"
"6110","be required by contract to look, exclusively to that"
"6111","particular Class for payment of such credit, claim, or contract."
"6112","(c)	Dividends, Distributions and Redemptions.  Notwithstanding"
"6113","any other provisions of this Declaration of Trust, including,"
"6114","without limitation, Article VI hereof, no dividend or distribution"
"6115","including, without limitation, any distribution paid upon dissolution"
"6116","of the Trust or of any Series with respect to, nor any redemption"
"6117","of, the Shares of any Series or Class of such Series shall be"
"6118","effected by the Trust other than from the assets held with respect"
"6119","to such Series, nor, except as specifically provided in Section 7"
"6120","of this Article III, shall any Shareholder of any particular Series"
"6121","otherwise have any right or claim against the assets held with respect"
"6122","to any other Series or the Trust generally except, in the case of a"
"6123","right or claim against the assets held with respect to any other"
"6124","Series, to the extent that such Shareholder has such a right or"
"6125","claim hereunder as a Shareholder of such other Series.  The Board"
"6126","of Trustees shall have full discretion, to the extent not"
"6127","inconsistent with the 1940 Act, to determine which items shall"
"6128","be treated as income and which items as capital; and each such"
"6129","determination and allocation shall be conclusive and binding"
"6130","upon the Shareholders."
"6131","(d)	Voting.  All Shares of the Trust entitled to vote on a"
"6132","matter shall vote in the aggregate without differentiation between"
"6133","the Shares of the separate Series, if any, or separate Classes,"
"6134","if any; provided that (i) with respect to any matter that affects"
"6135","only the interests of some but not all Series, then only the Shares"
"6136","of such affected Series, voting separately, shall be entitled to"
"6137","vote on the matter, (ii) with respect to any matter that affects"
"6138","only the interests of some but not all Classes, then only the"
"6139","Shares of such affected Classes, voting separately, shall be"
"6140","entitled to vote on the matter; and (iii) notwithstanding the"
"6141","foregoing, with respect to any matter as to which the 1940 Act or"
"6142","other applicable law or regulation requires voting, by Series or"
"6143","by Class, then the Shares of the Trust shall vote as prescribed"
"6144","in such law or regulation."
"6145","(e)	Equality.  Each Share of any particular Series shall be"
"6146","equal to each other Share of such Series (subject to the rights"
"6147","and preferences with respect to separate Classes of such Series)."
"6148","(f)	Fractions.  A fractional Share of the Trust or a Series"
"6149","shall carry proportionately all the rights and obligations of a"
"6150","whole Share of the Trust or such Series, including rights with"
"6151","respect to voting, receipt of dividends and distributions,"
"6152","redemption of Shares and dissolution of the Trust or that Series."
"6153","(g)	Exchange Privilege.  The Board of Trustees shall have the"
"6154","authority to provide that the holders of Shares of any Series shall"
"6155","have the right to exchange said Shares for Shares of one or more"
"6156","other Series in accordance with such requirements and procedures"
"6157","as may be established by the Board of Trustees, and in accordance"
"6158","with the 1940 Act."
"6159","(h)	Combination of Series or Classes."
"6160","(i)	The Board of Trustees shall have the authority, without the"
"6161","approval, vote or consent of the Shareholders of any Series, unless"
"6162","otherwise required by applicable law, to combine the assets and"
"6163","liabilities held with respect to any two or more Series into assets"
"6164","and liabilities held with respect to a single Series; provided that"
"6165","upon completion of such combination of Series, the interest of each"
"6166","Shareholder, in the combined assets and liabilities held with respect"
"6167","to the combined Series shall equal the interest of each such"
"6168","Shareholder in the aggregate of the assets and liabilities held with"
"6169","respect to the Series that were combined."
"6170","(ii)	The Board of Trustees shall have the authority, without the"
"6171","approval, vote or consent of the Shareholders of any Series or Class,"
"6172","unless otherwise required by applicable law, to combine, merge or"
"6173","otherwise consolidate the Shares of two or more Classes of Shares"
"6174","of a Series with and/or into a single Class of Shares of such"
"6175","Series, with such designation, preference, conversion or other"
"6176","rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends,"
"6177","qualifications, terms and conditions of redemption and other"
"6178","characteristics as the Trustees may determine; provided, however,"
"6179","that the Trustees shall provide written notice to the affected"
"6180","Shareholders of any such transaction."
"6181","(iii)	The transactions in (i) and (ii) above may be effected"
"6182","through share-for-share exchanges, transfers or sales of assets,"

"6187","dissolution events set forth in Article VIII, Section 1 hereof."
"6188","Upon dissolution of a particular Series, the Trustees shall wind"
"6189","up the affairs of such Series in accordance with Article VIII,"
"6190","Section 1 hereof.  The Board of Trustees shall terminate any"
"6191","particular Class: (i) upon approval by a majority of votes cast"
"6192","at a meeting of the Shareholders of such Class, provided a"
"6193","quorum of Shareholders of such Class are present, or by action"

"6971","actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such Proceeding"
"6972","if such Person acted in good faith or in the case of a criminal"
"6973","proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of such"
"6974","Person was unlawful.  The termination of any Proceeding by judgment,"

"7013","one of the following conditions for the advancement of expenses is"
"7014","met: (i) the Agent shall provide a security for his undertaking,"
"7015","(ii) the Trust shall be insured against losses arising by reason of"
"7016","any lawful advances, or (iii) a majority of a quorum of the"

"7060","upon the Board of Trustees to bring the subject action unless an"

"7063","on the Board of Trustees shall only be deemed not likely to succeed"
"7064","and therefore excused if a majority of the Board of Trustees, or a"
"7065","majority of any committee established to consider the merits of such"
"7066","action, is composed of Trustees who are not independent trustees"

"8363","Notice of Automatic Conversion of Class"
"8364","C Shares to"
"8365","Class A Shares after 10-Year Holding Period"
"8366","At Board meetings held on February 26 and"
"8367","27, 2018, the Board of Trustees approved an"
"8368","automatic conversion feature for the Fund's"
"8369","Class C shares (which includes Class C1"
"8370","shares as applicable) that will automatically"
"8371","convert shareholders' Class C shares into Class"
"8372","A shares of the same Fund after they have been"
"8373","held for 10 years. After conversion, your new"
"8374","shares will be subject to Class A shares'"
"8375","lower Rule 12b-1 fees. The conversion feature will become"
"8376","effective on or about October 5, 2018.  Later that month"
"8377","Class C shares of the Fund that have been outstanding"
"8378","for 10 years or more will automatically convert to Class"
"8379","A shares of such Fund on the basis of the relative net"
"8380","asset values of the two classes. Thereafter, Class C"
"8381","shares of the Fund will convert automatically to Class"
"8382","A shares of such Fund on a monthly basis in the month of,"
"8383","or the month following, the 10-year anniversary of the"
"8384","Class C shares' purchase date. Class C shares of the Fund"
"8385","acquired through automatic reinvestment of dividends or"
"8386","distributions will convert to Class A shares of the Fund"
"8387","on the conversion date pro rata with the converting Class"
"8388","C shares of the Fund that were not acquired through"
"8389","reinvestment of dividends or distributions."
"8390","Shareholders will not pay a sales charge, including a"
"8391","contingent deferred sales charge, upon the conversion"
"8392","of their Class C shares to Class A shares pursuant to"
"8393","this conversion feature. The automatic conversion of the Fund's"
"8394","Class C shares into Class A shares after the 10-year holding period"
"8395","is not expected to be a taxable event for federal income tax purposes."
"8396","Shareholders should consult with their tax advisor regarding the"
"8397","state and local tax consequences of such conversions."
"8398","Class C shares held through a financial intermediary in an"
"8399","omnibus account will be converted into Class A shares only"
"8400","if the intermediary can document that the shareholder has"
"8401","met the required holding period. In certain circumstances,"
"8402","when shares are invested through retirement plans, omnibus"
"8403","accounts, and in certain other instances, the Fund and its"
"8404","agents may not have transparency into how long a shareholder has"
"8405","held Class C shares for purposes of determining whether such Class"
"8406","C shares are eligible for automatic conversion into Class A shares"
"8407","and the financial intermediary may not have the ability to track"
"8408","purchases to credit individual shareholders' holding periods."
"8409","This primarily occurs when shares are invested through certain"
"8410","record keepers for group retirement plans, where the intermediary"
"8411","cannot track share aging at the participant level.  In these"
"8412","circumstances, the Fund will not be able to automatically convert"
"8413","Class C shares into Class A shares as described above. In order to"
"8414","determine eligibility for conversion in these circumstances, it is"
"8415","the responsibility of the shareholder or their financial intermediary"
"8416","to notify the Fund that the shareholder is eligible for the conversion"
"8417","of Class C shares to Class A shares, and the shareholder or their"
"8418","financial intermediary may be required to maintain and provide the"
"8419","Fund with records that substantiate the holding period of Class C"
"8420","shares. It is the financial intermediary's (and not the Fund's)"
"8421","responsibility to keep records and to ensure that the shareholder"
"8422","is credited with the proper holding period. Please consult with"
"8423","your financial intermediary about your shares' eligibility for"
"8424","this conversion feature."
"8425","Also effective October 5, 2018, new accounts or plans may not"
"8426","be eligible to purchase Class C shares of the Fund if it is"
"8427","determined that the intermediary cannot track shareholder holding"
"8428","periods to determine whether a shareholder's Class C shares are"
"8429","eligible for conversion to Class A shares.  Accounts or plans"
"8430","(and their successor, related and affiliated plans) that have"
"8431","Class C shares of the Fund available to participants on or before"
"8432","October 5, 2018, may continue to open accounts for new participants"
"8433","in such share class and purchase additional shares in existing"
"8434","participant accounts.  The Fund has no responsibility for"
"8435","overseeing, monitoring or implementing a financial intermediary's"
"8436","process for determining whether a shareholder meets the required"
"8437","holding period for conversion."
"8438","A financial intermediary may sponsor and/or control accounts,"
"8439","programs or platforms that impose a different conversion schedule"
"8440","or different eligibility requirements for the conversion of Class"
"8441","C shares into Class A shares. In these cases, Class C shareholders"
"8442","may convert to Class A shares under the policies of the financial"
"8443","intermediary and the conversion may be structured as an exchange"
"8444","of Class C shares for Class A shares of the same Fund. Financial"
"8445","intermediaries will be responsible for making such exchanges in"
"8446","those circumstances. Please consult with your financial"
"8447","intermediary if you have any questions regarding your shares'"
"8448","conversion from Class C shares to Class A shares."
