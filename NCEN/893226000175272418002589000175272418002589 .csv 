"998","<TEXT>"
"999","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1000","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Franklin Strategic"
"1001","Mortgage Portfolio"
"1002","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"1003","Franklin Strategic Mortgage Portfolio (the Fund) as of and for the"
"1004","year ended September 30, 2018, in accordance with the standards of the"
"1005","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ('PCAOB'), we"
"1006","considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"1007","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1008","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1009","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"1010","of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1011","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"1012","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1013","Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"1014","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1015","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1016","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"1017","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1018","controls.  A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1019","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1020","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1021","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1022","accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial"
"1023","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"1024","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1025","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"1026","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"1027","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"1028","with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1029","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"1030","authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)"
"1031","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1032","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"1033","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1034","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1035","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"1036","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1037","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1038","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1039","procedures may deteriorate."
"1040","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1041","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1042","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"1043","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"1044","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1045","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1046","possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or"
"1047","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"1048","timely basis."
"1049","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1050","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"1051","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"1052","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"1053","standards established by the PCAOB.  However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1054","in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1055","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"1056","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"1057","September 30, 2018."
"1058","This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Board"
"1059","of Trustees of Franklin Strategic Mortgage Portfolio and the Securities"
"1060","and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be"

"1475","Section 6 hereof to the extent relevant and not otherwise provided for"
"1476","herein, and all references to Series and Classes shall be construed"
"1477","(as the context may require) to refer to the Trust."

"1482","initially been established and designated without any specific"
"1483","establishment or designation of a Series (i.e., that all Shares of the"

"1539","Section 2.	Ownership of Shares.  The ownership of Shares shall be"
"1540","recorded on the books of the Trust kept by the Trust or by a transfer or"
"1541","similar agent for the Trust, which books shall be maintained separately"
"1542","for the Shares of the Trust and each Series and each Class thereof that"
"1543","has been established and designated.  No certificates certifying the"
"1544","ownership of Shares shall be issued except as the Board of Trustees may"
"1545","otherwise determine from time to time.  The Board of Trustees may make"
"1546","such rules not inconsistent with the provisions of the 1940 Act as it"
"1547","considers appropriate for the issuance of Share certificates, the"
"1548","transfer of Shares of the Trust and each Series and Class thereof,"
"1549","if any, and similar matters.  The record books of the Trust as kept by"
"1550","the Trust or any transfer or similar agent, as the case may be, shall"
"1551","be conclusive as to who are the Shareholders of the Trust and each"
"1552","Series and Class thereof and as to the number of Shares of the Trust"
"1553","and each Series and Class thereof held from time to time by each"
"1554","such Shareholder."
"1555","Section 3.	Sale of Shares.  Subject to the 1940 Act and applicable law,"
"1556","the Trust may sell its authorized but unissued Shares to such Persons,"

"1561","as the purchaser may select, at the net asset value per Share, subject"
"1562","to Section 22 of the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations adopted"
"1563","thereunder; provided, however, that the Board of Trustees may, in its"
"1564","sole discretion, permit the Principal Underwriter to impose a sales"
"1565","charge upon any such sale.  Every Shareholder by virtue of having"
"1566","become a Shareholder shall be bound by the terms of this Declaration"
"1567","of Trust.  Ownership of Shares shall not make any Shareholder a"
"1568","third-party beneficiary of any contract entered into by the Trust or"
"1569","any Series."
"1570","Section 4.	Status of Shares and Limitation of Personal Liability."
"1571","Shares shall be deemed to be personal property giving to Shareholders"
"1572","only the rights provided in this Declaration of Trust, the By-Laws, and"
"1573","under applicable law.  Ownership of Shares shall not entitle the"

"1582","terminated or bankrupt Shareholder to an accounting or to take any"
"1583","action in court or elsewhere against the Trust, the Trustees or any such"
"1584","Series, but entitles such representative only to the rights of said"

"1589","provided herein, to call upon any Shareholder for the payment of any"
"1590","sum of money other than such as the Shareholder may at any time"
"1591","personally agree to pay.  Each Share, when issued on the terms"
"1592","determined by the Board of Trustees, shall be fully paid and"
"1593","nonassessable.  As provided in the DSTA, Shareholders shall be entitled"
"1594","to the same limitation of personal liability as that extended to"
"1595","stockholders of a private corporation organized for profit under the"
"1596","General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware."
"1597","Section 5.	Power of Board of Trustees to Make Tax Status Election."
"1598","The Board of Trustees shall have the power, in its discretion, to make"

"1600","be permitted or required under the Code, without the vote of any"
"1601","Shareholder."
"1602","Section 6.	Establishment and Designation of Series and Classes."
"1603","The establishment and designation of any Series or Class shall be"
"1604","effective, without the requirement of Shareholder approval, upon the"
"1605","adoption of a resolution by not less than a majority of the then Board"
"1606","of Trustees, which resolution shall set forth such establishment and"
"1607","designation whether directly in such resolutions or by reference to,"
"1608","or approval of, another document that sets forth the designation or"
"1609","otherwise identifies such Series or Class, including any registration"
"1610","statement of the Trust and any amendment of this Declaration of Trust,"
"1611","and may provide, to the extent permitted by the DSTA, for rights, powers"
"1612","and duties of such Series or Class (including variations in the relative"
"1613","rights and preferences as between the different Series and Classes)"
"1614","otherwise than as provided herein.  Any action that may be taken by the"
"1615","Board of Trustees with respect to any Series or Class, including any"
"1616","addition, modification, division, combination, classification,"
"1617","reclassification, change of name or termination, may be made in the"
"1618","same manner as the establishment of such Series or Class."
"1619","Each Series shall be separate and distinct from any other Series,"
"1620","separate and distinct records on the books of the Trust shall be"
"1621","maintained for each Series, and the assets and liabilities belonging to"
"1622","any such Series shall be held and accounted for separately from the"
"1623","assets and liabilities of the Trust or any other Series.  Each Class of"
"1624","the Trust shall be separate and distinct from any other Class of the"
"1625","Trust.  Each Class of a Series shall be separate and distinct from any"
"1626","other Class of the Series.  As appropriate, in a manner determined by"
"1627","the Board of Trustees, the liabilities belonging to any such Class shall"
"1628","be held and accounted for separately from the liabilities of the Trust,"
"1629","the Series or any other Class and separate and distinct records on the"
"1630","books of the Trust for the Class shall be maintained for this purpose."
"1631","Subject to Article II hereof, each such Series shall operate as a"
"1632","separate and distinct investment medium, with separately defined"
"1633","investment objectives and policies."
"1634","Shares of each Series (and Class where applicable) established and"
"1635","designated pursuant to this Section 6, unless otherwise provided to the"
"1636","extent permitted by the DSTA, in the resolution establishing and"
"1637","designating such Series or Class, shall have the following rights,"
"1638","powers and duties:"
"1639","(a)	Assets Held with Respect to a Particular Series.  All consideration"

"1642","or reinvested, all income, earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof from"
"1643","whatever source derived, including, without limitation, any proceeds"
"1644","derived from the sale, exchange or liquidation of such assets, and any"
"1645","funds or payments derived from any reinvestment of such proceeds in"
"1646","whatever form the same may be, shall irrevocably be held with respect"
"1647","to that Series for all purposes, subject only to the rights of creditors"
"1648","with respect to that Series, and shall be so recorded upon the books of"
"1649","account of the Trust.  Such consideration, assets, income, earnings,"
"1650","profits and proceeds thereof, from whatever source derived, including,"
"1651","without limitation, any proceeds derived from the sale, exchange or"
"1652","liquidation of such assets, and any funds or payments derived from any"
"1653","reinvestment of such proceeds, in whatever form the same may be, are"
"1654","herein referred to as assets held with respect to that Series.  In"
"1655","the event that there are any assets, income, earnings, profits and"
"1656","proceeds thereof, funds or payments which are not readily identifiable"
"1657","as assets held with respect to any particular Series"
"1658","(collectively General Assets), the Board of Trustees, or an"
"1659","appropriate officer as determined by the Board of Trustees, shall"
"1660","allocate such General Assets to, between or among any one or more of"
"1661","the Series in such manner and on such basis as the Board of Trustees,"
"1662","in its sole discretion, deems fair and equitable, and any General Asset"
"1663","so allocated to a particular Series shall be held with respect to that"
"1664","Series.  Each such allocation by or under the direction of the Board of"
"1665","Trustees shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders of all"
"1666","Series for all purposes."

"1668","The assets of the Trust held with respect to a particular Series shall"
"1669","be charged with the liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges,"

"1671","existing with respect to such Series.  Such liabilities, debts,"
"1672","obligations, costs, charges, reserves and expenses incurred, contracted"
"1673","for or otherwise existing with respect to a particular Series are"
"1674","herein referred to as liabilities held with respect to that Series."
"1675","Any liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges, reserves and"
"1676","expenses of the Trust which are not readily identifiable as being"
"1677","liabilities held with respect to any particular Series (collectively"
"1678","General Liabilities) shall be allocated by the Board of Trustees, or"
"1679","an appropriate officer as determined by the Board of Trustees, to and"
"1680","among any one or more of the Series in such manner and on such basis as"
"1681","the Board of Trustees in its sole discretion deems fair and equitable."
"1682","Each allocation of liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges,"
"1683","reserves and expenses by or under the direction of the Board of"
"1684","Trustees shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders of all"
"1685","Series for all purposes.  All Persons who have extended credit that has"
"1686","been allocated to a particular Series, or who have a claim or contract"
"1687","that has been allocated to any particular Series, shall look exclusively"
"1688","to the assets of that particular Series for payment of such credit,"
"1689","claim, or contract.  In the absence of an express contractual agreement"
"1690","so limiting the claims of such creditors, claimants and contract"
"1691","providers, each creditor, claimant and contract provider shall be"
"1692","deemed nevertheless to have impliedly agreed to such limitation."
"1693","Subject to the right of the Board of Trustees in its discretion to"
"1694","allocate General Liabilities as provided herein, the debts, liabilities,"
"1695","obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing"
"1696","with respect to a particular Series, whether such Series is now"
"1697","authorized and existing pursuant to this Declaration of Trust or is"
"1698","hereafter authorized and existing pursuant to this Declaration of Trust,"
"1699","shall be enforceable against the assets held with respect to that Series"
"1700","only, and not against the assets of any other Series or the Trust"
"1701","generally and none of the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses"
"1702","incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to the Trust"
"1703","generally or any other Series thereof shall be enforceable against the"
"1704","assets held with respect to such Series.  Notice of this limitation on"
"1705","liabilities between and among Series shall be set forth in the"
"1706","Certificate of Trust pursuant to the DSTA, and upon the giving of such"
"1707","notice in the Certificate of Trust, the statutory provisions of Section"
"1708","3804 of the DSTA relating to limitations on liabilities between and"
"1709","among Series (and the statutory effect under Section 3804 of setting"
"1710","forth such notice in the Certificate of Trust) shall become applicable"
"1711","to the Trust and each Series."
"1712","Liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges, reserves and expenses"
"1713","related to the distribution of, and other identified expenses that"
"1714","should or may properly be allocated to, the Shares of a particular Class"
"1715","may be charged to and borne solely by such Class.  The bearing of"
"1716","expenses solely by a particular Class of Shares may be appropriately"
"1717","reflected (in a manner determined by the Board of Trustees) and may"
"1718","affect the net asset value attributable to, and the dividend,"
"1719","redemption and liquidation rights of, such Class.  Each allocation of"
"1720","liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges, reserves and expenses"
"1721","by or under the direction of the Board of Trustees shall be conclusive"
"1722","and binding upon the Shareholders of all Classes for all purposes.  All"
"1723","Persons who have extended credit that has been allocated to a particular"
"1724","Class, or who have a claim or contract that has been allocated to any"
"1725","particular Class, shall look, and may be required by contract to look,"
"1726","exclusively to that particular Class for payment of such credit, claim,"
"1727","or contract."
"1728","(c)	Dividends, Distributions and Redemptions.  Notwithstanding any"
"1729","other provisions of this Declaration of Trust, including, without"

"1732","or of any Series with respect to, nor any redemption of, the Shares of"
"1733","any Series or Class of such Series shall be effected by the Trust other"
"1734","than from the assets held with respect to such Series, nor, except as"
"1735","specifically provided in Section 7 of this Article III, shall any"
"1736","Shareholder of any particular Series otherwise have any right or claim"
"1737","against the assets held with respect to any other Series or the Trust"
"1738","generally except, in the case of a right or claim against the assets"
"1739","held with respect to any other Series, to the extent that such"
"1740","Shareholder has such a right or claim hereunder as a Shareholder of such"
"1741","other Series.  The Board of Trustees shall have full discretion, to the"
"1742","extent not inconsistent with the 1940 Act, to determine which items"
"1743","shall be treated as income and which items as capital; and each such"
"1744","determination and allocation shall be conclusive and binding upon the"
"1745","Shareholders."
"1746","(d)	Voting.  All Shares of the Trust entitled to vote on a matter"
"1747","shall vote in the aggregate without differentiation between the Shares"
"1748","of the separate Series, if any, or separate Classes, if any; provided"
"1749","that (i) with respect to any matter that affects only the interests of"
"1750","some but not all Series, then only the Shares of such affected Series,"
"1751","voting separately, shall be entitled to vote on the matter, (ii) with"

"1755","notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any matter as to which"
"1756","the 1940 Act or other applicable law or regulation requires voting, by"
"1757","Series or by Class, then the Shares of the Trust shall vote as"
"1758","prescribed in such law or regulation."
"1759","(e)	Equality.  Each Share of any particular Series shall be equal"
"1760","to each other Share of such Series (subject to the rights and"
"1761","preferences with respect to separate Classes of such Series)."
"1762","(f)	Fractions.  A fractional Share of the Trust or a Series shall"
"1763","carry proportionately all the rights and obligations of a whole Share of"
"1764","the Trust or such Series, including rights with respect to voting,"
"1765","receipt of dividends and distributions, redemption of Shares and"
"1766","dissolution of the Trust or that Series."
"1767","(g)	Exchange Privilege.  The Board of Trustees shall have the authority"

"1771","by the Board of Trustees, and in accordance with the 1940 Act."

"1774","vote or consent of the Shareholders of any Series, unless otherwise"
"1775","required by applicable law, to combine the assets and liabilities held"
"1776","with respect to any two or more Series into assets and liabilities held"
"1777","with respect to a single Series; provided that upon completion of such"
"1778","combination of Series, the interest of each Shareholder, in the combined"
"1779","assets and liabilities held with respect to the combined Series shall"
"1780","equal the interest of each such Shareholder in the aggregate of the"
"1781","assets and liabilities held with respect to the Series that were combined."
"1782","	The Board of Trustees shall have the authority, without the approval,"
"1783","vote or consent of the Shareholders of any Series or Class, unless"
"1784","otherwise required by applicable law, to combine, merge or otherwise"

"1786","with and/or into a single Class of Shares of such Series, with such"
"1787","designation, preference, conversion or other rights, voting powers,"
"1788","restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications, terms and"
"1789","conditions of redemption and other characteristics as the Trustees may"
"1790","determine; provided, however, that the Trustees shall provide written"
"1791","notice to the affected Shareholders of any such transaction."

"1805","without a meeting pursuant to Article V, Section 3; or (ii) at the"
"1806","discretion of the Board of Trustees either (A) at any time there are"
"1807","no Shares outstanding of such Class, or (B) upon prior written notice"
"1808","to the Shareholders of such Class; provided, however, that upon the"

"2625","Trustees shall only be deemed not likely to succeed and therefore"
"2626","excused if a majority of the Board of Trustees, or a majority of any"
"2627","committee established to consider the merits of such action, is"

"2636","(c)	Unless a demand is not required under paragraph (a) of this"
"2637","Section 4, the Board of Trustees must be afforded a reasonable amount"
"2638","of time to consider such Shareholder request and to investigate the"

"2641","shall require an undertaking by the Shareholders making such request to"
"2642","reimburse the Trust for the expense of any such advisors in the event"
"2643","that the Board of Trustees determine not to bring such action."
"2644","For purposes of this Section 4, the Board of Trustees may designate a"

"3235","and Section 3806 of the DSTA."
"3236","Section 7.	WAIVER OF NOTICE BY CONSENT OF ABSENT SHAREHOLDERS."
"3237","Attendance by a Shareholder, in person or by proxy, at a meeting shall"

"3240","express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the"
"3241","transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called"
"3242","or convened.  Whenever notice of a Shareholders' meeting is required to"
"3243","be given to a Shareholder under the Declaration of Trust or these"
"3244","By-Laws, a written waiver thereof, executed before or after the time"
"3245","notice is required to be given, by such Shareholder or his or her"
"3246","attorney thereunto authorized, shall be deemed equivalent to such notice."
"3247","The waiver of notice need not specify the purpose of, or the business to"
"3248","be transacted at, the meeting."
"3249","Section 8.	PROXIES.  Every Shareholder entitled to vote for Trustees"
"3250","or on any other matter that may properly come before the meeting shall"
"3251","have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents"
"3252","authorized by a written proxy executed by the Shareholder and filed with"
"3253","the secretary of the Trust before being voted; provided, that an"
"3254","alternative to the execution of a written proxy may be permitted as"
"3255","described in the next paragraph of this Section 8.  A proxy shall be"
"3256","deemed executed if the Shareholder's name is placed on the proxy"
"3257","(whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic or electronic"
"3258","transmission (as defined in Section 3806 of the DSTA) or otherwise) by"
"3259","the Shareholder or the Shareholder's attorney-in-fact.  A valid proxy"
"3260","that does not state that it is irrevocable shall continue in full force"
"3261","and effect unless (i) revoked by the person executing it before the vote"
"3262","pursuant to that proxy is taken (a) by a writing delivered to the Trust"
"3263","stating that the proxy is revoked, (b) by a subsequent proxy executed by"
"3264","such person, (c) attendance at the meeting and voting in person by the"
"3265","person executing that proxy, or (d) revocation by such person using any"
"3266","electronic, telephonic, computerized or other alternative means"
"3267","authorized by the Trustees for authorizing the proxy to act; or (ii)"
"3268","written notice of the death or incapacity of the maker of that proxy"
"3269","is received by the Trust before the vote pursuant to that proxy is"
"3270","counted; provided, however, that no proxy shall be valid after the"
"3271","expiration of eleven (11) months from the date of the proxy unless"
"3272","otherwise expressly provided in the proxy.  The revocability of a proxy"
"3273","that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the"
"3274","provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware."
"3275","Unless revoked, any proxy given in connection with a postponed or"
"3276","adjourned meeting for which a new record date is fixed shall continue"
"3277","to be valid so long as the Shareholder giving such proxy is a"
"3278","Shareholder of record on such new such record date."
"3279","With respect to any Shareholders' meeting, the Board, or, in case the"
"3280","Board does not act, the president, any vice president or the secretary,"
"3281","may permit proxies by electronic transmission (as defined in Section"
"3282","3806 of the DSTA), telephonic, computerized, telecommunications or"
"3283","other reasonable alternative to the execution of a written instrument"
"3284","authorizing the holder of the proxy to act.  A proxy with respect to"
"3285","Shares held in the name of two or more Persons shall be valid if"
"3286","executed, or a permitted alternative to execution is used, by any"
"3287","one of them unless, at or prior to the exercise of the proxy, the"
"3288","secretary of the Trust receives a specific written notice to the"
"3289","contrary from any one of them.  A proxy purporting to be by or on"
"3290","behalf of a Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or"
"3291","prior to its exercise and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest"
"3292","with the challenger.  Unless otherwise specifically limited by their"
"3293","terms, proxies shall entitle the Shareholder to vote at any adjournment"
"3294","or postponement of a Shareholder meeting."
"3295","Subject to the provisions of the DSTA, the Declaration of Trust or these"
"3296","By-Laws, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware relating"
"3297","to proxies, and judicial interpretations thereunder, shall govern all"
"3298","matters concerning the giving, voting or validity of proxies, as if the"
"3299","Trust were a Delaware corporation and the Shareholders were stockholders"
"3300","of a Delaware corporation."
"3301","Section 9.	INSPECTORS.  Before any meeting of Shareholders, the"
"3302","chairperson of the Board, or in the absence of the chairperson of the"
"3303","Board, the president of the Trust, or in the absence of the president,"
"3304","any vice president or other authorized officer of the Trust, may appoint"
"3305","any person other than nominees for office to act as inspector at the"
"3306","meeting or any adjournment.  If any person appointed as inspector fails"
"3307","to appear or fails or refuses to act, the chairperson of the Board, or"
"3308","in the absence of the chairperson of the Board, the president of the"
"3309","Trust, or in the absence of the president, any vice president or other"

"3318","(c)	hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising"
"3319","in connection with the right to vote;"

"3827","SUPPLEMENT DATED JUNE 8, 2018"
"3828","TO THE CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE PROSPECTUS"
"3829","OF EACH OF THE FUNDS LISTED BELOW"
"3830","Franklin Strategic Mortgage Portfolio"
"3831","Franklin New York Intermediate-Term Tax-Free Income Fund"
"3832","Notice of Automatic Conversion of Class C Shares to Class A Shares"
"3833","after 10-Year Holding Period"
"3834","At Board meetings held on February 26 and 27, 2018, the Board of"
"3835","Trustees approved an automatic conversion feature for the Fund's"
"3836","Class C shares (which includes Class C1 shares as applicable) that"
"3837","will automatically convert shareholders' Class C shares into Class A"
"3838","shares of the same Fund after they have been held for 10 years. After"
"3839","conversion, your new shares will be subject to Class A shares' lower"
"3840","Rule 12b-1 fees.  The conversion feature will become effective on or"
"3841","about October 5, 2018.  Later that month Class C shares of the Fund"
"3842","that have been outstanding for 10 years or more will automatically"
"3843","convert to Class A shares of such Fund on the basis of the relative"
"3844","net asset values of the two classes. Thereafter, Class C shares of the"
"3845","Fund will convert automatically to Class A shares of such Fund on a"
"3846","monthly basis in the month of, or the month following, the 10-year"
"3847","anniversaryof the Class C shares' purchase date. Class C shares of"
"3848","the Fund acquired through automatic reinvestment of dividends or"
"3849","distributions will convert to Class A shares of the Fund on the"
"3850","conversion date pro rata with the converting Class C shares of the"
"3851","Fund that were not acquired through reinvestment of dividends"
"3852","or distributions."
"3853","Shareholders will not pay a sales charge, including a contingent"
"3854","deferred sales charge, upon the conversion of their Class C shares"
"3855","to Class A shares pursuant to this conversion feature."
"3856","The automatic conversion of the Fund's Class C shares into Class A"
"3857","shares after the 10-year holding period is not expected to be a"
"3858","taxable event for federal income tax purposes. Shareholders should"
"3859","consult with their tax advisor regarding the state and local tax"
"3860","consequences of such conversions."
"3861","Class C shares held through a financial intermediary in an omnibus"
"3862","account will be converted into Class A shares only if the intermediary"
"3863","can document that the shareholder has met the required holding period."
"3864","In certain circumstances, when shares are invested through retirement"
"3865","plans, omnibus accounts, and in certain other instances, the Fund and"
"3866","its agents may not have transparency into how long a shareholder has"
"3867","held Class C shares for purposes of determining whether such Class C"
"3868","shares are eligible for automatic conversion into Class A shares and"
"3869","the financial intermediary may not have the ability to track purchases"
"3870","to credit individual shareholders' holding periods.  This primarily"
"3871","occurs when shares are invested through certain record keepers for"
"3872","group retirement plans, where the intermediary cannot track share"
"3873","aging at the participant level.  In these circumstances, the Fund"
"3874","will not be able to automatically convert Class C shares into Class A"
"3875","shares as described above. In order to determine eligibility for"
"3876","conversion in these circumstances, it is the responsibility of the"
"3877","shareholder or their financial intermediary to notify the Fund that"
"3878","the shareholder is eligible for the conversion of Class C shares to"
"3879","Class A shares, and the shareholder or their financial intermediary"
"3880","may be required to maintain and provide the Fund with records that"
"3881","substantiate the holding period of Class C shares. It is the"
"3882","financial intermediary's (and not the Fund's) responsibility"
"3883","to keep records and to ensure that the shareholder is credited"
"3884","with the proper holding period. Please consult with your financial"
"3885","intermediary about your shares' eligibility for this conversion feature."
"3886","Also effective October 5, 2018, new accounts or plans may not be"
"3887","eligible to purchase Class C shares of the Fund if it is determined"
"3888","that the intermediary cannot track shareholder holding periods to"
"3889","determine whether a shareholder's Class C shares are eligible for"
"3890","conversion to Class A shares.  Accounts or plans (and their successor,"
"3891","related and affiliated plans) that have Class C shares of the Fund"
"3892","available to participants on or before October 5, 2018, may continue"
"3893","to open accounts for new participants in such share class and purchase"
"3894","additional shares in existing participant accounts.  The Fund has no"
"3895","responsibility for overseeing, monitoring or implementing a financial"
"3896","intermediary's process for determining whether a shareholder meets the"
"3897","required holding period for conversion."
"3898","A financial intermediary may sponsor and/or control accounts, programs"
"3899","or platforms that impose a different conversion schedule or different"
"3900","eligibility requirements for the conversion of Class C shares into"
"3901","Class A shares. In these cases, Class C shareholders may convert to"
"3902","Class A shares under the policies of the financial intermediary and"
"3903","the conversion may be structured as an exchange of Class C shares for"
"3904","Class A shares of the same Fund. Financial intermediaries will be"
"3905","responsible for making such exchanges in those circumstances."
"3906","Please consult with your financial intermediary if you have any"
"3907","questions regarding your shares' conversion from Class C shares"
"3908","to Class A shares."
