"15495","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"15496","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"15497","financial reporting."

"15503","A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"

"15506","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"15507","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"

"15509","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"15510","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"15511","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"15512","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"

"15521","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"

"15523","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
