"25717","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"25718","Firm"
"25719","To the Board of Trustees of SunAmerica Series Trust and"
"25720","Shareholders of each of the funds listed in Appendix I"
"25721"," In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"25722","statements of the funds listed in Appendix I, (hereafter"
"25723","collectively referred to as the Funds) as of and for the"
"25724","periods ended January 31, 2020, in accordance with the"
"25725","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"25726","Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the"
"25727","Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"25728","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"25729","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"25730","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"25731","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"25732","Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"25733","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"25734","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not"
"25735","express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"25736","internal control over financial reporting."
"25737"," The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"25738","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"25739","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"25740","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"25741","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"25742","controls. A company's internal control over financial"
"25743","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"25744","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"25745","and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"25746","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"25747","accounting principles. A company's internal control over"
"25748","financial reporting includes those policies and"
"25749","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"25750","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"25751","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"25752","the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"25753","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"25754","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"25755","generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"25756","receipts and expenditures of the company are being"
"25757","made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"25758","management and trustees of the company; and (3)"
"25759","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"25760","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"25761","disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"25762","material effect on the financial statements."
"25763"," Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"

"25770"," A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"25771","exists when the design or operation of a control does"
