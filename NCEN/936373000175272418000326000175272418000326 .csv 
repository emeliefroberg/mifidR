"718","EXHIBIT ITEM: Copies of any material amendments to the registrant's"
"719","charter or by-laws"
"720","Amendment Effective February 1, 2018"
"721","To the By-Laws of Franklin Templeton Money Fund Trust (the Trust)"
"722","WHEREAS, Article VIII, Section 2 of the By-Laws provides that the"
"723"," By-Laws may be amended by the Board of Trustees; and"
"724","WHEREAS, by resolutions adopted October 24, 2017 at a meeting"
"725","of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Board of Trustees unanimously"
"726","authorized the By-Laws to be amended as set forth below."
"727","NOW THEREFORE, the By-Laws are hereby amended as follows:"
"728","1.	ARTICLE VII, Sections 3, 4 and 6 are replaced in their entirety"
"729"," with the following:"
"730","Section 3.	CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES.  No certificate or certificates"
"731","for Shares shall be issued to Shareholders and no Shareholder shall have"
"732","the right to demand or require that a certificate for Shares be issued"
"733","to it.  The Trust shall adopt and use a system of issuance, recordation"
"734","and transfer of its shares by electronic or other means."
"735","Section 4.	LOST CERTIFICATES.  No new certificate for Shares"
"736","shall be issued to replace an old certificate that is surrendered"
"737"," to the Trust for cancellation.  In case any Share certificate or"
"738","certificate for any other security is lost, stolen, or destroyed,"
"739"," such certificate shall be cancelled and the ownership of an"
"740","uncertificated Share shall be recorded upon the books of the Trust,"
"741"," on such terms and conditions as the Board may require, including a"
"742","provision for indemnification of the Board and the Trust secured by a bond"
"743"," or other adequate security sufficient to protect the Trust and the Board"
"744","against any claim that may be made against either, including any expense"
"745","or liability on account of the alleged loss, theft, or destruction of"
"746","the certificate."
"747","Section 6.	TRANSFERS OF SHARES.  Shares are transferable, if authorized"
"748"," by the Declaration of Trust, only on the record books of the Trust by the"
"749","Person in whose name such Shares are registered, or by his or her duly"
"750","authorized attorney-in-fact or representative.  Upon receipt of"
"751","proper transfer instructions from the registered owner of certificated"
"752","Shares, and upon the surrender for cancellation of such certificates"
"753","representing the number of Shares to be transferred with an assignment"
"754","and power of transfer endorsed thereon or attached thereto, duly executed,"
"755","with such proof of the authenticity of the signature as the Trust or its"
"756","agents may reasonably require, the Trust shall cancel the old certificate"
"757","and record the transaction and ownership of uncertificated Shares upon the"
"758","books of the Trust.  Upon receipt of proper transfer instructions from the"
"759","registered owner of uncertificated Shares, such uncertificated Shares shall"
"760","be transferred on the record books to the Person entitled thereto."
"761","The Trust, its transfer agent or other duly authorized agents may refuse"
"762","any requested transfer of Shares, or request additional evidence of"
"763","authority to safeguard the assets or interests of the Trust or of its"
"764","Shareholders, in their sole discretion.  In all cases of transfer by an"
"765","attorney-in-fact, the original power of attorney, or an official copy thereof"
"766","duly certified, shall be deposited and remain with the Trust, its transfer"
"767","agent or other duly authorized agent.  In case of transfers by executors,"
"768","administrators, guardians or other legal representatives, duly"
"769","authenticated evidence of their authority shall be presented to the"
"770","Trust, its transfer agent or other duly authorized agent, and may be"
"771","required to be deposited and remain with the Trust, its transfer"
"772","agent or other duly authorized agent."
"773","Adopted and approved as of October 24, 2017 by the Board of Trustees."

"786","<DESCRIPTION>TERMS OF NEW OR AMENDED SECURITIES NOTICE OF AUTOMATIC CONVERSION OF CLASS C SHARES TO CLASS A SHARES AFTER 10-YEAR HOLDING PERIOD"
"787","<TEXT>"
"788","NAME OF REGISTRANT:"
"789","Franklin Templeton Money Fund Trust"
"790","File No. 811-08962"
"791","EXHIBIT ITEM: Terms of new or amended securities"
"792","Notice of Automatic Conversion of Class C Shares to Class A"
"793","Shares after 10-Year Holding Period"
"794","At Board meetings held on February 26 and 27, 2018, the Board"
"795","of Trustees approved an automatic conversion feature for the Fund's"
"796","Class C shares (which includes Class C1 shares as applicable) that"
"797","will automatically convert shareholders' Class C shares into Class A"
"798","shares of the same Fund after they have been held for 10 years. After"
"799","conversion, your new shares will be subject to Class A shares' lower"
"800","Rule 12b-1 fees.  The conversion feature will become effective on or about"
"801","October 5, 2018.  Later that month Class C shares of the Fund that have"
"802","been outstanding for 10 years or more will automatically convert to Class"
"803","A shares of such Fund on the basis of the relative net asset values of the"
"804","two classes. Thereafter, Class C shares of the Fund will convert"
"805","automatically to Class A shares of such Fund on a monthly basis in"
"806","the month of, or the month following, the 10-year anniversary of the"
"807","Class C shares' purchase date. Class C shares of the Fund acquired"
"808","through automatic reinvestment of dividends or distributions will"
"809","convert to Class A shares of the Fund on the conversion date pro"
"810","rata with the converting Class C shares of the Fund that were not"
"811","acquired through reinvestment of dividends or distributions."
"812","Shareholders will not pay a sales charge, including a contingent"
"813","deferred sales charge, upon the conversion of their Class C shares to"
"814","Class A shares pursuant to this conversion feature. The automatic conversion"
"815","of the Fund's Class C shares into Class A shares after the 10-year holding"
"816","period is not expected to be a taxable event for federal income tax"
"817","purposes. Shareholders should consult with their tax advisor regarding"
"818","the state and local tax consequences of such conversions."
"819","Class C shares held through a financial intermediary in an omnibus"
"820","account will be converted into Class A shares only if the intermediary"
"821","can document that the shareholder has met the required holding period."
"822","In certain circumstances, when shares are invested through retirement"
"823","plans, omnibus accounts, and in certain other instances, the Fund"
"824","and its agents may not have transparency into how long a shareholder"
"825","has held Class C shares for purposes of determining whether such Class"
"826","C shares are eligible for automatic conversion into Class A shares and"
"827","the financial intermediary may not have the ability to track purchases"
"828","to credit individual shareholders' holding periods.  This primarily"
"829","occurs when shares are invested through certain record keepers for"
"830","group retirement plans, where the intermediary cannot track share"
"831","aging at the participant level.  In these circumstances, the Fund"
"832","will not be able to automatically convert Class C shares into Class A"
"833","shares as described above. In order to determine eligibility for conversion"
"834","in these circumstances, it is the responsibility of the shareholder or"
"835","their financial intermediary to notify the Fund that the shareholder is"
"836","eligible for the conversion of Class C shares to Class A shares, and the"
"837","shareholder or their financial intermediary may be required to maintain"
"838","and provide the Fund with records that substantiate the holding period of"
"839","Class C shares. It is the financial intermediary's (and not the Fund's)"
"840","responsibility to keep records and to ensure that the shareholder is"
"841","credited with the proper holding period. Please consult with your financial"
"842","intermediary about your shares' eligibility for this conversion feature."
"843","Also effective October 5, 2018, new accounts or plans may not be eligible"
"844","to purchase Class C shares of the Fund if it is determined that the"
"845","intermediary cannot track shareholder holding periods to determine whether"
"846","a shareholder's Class C shares are eligible for conversion to Class A"
"847","shares.  Accounts or plans (and their successor, related and"
"848","affiliated plans) that have Class C shares of the Fund available to"
"849","participants on or before October 5, 2018, may continue to open accounts"
"850","for new participants in such share class and purchase additional shares"

"873","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"874","To the Board of Trustees of Franklin Templeton Money Fund Trust"
"875","and Shareholders of Franklin Templeton U.S. Government Money Fund"
"876","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"877","Franklin Templeton U.S. Government Money Fund (the Fund) as of and"
"878","for the year ended June 30, 2018, in accordance with the standards of"
"879","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),"
"880","we considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"881","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"882","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"883","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN,"
"884","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"885","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"886","do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"887","control over financial reporting."
"888","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"889","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"890","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required"
"891","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"892","A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"893","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"894","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"895","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"896","principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"897","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"898","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"899","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"900","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"901","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"902","with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"903","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"904","authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)"
"905","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"906","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"907","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"908","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"909","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"910","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"911","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"912","that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"913","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"914","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"915","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"916","or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"917","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"918","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"919","a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial"
"920","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"921","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"922","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"923","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"924","in internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"925","weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB.  However, we noted"
"926","no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"927","and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"928","that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"929","June 30, 2018."
"930","This report is intended solely for the information and use of the"
"931","Board of Trustees of Franklin Templeton Money Fund Trust and the"
"932","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
