<FONT size=2 face=Arial>To the Board of Trustees of Vanguard World Fund and Shareholders of Vanguard Global Wellesley Income Fund Vanguard Global Wellington Fund Vanguard International Growth Fund Vanguard Mega Cap Growth Index Fund Vanguard Mega Cap Index Fund Vanguard Mega Cap Value Index Fund and Vanguard U.S. Growth Fund</FONT></P>
<P style=text-align: left;>
<FONT size=2 face=Arial>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Vanguard Global Wellesley Income Fund, Vanguard Global Wellington Fund, Vanguard International Growth Fund, Vanguard Mega Cap Growth Index Fund, Vanguard Mega Cap Index Fund, Vanguard Mega Cap Value Index Fund and Vanguard U.S. Growth Fund (seven of the funds constituting Vanguard World Fund, hereafter collectively referred to as </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>the &#147;Funds&#148;) </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>as of and for the period ended August 31, 2018, in accordance with the </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&#147;PCAOB&#148;), we considered the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting, including control</FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>s over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on th</FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>e effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting.</FONT></P>
<P style=text-align: left;>
<FONT size=2 face=Arial>The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company&#146;s internal control over </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A compan</FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>y&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>on the financial statements.</FONT></P>
<P style=text-align: left;>
<FONT size=2 face=Arial>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</FONT></P>
<P style=text-align: left;>
<FONT size=2 face=Arial>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination</FONT></P>

<FONT size=2 face=Arial>of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>material misstatement of the company&#146;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>detected on a timely basis.</FONT></P>
<P style=text-align: left;>
<FONT size=2 face=Arial>Our consideration of the Funds&#146; internal control over financ</FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>ial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB. However, we noted no deficiencies </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>in the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting and its </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of August 31, 2018.</FONT></P>

<FONT size=2 face=Arial>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Vanguard Consumer Discretionary Index Fund, Vanguard Communication Services Index Fund, Vanguard Consumer Staples Index Fund, Vanguard Energy Index Fund, Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury Index Fund, Vanguard Financials Index Fund, Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund, Vanguard Health Care Index Fund, Vanguard Industrials Index Fund, Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund, Vanguard Materials Index Fund and Vanguard Utilities Index Fund (fourteen of the funds constituting Vanguard World Fund, hereafter </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>collectively referred as the &#147;Funds&#148;) </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>as of and for the year ended August 31, 2018, in accordance with the </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&#147;PCAOB&#148;), we considered the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal co</FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>ntrol over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting.</FONT></P>
<P style=text-align: left;>
<FONT size=2 face=Arial>The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company&#146;s internal control over </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial repor</FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>ting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>the financial statements.</FONT></P>

<P style=text-align: left;>
<FONT size=2 face=Arial>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</FONT></P>
<P style=text-align: left;>
<FONT size=2 face=Arial>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>material misstatement of the company&#146;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>detected on a timely basis.</FONT></P>
<P style=text-align: left;>
<FONT size=2 face=Arial>Our consideration of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB. However, we noted no deficiencies </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>in the Funds&#146; i</FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>nternal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of August 31, 2018.</FONT></P>
