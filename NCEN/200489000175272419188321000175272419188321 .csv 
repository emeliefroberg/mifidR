"2886","of and for the year ended September 30, 2019, in"
"2887","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"2888","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"2889","considered the Funds? internal control over financial"
"2890","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"2891","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"2892","purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial"
"2893","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"

"2895","on the effectiveness of the Funds? internal control over"
"2896","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"2897","opinion."
"2898","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"2899","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"2900","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"2901","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"2902","assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"2903","controls. A fund?s internal control over financial reporting"
"2904","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2905","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"2906","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"2907","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2908","principles. A fund?s internal control over financial"
"2909","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"2910","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"2911","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2912","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"2913","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2914","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2915","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"2916","and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"2917","made only in accordance with authorizations of"

"2921","disposition of a fund?s assets that could have a material"
"2922","effect on the financial statements."
"2923","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2924","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2925","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2926","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"2927","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2928","conditions or that the degree of compliance with the"
"2929","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2930","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"

"2932","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"2933","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"

"2937","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a"
"2938","fund?s annual or interim financial statements will not be"

"2940","Our consideration of the Funds? internal control over"
"2941","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"

"2943","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"2944","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
