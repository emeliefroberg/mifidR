"1820","Opportunities Fund: In planning and performing our audits of"
"1821","the financial statements of Eaton Vance Focused Global"
"1822","Opportunities Fund and Eaton Vance Focused International"
"1823","Opportunities Fund (collectively, the Funds) (certain of the"
"1824","funds constituting Eaton Vance Growth Trust), as of and for"
"1825","the year ended November 30, 2018, in accordance with the"
"1826","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1827","(United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Funds' internal"
"1828","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1829","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1830","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1831","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"1832","Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"1833","on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"1834","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1835","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"1836","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1837","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1838","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1839","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's"
"1840","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed"
"1841","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1842","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1843","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1844","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal"
"1845","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1846","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"1847","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1848","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"1849","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"1850","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1851","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"1852","and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"1853","made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1854","of the fund and trustees of the trust; and (3) provide"
"1855","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1856","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a"
"1857","fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1858","statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1859","control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1860","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1861","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1862","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1863","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"1864","or procedures may deteriorate. A deficiency in internal"
"1865","control over financial reporting exists when the design or"
"1866","operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1867","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1868","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
"1869","basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"1870","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1871","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1872","misstatement of the fund's annual or interim financial"
"1873","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"1874","basis. Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"1875","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"1876","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"1877","deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1878","weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB."
"1879","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal"
"1880","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"1881","controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"1882","material weakness, as defined above, as of November 30,"
