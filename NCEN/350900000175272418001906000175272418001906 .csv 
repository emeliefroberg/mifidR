"4317","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"4318","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"4319","Templeton Global Smaller Companies Fund"
"4320","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"4321","Templeton Global Smaller Companies Fund  (the Fund) as of and for"
"4322","the year ended August 31, 2018, in accordance with the standards of"
"4323","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)"
"4324","(PCAOB), we considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"4325","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"4326","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"4327","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"
"4328","the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"4329","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"4330","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"4331","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"4332","reporting."
"4333","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"4334","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"4335","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"4336","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"4337","costs of controls.  A company's internal control over financial"
"4338","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"4339","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"4340","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"4341","generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal"
"4342","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"4343","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"4344","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"4345","and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"4346","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"4347","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"4348","with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"4349","and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"4350","with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and"
"4351","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"4352","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"4353","company's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"4354","financial statements."
"4355","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"4356","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"4357","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"4358","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"4359","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"4360","procedures may deteriorate."
"4361","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"4362","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"4363","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"4364","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"4365","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"4366","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"4367","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"4368","misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements"
"4369","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"4370","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"4371","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"4372","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"4373","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"4374","weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB."
"4375","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control"
"4376","over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"4377","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness"
"4378","as defined above as of August 31, 2018."
"4379","This report is intended solely for the information and use of the"
"4380","Board of Trustees and the Securities and Exchange Commission and"
"4381","is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"4382","these specified parties."

"4439","EXHIBIT ITEM: Terms of new or amended securities"
"4440","GOF P10 06/18"
"4441","SUPPLEMENT DATED JUNE 8, 2018"
"4442","TO THE CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE PROSPECTUS"
"4443","OF EACH OF THE FUNDS LISTED BELOW"
"4444","Templeton Global Smaller Companies Fund"
"4445","Notice of Automatic Conversion of Class C Shares"
"4446"," to Class A Shares after 10-Year Holding Period"
"4447","At Board meetings held on February 26 and 27, 2018,"
"4448"," the Board of Trustees approved an automatic conversion"
"4449","feature for the Fund's Class C shares"
"4450","(which includes Class C1 shares as applicable)"
"4451","that will automatically convert shareholders'"
"4452","Class C shares into Class A shares of the same Fund"
"4453"," after they have been held for 10 years. After conversion,"
"4454","your new shares will be subject to Class A shares'"
"4455"," lower Rule 12b-1 fees. The conversion feature will become"
"4456"," effective on or about October 5, 2018."
"4457","  Later that month Class C shares of the Fund"
"4458"," that have been outstanding for 10 years or more will"
"4459","automatically convert to Class A shares of such Fund on the basis"
"4460"," of the relative net asset values of the two classes."
"4461"," Thereafter, Class C shares of the Fund will convert automatically"
"4462"," to Class A shares of such Fund on a monthly basis"
"4463","in the month of,"
"4464"," or the month following, the 10-year anniversary of"
"4465","the Class C shares' purchase date. Class C shares of"
"4466","the Fund acquired through automatic reinvestment of dividends"
"4467"," or distributions will convert to Class A shares of the Fund"
"4468","on the conversion date pro rata with the converting Class C shares"
"4469"," of the Fund that were not acquired through reinvestment of dividends"
"4470"," or distributions."
"4471","Shareholders will not pay a sales charge, including a contingent"
"4472"," deferred sales charge, upon the conversion of their Class C shares"
"4473"," to Class A shares pursuant to this conversion feature."
"4474","The automatic conversion of the Fund's Class C shares into"
"4475"," Class A shares after the 10-year holding period is not expected"
"4476","to be a taxable event for federal income tax purposes."
"4477"," Shareholders should consult with their tax advisor regarding"
"4478","the state and local tax consequences of such conversions."
"4479","Class C shares held through a financial intermediary in"
"4480","an omnibus account will be converted into Class A shares"
"4481"," only if the intermediary can document that the shareholder has met"
"4482"," the required holding period. In certain circumstances,"
"4483"," when shares are invested through retirement plans, omnibus accounts,"
"4484"," and in certain other instances, the Fund and its agents"
"4485","may not have transparency into how long a shareholder has held"
"4486"," Class C shares for purposes of determining whether"
"4487","such Class C shares are eligible for automatic conversion"
"4488","into Class A shares and the financial intermediary may not have"
"4489"," the ability to track purchases to credit individual shareholders'"
"4490"," holding periods. This primarily occurs when shares are invested"
"4491","through certain record keepers for group retirement plans,"
"4492"," where the intermediary cannot track share aging at"
"4493","the participant level.  In these circumstances,"
"4494"," the Fund will not be able to automatically convert Class C shares"
"4495"," into Class A shares as described above. In order to determine"
"4496"," eligibility for conversion in these circumstances,"
"4497"," it is the responsibility of the shareholder or"
"4498","their financial intermediary to notify the Fund that"
"4499"," the shareholder is eligible for the conversion of Class C shares"
"4500"," to Class A shares, and the shareholder or their financial"
"4501"," intermediary may be required to maintain and provide"
"4502","the Fund with records that substantiate the holding period"
"4503","of Class C shares. It is the financial intermediary's"
"4504","(and not the Fund's) responsibility to keep records"
"4505","and to ensure that the shareholder is credited with"
"4506"," the proper holding period. Please consult with"
"4507"," your financial intermediary about your shares'"
"4508"," eligibility for this conversion feature."
"4509","Also effective October 5, 2018, new accounts or"
"4510"," plans may not be eligible to purchase Class C shares of"
"4511","the Fund if it is determined that the intermediary"
"4512","cannot track shareholder holding periods to"
"4513","determine whether a shareholder's Class C shares are eligible"
"4514"," for conversion to Class A shares.  Accounts or plans"
"4515","(and their successor, related and affiliated plans)"
"4516","that have Class C shares of the Fund available to participants"
"4517"," on or before October 5, 2018, may continue to open accounts"
"4518","for new participants in such share class and purchase"
"4519","additional shares in existing participant accounts."
"4520","The Fund has no responsibility for overseeing, monitoring"
"4521","or implementing a financial intermediary's process"
"4522","for determining whether a shareholder meets the required"
"4523","holding period for conversion."
"4524","A financial intermediary may sponsor and/or control accounts,"
"4525"," programs or platforms that impose a different conversion schedule"
"4526"," or different eligibility requirements for the conversion"
"4527","of Class C shares into Class A shares. In these cases,"
"4528","Class C shareholders may convert to Class A shares under"
"4529"," the policies of the financial intermediary and the conversion"
"4530"," may be structured as an exchange of Class C shares"
"4531"," for Class A shares of the same Fund. Financial intermediaries"
"4532","will be responsible for making such exchanges in those circumstances."
"4533"," Please consult with your financial intermediary"
"4534"," if you have any questions regarding your shares'"
"4535","conversion from Class C shares to Class A shares."
