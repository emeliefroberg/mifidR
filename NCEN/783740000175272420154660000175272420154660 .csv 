"11446","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express"
"11447","no such opinion."
"11448","The management of the Trust is responsible for"
"11449","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"11450","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"

"11456","and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"11457","purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted"
"11458","accounting principles. A company's internal control over"

"11478","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"11479","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"

"11481","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"

"11570","that transactions are recorded as necessary"

"11572","in accordance with generally accepted"

"11579","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition"
"11580","of a fund's assets that could have a material"

"11582","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
