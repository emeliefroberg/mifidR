"10513","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements and financial highlights for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles"
"10514","(GAAP). A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"

"10520","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"10521","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds&#146; annual or interim financial statements and financial highlights will not be prevented or detected"
