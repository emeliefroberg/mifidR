"543","Opinion on the Financial Statements"

"547","Value Line Asset Allocation Fund, Inc. (hereafter"

"551","assets for each of the two years in the period ended"
"552","March 31, 2019, including the related notes, and the"
"553","financial highlights for each of the periods indicated"
"554","therein (collectively referred to as the financial
statements). In our opinion, the financial statements"
"555","present fairly, in all material respects, the financial"
"556","position of the Funds as of March 31, 2019, the results of"
"557","their operations for the year then ended, the changes in"
"558","their net assets for each of the two years in the period"

"560","each of the periods indicated therein in conformity with"
"561","accounting principles generally accepted in the United"
"562","States of America."
"563","Basis for Opinion"
"564","These financial statements are the responsibility of the"
"565","Funds' management. Our responsibility is to express an"
"566","opinion on the Funds' financial statements based on our"
"567","audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the"
"568","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"569","States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with"
"570","respect to the Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal"
"571","securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of"
"572","the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB."
"573","We conducted our audits of these financial statements in"
"574","accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those"
"575","standards require that we plan and perform the audit to"
"576","obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial"
"577","statements are free of material misstatement, whether"
"578","due to error or fraud."
"579","Our audits included performing procedures to assess the"
"580","risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,"
"581","whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures"
"582","that respond to those risks. Such procedures included"
"583","examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the"
"584","amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our"
"585","audits also included evaluating the accounting principles"
"586","used and significant estimates made by management, as"
"587","well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial"
"588","statements. Our procedures included confirmation of"
"589","securities owned as of March 31, 2019 by correspondence"
"590","with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not"
"591","received from brokers, we performed other auditing"
"592","procedures. We believe that our audits provide a"
"593","reasonable basis for our opinion."

"623","financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an"
"624","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"625","over financial reporting."
"626","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"627","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"628","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"629","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"630","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"631","A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"632","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"633","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"634","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"635","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"636","principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"637","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"638","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"639","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"640","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"641","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"642","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"643","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"644","and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"645","made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"646","management and directors of the fund; and (3) provide"
"647","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"648","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"649","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"650","financial statements."
"651","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"652","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"653","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"654","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"655","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"656","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"657","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"658","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"659","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"660","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"661","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"662","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"663","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"664","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"665","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"666","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"667","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"668","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"669","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"670","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"671","all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting"
"672","that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"673","established by the PCAOB. However, we noted no"
"674","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"675","reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"676","safeguarding securities that we consider to be material"
"677","weaknesses as defined above as of March 31, 2019."
