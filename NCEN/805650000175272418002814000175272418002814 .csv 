"1397","Section 1.	Division of Beneficial Interest."
"1398","(a)	The beneficial interest in the Trust shall be divided into Shares,"
"1399"," each Share without a par value.  The number of Shares in the Trust"
"1400"," authorized hereunder, and of each Series and Class as may be established"
"1401"," from time to time, is unlimited.  The Board of Trustees may authorize the"
"1402"," division of Shares into separate Classes of Shares and into separate and"
"1403","distinct Series of Shares and the division of any Series into separate"
"1404","Classes of Shares in accordance with the 1940 Act.  The different Series"
"1405"," and Classes shall be established and designated pursuant to Article III,"
"1406","Section 6 hereof.  If no separate Series or Classes of Series shall be"
"1407","established, the Shares shall have the rights, powers and duties provided"
"1408"," for herein and in Article III, Section 6 hereof to the extent relevant"
"1409"," and not otherwise provided for herein, and all references to Series and"
"1410"," Classes shall be construed (as the context may require) to refer to the"
"1411","Trust."
"1412","The fact that the Trust shall have one or more established and designated"
"1413"," Classes of the Trust, shall not limit the authority of the Board of"
"1414","Trustees to establish and designate additional Classes of the Trust.  The"
"1415","fact that one or more Classes of the Trust shall have initially been"
"1416"," established and designated without any specific establishment or"
"1417","designation of a Series (i.e., that all Shares of the Trust are initially"
"1418"," Shares of one or more Classes) shall not limit the authority of the"
"1419","Board of Trustees to later establish and designate a Series and establish"
"1420"," and designate the Class or Classes of the Trust as Class or Classes,"
"1421","respectively, of such Series."
"1422","	The fact that a Series shall have initially been established and"
"1423"," designated without any specific establishment or designation of Classes"
"1424"," (i.e., that all Shares of such Series are initially of a single Class)"
"1425"," shall not limit the authority of the Board of Trustees to establish and"
"1426"," designate separate Classes of said Series.  The fact that a Series shall"
"1427"," have more than one established and designated Class, shall not limit the"
"1428","authority of the Board of Trustees to establish and designate additional"
"1429","Classes of said Series."
"1430","(b)	The Board of Trustees shall have the power to issue authorized,"
"1431","but unissued Shares of the Trust, or any Series and Class thereof, from"
"1432"," time to time for such consideration paid wholly or partly in cash,"
"1433","securities or other property, as may be determined from time to time by"
"1434","the Board of Trustees, subject to any requirements or limitations of the"
"1435","1940 Act.  The Board of Trustees, on behalf of the Trust, may acquire and"
"1436"," hold as treasury shares, reissue for such consideration and on such terms"
"1437"," as it may determine, or cancel, at its discretion from time to time, any"
"1438","Shares reacquired by the Trust.  The Board of Trustees may classify,"
"1439","reclassify or convert any unissued Shares or any Shares of the Trust or"
"1440","any Series or Class thereof, that were previously issued and are"
"1441","reacquired, into one or more Series or Classes that may be established"
"1442"," and designated from time to time and, in connection therewith, cause"
"1443","some or all of the Shareholders of the Trust, such Series or Class to"
"1444","become Shareholders of such other Series or Class.  Notwithstanding the"
"1445"," foregoing, the Trust and any Series thereof may acquire, hold, sell and"
"1446"," otherwise deal in, for purposes of investment or otherwise, the Shares"
"1447","of any other Series of the Trust or Shares of the Trust, and such Shares"
"1448","shall not be deemed treasury shares or cancelled."
"1449","(c)	Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Article III, each"
"1450","Share shall entitle the holder to voting rights as provided in Article V"
"1451","hereof.  Shareholders shall have no preemptive or other right to subscribe"
"1452"," for new or additional authorized, but unissued Shares or other securities"
"1453"," issued by the Trust or any Series thereof.  The Board of Trustees may"
"1454","from time to time divide or combine the Shares of the Trust or any"
"1455","particular Series thereof into a greater or lesser number of Shares of"
"1456"," the Trust or that Series, respectively.  Such division or combination"
"1457"," shall not materially change the proportionate beneficial interests of"
"1458"," the holders of Shares of the Trust or that Series, as the case may be,"

"1648","reflected (in a manner determined by the Board of Trustees) and may affect"
"1649"," the net asset value attributable to, and the dividend, redemption and"
"1650","liquidation rights of, such Class.  Each allocation of liabilities, debts,"

"1670"," such a right or claim hereunder as a Shareholder of such other Series."
"1671"," The Board of Trustees shall have full discretion, to the extent not"
"1672","inconsistent with the 1940 Act, to determine which items shall be treated"
"1673","as income and which items as capital; and each such determination and"
"1674","allocation shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders."
"1675","(d)	Voting.  All Shares of the Trust entitled to vote on a matter"
"1676","shall vote in the aggregate without differentiation between the Shares"
"1677","of the separate Series, if any, or separate Classes, if any; provided"
"1678","that (i) with respect to any matter that affects only the interests of"

"1906","what is in the best interests of the Trust or any Series or Class thereof"
"1907","and its Shareholders made by the Board of Trustees in good faith shall be"
"1908"," conclusive.  In construing the provisions of this Declaration of Trust,"
"1909","the presumption shall be in favor of a grant of power to the Board of"
"1910"," Trustees."
"1911","The Trustees shall be subject to the same fiduciary duties to which the"
"1912","directors of a Delaware corporation would be subject if the Trust were a"
"1913"," Delaware corporation, the Shareholders were shareholders of such"
"1914"," Delaware corporation and the Trustees were directors of such Delaware"
"1915"," corporation, and such modified duties shall replace any fiduciary"
"1916","duties to which the Trustees would otherwise be subject.  Without limiting"
"1917"," the generality of the foregoing, all actions and omissions of the"
"1918"," Trustees shall be evaluated under the doctrine commonly referred to as"
"1919"," the business judgment rule, as defined and developed under Delaware"
"1920","law, to the same extent that the same actions or omissions of directors"
"1921"," of a Delaware corporation in a substantially similar circumstance"
"1922","would be evaluated under such doctrine.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,"
"1923","the provisions of this Declaration of Trust and the By-Laws, to the"
"1924","extent that they restrict or eliminate the duties (including fiduciary"
"1925","duties) and liabilities relating thereto of a Trustee otherwise applicable"
"1926"," under the foregoing standard or otherwise existing at law or in equity,"
"1927"," are agreed by each Shareholder and the Trust to replace such other duties"
"1928"," and liabilities of such Trustee."
"1929","(b)	Other Business Interests.  The Trustees shall devote to the affairs"
"1930","of the Trust (including every Series thereof) such time as may be"
"1931","necessary for the proper performance of their duties hereunder, but"
"1932","neither the Trustees nor the officers, directors, shareholders, partners"
"1933","or employees of the Trustees, if any, shall be expected to devote their"
"1934","full time to the performance of such duties.  The Trustees, or any"
"1935","Affiliate, shareholder, officer, director, partner or employee thereof, or"
"1936","any Person owning a legal or beneficial interest therein, may engage in,"
"1937"," or possess an interest in, any business or venture other than the Trust"
"1938","or any Series thereof, of any nature and description, independently or"
"1939"," with or for the account of others.  None of the Trust, any Series thereof"
"1940"," or any Shareholder shall have the right to participate or share in such"
"1941"," other business or venture or any profit or compensation derived"
"1942","therefrom."

"1950","1 and 6 of the By-Laws and except as otherwise provided herein or required"
"1951"," by applicable law, the vote of not less than a majority of the Trustees"
"1952"," present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the"

"1957","of the Trust or any particular Series or Class thereof, or partly out of"
"1958"," the principal and partly out of the income of the Trust or any particular"
"1959"," Series or Class thereof, and charge or allocate the same to, between or"

"1974","Section 5.	Payment of Expenses by Shareholders.  The Board of Trustees"
"1975"," shall have the power, as frequently as it may determine, to cause any"
"1976"," Shareholder to pay directly, in advance or arrears, an amount fixed from"
"1977","time to time by the Board of Trustees or an officer of the Trust for"
"1978","charges of the Trust's custodian or transfer, dividend disbursing,"
"1979","shareholder servicing or similar agent-which are not customarily"
"1980","charged generally to the Trust, a Series or a Class, where such"
"1981","services are provided to such Shareholder individually, rather than"
"1982"," to all Shareholders collectively, by setting off such amount due from"
"1983","such Shareholder from the amount of (i) declared but unpaid dividends"
"1984"," or distributions owed such Shareholder, or (ii) proceeds from the"

"2394","(b)	An Agent shall be liable to the Trust and to any Shareholder"
"2395","for any act or omission that constitutes a bad faith violation of the"

"2398"," disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such Agent (such"
"2399","conduct referred to herein as Disqualifying Conduct), and for nothing"
"2400"," else."
"2401","(c)	Subject to subsection (b) of this Section 1 and to the fullest"
"2402","extent that limitations on the liability of Agents are permitted by the"
"2403","DSTA, the Agents shall not be responsible or liable in any event for any"
"2404","act or omission of any other Agent of the Trust or any Investment Adviser"
"2405"," or Principal Underwriter of the Trust."
"2406","(d)	No Agent, when acting in its respective capacity as such, shall be"

"2411","performance of his or her duties, be fully and completely justified and"
"2412","protected with regard to any act or any failure to act resulting from"
"2413","reliance in good faith upon the books of account or other records of the"
"2414","Trust, upon an opinion of counsel, or upon reports made to the Trust by"
"2415","any of its officers or employees or by the Investment Adviser, the"

"2437","or political act of any foreign government to which such assets might be"
"2438","exposed, except, in the case of a Trustee or officer, for liability"
"2439","resulting from such Trustee's or officer's Disqualifying Conduct."
"2440","(g)	The limitation on liability contained in this Article applies to"
"2441"," events occurring at the time a Person serves as an Agent whether or not"
"2442","such Person is an Agent at the time of any Proceeding in which liability"

"2448","(a)	Indemnification by Trust.  The Trust shall indemnify, out of Trust"
"2449","Property, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any Person"
"2450"," who was or is a party, potential party or non-party witness or is"
"2451","threatened to be made a party, potential party or non-party witness to"
"2452","any Proceeding by reason of the fact that such Person is or was an Agent"
"2453","of the Trust, against Expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other"
"2454","amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such"
"2455"," Proceeding if such Person acted in good faith or in the case of a"
"2456"," criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct"
"2457"," of such Person was unlawful.  The termination of any Proceeding by"
"2458","judgment, order, settlement, conviction or plea of nolo contendere or"
"2459","its equivalent shall not of itself create a presumption that the Person"
"2460"," did not act in good faith or that the Person had reasonable cause to"
"2461","believe that the Person's conduct was unlawful."
"2462","(b)	Exclusion of Indemnification.  Notwithstanding any provision to"
"2463"," the contrary contained herein, there shall be no right to"
"2464","indemnification for any liability arising by reason of the Agent's"

"2466"," to which that Person shall have been adjudged to be liable in the"
"2467","performance of that Person's duty to the Trust or the Shareholders,"
"2468","indemnification shall be made only to the extent that the court in which"
"2469"," that action was brought shall determine, upon application or otherwise,"
"2470"," that in view of all the circumstances of the case, that Person was not"
"2471","liable by reason of that Person's Disqualifying Conduct."
"2472","(c)	Required Approval.  Any indemnification under this Article shall"
"2473"," be made by the Trust if authorized in the specific case on a"
"2474","determination that indemnification of the Agent is proper in the"
"2475","circumstances by (i) a final decision on the merits by a court or other"
"2476","body before whom the proceeding was brought that the Agent was not liable"
"2477"," by reason of Disqualifying Conduct (including, but not limited to,"
"2478","dismissal of either a court action or an administrative proceeding"
"2479","against the Agent for insufficiency of evidence of any Disqualifying"
"2480"," Conduct) or, (ii) in the absence of such a decision, a reasonable"
"2481","determination, based upon a review of the facts, that the Agent was"
"2482","not liable by reason of Disqualifying Conduct, by (1) the vote of a"
"2483","majority of a quorum of the Trustees who are not (x) interested persons"
"2484"," of the Trust as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, (y) parties"
"2485"," to the proceeding, or (z) parties who have any economic or other"
"2486"," interest in connection with such specific case (the disinterested,
non-party Trustees); or (2) by independent legal counsel in a written"
"2487"," opinion."
"2488","(d)	Advancement of Expenses.  Expenses incurred by an Agent in"
"2489","defending any Proceeding may be advanced by the Trust before the final"
"2490","disposition of the Proceeding on receipt of an undertaking by or on"
"2491","behalf of the Agent to repay the amount of the advance if it shall be"
"2492","determined ultimately that the Agent is not entitled to be indemnified"
"2493"," as authorized in this Article; provided, that at least one of the"
"2494","following conditions for the advancement of expenses is met: (i) the"
"2495","Agent shall provide a security for his undertaking, (ii) the Trust"
"2496","shall be insured against losses arising by reason of any lawful advances,"
"2497"," or (iii) a majority of a quorum of the disinterested, non-party"
"2498"," Trustees of the Trust, or an independent legal counsel in a written"
"2499","opinion, shall determine, based on a review of readily available facts"
"2500","(as opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), that there is reason to"
"2501"," believe that the Agent ultimately will be found entitled to"
"2502","indemnification."
"2503","(e)	Other Contractual Rights.  Nothing contained in this Article"
"2504","shall affect any right to indemnification to which Persons other than"
"2505","Trustees and officers of the Trust or any subsidiary thereof may be"

"2507","(f)	Fiduciaries of Employee Benefit Plan.  This Article does not"
"2508","apply to any Proceeding against any trustee, investment manager or other"
"2509"," fiduciary of an employee benefit plan in that Person's capacity as such,"
"2510"," even though that Person may also be an Agent of the Trust as defined in"
"2511","Section 1 of this Article.  Nothing contained in this Article shall limit"
"2512","any right to indemnification to which such a trustee, investment manager,"
"2513"," or other fiduciary may be entitled by contract or otherwise which shall"
"2514","be enforceable to the extent permitted by applicable law other than this"
"2515","Article."
"2516","(g)	Joint and Several Obligations.  Notwithstanding any other provision"
"2517"," in this Declaration of Trust to the contrary, any amount of"
"2518"," indemnification and any advancement of expenses that any Agent is"
"2519","entitled to be paid under Section 2 shall be deemed to be joint and"
"2520","several obligations of the Trust and each Series, and the assets of the"
"2521"," Trust and each Series shall be subject to the claims of any Agent"
"2522","therefore under this Article VII; provided that any such liability,"
"2523","expense or obligation may be allocated and charged by the Board of"
"2524"," Trustees between or among the Trust and/or any one or more Series"
"2525","(and Classes) in such manner as the Board of Trustees in its sole"
"2526","discretion deem fair and equitable."
"2527","Section 3.	Insurance.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable"
"2528"," law, the Board of Trustees shall have the authority to purchase with"
"2529"," Trust Property, insurance for liability and for all Expenses reasonably"
"2530","incurred or paid or expected to be paid by an Agent in connection with"
"2531","any Proceeding in which such Agent becomes involved by virtue of such"
"2532","Agent's actions, or omissions to act, in its capacity or former"
"2533","capacity with the Trust, whether or not the Trust would have the power"
"2534"," to indemnify such Agent against such liability."
"2535","Section 4.	Derivative Actions.  In addition to the requirements set"
"2536","forth in Section 3816 of the DSTA, a Shareholder or Shareholders may bring"
"2537"," a derivative action on behalf of the Trust only if the following"
"2538","conditions are met:"
"2539","(a)	The Shareholder or Shareholders must make a pre-suit demand upon the"
"2540"," Board of Trustees to bring the subject action unless an effort to cause"
"2541","the Board of Trustees to bring such an action is not likely to succeed."
"2542","For purposes of this Section 4, a demand on the Board of Trustees shall"
"2543","only be deemed not likely to succeed and therefore excused if a majority"
"2544","of the Board of Trustees, or a majority of any committee established to"
"2545","consider the merits of such action, is composed of Trustees who are not"
"2546","independent trustees (as such term is defined in the DSTA)."
"2547","(b)	Unless a demand is not required under paragraph (a) of this Section"
"2548"," 4, Shareholders eligible to bring such derivative action under the DSTA"
"2549"," who hold at least 10% of the outstanding Shares of the Trust, or 10% of"
"2550","the outstanding Shares of the Series or Class to which such action"
"2551","relates, shall join in the request for the Board of Trustees to commence"
"2552"," such action; and"
"2553","(c)	Unless a demand is not required under paragraph (a) of this"
"2554","Section 4, the Board of Trustees must be afforded a reasonable amount of"
"2555"," time to consider such Shareholder request and to investigate the basis"
"2556","of such claim.  The Board of Trustees shall be entitled to retain counsel"
"2557"," or other advisors in considering the merits of the request and shall"
"2558","require an undertaking by the Shareholders making such request to"
"2559","reimburse the Trust for the expense of any such advisors in the event"
"2560"," that the Board of Trustees determine not to bring such action."
"2561","For purposes of this Section 4, the Board of Trustees may designate a"

"2945","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2946","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"2947","Franklin Rising Dividends Fund"
"2948","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"2949"," of Franklin Rising Dividends Fund (the Fund) as of and for"
"2950","the year ended September 30, 2018, in accordance with the standards"
"2951"," of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)"
"2952","(PCAOB), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"2953","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"2954"," as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2955"," expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"2956","with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"2957","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"2958"," control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express"
"2959"," an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"2960"," over financial reporting."
"2961","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"2962","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"2963","  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"2964"," management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"2965","related costs of controls.  A company's internal control over"
"2966"," financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"2967"," assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"2968","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"2969"," accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"2970"," A company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"2971"," those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"2972"," of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2973","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"2974","the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"2975"," are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"2976","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2977","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"2978"," are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"2979"," and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"2980"," regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"2981","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"2982","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2983","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2984"," financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2985","  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"2986"," periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"2987"," because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"2988"," with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2989","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2990"," when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"2991"," or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"2992","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"2993","  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"2994","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"2995"," such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"2996"," misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial"
"2997","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2998","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"2999"," reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"3000","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"3001","in internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"3002"," weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB.  However,"
"3003","we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over"
"3004","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"3005"," safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material"
"3006","weakness as defined above as of September 30, 2018."
"3007","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"3008","the Board of Trustees of Franklin Custodian Funds and the Securities"
"3009"," and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not"
"3010"," be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"3026","GOF P10 06/18"
"3027","SUPPLEMENT DATED JUNE 8, 2018"
"3028","TO THE CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE PROSPECTUS"
"3029","OF EACH OF THE FUNDS LISTED BELOW"
"3030","Franklin Managed Trust"
"3031","Franklin Rising Dividends Fund"
"3032","Notice of Automatic Conversion of Class C Shares to Class A Shares after"
"3033","10-Year Holding Period"
"3034","At Board meetings held on February 26 and 27, 2018, the Board of"
"3035","Trustees approved an automatic conversion feature for the Fund's Class C"
"3036","shares (which includes Class C1 shares as applicable) that will"
"3037","automatically convert shareholders' Class C shares into Class A shares"
"3038","of the same Fund after they have been held for 10 years. After conversion,"
"3039"," your new shares will be subject to Class A shares' lower Rule 12b-1 fees."
"3040"," The conversion feature will become effective on or about October 5, 2018."
"3041"," Later that month Class C shares of the Fund that have been outstanding"
"3042"," for 10 years or more will automatically convert to Class A shares of such"
"3043"," Fund on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes."
"3044"," Thereafter, Class C shares of the Fund will convert automatically to"
"3045"," Class A shares of such Fund on a monthly basis in the month of, or the"
"3046"," month following, the 10-year anniversary of the Class C shares' purchase"
"3047"," date. Class C shares of the Fund acquired through automatic reinvestment"
"3048"," of dividends or distributions will convert to Class A shares of the Fund"
"3049"," on the conversion date pro rata with the converting Class C shares of the"
"3050"," Fund that were not acquired through reinvestment of dividends or"
"3051"," distributions."
"3052","Shareholders will not pay a sales charge, including a contingent deferred"
"3053","sales charge, upon the conversion of their Class C shares to Class A"
"3054","shares pursuant to this conversion feature. The automatic conversion"
"3055","of the Fund's Class C shares into Class A shares after the 10-year"
"3056","holding period is not expected to be a taxable event for federal income"
"3057"," tax purposes. Shareholders should consult with their tax advisor"
"3058"," regarding the state and local tax consequences of such conversions."
"3059","Class C shares held through a financial intermediary in an omnibus"
"3060","account will be converted into Class A shares only if the intermediary"
"3061"," can document that the shareholder has met the required holding period."
"3062"," In certain circumstances, when shares are invested through retirement"
"3063"," plans, omnibus accounts, and in certain other instances, the Fund and"
"3064"," its agents may not have transparency into how long a shareholder has"
"3065"," held Class C shares for purposes of determining whether such Class C"
"3066"," shares are eligible for automatic conversion into Class A shares and"
"3067"," the financial intermediary may not have the ability to track purchases"
"3068"," to credit individual shareholders' holding periods.  This primarily"
"3069"," occurs when shares are invested through certain record keepers for"
"3070"," group retirement plans, where the intermediary cannot track share"
"3071"," aging at the participant level.  In these circumstances, the Fund"
"3072"," will not be able to automatically convert Class C shares into Class A"
"3073"," shares as described above. In order to determine eligibility for"
"3074"," conversion in these circumstances, it is the responsibility of the"
"3075"," shareholder or their financial intermediary to notify the Fund that"
"3076"," the shareholder is eligible for the conversion of Class C shares to"
"3077"," Class A shares, and the shareholder or their financial intermediary"
"3078"," may be required to maintain and provide the Fund with records that"
"3079"," substantiate the holding period of Class C shares. It is the financial"
"3080"," intermediary's (and not the Fund's) responsibility to keep records and"
"3081"," to ensure that the shareholder is credited with the proper holding"
"3082"," period. Please consult with your financial intermediary about your"
"3083"," shares' eligibility for this conversion feature."
"3084","Also effective October 5, 2018, new accounts or plans may not be"
"3085","eligible to purchase Class C shares of the Fund if it is determined"
"3086","that the intermediary cannot track shareholder holding periods to"
"3087","determine whether a shareholder's Class C shares are eligible for"
"3088","conversion to Class A shares.  Accounts or plans (and their successor,"
"3089","related and affiliated plans) that have Class C shares of the Fund"
"3090","available to participants on or before October 5, 2018, may continue"
"3091","to open accounts for new participants in such share class and purchase"
"3092"," additional shares in existing participant accounts.  The Fund has no"
"3093"," responsibility for overseeing, monitoring or implementing a financial"
"3094"," intermediary's process for determining whether a shareholder meets the"
"3095"," required holding period for conversion."
"3096","A financial intermediary may sponsor and/or control accounts, programs"
"3097","or platforms that impose a different conversion schedule or different"
"3098","eligibility requirements for the conversion of Class C shares into Class"
"3099"," A shares. In these cases, Class C shareholders may convert to Class A"
"3100"," shares under the policies of the financial intermediary and the"
"3101"," conversion may be structured as an exchange of Class C shares for Class A"
"3102"," shares of the same Fund. Financial intermediaries will be responsible"
"3103"," for making such exchanges in those circumstances. Please consult with"
"3104"," your financial intermediary if you have any questions regarding your"
"3105"," shares' conversion from Class C shares to Class A shares."

"3377"," (as defined in Section 3806 of the DSTA) or otherwise) by the Shareholder"

"3389"," counted; provided, however, that no proxy shall be valid after the"
"3390"," expiration of eleven (11) months from the date of the proxy unless"
"3391"," otherwise expressly provided in the proxy.  The revocability of a proxy"
"3392"," that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the"

"3399"," the Board does not act, the president, any vice president or the"

"3401"," defined in Section 3806 of the DSTA), telephonic, computerized,"
"3402"," telecommunications or other reasonable alternative to the execution"
"3403"," of a written instrument authorizing the holder of the proxy to act."
