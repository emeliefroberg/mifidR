"1881","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1882","To the Board of Trustees of Franklin Templeton International Trust"
"1883","and Franklin India Growth Fund"
"1884","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1885","statements of Franklin India Growth Fund (the"
"1886","Fund) as of and for the year ended October 31, 2018,"
"1887","in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1888","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),"
"1889","we considered the Fund's internal"
"1890","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1891","securities, as a basis for designing"
"1892","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"1893","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"1894","of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1895","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"1896","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1897","Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"1898","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1899","maintaining effective internal control"
"1900","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"1901","and judgments by management are"
"1902","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"1903","A company's internal control over"
"1904","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1905","assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1906","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"1907","for external purposes in accordance with"
"1908","generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"1909","over financial reporting includes"
"1910","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1911","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1912","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"1913","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"1914","to permit preparation of financial"
"1915","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"1916","and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only"
"1917","in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1918","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1919","regarding prevention or timely detection"
"1920","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"1921","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1922","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1923","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"1924","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject"
"1925","to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes"
"1926","in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"1927","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1928","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1929","when the design or operation of a control"
"1930","does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1931","performing their assigned functions, to"
"1932","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness"
"1933","is a deficiency, or a combination"
"1934","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that"
"1935","there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1936","material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial"
"1937","statements will not be prevented or"
"1938","detected on a timely basis."
"1939","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"1940","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"1941","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over"
"1942","financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"1943","established by the PCAOB."
"1944","However, we noted the following deficiency in the Fund's internal"
"1945","control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"1946","over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness"
"1947","as defined above as of October 31, 2018."
"1948","Management and PwC identified that at October 31, 2018, management's"
"1949","controls were ineffective related to internal control over financial"
"1950","reporting specific to the monitoring of market events following the close"
"1951","of trading in foreign stock markets that assist in determining the"
"1952","reliability of the values of the foreign securities held by the Fund"
"1953","and which may require the use of fair valuation factors to"
"1954","account for changes in the values of those securities subsequent"
"1955","to the local close of the foreign market but prior to the net"
"1956","asset calculation of the Fund. This material weakness did not result"
"1957","in misstatements in the Fund's interim or annual financial statements."
"1958","However, this material weakness could result in misstatements of security"
"1959","values and unrealized gains or losses and associated disclosures"
"1960","that would result in a material misstatement of the financial statements"
"1961","that would not be prevented or detected."
"1962","As a result, a material weakness exists at October 31, 2018 for the Fund."
"1963","Management has reinforced with the pricing personnel the importance of"
"1964","timely monitoring of market events following the close of trading and,"
"1965","after October 31, 2018 but prior to the issuance of the financial statements,"
"1966"," the controls were further enhanced through the implementation of a daily"
"1967","secondary review of market events following the close of trading on foreign"
"1968","stock markets to ensure the appropriate application of market level"
"1969","fair value. We have not performed any procedures to assess this"
"1970","corrective action, including its sufficiency in addressing"

"2428","SHARES"
"2429","Section 1.	Division of Beneficial Interest."
"2430","(a)	The beneficial interest in the Trust shall be divided"
"2431","into Shares, each Share without a par value.  The number of"
"2432"," Shares in the Trust authorized hereunder, and of each Series"
"2433"," and Class as may be established from time to time, is unlimited."
"2434","  The Board of Trustees may authorize the division of Shares"
"2435","into separate Classes of Shares and into separate and distinct"
"2436"," Series of Shares and the division of any Series into separate"
"2437"," Classes of Shares in accordance with the 1940 Act."
"2438","The different Series and Classes shall be established and"
"2439"," designated pursuant to Article III, Section 6 hereof."
"2440","If no separate Series or Classes of Series shall be established,"
"2441"," the Shares shall have the rights, powers and duties provided"
"2442"," for herein and in Article III, Section 6 hereof to the extent"
"2443","relevant and not otherwise provided for herein, and all references"
"2444","to Series and Classes shall be construed (as the context may require)"
"2445"," to refer to the Trust."
"2446","	The fact that the Trust shall have one or more established"
"2447"," and designated Classes of the Trust, shall not limit the authority"
"2448"," of the Board of Trustees to establish and designate additional"
"2449","Classes of the Trust.  The fact that one or more Classes of the"
"2450","Trust shall have initially been established and designated without"
"2451"," any specific establishment or designation of a Series"
"2452","(i.e., that all Shares of the Trust are initially Shares"
"2453"," of one or more Classes) shall not limit the authority of"
"2454"," the Board of Trustees to later establish and designate a"
"2455","Series and establish and designate the Class or Classes of"
"2456"," the Trust as Class or Classes, respectively, of such Series."
"2457","	The fact that a Series shall have initially been"
"2458","established and designated without any specific establishmentl"
"2459"," or designation of Classes (i.e., that all Shares of such"
"2460"," Series are initially of a single Class) shall not limit"
"2461","the authority of the Board of Trustees to establish and"
"2462","designate separate Classes of said Series.  The fact that"
"2463"," a Series shall have more than one established and designated Class,"
"2464"," shall not limit the authority of the Board of Trustees to"
"2465","establish and designate additional Classes of said Series."
"2466","(b)	The Board of Trustees shall have the power to issue"
"2467"," authorized, but unissued Shares of the Trust, or any Series"
"2468","and Class thereof, from time to time for such consideration"
"2469"," paid wholly or partly in cash, securities or other property,"
"2470","as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Trustees,"
"2471"," subject to any requirements or limitations of the 1940 Act."
"2472","  The Board of Trustees, on behalf of the Trust, may acquire and"
"2473"," hold as treasury shares, reissue for such consideration and on"
"2474"," such terms as it may determine, or cancel, at its discretion"
"2475"," from time to time, any Shares reacquired by the Trust."
"2476","The Board of Trustees may classify, reclassify or convert"
"2477","any unissued Shares or any Shares of the Trust or any Series"
"2478","or Class thereof, that were previously issued and are reacquired,"
"2479"," into one or more Series or Classes that may be established and"
"2480"," designated from time to time and, in connection therewith,"
"2481"," cause some or all of the Shareholders of the Trust, such"
"2482"," Series or Class to become Shareholders of such other"
"2483"," Series or Class.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the"
"2484"," Trust and any Series thereof may acquire, hold, sell"
"2485"," and otherwise deal in, for purposes of investment or"
"2486"," otherwise, the Shares of any other Series of the Trust"
"2487"," or Shares of the Trust, and such Shares shall not be"
"2488","deemed treasury shares or cancelled."
"2489","(c)	Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this"
"2490"," Article III, each Share shall entitle the holder to"
"2491"," voting rights as provided in Article V hereof."
"2492"," Shareholders shall have no preemptive or other right"
"2493","to subscribe for new or additional authorized, but unissued"
"2494"," Shares or other securities issued by the Trust or any Series"
"2495"," thereof.  The Board of Trustees may from time to time divide"
"2496"," or combine the Shares of the Trust or any particular Series"
"2497"," thereof into a greater or lesser number of Shares of the"
"2498","Trust or that Series, respectively.  Such division or combination"
"2499"," shall not materially change the proportionate beneficial interests"
"2500"," of the holders of Shares of the Trust or that Series, as the case"
"2501"," may be, in the Trust Property at the time of such division or"
"2502","combination that is held with respect to the Trust or that Series,"
"2503"," as the case may be."
"2504","(d)	Any Trustee, officer or other agent of the Trust, and any"
"2505"," organization in which any such Person has an economic or other"
"2506"," interest, may acquire, own, hold and dispose of Shares in the"
"2507"," Trust or any Series and Class thereof, whether such Shares"
"2508","are authorized but unissued, or already outstanding, to the"
"2509"," same extent as if such Person were not a Trustee, officer"
"2510","or other agent of the Trust; and the Trust or any Series may"
"2511"," issue and sell and may purchase such Shares from any such"
"2512","Person or any such organization, subject to the limitations,"
"2513"," restrictions or other provisions applicable to the sale or"
"2514"," purchase of such Shares herein and the 1940 Act."
"2515","Section 2.	Ownership of Shares.  The ownership of Shares"

"2517"," or by a transfer or similar agent for the Trust, which books"
"2518"," shall be maintained separately for the Shares of the Trust"
"2519","and each Series and each Class thereof that has been established"
"2520"," and designated.  No certificates certifying the ownership of"
"2521","Shares shall be issued except as the Board of Trustees may"
"2522","otherwise determine from time to time.  The Board of Trustees"
"2523"," may make such rules not inconsistent with the provisions of"
"2524","the 1940 Act as it considers appropriate for the issuance of"
"2525"," Share certificates, the transfer of Shares of the Trust and"
"2526"," each Series and Class thereof, if any, and similar matters."
"2527","  The record books of the Trust as kept by the Trust or any"
"2528","transfer or similar agent, as the case may be, shall be conclusive"
"2529"," as to who are the Shareholders of the Trust and each Series and"
"2530"," Class thereof and as to the number of Shares of the Trust and"
"2531"," each Series and Class thereof held from time to time by each"
"2532","such Shareholder."
"2533","Section 3.	Sale of Shares.  Subject to the 1940 Act and"
"2534","applicable law, the Trust may sell its authorized but unissued"
"2535","Shares to such Persons, at such times, on such terms, and for"
"2536"," such consideration as the Board of Trustees may from time to"
"2537"," time authorize.  Each sale shall be credited to the individual"
"2538","purchaser's account in the form of full or fractional Shares of"
"2539"," the Trust or such Series thereof (and Class thereof, if any),"
"2540"," as the purchaser may select, at the net asset value per Share,"
"2541"," subject to Section 22 of the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations"
"2542"," adopted thereunder; provided, however, that the Board of"
"2543"," Trustees may, in its sole discretion, permit the Principal"
"2544"," Underwriter to impose a sales charge upon any such sale."
"2545","Every Shareholder by virtue of having become a Shareholder"
"2546","shall be bound by the terms of this Declaration of Trust."
"2547","Ownership of Shares shall not make any Shareholder a"
"2548","third-party beneficiary of any contract entered into by"

"2551","Liability.  Shares shall be deemed to be personal property"
"2552"," giving to Shareholders only the rights provided in this"
"2553"," Declaration of Trust, the By-Laws, and under applicable law."
"2554","  Ownership of Shares shall not entitle the Shareholder to any"

"2559","1 hereof, the death, incapacity, dissolution, termination, or"
"2560"," bankruptcy of a Shareholder during the existence of the Trust"

"2571"," herein, to call upon any Shareholder for the payment of any"
"2572","sum of money other than such as the Shareholder may at any"
"2573","time personally agree to pay.  Each Share, when issued on the"
"2574"," terms determined by the Board of Trustees, shall be fully paid"
"2575"," and nonassessable.  As provided in the DSTA, Shareholders"
"2576","shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability"
"2577"," as that extended to stockholders of a private corporation organized"
"2578"," for profit under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware."
"2579","Section 5.	Power of Board of Trustees to Make Tax Status Election."
"2580","  The Board of Trustees shall have the power, in its discretion,"
"2581","to make such elections as to the tax status of the Trust and any"
"2582","Series as may be permitted or required under the Code, without the"

"2584","Section 6.	Establishment and Designation of Series and Classes."
"2585","  The establishment and designation of any Series or Class shall"
"2586","be effective, without the requirement of Shareholder approval,"
"2587","upon the adoption of a resolution by not less than a majority"
"2588","of the then Board of Trustees, which resolution shall set forth"
"2589"," such establishment and designation whether directly in such"
"2590","resolutions or by reference to, or approval of, another document"
"2591"," that sets forth the designation or otherwise identifies such"

"2607"," the assets and liabilities of the Trust or any other Series.  Each"
"2608"," Class of the Trust shall be separate and distinct from any other"
"2609"," Class of the Trust.  Each Class of a Series shall be separate"

"2613","separately from the liabilities of the Trust, the Series or any"
"2614"," other Class and separate and distinct records on the books of"
"2615","the Trust for the Class shall be maintained for this purpose."
"2616"," Subject to Article II hereof, each such Series shall operate"
"2617","as a separate and distinct investment medium, with separately"
"2618"," defined investment objectives and policies."
"2619","Shares of each Series (and Class where applicable) established"
"2620"," and designated pursuant to this Section 6, unless otherwise"
"2621"," provided to the extent permitted by the DSTA, in the resolution"
"2622"," establishing and designating such Series or Class, shall have"
"2623"," the following rights, powers and duties:"
"2624","(a)	Assets Held with Respect to a Particular Series."
"2625"," All consideration received by the Trust for the issue or sale"
"2626"," of Shares of a particular Series, together with all assets in"
"2627"," which such consideration is invested or reinvested, all income,"
"2628"," earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof from whatever source derived,"
"2629"," including, without limitation, any proceeds derived from the sale,"
"2630"," exchange or liquidation of such assets, and any funds or payments"
"2631"," derived from any reinvestment of such proceeds in whatever form"
"2632"," the same may be, shall irrevocably be held with respect to"
"2633"," that Series for all purposes, subject only to the rights of"
"2634"," creditors with respect to that Series, and shall be so"
"2635","recorded upon the books of account of the Trust.  Such"
"2636","consideration, assets, income, earnings, profits and proceeds"
"2637"," thereof, from whatever source derived, including, without"
"2638","limitation, any proceeds derived from the sale, exchange or"
"2639"," liquidation of such assets, and any funds or payments derived"
"2640"," from any reinvestment of such proceeds, in whatever form the"
"2641","same may be, are herein referred to as assets held with respect
to that Series.  In the event that there are any assets, income,"
"2642"," earnings, profits and proceeds thereof, funds or payments which"
"2643"," are not readily identifiable as assets held with respect to any"
"2644"," particular Series (collectively General Assets), the Board of"
"2645"," Trustees, or an appropriate officer as determined by the Board"
"2646"," of Trustees, shall allocate such General Assets to, between or"
"2647"," among any one or more of the Series in such manner and on"
"2648","such basis as the Board of Trustees, in its sole discretion,"
"2649"," deems fair and equitable, and any General Asset so allocated"
"2650"," to a particular Series shall be held with respect to that"
"2651","Series.  Each such allocation by or under the direction of"
"2652","the Board of Trustees shall be conclusive and binding upon"
"2653"," the Shareholders of all Series for all purposes."
"2654","(b)	Liabilities Held with Respect to a Particular"
"2655","Series or Class.  The assets of the Trust held with respect"
"2656"," to a particular Series shall be charged with the liabilities,"
"2657"," debts, obligations, costs, charges, reserves and expenses"
"2658","of the Trust incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing"
"2659"," with respect to such Series.  Such liabilities, debts,"
"2660"," obligations, costs, charges, reserves and expenses incurred,"
"2661"," contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to a particular"
"2662"," Series are herein referred to as liabilities held with respect
 to that Series.  Any liabilities, debts, obligations, costs,"
"2663"," charges, reserves and expenses of the Trust which are not readily"
"2664"," identifiable as being liabilities held with respect to any"
"2665","particular Series (collectively General Liabilities) shall"
"2666"," be allocated by the Board of Trustees, or an appropriate officer"
"2667"," as determined by the Board of Trustees, to and among any one or"
"2668"," more of the Series in such manner and on such basis as the Board"
"2669"," of Trustees in its sole discretion deems fair and equitable."
"2670"," Each allocation of liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges,"
"2671"," reserves and expenses by or under the direction of the Board of"
"2672","Trustees shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders of"
"2673"," all Series for all purposes.  All Persons who have extended"
"2674"," credit that has been allocated to a particular Series, or who"
"2675","have a claim or contract that has been allocated to any particular"
"2676"," Series, shall look exclusively to the assets of that particular"
"2677"," Series for payment of such credit, claim, or contract.  In the"
"2678","absence of an express contractual agreement so limiting the"
"2679"," claims of such creditors, claimants and contract providers,"
"2680"," each creditor, claimant and contract provider shall be deemed"
"2681","nevertheless to have impliedly agreed to such limitation."
"2682","Subject to the right of the Board of Trustees in its discretion"
"2683"," to allocate General Liabilities as provided herein, the debts,"
"2684"," liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for"
"2685"," or otherwise existing with respect to a particular Series, whether"
"2686"," such Series is now authorized and existing pursuant to this"
"2687","Declaration of Trust or is hereafter authorized and existing"
"2688","pursuant to this Declaration of Trust, shall be enforceable"
"2689","against the assets held with respect to that Series only,"
"2690","and not against the assets of any other Series or the Trust"
"2691"," generally and none of the debts, liabilities, obligations"
"2692"," and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing"
"2693"," with respect to the Trust generally or any other Series"
"2694","thereof shall be enforceable against the assets held with"
"2695","respect to such Series.  Notice of this limitation on"
"2696","liabilities between and among Series shall be set forth in"
"2697","the Certificate of Trust pursuant to the DSTA, and upon the"
"2698"," giving of such notice in the Certificate of Trust, the"
"2699","statutory provisions of Section 3804 of the DSTA relating"
"2700","to limitations on liabilities between and among Series"
"2701"," (and the statutory effect under Section 3804 of setting"
"2702"," forth such notice in the Certificate of Trust) shall"
"2703","become applicable to the Trust and each Series."
"2704","Liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges,"
"2705","reserves and expenses related to the distribution"
"2706"," of, and other identified expenses that should or"
"2707"," may properly be allocated to, the Shares of a"
"2708","particular Class may be charged to and borne solely"
"2709"," by such Class.  The bearing of expenses solely by"
"2710"," a particular Class of Shares may be appropriately"
"2711","reflected (in a manner determined by the Board of Trustees)"
"2712"," and may affect the net asset value attributable to, and the"
"2713"," dividend, redemption and liquidation rights of, such Class."
"2714","  Each allocation of liabilities, debts, obligations, costs,"
"2715"," charges, reserves and expenses by or under the direction of"
"2716"," the Board of Trustees shall be conclusive and binding upon"
"2717","the Shareholders of all Classes for all purposes.  All Persons"
"2718"," who have extended credit that has been allocated to a particular"
"2719"," Class, or who have a claim or contract that has been allocated"
"2720"," to any particular Class, shall look, and may be required by"
"2721","contract to look, exclusively to that particular Class for payment"
"2722"," of such credit, claim, or contract."
"2723","(c)	Dividends, Distributions and Redemptions.  Notwithstanding"
"2724"," any other provisions of this Declaration of Trust, including,"
"2725","without limitation, Article VI hereof, no dividend or distribution"
"2726"," including, without limitation, any distribution paid upon"
"2727"," dissolution of the Trust or of any Series with respect to,"
"2728"," nor any redemption of, the Shares of any Series or Class of"
"2729"," such Series shall be effected by the Trust other than from"
"2730","the assets held with respect to such Series, nor, except as"
"2731"," specifically provided in Section 7 of this Article III,"
"2732","shall any Shareholder of any particular Series otherwise"
"2733","have any right or claim against the assets held with respect"
"2734"," to any other Series or the Trust generally except, in the case"
"2735"," of a right or claim against the assets held with respect to any"
"2736"," other Series, to the extent that such Shareholder has such a"
"2737","right or claim hereunder as a Shareholder of such other Series."
"2738","  The Board of Trustees shall have full discretion, to the extent"
"2739"," not inconsistent with the 1940 Act, to determine which items"
"2740","shall be treated as income and which items as capital; and each"
"2741"," such determination and allocation shall be conclusive and binding"
"2742"," upon the Shareholders."
"2743","(d)	Voting.  All Shares of the Trust entitled to vote on a"
"2744","matter shall vote in the aggregate without differentiation between"
"2745"," the Shares of the separate Series, if any, or separate Classes,"
"2746"," if any; provided that (i) with respect to any matter that affects"
"2747"," only the interests of some but not all Series, then only the Shares"
"2748"," of such affected Series, voting separately, shall be entitled to"
"2749","vote on the matter, (ii) with respect to any matter that affects only"
"2750"," the interests of some but not all Classes, then only the Shares of"
"2751","such affected Classes, voting separately, shall be entitled to vote"
"2752"," on the matter; and (iii) notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect"
"2753"," to any matter as to which the 1940 Act or other applicable law or"
"2754","regulation requires voting, by Series or by Class, then the Shares"
"2755","of the Trust shall vote as prescribed in such law or regulation."
"2756","(e)	Equality.  Each Share of any particular Series shall be equal"
"2757"," to each other Share of such Series (subject to the rights and"
"2758","preferences with respect to separate Classes of such Series)."
"2759","(f)	Fractions.  A fractional Share of the Trust or a Series"
"2760","shall carry proportionately all the rights and obligations of a"
"2761","whole Share of the Trust or such Series, including rights with"
"2762","respect to voting, receipt of dividends and distributions, redemption"
"2763"," of Shares and dissolution of the Trust or that Series."
"2764","(g)	Exchange Privilege.  The Board of Trustees shall have"
"2765"," the authority to provide that the holders of Shares of any Series"
"2766"," shall have the right to exchange said Shares for Shares of one or"
"2767"," more other Series in accordance with such requirements"
"2768"," and procedures as may be established by the Board of"
"2769"," Trustees, and in accordance with the 1940 Act."
"2770","(h)	Combination of Series or Classes."
"2771","	The Board of Trustees shall have the authority,"
"2772"," without"
"2773","the approval, vote or consent of the Shareholders of any"
"2774"," Series, unless otherwise required by applicable law, to"
"2775","combine the assets and liabilities held with respect to any"
"2776","two or more Series into assets and liabilities held with respect"
"2777"," to a single Series; provided that upon completion of such"
"2778"," combination of Series, the interest of each Shareholder, in"
"2779"," the combined assets and liabilities held with respect to the"
"2780"," combined Series shall equal the interest of each such Shareholder"
"2781","in the aggregate of the assets and liabilities held with respect"

"3734","not likely to succeed.  For purposes of this Section 4, a demand"
"3735","on the Board of Trustees shall only be deemed not likely to"
"3736"," succeed and therefore excused if a majority of the Board of"
"3737","Trustees, or a majority of any committee established to"

"3752"," the merits of the request and shall require an undertaking by"
"3753","the Shareholders making such request to reimburse the Trust for"

"3981"," Series the assets associated with which have been so sold,"
"3982","conveyed and transferred, and due effect to the differences"

"4007","or any one or more Series to convert to a master feeder structure"
"4008"," (a structure in which a feeder fund invests all of its assets"
"4009"," in a master fund, rather than making investments in securities"
"4010","directly) and thereby cause existing Series of the Trust to either"

"4012","in which other funds are feeders."
