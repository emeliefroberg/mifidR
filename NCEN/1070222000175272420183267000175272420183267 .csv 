"1354","we considered the Funds internal control over"

"1389","of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of"
"1390","the companys assets that could have a material"
"1391","effect on the financial statements."
"1392","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1393","control over financial reporting may not prevent or"

"1396","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1397","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"1398","the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1399","procedures may deteriorate."
"1400","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1401","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1402","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1403","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1404","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1405","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1406","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1407","control over financial reporting, such that there is"
"1408","a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1409","misstatement of the Funds annual or interim"
"1410","financial statements will not be prevented or"

"1412","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"

"1415","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"1416","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1417","standards established by the Public Company"
"1418","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However,"
"1419","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal"
"1420","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1421","including controls over safeguarding securities that"
"1422","we consider to be a material weakness as defined"
