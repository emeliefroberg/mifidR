"3076","Full Names of Principal Parties: Susan Lanotte,"
"3077","derivatively on behalf of Highland Global Allocation"
"3078","fund, and on behalf of herself and all others similarly"
"3079","situated v. Highland Capital Management Fund"
"3080","Advisors, L.P., Timothy Hui, Bryan Ward, Bob Froehlich,"
"3081","John Honis, Ethan Powell, Highland Global Allocation"
"3082","Brief Description: The Fund received a shareholder"
"3083","demand letter dated March 1, 2018, from an individual"
"3084","purporting to be a shareholder of the Fund (the"
"3085","Demand Letter). The Demand Letter alleges that the"
"3086","current and former Board breached their fiduciary"
"3087","duties, and the Investment Adviser breached its"
"3088","advisory agreement, in relation to the Fund's"
"3089","investment in shares of an affiliated mutual fund, the"
"3090","Highland Energy MLP Fund (also a series of the Trust)."
"3091","The Fund holds $17.4 million (or 58.5%) of the Highland"
"3092","Energy MLP Fund. Upon receipt of the Demand Letter,"
"3093","the Board formed a Demand Review Committee"
"3094","(DRC) comprised entirely of independent trustees to"
"3095","investigate these claims and to make a"
"3096","recommendation to the Board regarding whether"
"3097","pursuit of these claims is in the best interests of the"
"3098","Fund. Aided by independent counsel to the committee,"
"3099","the DRC engaged in a thorough and detailed review of"
"3100","the allegations contained in the Demand Letter. Upon"
"3101","completion of its evaluation, the DRC recommended"
"3102","that the Fund's independent trustees, who represent a"
"3103","majority of the Board, reject the demand specified in"
"3104","the shareholder Demand Letter. After considering the"
"3105","report of the DRC, the independent trustees"
"3106","unanimously agreed and rejected the demand, noting"
"3107","that the Demand Letter contained material factual"
"3108","errors and incorrect assumptions, and the proposed suit"
"3109","was meritless and should not be pursued. A copy of the"
"3110","report was provided to the purported shareholder and"
"3111","her counsel."
"3112","Notwithstanding the foregoing, the purported"
"3113","shareholder (the Plaintiff) filed a shareholder"
"3114","derivative suit against the Fund, certain members of the"
"3115","Board and the Investment Adviser on September 5,"
"3116","2018 (the Shareholder Litigation). Based on the"
"3117","extensive pre-suit investigation and the resulting report,"
"3118","the Fund, Board and Investment Adviser believe the"
"3119","claims made in the Shareholder Litigation are without"
"3120","merit and intend to vigorously defend against them. The"
"3121","case is Lanotte v. Highland Global Allocation Fund et al,"
"3122","3:18-cv-02360, U.S. District Court for the Northern"
"3123","District of Texas (Dallas). The Demand Letter and the"
"3124","Shareholder Litigation are not related to the Proposals"
"3125","and do not alter the intention of the Fund and the"
"3126","Investment Adviser to redomicile the Fund and convert"
"3127","the Fund into a closed-end fund."

"3136","RE: Report on Internal Controls - Highland Funds II"
"3137","Within 90 days prior to the filing date of the"
"3138","Shareholder Report on Form N-CSR, Management"
"3139","carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the"
"3140","design and operation of the Registrant's disclosure"
"3141","controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the"
"3142","principal executive officer and principal financial officer"
"3143","concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and"
"3144","procedures were not effective due to a material"
"3145","weakness for the Highland Global Allocation Fund (the"
"3146","Fund) relating to the application of ASC 820 and"
"3147","reasonableness and reliability of assumptions used in"
"3148","the fair value model which are monitored by the"
"3149","Valuation Committee through the operation of a review"
"3150","control. This control was not designed at an appropriate"
"3151","level of precision to ensure the accurate valuation of"
"3152","Level 3 securities. A material weakness (as defined in"
"3153","Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) is a deficiency, or a"
"3154","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"3155","financial reporting such that there is a reasonable"
"3156","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"3157","Registrant's annual or interim financial statements will"
"3158","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. This"
"3159","material weakness resulted in material pricing errors"
"3160","related to a hard-to-value security held by Fund, over a"
"3161","period of time, which resulted in the reprocessing of"
"3162","investor capital activity, as well as material"
"3163","misstatements to the Fund's semi-annual financial"
"3164","statements as of March 31, 2018 and a material error"
"3165","that was corrected in the annual financial statements"
"3166","for the year ended September 30, 2018. Additionally,"
"3167","this material weakness could result in a misstatement to"
"3168","the investment balances or disclosures that would"
"3169","result in a material misstatement to the annual or"
"3170","interim financial statements that would not be"
"3171","prevented or detected."
"3172","Management has developed a plan to remediate the"
"3173","material weakness described above. Management"
"3174","utilizes a Valuation Sub-Committee as part of its existing"
"3175","valuation process. Management will undertake the"
"3176","addition of a review control by adding one or more"
"3177","members to the Valuation Sub-Committee to conduct"
"3178","control activities designed to operate at a level of"
"3179","precision which will enable such errors to be detected."
"3180","Additionally, Management will undertake"
"3181","enhancements to its Valuation Committee by providing"
"3182","training materials to members of its Valuation"
"3183","Committee with respect to the application of ASC 820"
"3184","as well as the usage of subject matter expert inputs as"
"3185","inputs to fair value determinations. Finally,"
"3186","management will undertake enhancements to its"
"3187","review control by designing additional control activities"
"3188","to more precisely assess the application of ASC 820 to"
"3189","fair value models."
