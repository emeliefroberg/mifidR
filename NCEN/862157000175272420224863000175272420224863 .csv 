"342","Creditors of Tribune Company, et al., v. Fitzsimons"
"343","et al. (the Lawsuit).  The Lawsuit arises out of a"
"344","leveraged buyout transaction (LBO) in 2007 by"
"345","which loans were made to the Tribune Company to"
"346","fund the LBO and shares of the Tribune Company"
"347","held by shareholders were tendered for or were"
"348","converted to a right to receive cash.  Following the"
"349","completion of the LBO in 2007, the Tribune"
"350","Company filed for bankruptcy.  The Lawsuit seeks"
"351","to recover all payments made to the shareholders in"
"352","the LBO.  The Lawsuit has been consolidated in a"
"353","multi-district litigation (the Tribune MDL) in the"
"354","United States District Court for the Southern"
"355","District of New York, case no. 12-MC-2296 (the"
"356","District Court).  At the outset of the Lawsuit, the"
"357","District Court issued a scheduling order which"
"358","stayed all substantive proceedings in the Lawsuit"
"359","until after the decision on motions to dismiss based"
"360","on certain defenses common to the defendants filed"
"361","in related cases."
"362","On September 23, 2013, the District Court entered"
"363","an order granting the defendants' motion to dismiss"
"364","in certain of those related cases (the Bondholder
Actions) due to the pendency of the Lawsuit"
"365","seeking recoveries on similar grounds, and the"
"366","plaintiffs in Bondholder Actions appealed that order"
"367","to the United States Court of Appeals for the"
"368","Second Circuit.  On April 25, 2014, the District"
"369","Court entered an order governing the upcoming"
"370","stage of the Lawsuit, which directed Ropes & Gray,"
"371","as Liaison Counsel to the Shareholder Defendants,"
"372","to file a global motion to dismiss (the Global
Motion to Dismiss) the Lawsuit on behalf of all"
"373","shareholder defendants named in Exhibit A to the"
"374","current Fifth Amended Complaint (including the"
"375","Trust).  The Global Motion to Dismiss was filed on"
"376","May 23, 2014."
"377","On March 29, 2016, the Second Circuit, in a"
"378","unanimous opinion, affirmed the District Court's"
"379","dismissal of the Bondholder Actions.  The"
"380","Bondholder Actions plaintiffs subsequently filed a"
"381","petition for rehearing, which the Second Circuit"
"382","denied on July 22, 2016.  On September 9, 2016,"
"383","the Bondholder Actions plaintiffs filed a petition for"
"384","a writ of certiorari of the Second Circuit's decision"
"385","in the U.S. Supreme Court."
"386","On January 6, 2017, the District Court granted the"
"387","Global Motion to Dismiss, dismissing the only"
"388","claim asserted against the shareholder defendants"
"389","named in the Lawsuit, and denied the plaintiff's"
"390","request for leave to amend the Complaint."
"391","On April 3, 2018, Supreme Court Justices Kennedy"
"392","and Thomas issued a Statement indicating that"
"393","consideration of the petition for certiorari in the"
"394","Bondholder Actions will be deferred for an
additional period of time because of the possibility"
"395","that there might not be a quorum of Justices"
"396","available to consider those cases.  The Statement"
"397","also said that this deferral would allow the Second"
"398","Circuit or the District Court to consider whether to"
"399","recall the mandate, entertain a motion to vacate the"
"400","earlier judgment, or provide any other available"
"401","relief in light of the Supreme Court's decision in"
"402","another case, FTI Consulting, Inc. v. Merit"
"403","Management Group, 830 F.3d 690 (7th Cir. 2016)"
"404","(Merit Mgmt.).  On April 10, 2018, the"
"405","Bondholder Actions plaintiffs filed a motion"
"406","requesting that the Second Circuit recall its"
"407","mandate, vacate its affirmation of the District"
"408","Court's dismissal of their claims, and remand the"
"409","Bondholder Actions to the District Court for further"
"410","proceedings.    On May 15, 2018, the Second"
"411","Circuit granted plaintiffs' motion to recall the"
"412","court's mandate in anticipation of further panel
review. On December 19, 2019, the Second Circuit"
"413","affirmed its prior dismissal of the Bondholder"
"414","Actions plaintiffs' claims, notwithstanding the"
"415","Supreme Court's decision in Merit Mgmt. On"
"416","January 2, 2020, the Bondholder Actions plaintiffs"
"417","filed a motion requesting that the Second Circuit"
"418","panel reconsider that ruling or that the full Second"
"419","Circuit review the opinion en banc (the"
"420","Reconsideration Motion). On February 6, 2020,"
"421","the Second Circuit denied the Reconsideration"
"422","Motion.  On July 6, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a"
"423","further petition for a writ of certiorari in the U.S."
"424","Supreme Court.  The defendants filed a brief in"
"425","opposition with the U.S. Supreme Court on August"
"426","26, 2020.  The plaintiffs filed a reply brief with the"
"427","U.S. Supreme Court on September 8, 2020.  By"
"428","order dated October 5, 2020, the U.S. Supreme"
"429","Court (with Justice Alito recused) invited the U.S."
"430","Solicitor General to file a brief expressing the"
"431","Solicitor General's views on the petition for a writ"
"432","of certiorari.  Based on previous practice, the"
"433","Solicitor General is likely to file the invited brief"
"434","sometime in December 2020."
"435","On April 4, 2019, the plaintiff in the Lawsuit filed a"
"436","motion to amend his complaint to add constructive"
"437","fraudulent conveyance claims against shareholder"
"438","defendants based on an alleged change in governing"
"439","law resulting from the Supreme Court's decision in"
"440","Merit Mgmt.  On April 23, 2019, the District Court"
"441","denied that motion.  On July 15, 2019, the plaintiff"
"442","in the Lawsuit filed a notice of appeal to the Second"
"443","Circuit for these District Court rulings in the"
"444","Lawsuit.  The parties have briefed the issues on"
"445","appeal, and the Second Circuit heard oral argument"
"446","on August 24, 2020.  This appeal remains pending"
"447","before the Second Circuit."
"448","We express no opinion on the likely outcome of"
"449","these matters. Management is currently assessing"
"450","the Lawsuit and has not yet determined the effect, if"
"451","any, on any series of the Trust."
