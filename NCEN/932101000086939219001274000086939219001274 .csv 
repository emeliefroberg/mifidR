"1388","(United States), we considered the Funds internal control over"

"1391","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"

"1396","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"

"1400","benefits and related costs of controls. A companys internal"
"1401","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1402","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1403","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"1404","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1405","accounting principles (GAAP). A companys internal control over"
"1406","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"1407","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1408","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1409","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"1410","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1411","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1412","accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1413","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations"

"1426","exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1427","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1428","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
