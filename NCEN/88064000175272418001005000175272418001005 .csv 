"1014","Accounting Firm"
"1015","To the Board of Trustees of Deutsche DWS Investment"
"1016","Trust and Shareholders of DWS Large Cap Focus Growth"
"1017","Fund"
"1018","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1019","statements of DWS Large Cap Focus Growth Fund (the"
"1020","Fund) as of and for the year ended July 31, 2018, in"
"1021","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1022","Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we"
"1023","considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1024","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"1025","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1026","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1027","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"1028","CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1029","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"1030","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"1031","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"1032","over financial reporting."
"1033","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"1034","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1035","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1036","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1037","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's"
"1038","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"1039","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1040","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1041","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"1042","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"1043","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1044","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1045","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1046","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"1047","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1048","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1049","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"1050","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"1051","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"1052","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1053","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1054","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1055","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"1056","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1057","statements."
"1058","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1059","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1060","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1061","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1062","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1063","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1064","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1065","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1066","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1067","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1068","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1069","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1070","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1071","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1072","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1073","company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"1074","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1075","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"1076","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"1077","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"1078","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that"
"1079","might be material weaknesses under standards established"
"1080","by the PCAOB.  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"1081","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1082","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities"
"1083","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above"
"1084","as of July 31, 2018."

"1106"," Item G.1.a.i - Deutsche DWS Investment Trust"
"1107","(formerly DWS Investment Trust)"
"1108","On December 7, 2010, Deutsche DWS Investment"
"1109","Trust (formerly DWS Investment Trust) (the Trust)"
"1110","was named as a defendant in the First Amended"
"1111","Complaint filed by the Official Committee of"
"1112","Unsecured Creditors in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for"
"1113","the District of Delaware in the lawsuit styled Official"
"1114","Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Tribune"
"1115","Company, et al., v. Fitzsimons et al. (the Lawsuit)."
"1116","The Lawsuit arises out of a leveraged buyout"
"1117","transaction (LBO) in 2007 by which loans were"
"1118","made to the Tribune Company to fund the LBO and"
"1119","shares of the Tribune Company held by shareholders"
"1120","were tendered for or were converted to a right to"
"1121","receive cash. Following the completion of the LBO in"
"1122","2007, the Tribune Company filed for bankruptcy. The"
"1123","Lawsuit seeks to recover all payments made to the"
"1124","shareholders in the LBO. The Lawsuit has been"
"1125","consolidated in a multi-district litigation (the Tribune
MDL) in the United States District Court for the"
"1126","Southern District of New York, case no. 12-MC-2296"
"1127","(the District Court). At the outset of the Lawsuit, the"
"1128","Court issued a scheduling order which stayed all"
"1129","substantive proceedings in the Lawsuit until after the"
"1130","decision on motions to dismiss based on certain"
"1131","defenses common to the defendants filed in related"
"1132","cases. On September 23, 2013, the District Court"
"1133","entered an order granting the defendants' motion to"
"1134","dismiss in certain of those related cases (the"
"1135","Bondholder Actions) due to the pendency of the"
"1136","Lawsuit seeking recoveries on similar grounds, and"
"1137","the plaintiffs in Bondholder Actions appealed that"
"1138","order to the United States Court of Appeals for the"
"1139","Second Circuit."
"1140","On April 25, 2014, the District Court entered an order"
"1141","governing the upcoming stage of the Lawsuit, which"
"1142","directed Ropes & Gray, as Liaison Counsel to the"
"1143","Shareholder Defendants, to file a global motion to"
"1144","dismiss (the Global Motion to Dismiss) the Lawsuit"
"1145","on behalf of all shareholder defendants named in"
"1146","Exhibit A to the current Fifth Amended Complaint"
"1147","(including the Trust). The Global Motion to Dismiss"
"1148","was filed on May 23, 2014. On March 29, 2015, the"
"1149","Second Circuit, in a unanimous opinion, affirmed the"
"1150","District Court's dismissal of the Bondholder Actions."
"1151","The Bondholder Action plaintiffs subsequently filed a"
