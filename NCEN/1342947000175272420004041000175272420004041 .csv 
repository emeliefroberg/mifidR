"2351","2019, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"2352","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Trust's internal"
"2353","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"2354","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"

"2357","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"2358","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."

"2360","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"2361","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"2362","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A trust's internal control"

"2371","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2372","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the trust are being made only"
"2373","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the trust;"
"2374","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"2375","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a trust's assets that could"
"2376","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2377","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2378","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2379","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2380","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"2381","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2382","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"2383","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"2384","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2385","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2386","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"2387","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2388","trust's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"2389","on a timely basis."
"2390","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting was"
"2391","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"2392","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"2393","weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB. However, we noted no"
"2394","deficiencies in the Trust's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"2395","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities that we consider to be"
"2396","a material weakness, as defined above, as of October 31, 2019."
"2397","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"2398","Trustees of the BBH Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
