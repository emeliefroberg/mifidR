for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates
and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund&rsquo;s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (<B><I>&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;</I></B>). A fund&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the
fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund&rsquo;s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.</P>

<P STYLE=font: 10.5pt Proxima Nova,sans-serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; color: #131819>Because of inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>

control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the
normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness
is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund&rsquo;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis.</P>
