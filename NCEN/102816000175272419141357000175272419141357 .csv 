"2441","(the Fund) (one of the funds constituting Eaton Vance Growth Trust)"
"2442","as of and for the year ended July 31, 2019, in accordance with the"
"2443","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"2444","States) (PCAOB), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"2445","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"2446","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2447","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"2448","with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"2449","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"2450","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"

"2452","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"

"2454","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"

"2457","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"2458","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"2459","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2460","principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"2461","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"2462","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"2463","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"2464","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"

"2472","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"

"2475","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"2476","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"2477","deteriorate."
"2478","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"2479","design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"2480","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"2481","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A"
"2482","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"2483","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"

"2485","or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"

"2491","the PCAOB. However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"2492","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
