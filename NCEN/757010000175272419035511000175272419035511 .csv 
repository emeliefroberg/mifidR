"6535","EXHIBIT ITEM: Copies of any material amendments to the"
"6536","registrant's charter or by-laws"
"6537","Amendment Effective February 1, 2018"
"6538","To the By-Laws of"
"6539","Franklin Tax-Free Trust"
"6540","(the Trust)"
"6541","WHEREAS, Article VIII, Section 2 of the By-Laws provides"
"6542","that the By-Laws may be amended by the Board of Trustees; and"
"6543","WHEREAS, by resolutions adopted October 24, 2017 at a meeting"
"6544","of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Board of"
"6545","Trustees unanimously authorized the By-Laws to be amended"
"6546","as set forth below."
"6547","NOW THEREFORE, the By-Laws are hereby amended as follows:"
"6548","1.	ARTICLE VII, Sections 3, 4 and 6 are replaced in their"
"6549","entirety with the following:"
"6550","Section 3.	CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES.  No certificate or certificates"
"6551","for Shares shall be issued to Shareholders and no Shareholder shall"
"6552"," have the right to demand or require that a certificate for Shares"
"6553"," be issued to it.  The Trust shall adopt and use a system of issuance,"
"6554","recordation and transfer of its shares by electronic or other means."
"6555","Section 4.	LOST CERTIFICATES.  No new certificate for Shares"
"6556","shall be issued to replace an old certificate that is surrendered"
"6557","to the Trust for cancellation.  In case any Share certificate or"
"6558","certificate for any other security is lost, stolen, or destroyed,"
"6559","such certificate shall be cancelled and the ownership of an"
"6560","uncertificated Share shall be recorded upon the books of"
"6561","the Trust, on such terms and conditions as the Board may require,"
"6562"," including a provision for indemnification of the Board and"
"6563","the Trust secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient"
"6564"," to protect the Trust and the Board against any claim that may"
"6565","be made against either, including any expense or liability on"
"6566","account of the alleged loss, theft, or destruction of the certificate."
"6567","Section 6.	TRANSFERS OF SHARES.  Shares are transferable, if authorized by"
"6568"," the Declaration of Trust, only on the record books of the Trust by the"
"6569"," Person in whose name such Shares are registered, or by his or her duly"
"6570"," authorized attorney-in-fact or representative.  Upon receipt of"
"6571","proper transfer instructions from the registered owner of"
"6572","certificated Shares, and upon the surrender for cancellation"
"6573","of such certificates representing the number of Shares to"
"6574"," be transferred with an assignment and power of transfer"
"6575"," endorsed thereon or attached thereto, duly executed, with"
"6576","such proof of the authenticity of the signature as the Trust"
"6577","or its agents may reasonably require, the Trust shall"
"6578","cancel the old certificate and record the transaction"
"6579","and ownership of uncertificated Shares upon the books"
"6580","of the Trust.  Upon receipt of proper transfer instructions"
"6581"," from the registered owner of uncertificated Shares,"
"6582","such uncertificated Shares shall be transferred on the"
"6583","record books to the Person entitled thereto."
"6584","The Trust, its transfer agent or other duly authorized"
"6585","agents may refuse any requested transfer of Shares, or"
"6586"," request additional evidence of authority to safeguard"
"6587","the assets or interests of the Trust or of its Shareholders,"
"6588","in their sole discretion.  In all cases of transfer by an"
"6589"," attorney-in-fact, the original power of attorney, or an"
"6590","official copy thereof duly certified, shall be deposited and"
"6591"," remain with the Trust, its transfer agent or other duly"
"6592"," authorized agent.  In case of transfers by executors,"
"6593","administrators, guardians or other legal representatives,"
"6594","duly authenticated evidence of their authority shall be"
"6595"," presented to the Trust, its transfer agent or other duly"
"6596","authorized agent, and may be required to be deposited and"
"6597","remain with the Trust, its transfer agent or other duly"
"6598","authorized agent."
"6599","Adopted and approved as of October 24, 2017 by the Board of Trustees."

"7070","divided into Shares, each Share without a par value."
"7071","The number of Shares in the Trust authorized hereunder,"
"7072","and of each Series and Class as may be established from"
"7073"," time to time, is unlimited.  The Board of Trustees"
"7074"," may authorize the division of Shares into separate"
"7075","Classes of Shares and into separate and distinct Series"
"7076"," of Shares and the division of any Series into"
"7077","separate Classes of Shares in accordance with the"
"7078","1940 Act.  The different Series and Classes shall be"
"7079","established and designated pursuant to Article III,"
"7080","Section 6 hereof.  If no separate Series or Classes"
"7081","of Series shall be established, the Shares shall have the rights,"
"7082"," powers and duties provided for herein and in Article III,"
"7083","Section 6 hereof to the extent relevant and not otherwise"
"7084","provided for herein, and all references to Series and Classes"
"7085","shall be construed (as the context may require) to refer"
"7086"," to the Trust."
"7087","(i)	The fact that the Trust shall have one or more established"
"7088","and designated Classes of the Trust, shall not limit the authority of"
"7089"," the Board of Trustees to establish and designate additional Classes"
"7090"," of the Trust.  The fact that one or more Classes of the Trust shall"
"7091"," have initially been established and designated without any specific"
"7092","establishment or designation of a Series (i.e., that all Shares"
"7093","of the Trust are initially Shares of one or more Classes) shall"

"7098","(ii)	The fact that a Series shall have initially been"
"7099","established and designated without any specific establishment"
"7100","or designation of Classes (i.e., that all Shares of such"
"7101","Series are initially of a single Class) shall not limit the"
"7102","authority of the Board of Trustees to establish and"
"7103","designate separate Classes of said Series.  The fact"
"7104","that a Series shall have more than one established and"
"7105"," designated Class, shall not limit the authority of"
"7106","the Board of Trustees to establish and designate"
"7107","additional Classes of said Series."
"7108","(b)	The Board of Trustees shall have the power to"
"7109","issue authorized, but unissued Shares of the Trust,"
"7110"," or any Series and Class thereof, from time to time"
"7111","for such consideration paid wholly or partly in cash,"

"7120","convert any unissued Shares or any Shares of the Trust or"
"7121","any Series or Class thereof, that were previously issued"
"7122","and are reacquired, into one or more Series or Classes that"
"7123","may be established and designated from time to time and, in"
"7124","connection therewith, cause some or all of the Shareholders"
"7125","of the Trust, such Series or Class to become Shareholders of"
"7126","such other Series or Class.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,"
"7127","the Trust and any Series thereof may acquire, hold, sell"
"7128","and otherwise deal in, for purposes of investment or otherwise,"
"7129"," the Shares of any other Series of the Trust or Shares of"
"7130","the Trust, and such Shares shall not be deemed treasury shares"
"7131"," or cancelled."
"7132","(c)	Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Article III,"
"7133"," each Share shall entitle the holder to voting rights as"

"7136","additional authorized, but unissued Shares or other"
"7137","securities issued by the Trust or any Series thereof."
"7138","The Board of Trustees may from time to time divide or"
"7139"," combine the Shares of the Trust or any particular Series"
"7140"," thereof into a greater or lesser number of Shares of"
"7141"," the Trust or that Series, respectively.  Such division"
"7142"," or combination shall not materially change the"
"7143","proportionate beneficial interests of the holders of"
"7144","Shares of the Trust or that Series, as the case may be,"
"7145"," in the Trust Property at the time of such division or"
"7146"," combination that is held with respect to the Trust"
"7147","or that Series, as the case may be."
"7148","(d)	Any Trustee, officer or other agent of the"
"7149","Trust, and any organization in which any such Person"
"7150","has an economic or other interest, may acquire,"
"7151","own, hold and dispose of Shares in the Trust or"
"7152"," any Series and Class thereof, whether such Shares"
"7153"," are authorized but unissued, or already"
"7154","outstanding, to the same extent as if such Person were"
"7155","not a Trustee, officer or other agent of the Trust;"
"7156","and the Trust or any Series may issue and sell and"
"7157","may purchase such Shares from any such Person or"
"7158","any such organization, subject to the limitations,"
"7159"," restrictions or other provisions applicable to"
"7160","the sale or purchase of such Shares herein and"
"7161","the 1940 Act."
"7162","Section 2.	Ownership of Shares.  The ownership"
"7163"," of Shares shall be recorded on the books of the"

"7165","agent for the Trust, which books shall be maintained"
"7166","separately for the Shares of the Trust and each Series"
"7167","and each Class thereof that has been established"
"7168"," and designated.  No certificates certifying the"
"7169","ownership of Shares shall be issued except as the"
"7170"," Board of Trustees may otherwise determine from time"
"7171"," to time.  The Board of Trustees may make such rules"
"7172","not inconsistent with the provisions of the 1940 Act as it"
"7173","considers appropriate for the issuance of Share certificates,"
"7174","the transfer of Shares of the Trust and each Series and Class"
"7175"," thereof, if any, and similar matters.  The record books of"
"7176"," the Trust as kept by the Trust or any transfer or"
"7177","similar agent, as the case may be, shall be conclusive"
"7178","as to who are the Shareholders of the Trust and"
"7179","each Series and Class thereof and as to the number"
"7180","of Shares of the Trust and each Series and Class"
"7181","thereof held from time to time by each such Shareholder."
"7182","Section 3.	Sale of Shares.  Subject to the 1940 Act"
"7183","and applicable law, the Trust may sell its authorized but"
"7184","unissued Shares to such Persons, at such times, on such"
"7185","terms, and for such consideration as the Board of Trustees"
"7186"," may from time to time authorize.  Each sale shall be"
"7187"," credited to the individual purchaser's account in"
"7188","the form of full or fractional Shares of the Trust"
"7189","or such Series thereof (and Class thereof, if any),"
"7190"," as the purchaser may select, at the net asset"
"7191","value per Share, subject to Section 22 of the 1940 Act,"
"7192"," and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder;"
"7193"," provided, however, that the Board of Trustees may,"
"7194","in its sole discretion, permit the Principal Underwriter"
"7195"," to impose a sales charge upon any such sale.  Every Shareholder"
"7196"," by virtue of having become a Shareholder shall be bound by"
"7197"," the terms of this Declaration of Trust.  Ownership of"
"7198","Shares shall not make any Shareholder a third-party"
"7199","beneficiary of any contract entered into by the Trust"

"7202","Personal Liability.  Shares shall be deemed to be personal"
"7203","property giving to Shareholders only the rights provided"
"7204","in this Declaration of Trust, the By-Laws, and under"
"7205","applicable law.  Ownership of Shares shall not entitle"
"7206","the Shareholder to any title in or to the whole or any"
"7207","part of the Trust Property or right to call for a"
"7208","partition or division of the same or for an accounting,"
"7209","nor shall the ownership of Shares constitute the"

"7220","such representative only to the rights of said"
"7221"," deceased, incapacitated, dissolved, terminated or"
"7222","bankrupt Shareholder under this Declaration of Trust."
"7223"," Neither the Trust nor the Trustees, nor any officer,"
"7224","employee or agent of the Trust, shall have any power"
"7225"," to bind personally any Shareholder, nor, except as"
"7226"," specifically provided herein, to call upon any"
"7227","Shareholder for the payment of any sum of money other than"
"7228"," such as the Shareholder may at any time personally"
"7229","agree to pay.  Each Share, when issued on the terms"
"7230","determined by the Board of Trustees, shall be fully"
"7231"," paid and nonassessable.  As provided in the DSTA,"
"7232","Shareholders shall be entitled to the same"
"7233","limitation of personal liability as that extended"
"7234","to stockholders of a private corporation organized"
"7235"," for profit under the General Corporation Law of"
"7236","the State of Delaware."

"7241"," Series as may be permitted or required under the"
"7242","Code, without the vote of any Shareholder."
"7243","Section 6.	Establishment and Designation of"
"7244","Series and Classes.  The establishment and designation"

"7248"," of the then Board of Trustees, which resolution"
"7249","shall set forth such establishment and designation"
"7250","whether directly in such resolutions or by reference"
"7251","to, or approval of, another document that sets forth"
"7252","the designation or otherwise identifies such Series"
"7253"," or Class, including any registration statement of"
"7254","the Trust and any amendment of this Declaration of"
"7255","Trust, and may provide, to the extent permitted by"
"7256","the DSTA, for rights, powers and duties of such Series"

"7417"," or the Trust generally except, in the case of a right"
"7418","or claim against the assets held with respect to any"
"7419","other Series, to the extent that such Shareholder has"
"7420","such a right or claim hereunder as a Shareholder of"
"7421","such other Series.  The Board of Trustees shall have"
"7422","full discretion, to the extent not inconsistent with"
"7423","the 1940 Act, to determine which items shall be treated as"
"7424","income and which items as capital; and each such"
"7425","determination and allocation shall be conclusive"
"7426","and binding upon the Shareholders."
"7427","(d)	Voting.  All Shares of the Trust entitled to"

"8322","Proceeding if such Person acted in good faith or in the case"
"8323","of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe"

"8341","(c)	Required Approval.  Any indemnification under this"
"8342","Article shall be made by the Trust if authorized in the specific"
"8343","case on a determination that indemnification of the Agent is"
"8344","proper in the circumstances by (i) a final decision on the merits"
"8345"," by a court or other body before whom the proceeding was brought"

"8348"," or an administrative proceeding against the Agent for"
"8349","insufficiency of evidence of any Disqualifying Conduct) or,"
"8350","(ii) in the absence of such a decision, a reasonable determination,"
"8351"," based upon a review of the facts, that the Agent was not liable"
"8352","by reason of Disqualifying Conduct, by (1) the vote of a majority"

"8364"," Agent is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this"
"8365","Article; provided, that at least one of the following conditions"
"8366"," for the advancement of expenses is met: (i) the Agent shall"
"8367"," provide a security for his undertaking, (ii) the Trust shall"

"8371","counsel in a written opinion, shall determine, based on a"
"8372","review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full"
"8373","trial-type inquiry), that there is reason to believe that"
"8374","the Agent ultimately will be found entitled to indemnification."
"8375","(e)	Other Contractual Rights.  Nothing contained in this Article"
"8376","shall affect any right to indemnification to which Persons other"

"8416","demand upon the Board of Trustees to bring the subject action"
"8417","unless an effort to cause the Board of Trustees to bring such"
"8418","an action is not likely to succeed.  For purposes of this"
"8419","Section 4, a demand on the Board of Trustees shall only be"
"8420","deemed not likely to succeed and therefore excused if a"
"8421","majority of the Board of Trustees, or a majority of any"

"8423"," is composed of Trustees who are not independent trustees"
"8424","(as such term is defined in the DSTA)."

"8435","  The Board of Trustees shall be entitled to retain counsel or"
"8436"," other advisors in considering the merits of the request and"
"8437","shall require an undertaking by the Shareholders making such"
"8438"," request to reimburse the Trust for the expense of any such"

"8440"," not to bring such action."
"8441","For purposes of this Section 4, the Board of Trustees may"

"8691","among the various Series the assets associated with which have"
"8692","been so sold, conveyed and transferred, and due effect to the"

"8709"," additional procedures necessary or appropriate to"

"8711"," including the power to create one or more separate statutory"
"8712","trusts to which all or any part of the assets, liabilities,"

"8714"," for the conversion of Shares into beneficial interests in"
"8715","such separate statutory trust or trusts."

"8717","the 1940 Act, the Board of Trustees, by vote of a majority"
"8718"," of the Trustees, and without a Shareholder vote, may"
"8719","cause the Trust or any one or more Series to convert to a"
"8720"," master feeder structure (a structure in which a feeder"
"8721","fund invests all of its assets in a master fund, rather than"
"8722","making investments in securities directly) and thereby cause"
"8723"," existing Series of the Trust to either become feeders in"
"8724","a master fund, or to become master funds in which other"
"8725","funds are feeders."
"8726","Section 4.	Absence of Appraisal or Dissenters' Rights."
"8727","  No Shareholder shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to relief"
"8728","as a dissenting Shareholder in respect of any proposal or action"
"8729"," involving the Trust or any Series or any Class thereof."

"8820","Section 3.	Provisions in Conflict with Law or Regulations."
"8821","(a)	The provisions of this Declaration of Trust are"
"8822","severable, and if the Board of Trustees shall determine,"
"8823","with the advice of counsel, that any of such provisions"
"8824","is in conflict with the 1940 Act, the Code, the DSTA, or"
"8825","with other applicable laws and regulations, the conflicting"
"8826","provision shall be deemed not to have constituted a part"
"8827","of this Declaration of Trust from the time when such"
"8828","provisions became inconsistent with such laws or"
"8829","regulations; provided, however, that such determination"
"8830"," shall not affect any of the remaining provisions of"
"8831","this Declaration of Trust or render invalid or improper"
"8832","any action taken or omitted prior to such determination."
"8833","(b)	If any provision of this Declaration of Trust shall"
"8834"," be held invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such"
"8835","invalidity or unenforceability shall attach only to such"
"8836","provision in such jurisdiction and shall not in any manner"
"8837"," affect such provision in any other jurisdiction or any"
"8838","other provision of this Declaration of Trust in any jurisdiction."
"8839","Section 4.	Statutory Trust Only.  It is the intention"
"8840","of the Trustees to create hereby a statutory trust"
"8841"," pursuant to the DSTA, and thereby to create the relationship"
"8842"," of trustee and beneficial owners within the meaning"
"8843","of the DSTA between, respectively, the Trustees and each"
"8844","Shareholder.  It is not the intention of the Trustees to"
"8845","create a general or limited partnership, limited liability"
"8846"," company, joint stock association, corporation, bailment,"
"8847","or any form of legal relationship other than a statutory"
"8848","trust pursuant to the DSTA.  Nothing in this Declaration of"

"8850","by themselves or with the Trustees, partners or members of"
"8851","a joint stock association."
"8852","Section 5.	Use of the Names Franklin, Templeton,"
"8853"," Fiduciary Trust, and/or Institutional Fiduciary Trust."
"8854"," The Board of Trustees expressly agrees and acknowledges that"
"8855"," the names Franklin, Templeton, Fiduciary Trust, and"

"8860","Trustees further expressly agrees and acknowledges that the"
"8861","non-exclusive license granted herein may be terminated by"
"8862","FRI if the Trust ceases to use FRI or one of its Affiliates"
"8863","as Investment Adviser or to use other Affiliates or successors"
"8864"," of FRI for such purposes.  In such event, the non-exclusive"
"8865","license may be revoked by FRI and the Trust shall cease using"

"8956","and Franklin Virginia Tax-Free Income Fund (the Funds)"
"8957","as of and for the year ended February 28, 2019, in"
"8958","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"8959","Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),"
"8960","we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"8961","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"8962","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"8963"," for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"8964","financial statements and to comply with the"
"8965","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose"
"8966","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"8967","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"8968","do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"8969"," the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"8970","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"8971","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"8972"," over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"8973","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"8974","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"8975"," A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"8976"," is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"8977","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"8978"," preparation of financial statements for external"
"8979","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"8980","accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"8981","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"8982"," procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"8983","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"8984","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"8985","the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"8986"," assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"8987","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"8988","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"8989","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"8990","company are being made only in accordance with"
"8991","authorizations of management and directors of the company;"
"8992"," and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"8993","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"8994","disposition of a company's assets that could have a material"
"8995"," effect on the financial statements."
"8996","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"8997","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"8998","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"8999","future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"9000","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"9001","that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"9002","procedures may deteriorate."
"9003","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"9004","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"9005","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"9006","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"9007"," misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is"
"9008"," a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"9009","internal control over financial reporting, such that"
"9010","there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"9011","misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"9012","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"9013","detected on a timely basis."
"9014","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"9015"," financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"9016","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"9017"," necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"9018","control over financial reporting that might be"
"9019","material weaknesses under standards established"
"9020","by the PCAOB. However, we noted no deficiencies"
"9021","in the Funds' internal control over financial"
"9022","reporting and its operation, including controls"
"9023"," over safeguarding securities, that we consider"
"9024","to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"9025","February 28, 2019."
"9026","This report is intended solely for the information"

"9119","feature for the Fund's Class C shares"
"9120","(which includes Class C1 shares as applicable) that"
"9121","will automatically convert shareholders' Class C shares"
"9122","into Class A shares of the same Fund after they"
"9123","have been held for 10 years. After conversion,"
"9124","your new shares will be subject to Class A shares'"
"9125","lower Rule 12b-1 fees. The conversion feature will become"
"9126","effective on or about October 5, 2018.  Later that month"
"9127","Class C shares of the Fund that have been outstanding for"
"9128"," 10 years or more will automatically convert to Class A shares"
"9129","of such Fund on the basis of the relative net asset values of"
"9130","the two classes. Thereafter, Class C shares of the Fund will"
"9131","convert automatically to Class A shares of such Fund on a"
"9132"," monthly basis in the month of, or the month following,"
"9133","the 10-year anniversary of the Class C shares'"
"9134","purchase date. Class C shares of the Fund acquired"
"9135","through automatic reinvestment of dividends or"
"9136","distributions will convert to Class A shares"
"9137","of the Fund on the conversion date pro rata"
"9138","with the converting Class C shares of the"
"9139","Fund that were not acquired through reinvestment"
"9140"," of dividends or distributions."
"9141","Shareholders will not pay a sales charge, including a contingent"
"9142"," deferred sales charge, upon the conversion of their"
"9143","Class C shares to Class A shares pursuant to this"
"9144","conversion feature. The automatic conversion of the"
"9145","Fund's Class C shares into Class A shares after the"
"9146","10-year holding period is not expected to be a taxable"
"9147","event for federal income tax purposes. Shareholders"
"9148","should consult with their tax advisor regarding the"
"9149","state and local tax consequences of such conversions."
"9150","Class C shares held through a financial intermediary"
"9151","in an omnibus account will be converted into"
"9152","Class A shares only if the intermediary can document"
"9153"," that the shareholder has met the required holding"
"9154"," period. In certain circumstances, when shares are"
"9155","invested through retirement plans, omnibus accounts,"
"9156","and in certain other instances, the Fund and its"
"9157","agents may not have transparency into how long a"
"9158","shareholder has held Class C shares for purposes"
"9159","of determining whether such Class C shares are"
"9160","eligible for automatic conversion into Class A shares"
"9161","and the financial intermediary may not have the ability"
"9162"," to track purchases to credit individual shareholders'"
"9163","holding periods.  This primarily occurs when shares are"
"9164","invested through certain record keepers for group"
"9165","retirement plans, where the intermediary cannot track"
"9166"," share aging at the participant level.  In these"
"9167","circumstances, the Fund will not be able to automatically"
"9168","convert Class C shares into Class A shares as described above."
"9169","In order to determine eligibility for conversion in these"
"9170"," circumstances, it is the responsibility of the shareholder or"
"9171","their financial intermediary to notify the Fund that the"
"9172","shareholder is eligible for the conversion of Class C shares"
"9173","to Class A shares, and the shareholder or their financial"
"9174","intermediary may be required to maintain and provide the Fund"
"9175","with records that substantiate the holding period of"
"9176","Class C shares. It is the financial intermediary's"
"9177","(and not the Fund's) responsibility to keep records and to"
"9178","ensure that the shareholder is credited with the proper holding"
"9179"," period. Please consult with your financial intermediary about"
"9180","your shares' eligibility for this conversion feature."
"9181","Also effective October 5, 2018, new accounts or plans may not"
"9182","be eligible to purchase Class C shares of the Fund if it is"
"9183","determined that the intermediary cannot track shareholder"
"9184","holding periods to determine whether a shareholder's"
"9185","Class C shares are eligible for conversion to Class A shares."
"9186"," Accounts or plans (and their successor, related and affiliated plans)"
"9187"," that have Class C shares of the Fund available to"
"9188","participants on or before October 5, 2018, may continue to"
"9189"," open accounts for new participants in such share class and purchase"
"9190","additional shares in existing participant accounts.  The Fund"
"9191","has no responsibility for overseeing, monitoring or implementing"
"9192"," a financial intermediary's process for determining whether"
"9193","a shareholder meets the required holding period for conversion."
"9194","A financial intermediary may sponsor and/or control"
"9195","accounts, programs or platforms that impose a different"
"9196","conversion schedule or different eligibility requirements"
"9197","for the conversion of Class C shares into Class A shares."
"9198","In these cases, Class C shareholders may convert to"
"9199","Class A shares under the policies of the financial"
"9200","intermediary and the conversion may be structured as"
"9201","an exchange of Class C shares for Class A shares of"
"9202","the same Fund. Financial intermediaries will be"
"9203","responsible for making such exchanges in those"
"9204","circumstances. Please consult with your financial"
"9205","intermediary if you have any questions regarding your shares'"
"9206"," conversion from Class C shares to Class A shares."
