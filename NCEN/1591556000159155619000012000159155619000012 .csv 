"4612","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"4613","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"4614","preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"4615","and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"4616","authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"4617","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
