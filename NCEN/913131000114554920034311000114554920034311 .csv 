"446","<TEXT>"
"447","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"448","To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Nicholas Equity Income"
"449","Fund, Inc."
"450","Opinion on the Financial Statements and Financial Highlights"
"451","We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of"
"452","Nicholas Equity Income Fund, Inc. (the Fund), including the schedule of"
"453","investments, as of March 31, 2020, and the related statement of operations"
"454","for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each"
"455","of the two years in the period then ended, the financial highlights for each"
"456","of the five years in the period then ended, and the related notes. In our"
"457","opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights present fairly,"
"458","in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as of"
"459","March 31, 2020, and the results of its operations for the year then ended,"
"460","the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then"
"461","ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period"
"462","then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in"
"463","the United States of America."
"464","Basis for Opinion"
"465","These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility"
"466","of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the"
"467","Fund's financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits. We"
"468","are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting"
"469","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent"
"470","with respect to the Fund in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws"
"471","and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange"
"472","Commission and the PCAOB."
"473","We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those"
"474","standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable"
"475","assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are"
"476","free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Fund is not"
"477","required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal"
"478","control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to"
"479","obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not"
"480","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"481","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"482","opinion."
"483","Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material"
"484","misstatement of the financial statements and financial highlights, whether"
"485","due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks."
"486","Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the"
"487","amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights."
"488","Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and"
"489","significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall"
"490","presentation of the financial statements and financial highlights. Our"
"491","procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of March 31, 2020,"
"492","by correspondence with the custodian and brokers. We believe that our audits"
"493","provide a reasonable basis for our opinion."
"494","/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP"
"495","Milwaukee, Wisconsin"
"496","May 29, 2020"
"497","We have served as the auditor of one or more Nicholas investment"
"498","companies since 1977."
