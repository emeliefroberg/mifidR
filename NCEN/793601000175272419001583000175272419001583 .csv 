"939","for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"

"941","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"942","and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in"
"943","the United States of America (<B><I>&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;</I></B>). A company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes"
"944","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"945","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"946","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures"
"947","of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide"
"948","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company&rsquo;s"
"949","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
