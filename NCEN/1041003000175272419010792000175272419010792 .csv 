"339","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"340","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"341","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility"
"342","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"343","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"344","controls.  A companys internal control over financial"
"345","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"346","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"347","and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"348","purposes in accordance with accounting principles"
"349","generally accepted in the United States of America"
"350","(GAAP).  A companys internal control over financial"
"351","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"352","pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable"
"353","detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"354","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"355","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"356","necessary to permit preparation of the financial"
"357","statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts"

"362","unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of a"
"363","companys assets that could have a material effect on"
"364","the financial statements."
"365","Because of inherent limitations internal control over"
"366","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"367","misstatements.  Also projections of any evaluation of"
"368","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"369","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"370","conditions or that the degree of compliance with the"
"371","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"372","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"373","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"374","allow management or employees in the normal course of"
"375","performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect"
"376","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness"
"377","is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal"
"378","control over financial reporting such that there is a"
"379","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"380","Funds annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"381","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
