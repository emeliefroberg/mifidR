"770","<P style=margin:0px; font-size:12pt align=justify>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect material misstatements. &nbsp;Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds&#146; annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</P>"
