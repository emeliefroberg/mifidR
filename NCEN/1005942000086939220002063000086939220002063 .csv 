"940","Fund ) as of and for the year ended July 31, 2020, in accordance"
"941","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"942","Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Funds internal"
"943","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"944","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"945","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"946","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"

"949","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"

"952","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"953","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"954","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"955","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"956","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"957","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"958","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"959","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"960","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"961","companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"962","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"963","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"964","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"965","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"966","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"

"969","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"

"972","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a companys"
"973","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"974","statements."
"975","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"976","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"977","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"

"979","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"980","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"981","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"982","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"983","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
