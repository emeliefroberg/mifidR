"3694","and for the year ended August 31, 2020, in accordance with the"
"3695","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"3696","(United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Fund's internal"
"3697","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"3698","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"3699","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"

"3706","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"

"3710","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"3711","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"3712","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal"
"3713","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"

"3731","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."

"3734","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
