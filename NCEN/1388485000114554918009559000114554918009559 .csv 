"3917","&#145;&#145;Program&#146;&#146;), providing for the lending of securities to qualified brokers. Securities lending income includes earnings of such temporary cash investments, plus or minus any rebate to a borrower. These earnings (after any rebate)"
"3918","are then divided between the Bank of New York Mellon, as a fee for its services under the Program, and the Funds, according to agreed-upon rates. Collateral on all securities loaned is accepted in cash and is maintained at a minimum level of 102%"
"3919","(105% in the case of certain foreign securities) of the market value, plus interest, if applicable, of investments on loan. It is the Funds&#146; policy to obtain additional collateral from or return excess collateral to the borrower by the end of"
"3920","the next business day, following the valuation date of the securities loaned. Therefore, the value of the collateral held may be temporarily less than the value of the securities on loan. Lending securities entails a risk of loss to the Funds if and"
"3921","to the extent that the market value of the securities loaned were to increase and the borrower did not increase the collateral accordingly, and the borrower fails to return the securities. Under the terms of the Program, the Funds are indemnified"
