"3526","Notice of Automatic Conversion of Class C Shares to Class A"
"3527"," Shares after 10-Year Holding Period"
"3528","At Board meetings held on February 26 and 27, 2018,"
"3529","the Board of Trustees approved an automatic conversion feature"
"3530"," for the Fund's Class C shares (which includes Class C1"
"3531"," shares as applicable) that will automatically convert"
"3532"," shareholders' Class C shares into Class A shares of the same"
"3533"," Fund after they have been held for 10 years. After conversion,"
"3534"," your new shares will be subject to Class A shares' lower"
"3535"," Rule 12b-1 fees. The conversion feature will become effective"
"3536"," on or about October 5, 2018.  Later that month Class C shares"
"3537"," of the Fund that have been outstanding for 10 years or"
"3538"," more will automatically convert to Class A shares of such"
"3539"," Fund on the basis of the relative net asset values"
"3540"," of the two classes. Thereafter, Class C shares of the"
"3541"," Fund will convert automatically to Class A shares of such"
"3542"," Fund on a monthly basis in the month of, or the month"
"3543"," following, the 10-year anniversary of the Class C shares'"
"3544"," purchase date. Class C shares of the Fund acquired"
"3545"," through automatic reinvestment of dividends or distributions"
"3546"," will convert to Class A shares of the Fund on the conversion"
"3547"," date pro rata with the converting Class C shares of the"
"3548"," Fund that were not acquired through reinvestment of"
"3549"," dividends or distributions."
"3550","Shareholders will not pay a sales charge, including a"
"3551"," contingent deferred sales charge, upon the conversion of"
"3552"," their Class C shares to Class A shares pursuant to this"
"3553"," conversion feature. The automatic conversion of the Fund's"
"3554"," Class C shares into Class A shares after the 10-year holding"
"3555"," period is not expected to be a taxable event for federal"
"3556"," income tax purposes. Shareholders should consult"
"3557"," with their tax advisor regarding the state"
"3558"," and local tax consequences of such conversions."
"3559","Class C shares held through a financial intermediary"
"3560"," in an omnibus account will be converted into Class A shares"
"3561"," only if the intermediary can document that the shareholder"
"3562"," has met the required holding period. In certain circumstances,"
"3563"," when shares are invested through retirement plans,"
"3564"," omnibus accounts, and in certain other instances,"
"3565"," the Fund and its agents may not have transparency into"
"3566"," how long a shareholder has held Class C shares for purposes"
"3567"," of determining whether such Class C shares are eligible"
"3568"," for automatic conversion into Class A shares and the"
"3569"," financial intermediary may not have the ability to track"
"3570"," purchases to credit individual shareholders' holding periods."
"3571","  This primarily occurs when shares are invested through"
"3572"," certain record keepers for group retirement plans, where"
"3573"," the intermediary cannot track share aging at the"
"3574"," participant level.  In these circumstances, the Fund"
"3575"," will not be able to automatically convert Class C shares"
"3576"," into Class A shares as described above. In order"
"3577"," to determine eligibility for conversion in these"
"3578"," circumstances, it is the responsibility of the"
"3579"," shareholder or their financial intermediary to notify"
"3580"," the Fund that the shareholder is eligible for the"
"3581"," conversion of Class C shares to Class A shares,"
"3582"," and the shareholder or their financial intermediary"
"3583"," may be required to maintain and provide the Fund"
"3584"," with records that substantiate the holding period"
"3585"," of Class C shares. It is the financial intermediary's"
"3586"," (and not the Fund's) responsibility to keep records"
"3587"," and to ensure that the shareholder is credited"
"3588"," with the proper holding period. Please consult with"
"3589"," your financial intermediary about your shares'"
"3590"," eligibility for this conversion feature."
"3591","Also effective October 5, 2018, new accounts or plans"
"3592"," may not be eligible to purchase Class C shares of"
"3593"," the Fund if it is determined that the intermediary"
"3594"," cannot track shareholder holding periods to determine"
"3595"," whether a shareholder's Class C shares are eligible"
"3596"," for conversion to Class A shares.  Accounts or plans"
"3597"," (and their successor, related and affiliated plans)"
"3598"," that have Class C shares of the Fund available"
"3599"," to participants on or before October 5, 2018, may continue"
"3600"," to open accounts for new participants in such share class"
"3601"," and purchase additional shares in existing"
"3602"," participant accounts.  The Fund has no responsibility"
"3603"," for overseeing, monitoring or implementing a financial"
"3604"," intermediary's process for determining whether"
"3605"," a shareholder meets the required holding period for conversion."
"3606","A financial intermediary may sponsor and/or control accounts,"
"3607"," programs or platforms that impose a different conversion"
"3608"," schedule or different eligibility requirements for the"
"3609"," conversion of Class C shares into Class A shares."
"3610"," In these cases, Class C shareholders may convert"
"3611"," to Class A shares under the policies of the"
"3612"," financial intermediary and the conversion may be structured"
"3613"," as an exchange of Class C shares for Class A shares"
"3614"," of the same Fund. Financial intermediaries"
"3615"," will be responsible for making such exchanges"
"3616"," in those circumstances. Please consult with your"
"3617"," financial intermediary if you have any questions"
"3618"," regarding your shares' conversion from"
"3619"," Class C shares to Class A shares."

"3628","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"3629","To the Board of Trustees of Templeton Income Trust"
"3630","and Shareholders of Templeton Global Bond Fund,"
"3631","Templeton International Bond Fund,"
"3632","Templeton Global Total Return Fund"
"3633","and Templeton Emerging Markets Bond Fund"
"3634","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"3635","Templeton Global Bond Fund, Templeton International Bond Fund,"
"3636","Templeton Global Total Return Fund and"
"3637","Templeton Emerging Markets Bond Fund (the Funds)"
"3638","as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 in accordance with the"
"3639","standards of the"
"3640","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),"
"3641","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"3642","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"3643","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"3644","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"3645","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"3646","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"3647","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"3648","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"3649","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"3650","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"3651","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"3652","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"3653","controls.  A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"3654","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"3655","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"3656","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"3657","accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over"
"3658","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"3659","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"3660","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"3661","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"3662"," are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"3663","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"3664","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"3665","with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and"
"3666","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"3667","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"3668","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3669","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"3670","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"3671","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"3672","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"3673","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"3674","procedures may deteriorate."
"3675","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"3676","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"3677","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"3678","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"3679","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"3680","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there"
"3681","is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"3682","company's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"3683","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3684","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3685","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"3686","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"3687","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"3688","weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB."
"3689","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over"
"3690","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"3691","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as"
"3692","defined above as of December 31, 2018."

"4040"," contrary from any one of them.  A proxy purporting"
"4041"," to be by or on behalf of a Shareholder shall be deemed"
"4042"," valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise"
"4043"," and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest with"

"5252","ARTICLE III SHARES"
"5253","Section 1.	Division of Beneficial Interest."
"5254","(a)	The beneficial interest in the Trust shall be"
"5255"," divided into Shares, each Share without a par value."
"5256","  The number of Shares in the Trust authorized"
"5257"," hereunder, and of each Series and Class as may be"
"5258"," established from time to time, is unlimited.  The"
"5259"," Board of Trustees may authorize the division of"
"5260"," Shares into separate Classes of Shares and into"
"5261"," separate and distinct Series of Shares and the"
"5262"," division of any Series into separate Classes"
"5263"," of Shares in accordance with"
"5264","the 1940 Act.  The different Series and Classes"
"5265"," shall be established and designated pursuant to"
"5266"," Article III, Section 6 hereof.  If no separate"
"5267"," Series or Classes of Series shall be established,"
"5268"," the Shares shall have the rights, powers and duties"
"5269"," provided for herein and in Article III, Section 6"
"5270"," hereof to the extent relevant and not otherwise"
"5271"," provided for herein, and all references to Series"
"5272"," and Classes shall be construed"
"5273"," (as the context may require) to refer to the Trust."
"5274","(i)	The fact that the Trust shall have one or more"
"5275"," established and designated Classes of the Trust,"
"5276"," shall not limit the authority of the Board of"
"5277"," Trustees to establish and designate additional"
"5278"," Classes of the Trust.  The fact that one or more"
"5279"," Classes of the Trust shall have initially been"
"5280"," established and designated without any specific"
"5281"," establishment or designation of a Series"
"5282"," (i.e., that all Shares of the Trust are initially"
"5283"," Shares of one or more Classes) shall not limit"
"5284"," the authority of the Board of Trustees to later"
"5285"," establish and designate a Series and establish"
"5286"," and designate the Class or Classes of the Trust"
"5287"," as Class or Classes, respectively, of such Series."
"5288","(ii)	The fact that a Series shall have initially"
"5289"," been established and designated without any specific"
"5290"," establishment or designation of Classes (i.e., that"
"5291","all Shares of such Series are initially of a single Class)"
"5292"," shall not limit the authority of the Board of Trustees"
"5293"," to establish and designate separate Classes of said Series."
"5294","  The fact that a Series shall have more than one"
"5295"," established and designated Class, shall not limit"
"5296"," the authority of the Board of Trustees to"
"5297"," establish and designate additional Classes of said Series."
"5298","(b)	The Board of Trustees shall have the power to"
"5299"," issue authorized, but unissued Shares of the Trust,"
"5300"," or any Series and Class thereof, from time to time"
"5301"," for such consideration paid wholly or partly in"
"5302"," cash, securities or other property, as may be"
"5303"," determined from time to time by the Board of"
"5304"," Trustees, subject to any requirements or limitations of the"
"5305","1940 Act.  The Board of Trustees, on behalf of the"
"5306"," Trust, may acquire and hold as treasury shares,"
"5307"," reissue for such consideration and on such terms"
"5308"," as it may determine, or cancel, at its discretion"
"5309"," from time to time, any Shares reacquired by the Trust."
"5310","  The Board of Trustees may classify, reclassify or"
"5311"," convert any unissued Shares or any Shares of the"
"5312"," Trust or any Series or Class thereof, that were"
"5313"," previously issued and are reacquired, into one"
"5314"," or more Series or Classes that may be established"
"5315"," and designated from time to time and, in connection"
"5316"," therewith, cause some or all of the Shareholders"
"5317"," of the Trust, such Series or Class to become"
"5318"," Shareholders of such other Series or Class."
"5319","  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust and any"
"5320"," Series thereof may acquire, hold, sell and otherwise"
"5321"," deal in, for purposes of investment or otherwise,"
"5322"," the Shares of any other Series of the Trust or"
"5323"," Shares of the Trust, and such Shares shall not"
"5324","be deemed treasury shares or cancelled."
"5325","(c)	Subject to the provisions of Section 6"
"5326"," of this Article III, each Share shall entitle"
"5327"," the holder to voting rights as provided in Article"
"5328"," V hereof.  Shareholders shall have no preemptive"
"5329"," or other right to subscribe for new or additional"
"5330"," authorized, but unissued Shares or other securities"
"5331"," issued by the Trust or any Series thereof."
"5332","  The Board of Trustees may from time to time"
"5333"," divide or combine the Shares of the Trust or any"
"5334"," particular Series thereof into a greater or"
"5335","lesser number of Shares of the Trust or that Series,"
"5336"," respectively.  Such division or combination shall"
"5337"," not materially change the proportionate beneficial"
"5338"," interests of the holders of Shares of the Trust or"
"5339"," that Series, as the case may be, in the Trust"
"5340"," Property at the time of such division or combination"
"5341"," that is held with respect to the Trust or that"
"5342"," Series, as the case may be."
"5343","(d)	Any Trustee, officer or other agent of the Trust,"
"5344"," and any organization in which any such Person has an"
"5345"," economic or other interest, may acquire, own, hold"
"5346"," and dispose of Shares in the Trust or any Series and"
"5347"," Class thereof, whether such Shares are authorized"
"5348"," but unissued, or already outstanding, to the same"
"5349"," extent as if such Person were not a Trustee, officer"
"5350"," or other agent of the Trust; and the Trust or any"
"5351"," Series may issue and sell and may purchase such Shares"
"5352"," from any such Person or any such organization,"
"5353"," subject to the limitations, restrictions or other"
"5354","provisions applicable to the sale or purchase"
"5355"," of such Shares herein and the 1940 Act."
"5356","Section 2.	Ownership of Shares.  The ownership"
"5357"," of Shares shall be recorded on the books of the Trust"
"5358"," kept by the Trust or by a transfer or similar agent"
"5359"," for the Trust, which books shall be maintained"
"5360"," separately for the Shares of the Trust and each"
"5361"," Series and each Class thereof that has been"
"5362"," established and designated.  No certificates certifying"
"5363"," the ownership of Shares shall be issued except"
"5364"," as the Board of Trustees may otherwise determine"
"5365"," from time to time.  The"
"5366","Board of Trustees may make such rules not inconsistent"
"5367"," with the provisions of the 1940 Act as it considers"
"5368"," appropriate for the issuance of Share certificates"
"5369",", the transfer of Shares of the Trust and each"
"5370"," Series and Class thereof, if any, and similar"
"5371"," matters.  The record books of the Trust as kept"
"5372"," by the Trust or any transfer or similar agent,"
"5373"," as the case may be, shall be conclusive as to who"
"5374","are the Shareholders of the Trust and each Series and"
"5375"," Class thereof and as to the number of Shares of the"
"5376"," Trust and each Series and Class thereof held from"
"5377"," time to time by each such Shareholder."
"5378","Section 3.	Sale of Shares.  Subject to the 1940 Act"
"5379"," and applicable law, the Trust may sell its authorized"
"5380"," but unissued Shares to such Persons, at such times,"
"5381"," on such terms, and for such consideration as the Board"
"5382"," of Trustees may from time to time authorize.  Each sale"
"5383"," shall be credited to the individual purchaser's account"
"5384"," in the form of full or fractional Shares of the Trust"
"5385"," or such Series thereof (and Class thereof, if any),"
"5386"," as the purchaser may select, at the net asset value"
"5387"," per Share, subject to Section 22 of the 1940 Act,"
"5388"," and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder;"
"5389"," provided, however, that the Board of Trustees may,"
"5390"," in its sole discretion, permit the Principal Underwriter"
"5391"," to impose a sales charge upon any such sale.  Every"
"5392"," Shareholder by virtue of having become a Shareholder"
"5393"," shall be bound by the terms of this Declaration of"
"5394"," Trust. Ownership of Shares shall not make any"
"5395"," Shareholder a third-party beneficiary of any contract"
"5396"," entered into by the Trust or any Series."
"5397","Section 4.	Status of Shares and Limitation of"
"5398"," Personal Liability.  Shares shall be deemed to be"
"5399"," personal property giving to Shareholders only the"
"5400"," rights provided in this Declaration of Trust, the"
"5401"," By-Laws, and under applicable law.  Ownership of Shares"

"5404"," right to call for a partition or division of the"
"5405"," same or for an accounting, nor shall the ownership"
"5406"," of Shares constitute the Shareholders as partners."
"5407","  Subject to Article VIII, Section 1 hereof, the death,"
"5408"," incapacity, dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of"
"5409"," a Shareholder during the existence of the Trust and any"
"5410"," Series thereof shall not operate to dissolve the Trust"
"5411","or any such Series, nor entitle the representative of"
"5412"," any deceased, incapacitated, dissolved, terminated"
"5413"," or bankrupt Shareholder"
"5414","to an accounting or to take any action in court or"
"5415"," elsewhere against the Trust, the Trustees or any"
"5416"," such Series, but entitles such representative only"
"5417"," to the rights of said deceased, incapacitated, dissolved,"
"5418"," terminated or bankrupt Shareholder under this Declaratio"
"5419","n of Trust.  Neither the Trust nor the Trustees,"
"5420"," nor any officer, employee or agent of the Trust,"
"5421"," shall have any power to bind personally any Shareholder"
"5422",", nor, except as specifically provided herein, to call"
"5423"," upon any Shareholder for the payment of any sum of"
"5424"," money other than such as the Shareholder may at any"
"5425"," time personally agree to pay.  Each Share, when issued"
"5426"," on the terms determined by the Board of Trustees,"
"5427"," shall be fully paid and nonassessable.  As provided"
"5428"," in the DSTA, Shareholders shall be entitled to the"
"5429"," same limitation of personal liability as that extended"
"5430"," to stockholders of a private corporation organized"
"5431"," for profit under the General Corporation Law of"

"5439","Section 6.	Establishment and Designation of"
"5440","Series and Classes.  The establishment and designation"
"5441"," of any Series or Class shall be effective, without"
"5442"," the requirement of Shareholder approval, upon the"
"5443"," adoption of a resolution by not less than a majority"
"5444"," of the then Board of Trustees, which resolution"
"5445"," shall set forth such establishment and designation"
"5446"," whether directly in such resolutions or by reference"

"5448"," the designation or otherwise identifies such Series or"
"5449"," Class, including any registration statement of the Trust"

"5470"," shall be separate and distinct from any other Class of"
