"4819"," Report of Independent Registered Public"
"4820","Accounting Firm"
"4821","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"4822","Baron Select Funds"
"4823","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"4824","statements of Baron Partners Fund, Baron Focused"
"4825","Growth Fund, Baron International Growth Fund, Baron"
"4826","Real Estate Fund, Baron Emerging Markets Fund, Baron"
"4827","Energy and Resources Fund, Baron Global Advantage"

"4829","Care Fund and Baron WealthBuilder Fund (ten of the"
"4830","funds constituting Baron Select Funds, hereafter"
"4831","referred to as the Funds) as of and for the periods"
"4832","ended December 31, 2018, in accordance with the"
"4833","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"4834","Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the"
"4835","Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"4836","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"4837","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"4838","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"4839","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"4840","N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"4841","on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"4842","financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an"
"4843","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"4844","control over financial reporting."
"4845","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"4846","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"4847","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"4848","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"4849","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"4850","A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"4851","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"4852","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"4853","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"4854","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"4855","principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"4856","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"4857","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"4858","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"4859","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"4860","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"4861","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"4862","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"4863","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"4864","fund are being made only in accordance with"
"4865","authorizations of management and trustees of the fund;"
"4866","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"4867","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"4868","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that"
"4869","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"4870","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"4871","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"4872","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"4873","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"4874","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"4875","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"4876","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"4877","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"4878","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"4879","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"4880","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"4881","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is"
"4882","a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"4883","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"4884","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"4885","the fund's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"4886","be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 2"

"4896","no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over"
"4897","financial reporting and their operation, including"
"4898","controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
