"1451","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1452","To the Board of Directors of M Fund, Inc."
"1453","and the Shareholders of"
"1454","M International Equity Fund,"
"1455","M Large Cap Growth Fund,"
"1456","M Capital Appreciation Fund and"
"1457","M Large Cap Value Fund"
"1458","Opinion on the Financial Statements"
"1459","We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and"
"1460","liabilities of M International Equity Fund, M Large"
"1461","Cap Growth Fund, M Capital Appreciation Fund and M Large"
"1462","Cap Value Fund, each a series of shares of M Fund,"
"1463","Inc. (the Funds), including the schedules of investments, as"
"1464","of December 31, 2018, and the related statements of"
"1465","operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes"
"1466","in net assets for each of the years in the two-year period then"
"1467","ended and the financial highlights for each of the years in the"
"1468","five-year period then ended, and the related notes (collectively"
"1469","referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the"
"1470","financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the"
"1471","financial position of the Funds as of December 31, 2018, and"
"1472","the results of their operations for the year then ended, the"
"1473","changes in their net assets for each of the years in the two-year"
"1474","period then ended and their financial highlights for each of the"
"1475","years in the five-year period then ended, in conformity with"
"1476","accounting principles generally accepted in the United States"
"1477","of America."
"1478","Basis for Opinion"
"1479","These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds'"
"1480","management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on"
"1481","the Funds' financial statements based on our audits. We are a"
"1482","public accounting firm registered with the Public Company"
"1483","Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and"
"1484","are required to be independent with respect to the Funds in"
"1485","accordance with the U.S. federal securities law and the"
"1486","applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and"
"1487","Exchange Commission and the PCAOB."
"1488","We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of"
"1489","the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform"
"1490","the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the"
"1491","financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether"
"1492","due to error or fraud. The Funds are not required to have, nor"
"1493","were we engaged to perform, an audit of their internal control"
"1494","over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required"
"1495","to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial"
"1496","reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1497","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1498","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1499","Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risk"
"1500","of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether"
"1501","due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond"
"1502","to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test"
"1503","basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the"
"1504","financial statements. Our  procedures included confirmation of"
"1505","securities owned as of December 31, 2018 by correspondence"
"1506","with the custodian and brokers and by other appropriate"
"1507","auditing procedures where responses from brokers were not"
"1508","received. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting"
"1509","principles used and significant estimates made by"
"1510","management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of"
"1511","the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a"
"1512","reasonable basis for our opinion."
"1513","/s/ BBD, LLP"
"1514","We have served as the auditor of one or more of the Funds in"
"1515","the M Fund, Inc. since 2008."
