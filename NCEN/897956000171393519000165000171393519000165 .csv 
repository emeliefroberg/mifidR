Insurance obligations under the Policies include, without limitation, any death benefits payable under the Policies and withdrawals of Cash Value. The guarantee does not guarantee the amount of Cash Value or the investment performance of the Divisions available under the Policy. In the event an Owner of such a Policy presents a legitimate claim for payment, Met Tower Life will pay such claim directly to the Owner if MetLife is unable to make such payment. This guarantee is enforceable by such Owners against Met Tower Life directly without any requirement that Owners first file a claim against MetLife.
