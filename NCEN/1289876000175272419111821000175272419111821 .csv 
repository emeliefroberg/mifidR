"737","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"738","To the Shareholders and"
"739","Board of Trustees of the Victory Institutional Funds"
"740","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"741","statements of Victory Institutional Diversified Stock"
"742","Fund (the Fund) (one of the portfolios comprising Victory"
"743","Institutional Funds (the Trust)) as of and for the year"
"744","ended October 31, 2018, in accordance with the standards"
"745","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"746","(United States), we considered the Trusts internal"
"747","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"748","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"749","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"750","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"
"751","the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose"
"752","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"753","Trusts internal control over financial reporting."
"754","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"755","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing"
"756","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"757","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"758","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"759","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A trusts"
"760","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"761","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"762","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"763","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"764","with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A trusts"
"765","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"766","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"767","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"768","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"769","the trust; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"770","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"771","statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted"
"772","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"773","the trust are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"774","of management and directors of the trust; and (3) provide"
"775","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"776","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a Trusts"
"777","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"778","statements."
"779","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"780","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"781","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"782","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"783","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"784","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"785","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"786","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"787","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"788","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"789","on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"790","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"791","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"792","material misstatement of the Trusts annual or interim financial"
"793","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"794","Our consideration of the Trusts internal control over financial"
"795","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"796","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"797","in internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"798","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"799","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"800","Trusts internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"801","including controls over safeguarding securities, which we consider"
"802","to be a material weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2018."
