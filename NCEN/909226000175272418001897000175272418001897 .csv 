"1194","Fund"
"1195","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"1196","of Templeton China World Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year"
"1197","ended August 31, 2018, in accordance with the standards of the"
"1198","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)"
"1199","(PCAOB), we considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1200","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"1201","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1202","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"1203","with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"1204","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"1205","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express"
"1206","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"1207","financial reporting."
"1208","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1209","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1210","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1211","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"1212","costs of controls.  A company's internal control over financial"
"1213","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1214","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1215","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1216","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1217","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1218","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1219","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1220","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"1221","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1222","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"1223","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1224","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only"
"1225","in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"1226","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1227","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"1228","or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material"
"1229","effect on the financial statements."
"1230","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1231","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1232","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1233","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"1234","because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"1235","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1236","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1237","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"1238","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1239","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"1240","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1241","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1242","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"1243","of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1244","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1245","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1246","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1247","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1248","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"1249","weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB.  However, we"

"1670","(a)	The beneficial interest in the Trust shall be divided into"
"1671","Shares, each Share without a par value.  The number of Shares in the"
"1672","Trust authorized hereunder, and of each Series and Class as may be"
"1673","established from time to time, is unlimited.  The Board of Trustees"
"1674","may authorize the division of Shares into separate Classes of Shares"
"1675","and into separate and distinct Series of Shares and the division of"
"1676","any Series into separate Classes of Shares in accordance with the"
"1677","1940 Act.  The different Series and Classes shall be established and"

"1680","have the rights, powers and duties provided for herein and in"
"1681","Article III, Section 6 hereof to the extent relevant and not"
"1682","otherwise provided for herein, and all references to Series and"
"1683","Classes shall be construed (as the context may require) to refer to"
"1684","the Trust."
"1685","	The fact that the Trust shall have one or more established and"
"1686","designated Classes of the Trust, shall not limit the authority of the"
"1687","Board of Trustees to establish and designate additional Classes of"
"1688","the Trust.  The fact that one or more Classes of the Trust shall have"
"1689","initially been established and designated without any specific"
"1690","establishment or designation of a Series (i.e., that all Shares of"
"1691","the Trust are initially Shares of one or more Classes) shall not"
"1692","limit the authority of the Board of Trustees to later establish and"

"1694","of the Trust as Class or Classes, respectively, of such Series."
"1695","	The fact that a Series shall have initially been established and"
"1696","designated without any specific establishment or designation of"
"1697","Classes (i.e., that all Shares of such Series are initially of a"

"1699","to establish and designate separate Classes of said Series."
"1700","The fact that a Series shall have more than one established and"

"1705","but unissued Shares of the Trust, or any Series and Class thereof,"
"1706","from time to time for such consideration paid wholly or partly in"
"1707","cash, securities or other property, as may be determined from time"
"1708","to time by the Board of Trustees, subject to any requirements or"
"1709","limitations of the 1940 Act.  The Board of Trustees, on behalf of the"
"1710","Trust, may acquire and hold as treasury shares, reissue for such"
"1711","consideration and on such terms as it may determine, or cancel, at"
"1712","its discretion from time to time, any Shares reacquired by the Trust."
"1713","The Board of Trustees may classify, reclassify or convert any"
"1714","unissued Shares or any Shares of the Trust or any Series or Class"
"1715","thereof, that were previously issued and are reacquired, into one"
"1716","or more Series or Classes that may be established and designated"
"1717","from time to time and, in connection therewith, cause some or all"
"1718","of the Shareholders of the Trust, such Series or Class to become"
"1719","Shareholders of such other Series or Class.  Notwithstanding the"

"1721","and otherwise deal in, for purposes of investment or otherwise, the"
"1722","Shares of any other Series of the Trust or Shares of the Trust, and"
"1723","such Shares shall not be deemed treasury shares or cancelled."
"1724","(c)	Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Article III, each"
"1725","Share shall entitle the holder to voting rights as provided in"
"1726","Article V hereof.  Shareholders shall have no preemptive or other"
"1727","right to subscribe for new or additional authorized, but unissued"
"1728","Shares or other securities issued by the Trust or any Series thereof."
"1729","The Board of Trustees may from time to time divide or combine the"
"1730","Shares of the Trust or any particular Series thereof into a greater"
"1731","or lesser number of Shares of the Trust or that Series, respectively."
"1732","Such division or combination shall not materially change the"

"1734","Trust or that Series, as the case may be, in the Trust Property at"
"1735","the time of such division or combination that is held with respect to"

"1743","the Trust or any Series may issue and sell and may purchase such"
"1744","Shares from any such Person or any such organization, subject to the"
"1745","limitations, restrictions or other provisions applicable to the sale"
"1746","or purchase of such Shares herein and the 1940 Act."
"1747","Section 2.	Ownership of Shares.  The ownership of Shares shall be"
"1748","recorded on the books of the Trust kept by the Trust or by a transfer"
"1749","or similar agent for the Trust, which books shall be maintained"
"1750","separately for the Shares of the Trust and each Series and each Class"
"1751","thereof that has been established and designated.  No certificates"
"1752","certifying the ownership of Shares shall be issued except as the"
"1753","Board of Trustees may otherwise determine from time to time."
"1754","The Board of Trustees may make such rules not inconsistent with the"
"1755","provisions of the 1940 Act as it considers appropriate for the"
"1756","issuance of Share certificates, the transfer of Shares of the Trust"
"1757","and each Series and Class thereof, if any, and similar matters."
"1758","The record books of the Trust as kept by the Trust or any transfer"
"1759","or similar agent, as the case may be, shall be conclusive as to who"
"1760","are the Shareholders of the Trust and each Series and Class thereof"

"1762","thereof held from time to time by each such Shareholder."

"1766","the Board of Trustees may from time to time authorize.  Each sale"

"1771","rules and regulations adopted thereunder; provided, however, that the"
"1772","Board of Trustees may, in its sole discretion, permit the Principal"
"1773","Underwriter to impose a sales charge upon any such sale."
"1774","Every Shareholder by virtue of having become a Shareholder shall be"
"1775","bound by the terms of this Declaration of Trust.  Ownership of Shares"
"1776","shall not make any Shareholder a third-party beneficiary of any"
"1777","contract entered into by the Trust or any Series."
"1778","Section 4.	Status of Shares and Limitation of Personal Liability."
"1779","Shares shall be deemed to be personal property giving to Shareholders"
"1780","only the rights provided in this Declaration of Trust, the By-Laws,"
"1781","and under applicable law.  Ownership of Shares shall not entitle the"

"2713","for any act or omission that constitutes a bad faith violation"

"2716","negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the"
"2717","conduct of such Agent (such conduct referred to herein as"
"2718","Disqualifying Conduct), and for nothing else."

"2723","the Trust or any Investment Adviser or Principal Underwriter of the"
"2724","Trust."
"2725","(d)	No Agent, when acting in its respective capacity as such,"
"2726","shall be personally liable to any Person, other than the Trust or"

"2752","or to take timely action with respect to entitlements, on the Trust's"

"2756","resulting from the imposition by any government of exchange control"
"2757","restrictions which might affect the liquidity of the Trust's assets"
"2758","or from any war or political act of any foreign government to which"
"2759","such assets might be exposed, except, in the case of a Trustee or"

"2761","Disqualifying Conduct."
"2762","(g)	The limitation on liability contained in this Article applies"
"2763","to events occurring at the time a Person serves as an Agent whether"

"2770","(a)	Indemnification by Trust.  The Trust shall indemnify, out of"
"2771","Trust Property, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law,"
"2772","any Person who was or is a party, potential party or non-party"
"2773","witness or is threatened to be made a party, potential party or"
"2774","non-party witness to any Proceeding by reason of the fact that such"
"2775","Person is or was an Agent of the Trust, against Expenses, judgments,"
"2776","fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred"
"2777","in connection with such Proceeding if such Person acted in good faith"
"2778","or in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to"
"2779","believe the conduct of such Person was unlawful.  The termination of"
"2780","any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or plea of"
"2781","nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not of itself create a"
"2782","presumption that the Person did not act in good faith or that the"
"2783","Person had reasonable cause to believe that the Person's conduct was"
"2784","unlawful."
"2785","(b)	Exclusion of Indemnification.  Notwithstanding any provision"
"2786","to the contrary contained herein, there shall be no right to"
"2787","indemnification for any liability arising by reason of the Agent's"

"2791","indemnification shall be made only to the extent that the court"
"2792","in which that action was brought shall determine, upon application"
"2793","or otherwise, that in view of all the circumstances of the case,"
"2794","that Person was not liable by reason of that Person's Disqualifying"
"2795","Conduct."
"2796","(c)	Required Approval.  Any indemnification under this Article"
"2797","shall be made by the Trust if authorized in the specific case on a"
"2798","determination that indemnification of the Agent is proper in the"
"2799","circumstances by (i) a final decision on the merits by a court or"
"2800","other body before whom the proceeding was brought that the Agent"
"2801","was not liable by reason of Disqualifying Conduct (including, but"
"2802","not limited to, dismissal of either a court action or an"
"2803","administrative proceeding against the Agent for insufficiency of"
"2804","evidence of any Disqualifying Conduct) or, (ii) in the absence"
"2805","of such a decision, a reasonable determination, based upon a"
"2806","review of the facts, that the Agent was not liable by reason of"
"2807","Disqualifying Conduct, by (1) the vote of a majority of a quorum"
"2808","of the Trustees who are not (x) interested persons of the Trust"
"2809","as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, (y) parties to the"
"2810","proceeding, or (z) parties who have any economic or other interest"
"2811","in connection with such specific case (the disinterested, non-party
Trustees); or (2) by independent legal counsel in a written opinion."
"2812","(d)	Advancement of Expenses.  Expenses incurred by an Agent in"
"2813","defending any Proceeding may be advanced by the Trust before the final"
"2814","disposition of the Proceeding on receipt of an undertaking by or on"
"2815","behalf of the Agent to repay the amount of the advance if it shall be"
"2816","determined ultimately that the Agent is not entitled to be"

"2818","one of the following conditions for the advancement of expenses is met:"
"2819","(i) the Agent shall provide a security for his undertaking,"
"2820","(ii) the Trust shall be insured against losses arising by reason of"
"2821","any lawful advances, or"
"2822","(iii) a majority of a quorum of the disinterested, non-party Trustees"
"2823","of the Trust, or an independent legal counsel in a written opinion,"
"2824","shall determine, based on a review of readily available facts"
"2825","(as opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), that there is reason to"
"2826","believe that the Agent ultimately will be found entitled to"
"2827","indemnification."
"2828","(e)	Other Contractual Rights.  Nothing contained in this Article"
"2829","shall affect any right to indemnification to which Persons other than"
"2830","Trustees and officers of the Trust or any subsidiary thereof may be"
"2831","entitled by contract or otherwise."
"2832","(f)	Fiduciaries of Employee Benefit Plan.  This Article does not"
"2833","apply to any Proceeding against any trustee, investment manager or"
"2834","other fiduciary of an employee benefit plan in that Person's capacity"
"2835","as such, even though that Person may also be an Agent of the Trust as"
"2836","defined in Section 1 of this Article.  Nothing contained in this"
"2837","Article shall limit any right to indemnification to which such a"
"2838","trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary may be entitled by"
"2839","contract or otherwise which shall be enforceable to the extent"
"2840","permitted by applicable law other than this Article."
"2841","(g)	Joint and Several Obligations.  Notwithstanding any other"
"2842","provision in this Declaration of Trust to the contrary, any amount of"
"2843","indemnification and any advancement of expenses that any Agent is"
"2844","entitled to be paid under Section 2 shall be deemed to be joint and"
"2845","several obligations of the Trust and each Series, and the assets of"
"2846","the Trust and each Series shall be subject to the claims of any Agent"
"2847","therefor under this Article VII; provided that any such liability,"
"2848","expense or obligation may be allocated and charged by the Board of"
"2849","Trustees between or among the Trust and/or any one or more Series"
"2850","(and Classes) in such manner as the Board of Trustees in its sole"
"2851","discretion deem fair and equitable."

"2853","applicable law, the Board of Trustees shall have the authority to"
"2854","purchase with Trust Property, insurance for liability and for all"
"2855","Expenses reasonably incurred or paid or expected to be paid by an"
"2856","Agent in connection with any Proceeding in which such Agent becomes"
"2857","involved by virtue of such Agent's actions, or omissions to act,"
"2858","in its capacity or former capacity with the Trust, whether or not"
"2859","the Trust would have the power to indemnify such Agent against such"
"2860","liability."

"2862","set forth in Section 3816 of the DSTA, a Shareholder or Shareholders"
"2863","may bring a derivative action on behalf of the Trust only if the"
"2864","following conditions are met:"
"2865","(a)	The Shareholder or Shareholders must make a pre-suit demand upon"
"2866","the Board of Trustees to bring the subject action unless an effort"
"2867","to cause the Board of Trustees to bring such an action is not likely"
"2868","to succeed.  For purposes of this Section 4, a demand on the Board"
"2869","of Trustees shall only be deemed not likely to succeed and therefore"
"2870","excused if a majority of the Board of Trustees, or a majority of any"
"2871","committee established to consider the merits of such action, is"
"2872","composed of Trustees who are not independent trustees"
"2873","(as such term is defined in the DSTA)."
"2874","(b)	Unless a demand is not required under paragraph"
"2875","(a) of this Section 4, Shareholders eligible to bring such"

"2877","outstanding Shares of the Trust, or 10% of the outstanding"
"2878","Shares of the Series or Class to which such action relates, shall"
"2879","join in the request for the Board of Trustees to commence such action; and"
"2880","(c)	Unless a demand is not required under paragraph"
"2881","(a) of this Section 4, the Board of Trustees must be afforded a"
"2882","reasonable amount of time to consider such Shareholder request and"
"2883","to investigate the basis of such claim.  The Board of Trustees shall"
"2884","be entitled to retain counsel or other advisors in considering the"
"2885","merits of the request and shall require an undertaking by the"
"2886","Shareholders making such request to reimburse the Trust for the"
"2887","expense of any such advisors in the event that the Board of Trustees"
"2888","determine not to bring such action."
"2889","For purposes of this Section 4, the Board of Trustees may designate a"
"2890","committee of one Trustee to consider a Shareholder demand if necessary"
"2891","to create a committee with a majority of Trustees who are independent
trustees (as such term is defined in the DSTA)."
"2892","In addition to all suits, claims or other actions"
"2893","(collectively, claims) that under applicable law must be brought"
"2894","as derivative claims, each Shareholder of the Trust or any Series or"
"2895","Class thereof agrees that any claim that affects all Shareholders of a"
"2896","Series or Class equally, that is, proportionately based on their"
"2897","number of Shares in such Series or Class, must be brought as a"
"2898","derivative claim subject to this Section 4 irrespective of whether"
"2899","such claim involves a violation of the Shareholders' rights"
"2900","under this Declaration of Trust or any other alleged violation"
"2901","of contractual or individual rights that might otherwise give"
"2902","rise to a direct claim."
"2903","Section 5.	Jurisdiction and Waiver of Jury Trial."
"2904","In accordance with Section 3804(e) of the DSTA any suit,"

"2909","Declaration of Trust or the Trust, any Series or Class or"
"2910","any Shares, including any claim of any nature against the Trust,"
"2911","any Series or Class, the Trustees or officers of the Trust, shall"
"2912","be brought exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of"
"2913","Delaware to the extent there is subject matter jurisdiction in"
"2914","such court for the claims asserted or, if not, then in the Superior"
"2915","Court of the State of Delaware, and all Shareholders and other such"
"2916","Persons hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of such courts"

"3301","EXHIBIT ITEM: Terms of new or amended securities"
"3302","GOF P10 06/18"
"3303","SUPPLEMENT DATED JUNE 8, 2018"
"3304","TO THE CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE PROSPECTUS"
"3305","OF EACH OF THE FUNDS LISTED BELOW"
"3306","Templeton China World Fund"
"3307","Notice of Automatic Conversion of Class C Shares to Class A Shares"
"3308","after 10-Year Holding Period"
"3309","At Board meetings held on February 26 and 27, 2018, the Board of"
"3310","Trustees approved an automatic conversion feature for the Fund's"
"3311","Class C shares (which includes Class C1 shares as applicable) that"
"3312","will automatically convert shareholders' Class C shares into Class"
"3313","A shares of the same Fund after they have been held for 10 years."
"3314","After conversion, your new shares will be subject to Class A"
"3315","shares' lower Rule 12b-1 fees. The conversion feature will become"
"3316","effective on or about October 5, 2018.  Later that month Class C"
"3317","shares of the Fund that have been outstanding for 10 years or more"
"3318","will automatically convert to Class A shares of such Fund on the"
"3319","basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes."
"3320","Thereafter, Class C shares of the Fund will convert automatically"
"3321","to Class A shares of such Fund on a monthly basis in the month of,"
"3322","or the month following, the 10-year anniversary of the Class C"
"3323","shares' purchase date. Class C shares of the Fund acquired through"
"3324","automatic reinvestment of dividends or distributions will convert"
"3325","to Class A shares of the Fund on the conversion date pro rata with"
"3326","the converting Class C shares of the Fund that were not acquired"
"3327","through reinvestment of dividends or distributions."
"3328","Shareholders will not pay a sales charge, including a contingent"
"3329","deferred sales charge, upon the conversion of their Class C shares"
"3330","to Class A shares pursuant to this conversion feature. The"
"3331","automatic conversion of the Fund's Class C shares into Class A"
"3332","shares after the 10-year holding period is not expected to be a"
"3333","taxable event for federal income tax purposes. Shareholders should"
"3334","consult with their tax advisor regarding the state and local tax"
"3335","consequences of such conversions."
"3336","Class C shares held through a financial intermediary in an omnibus"
"3337","account will be converted into Class A shares only if the"
"3338","intermediary can document that the shareholder has met the required"
"3339","holding period. In certain circumstances, when shares are invested"
"3340","through retirement plans, omnibus accounts, and in certain other"
"3341","instances, the Fund and its agents may not have transparency into"
"3342","how long a shareholder has held Class C shares for purposes of"
"3343","determining whether such Class C shares are eligible for automatic"
"3344","conversion into Class A shares and the financial intermediary may"
"3345","not have the ability to track purchases to credit individual"
"3346","shareholders' holding periods. This primarily occurs when shares"
"3347","are invested through certain record keepers for group retirement"
"3348","plans, where the intermediary cannot track share aging at the"
"3349","participant level.  In these circumstances, the Fund will not be"
"3350","able to automatically convert Class C shares into Class A shares as"
"3351","described above. In order to determine eligibility for conversion"
"3352","in these circumstances, it is the responsibility of the shareholder"
"3353","or their financial intermediary to notify the Fund that the"
"3354","shareholder is eligible for the conversion of Class C shares to"
"3355","Class A shares, and the shareholder or their financial intermediary"
"3356","may be required to maintain and provide the Fund with records that"
"3357","substantiate the holding period of Class C shares. It is the"
"3358","financial intermediary's (and not the Fund's) responsibility to"
"3359","keep records and to ensure that the shareholder is credited with"
"3360","the proper holding period. Please consult with your financial"
"3361","intermediary about your shares' eligibility for this conversion"
"3362","feature."
"3363","Also effective October 5, 2018, new accounts or plans may not be"
"3364","eligible to purchase Class C shares of the Fund if it is determined"
"3365","that the intermediary cannot track shareholder holding periods to"
"3366","determine whether a shareholder's Class C shares are eligible for"
"3367","conversion to Class A shares.  Accounts or plans (and their"
"3368","successor, related and affiliated plans) that have Class C"
"3369","shares of the Fund available to participants on or before October"
"3370","5, 2018, may continue to open accounts for new participants in such"
"3371","share class and purchase additional shares in existing participant"
"3372","accounts. The Fund has no responsibility for overseeing, monitoring"
"3373","or implementing a financial intermediary's process for determining"
"3374","whether a shareholder meets the required holding period for"
"3375","conversion."
"3376","A financial intermediary may sponsor and/or control accounts,"
"3377","programs or platforms that impose a different conversion schedule"
"3378","or different eligibility requirements for the conversion of Class"
"3379","C shares into Class A shares. In these cases, Class C shareholders"
"3380","may convert to Class A shares under the policies of the financial"
"3381","intermediary and the conversion may be structured as an exchange"
"3382","of Class C shares for Class A shares of the same Fund. Financial"
"3383","intermediaries will be responsible for making such exchanges in"
"3384","those circumstances. Please consult with your financial"
"3385","intermediary if you have any questions regarding your shares'"
"3386","conversion from Class C shares to Class A shares."

"3629","on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic"
"3630","or electronic transmission (as defined in Section 3806 of the DSTA)"
"3631","or otherwise) by the Shareholder or the Shareholder's"
"3632","attorney-in-fact.  A valid proxy that does not state that it is"

"3646","proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be"
"3647","governed by the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the"
"3648","State of Delaware. Unless revoked, any proxy given in connection with"
"3649","a postponed or adjourned meeting for which a new record date is fixed"
"3650","shall continue to be valid so long as the Shareholder giving such"
"3651","proxy is a Shareholder of record on such new such record date."
"3652","With respect to any Shareholders' meeting, the Board, or, in case the"
"3653","Board does not act, the president, any vice president or the"
"3654","secretary, may permit proxies by electronic transmission"
"3655","(as defined in Section 3806 of the DSTA), telephonic, computerized,"
"3656","telecommunications or other reasonable alternative to the execution"
"3657","of a written instrument authorizing the holder of the proxy to act."
"3658","A proxy with respect to Shares held in the name of two or more"

"3660","execution is used, by any one of them unless, at or prior to the"
"3661","exercise of the proxy, the secretary of the Trust receives a specific"
"3662","written notice to the contrary from any one of them.  A proxy"
"3663","purporting to be by or on behalf of a Shareholder shall be deemed"
"3664","valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise and the burden of"
"3665","proving invalidity shall rest with the challenger.  Unless otherwise"
"3666","specifically limited by their terms, proxies shall entitle the"
"3667","Shareholder to vote at any adjournment or postponement of a"
"3668","Shareholder meeting."
"3669","Subject to the provisions of the DSTA, the Declaration of Trust or"
"3670","these By-Laws, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware"
"3671","relating to proxies, and judicial interpretations thereunder, shall"
"3672","govern all matters concerning the giving, voting or validity of"
"3673","proxies, as if the Trust were a Delaware corporation and the"
"3674","Shareholders were stockholders of a Delaware corporation."
"3675","Section 9.	INSPECTORS.  Before any meeting of Shareholders, the"
