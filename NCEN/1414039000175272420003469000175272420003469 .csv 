"818","<TEXT>"
"819","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"820","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"821","To the shareholders and Board of Trustees of Miller"
"822","Convertible Bond Fund, Miller Convertible Plus Bond"
"823","Fund, and Miller Intermediate Bond Fund"
"824","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"825","statements of the Miller Convertible Bond Fund, Miller"
"826","Convertible Plus Bond Fund, and the Miller Intermediate"
"827","Bond Fund (collectively, the Funds) as of and for the"
"828","year ended October 31, 2019, in accordance with the"
"829","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"830","Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the"
"831","Funds internal control over financial reporting, including"
"832","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"833","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"834","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"835","to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not"
"836","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"837","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"838","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"839","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"840","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"841","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"842","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"843","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"844","controls. A funds internal control over financial reporting"
"845","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"846","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"847","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"848","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"849","principles. A funds internal control over financial"
"850","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"851","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"852","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"853","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"854","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"855","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"856","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"857","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"858","are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"859","of management and trustee  of the funds; and (3)"
"860","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"861","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"862","disposition of a funds assets that could have a material"
"863","effect on the financial statements."
"864","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"865","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"866","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"867","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"868","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"869","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"870","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"871","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"872","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"873","allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"874","of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"875","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"876","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"877","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"878","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"879","misstatement of the funds annual or interim financial"
"880","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"881","basis."
"882","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"883","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"884","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"885","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"886","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"887","PCAOB. However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"888","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"889","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities,"
"890","that we consider to be a material weakness, as defined"
"891","above, as of October 31, 2019."
"892","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"893","of management and the Board of Trustees of the Funds"
"894","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"895","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"896","than these specified parties."
