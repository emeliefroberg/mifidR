"1102","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1103","control over financial reporting may not prevent"

"1110","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1111","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"1112","a control does not allow management or"
"1113","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1114","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1115","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"1116","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1117","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1118","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1119","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1120","company's annual or interim financial"
