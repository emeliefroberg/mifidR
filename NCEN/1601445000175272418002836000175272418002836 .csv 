"1552","of Guggenheim Strategy Funds Trust (the &ldquo;Trust&rdquo;) as of and for the year ended September 30, 2018, in accordance with"
"1553","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust&rsquo;s internal control"

"1555","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for"

"1562","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1563","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles."
"1564","A company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1565","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"1566","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"1567","with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"1568","with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"

"1580","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company&rsquo;s"
"1581","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</P>"
