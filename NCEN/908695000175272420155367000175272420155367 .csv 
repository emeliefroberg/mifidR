"6609","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"6610","To the Shareholders and"
"6611","Board of Trustees of USAA Mutual Funds Trust"
"6612","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"6613"," of USAA Mutual Funds Trust (comprising USAA Cornerstone Aggressive"
"6614","Fund, USAA Cornerstone Conservative Fund, USAA Cornerstone Equity"

"6620","Treasury Money Market Trust, and USAA World Growth Fund) (the Trust)"
"6621","as of and for the year ended May 31, 2020, in accordance with the"
"6622","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"6623","States), we considered the Trust's internal control over financial"
"6624","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"6625","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"6626","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"6627","with the requirements of Form NCEN, but not for the purpose"
"6628","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's"
"6629","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express"
"6630","no such opinion."
"6631","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"6632","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"6633","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"6634","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"6635","costs of controls. A trust's internal control over financial"
"6636","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"6637","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"6638","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"6639","accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles."
"6640","A trust's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"6641","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"6642","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"6643","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the trust; (2)"
"6644","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"6645","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"6646","with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"6647","and expenditures of the trust are being made only in accordance with"
"6648","authorizations of management and trustees of the trust; and (3)"
"6649","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"6650"," of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a trust's assets that"
"6651","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"6652","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"6653","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"6654","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"6655","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
