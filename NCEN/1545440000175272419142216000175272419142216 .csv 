"567","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"568","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures"

"640","<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>The management of the Fund is responsible for"

"647","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"648","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures"
"649","of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide"
