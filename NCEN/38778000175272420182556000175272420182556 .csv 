"853"," Templeton Global Advisors"
"854","Limited filed an application on September 14, 2017, and an"
"855","amendment on March 9, 2018."
"856","Applicants requested an order under section 6(c) of the Investment"
"857"," Company Act of 1940 (the"
"858","Act) for an exemption from sections 18(f) and 21(b) of the Act,"
"859"," under section 12(d)(1)(J) of"
"860","the Act for an exemption from section 12(d)(1) of the Act, under"
"861"," sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the"
"862","Act for an exemption from sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2), and 17(a)(3)"
"863"," of the Act, and under section"
"864","17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit certain"
"865","joint arrangements and"
"866","transactions. The order supersedes a prior order1 and permits"
"867","certain registered management"
"868","investment companies to participate in a joint lending and"
"869","borrowing facility."
"870","On May 10, 2018, a notice of the filing of the application was"
"871"," issued (Investment Company Act"
"872","Release No. 33095). The notice gave interested persons an"
"873"," opportunity to request a hearing and"
"874","stated that an order disposing of the application would be issued"
"875","unless a hearing was ordered."
"876","No request for a hearing has been filed, and the Commission has"
"877","not ordered a hearing."
"878","The matter has been considered and it is found, on the basis of"
"879","the information set forth in the"
"880","application, as amended, that granting the requested exemption"
"881"," is consistent with and appropriate"
"882","in the public interest, and consistent with the protection of"
"883","investors and the purposes fairly"
"884","intended by the policy and provisions of the Act."
"885","It is also found that the terms of the proposed transactions,"
"886","including the consideration to be paid"
"887","or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve"
"888","overreaching on the part of any person"
"889","concerned, and that the proposed transactions are consistent"
"890","with the policy of each registered"
"891","investment company concerned and the general purposes of the"
"892"," Act."
"893","It is further found that the participation of each registered"
"894"," investment company in the proposed"
"895","credit facility is consistent with the provisions, policies,"
"896","and purposes of the Act, and not on a"
"897","basis different from or less advantageous than that of other"
"898","participants."
"899","Accordingly, in the matter of Franklin Alternative Strategies"
"900","Funds, et al., (File No. 812-14819),"
"901","IT IS ORDERED, under section 6(c) of the Act, that the requested"
"902"," exemptions from sections"
"903","18(f) and 21(b) of the Act are granted, effective immediately,"
"904"," subject to the conditions in the"

"1148","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"1149","Firm"
"1150","To the Board of Trustees of and Shareholders of Franklin U.S."
"1151","Government Money Fund"
"1152","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"1153","of Franklin U.S. Government Money Fund (the Fund) as of and"
"1154","for the year ended June 30, 2020, in accordance with the"
"1155","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1156","(United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Fund's internal"
"1157","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1158","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1159","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1160","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"1161","N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1162","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1163","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"1164","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1165","reporting."
"1166","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1167","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1168","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1169","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1170","related costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"1171","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1172","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1173","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1174","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"1175","company's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1176","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1177","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1178","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"1179","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1180","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1181","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1182","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"1183","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1184","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1185","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1186","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could"
"1187","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1188","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1189","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"1190","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1191","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"1192","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1193","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1194","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1195","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1196","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1197","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1198","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"1199","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1200","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"1201","of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1202","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1203","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1204","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1205","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1206","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"1207","weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB. However,"
"1208","we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over"
"1209","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"1210","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness"
"1211","as defined above as of June 30, 2020."
