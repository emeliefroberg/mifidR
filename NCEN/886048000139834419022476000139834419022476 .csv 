"4089","<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0><B>Litigation &ndash;</B> The Blue Chip and Equity Income Funds"
"4090","have been named, and have received notice that they may be putative members of the proposed defendant class of shareholders, in"
"4091","a lawsuit filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on November 1, 2010, by the Official Committee"
"4092","of Unsecured Creditors of Tribune Company (the &quot;Committee&quot;). The Committee is seeking to recover all payments made to"
"4093","beneficial owners of common stock in connection with a leveraged buyout of the Tribune Company (&ldquo;LBO&rdquo;), including payments"
"4094","made in connection with a 2007 tender offer into which the Blue Chip and Equity Income Funds tendered their shares of common stock"
"4095","of the Tribune Company. On December 9, 2011, the Blue Chip Fund was reorganized into the Growth &amp; Income Fund pursuant to a"
"4096","Plan of Reorganization and Termination, whereby all of the assets of the Blue Chip Fund were transferred to the Growth &amp; Income"
"4097","Fund, the Growth &amp; Income Fund assumed all of the liabilities of the Blue Chip Fund, including any contingent liabilities with"
"4098","respect to pending or threatened litigation or actions, and shareholders of Blue Chip Fund became shareholders of Growth &amp;"
"4099","Income Fund. The adversary proceeding brought by the Committee has been transferred to the Southern District of New York and administratively"
"4100","consolidated with other similar suits as discussed below. In addition, on June 2, 2011, the Blue Chip and Equity Income Funds were"
"4101","named as defendants in a lawsuit brought in connection with the Tribune Company's LBO by Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas,"
"4102","in its capacity as successor indenture trustee for a certain series of Senior Notes, Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, in"
"4103","its capacity as successor indenture trustee for a certain series of Senior Notes, and Wilmington Trust Company, in its capacity"
"4104","as successor indenture trustee for the PHONES Notes (together, the &quot;Bondholder Plaintiffs&quot;) in the Supreme Court of the"
"4105","State of New York. The Blue Chip and Equity Income Funds have also been named in a similar suit filed on behalf of participants"
"4106","in Tribune defined-compensation plans (the &ldquo;Retiree Plaintiffs&rdquo;). As with the Bondholder Plaintiffs and the Committee,"
"4107","the Retiree Plaintiffs seek to recover payments of the proceeds of the LBO. (All of these suits have been removed to the United"
"4108","States District Court for the Southern District of New York and administratively consolidated with other substantially similar"
"4109","suits against other former Tribune shareholders (the &ldquo;MDL Proceeding&rdquo;)). On September 23, 2013, the Judge in the MDL"
"4110","Proceeding dismissed various state law constructive fraudulent transfer suits, resulting in the Funds being dismissed from the"
"4111","Bondholder and Retiree Plaintiffs&rsquo; actions. On September 30, 2013, counsel for the plaintiffs in those suits appealed the"
"4112","MDL Judge&rsquo;s dismissal ruling to the Second Circuit. On March 24, 2016, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the MDL"
"4113","Judge&rsquo;s dismissal of the various state law constructive fraudulent transfer suits. In September 2016, the Bondholder and"
"4114","Retiree Plaintiffs petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Second Circuit&rsquo;s decision. The Supreme Court has not yet"
"4115","ruled on that request. On January 9, 2017, the Tribune MDL judge granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the Committee lawsuit"
"4116","alleging a single claim for intentional fraudulent transfer. An appeal of that decision to the Second Circuit is expected, but"
"4117","has not yet been made. The extent of the Funds' potential liability in any such actions has not been determined. The Funds have"
"4118","been advised by counsel that the Funds could be held liable to return all or part of the proceeds received in any of these actions,"
"4119","as well as interest and court costs, even though the Funds had no knowledge of, or participation in, any misconduct. The Equity"
"4120","Income Fund received proceeds of $1,526,566 in connection with the LBO, representing 0.32% of its net assets as of September 30,"
"4121","2019. The Blue Chip Fund received proceeds of $790,772 in connection with the LBO, representing 0.05% of the net assets of Growth"
"4122","&amp; Income Fund as of September 30, 2019. The Equity Income and Growth &amp; Income Funds cannot predict the outcomes of these"
"4123","proceedings, and thus have not accrued any of the amounts sought in the various actions in the accompanying financial statements.</P>"

"4143","Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"4144","First Investors Equity Funds"
"4145","40 Wall Street"
"4146","New York, New York 10005"
"4147","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of First"
"4148","Investors Equity Funds (comprising, respectively, the Covered Call"
"4149","Strategy Fund, Equity Income Fund, Global Fund, Growth &amp; Income Fund,"
"4150","Hedged U.S. Equity Opportunities Fund, International Fund, Opportunity Fund,"
"4151","Premium Income Fund, Select Growth Fund, Special Situations Fund and"
"4152","Total Return Fund Fund) (the Funds), as of and for the year ended"
"4153","September 30, 2019, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"4154","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered its internal"
"4155","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"4156","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"4157","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"4158","comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for"
"4159","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"4160","internal control over financialreporting.   Accordingly, we express no"
"4161","such opinion."
"4162","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"4163","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.   In"
"4164","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"4165","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"4166","A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"4167","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"4168","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"4169","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"4170","principles.   A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"4171","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"4172","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"4173","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"4174","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"4175","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"4176","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"4177","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"4178","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"4179","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"4180","disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on"
"4181","the financial statements."
"4182","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"4183","may not prevent or detect misstatements.   Also, projections of any"
"4184","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"4185","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"4186","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"4187","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"4188","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"4189","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"4190","detect misstatements on a timely basis.   A material weakness is a"
"4191","deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"4192","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"4193","material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial"
"4194","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
