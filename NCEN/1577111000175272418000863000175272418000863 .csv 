In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>statements.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>material misstatement of the Fund&#8217;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>detected on a timely basis.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>Our consideration of the Fund&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose</FONT><BR><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that</FONT></P></DIV>"
