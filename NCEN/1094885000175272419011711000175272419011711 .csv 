"2227","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2228","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of State Street Master Funds"
"2229","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"2230","State Street Master Funds (the Trust), comprising State Street Equity"
"2231","500 Index Portfolio, State Street International Developed Equity Index"
"2232","Portfolio, State Street Money Market Portfolio, State Street U.S."
"2233","Government Money Market Portfolio, State Street Treasury Money"
"2234","Market Portfolio and State Street Treasury Plus Money Market"
"2235","Portfolio, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, in"
"2236","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"2237","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust's internal"
"2238","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"2239","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"2240","purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements and to"
"2241","comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose"
"2242","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal"
"2243","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such"
"2244","opinion."
"2245","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"2246","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"2247","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"2248","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"2249","controls.  A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"2250","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"2251","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"2252","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2253","accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial"
"2254","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2255","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2256","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"2257","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2258","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"2259","with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"2260","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"2261","authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)"
"2262","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"2263","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"2264","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2265","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2266","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"2267","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
