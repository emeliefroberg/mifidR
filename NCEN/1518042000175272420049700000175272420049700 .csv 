"1309","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1310","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"1311","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1312","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"1313","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1314","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1315","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1316","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1317","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1318","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A"
"1319","material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in"
"1320","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1321","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1322","Portfolio's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1323","prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Our consideration of the"
"1324","Portfolio's internal control over financial reporting was for the"
"1325","limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1326","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might"
"1327","be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"1328","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we"
"1329","noted no deficiencies in the Portfolio's internal control over"
"1330","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"1331","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness"
"1332","as defined above as of December 31, 2019."
