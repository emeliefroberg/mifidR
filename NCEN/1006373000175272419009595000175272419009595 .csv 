"1984","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"1985","Accounting Firm"
"1986","To the Board of Trustees of Deutsche DWS Investments VIT"
"1987","Funds and Shareholders of DWS Small Cap Index VIP"
"1988","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1989","statements of DWS Small Cap Index VIP (the Fund) as of"
"1990","and for the year ended December 31, 2018, in accordance"
"1991","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1992","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered"
"1993","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"1994","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"1995","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1996","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"1997","comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for"
"1998","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"1999","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"2000","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"2001","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"2002","reporting."
"2003","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"2004","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"2005","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"2006","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"2007","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's"
"2008","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"2009","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"2010","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"2011","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"2012","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"2013","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"2014","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"2015","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2016","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"2017","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"2018","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2019","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"2020","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"2021","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"2022","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"2023","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"2024","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"2025","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"2026","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2027","statements."
"2028","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2029","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2030","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2031","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"2032","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2033","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"2034","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2035","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"2036","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"2037","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"2038","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2039","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"2040","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2041","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"2042","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2043","company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"2044","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2045","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"2046","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"2047","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"2048","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that"
"2049","might be material weaknesses under standards established"
"2050","by the PCAOB.  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"2051","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"2052","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"2053","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above"
"2054","as of December 31, 2018."

"2077","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"2078","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered"
"2079","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"2080","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"2081","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2082","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"2083","comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for"
"2084","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"2085","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"2086","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"2087","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"2088","reporting."
"2089","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"2090","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"2091","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"2092","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"2093","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's"
"2094","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"2095","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"2096","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"2097","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"2098","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"2099","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"2100","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"2101","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2102","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"2103","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"2104","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2105","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"2106","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"2107","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"2108","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"2109","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"2110","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"2111","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"2112","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2113","statements."
"2114","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2115","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2116","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2117","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"2118","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2119","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"2120","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2121","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"2122","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"2123","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"2124","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2125","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"2126","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2127","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"2128","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2129","company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"2130","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2131","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"2132","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"2133","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"2134","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that"
"2135","might be material weaknesses under standards established"
"2136","by the PCAOB.  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"2137","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"2138","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"2139","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above"
"2140","as of December 31, 2018."

"2156","Item G.1.a.i - Deutsche DWS Investments VIT"
"2157","Funds (formerly DWS Investments VIT Funds)"
"2158","On December 7, 2010, Deutsche DWS Investments"
"2159","VIT Funds (formerly DWS Investments VIT Funds)"
"2160","(the Trust) was named as a defendant in the First"
"2161","Amended Complaint filed by the Official Committee"
"2162","of Unsecured Creditors in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court"
"2163","for the District of Delaware in the lawsuit styled"
"2164","Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Tribune"
"2165","Company, et al., v. Fitzsimons et al. (the Lawsuit)."
"2166","The Lawsuit arises out of a leveraged buyout"
"2167","transaction (LBO) in 2007 by which loans were"
"2168","made to the Tribune Company to fund the LBO and"
"2169","shares of the Tribune Company held by shareholders"
"2170","were tendered for or were converted to a right to"
"2171","receive cash. Following the completion of the LBO in"
"2172","2007, the Tribune Company filed for bankruptcy. The"
"2173","Lawsuit seeks to recover all payments made to the"
"2174","shareholders in the LBO. The Lawsuit has been"
"2175","consolidated in a multi-district litigation (the Tribune
MDL) in the United States District Court for the"
"2176","Southern District of New York, case no. 12-MC-2296"
"2177","(the District Court). At the outset of the Lawsuit, the"
"2178","Court issued a scheduling order which stayed all"
"2179","substantive proceedings in the Lawsuit until after the"
"2180","decision on motions to dismiss based on certain"
"2181","defenses common to the defendants filed in related"
"2182","cases. On September 23, 2013, the District Court"
"2183","entered an order granting the defendants' motion to"
"2184","dismiss in certain of those related cases (the"
"2185","Bondholder Actions) due to the pendency of the"
"2186","Lawsuit seeking recoveries on similar grounds, and"
"2187","the plaintiffs in Bondholder Actions appealed that"
"2188","order to the United States Court of Appeals for the"
"2189","Second Circuit."
"2190","On April 25, 2014, the District Court entered an order"
"2191","governing the upcoming stage of the Lawsuit, which"
"2192","directed Ropes & Gray, as Liaison Counsel to the"
"2193","Shareholder Defendants, to file a global motion to"
"2194","dismiss (the Global Motion to Dismiss) the Lawsuit"
"2195","on behalf of all shareholder defendants named in"
"2196","Exhibit A to the current Fifth Amended Complaint"
"2197","(including the Trust). The Global Motion to Dismiss"
"2198","was filed on May 23, 2014. On March 29, 2015, the"
"2199","Second Circuit, in a unanimous opinion, affirmed the"
"2200","District Court's dismissal of the Bondholder Actions."
"2201","The Bondholder Action plaintiffs subsequently filed a"
"2202","petition for rehearing, which the Second Circuit"
"2203","denied on July 22, 2016. On September 9, 2016, the"
"2204","Bondholder Action plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ"
"2205","of certiorari of the Second Circuit's decision in the"
"2206","U.S. Supreme Court."
"2207","On January 9, 2017, the District Court granted the"
"2208","Global Motion to Dismiss, dismissing the only claim"
"2209","asserted against the shareholder defendants named in"
"2210","the Lawsuit, and denied the plaintiff's request for"
"2211","leave to amend the Complaint. On February 1, 2017,"
"2212","the plaintiff in the Lawsuit filed a letter addressed to"
"2213","the District Court requesting certification for appeal,"
"2214","pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), of"
"2215","the court's decision granting the shareholder"
"2216","defendants' Global Motion to Dismiss. On February"
"2217","23, 2017, the District Court issued an order indicating"
"2218","that the District Court intended to grant that request"
"2219","only after ruling on other pending motions to dismiss"
"2220","addressing separate claims in the same complaint,"
"2221","which currently remain unresolved."
"2222","On July 18, 2017, the plaintiff in the Lawsuit filed"
"2223","another letter addressed to the District Court"
"2224","requesting leave to file a motion requesting (i) to file a"
"2225","sixth amended complaint in the Lawsuit adding a"
"2226","constructive fraudulent conveyance claim based on a"
"2227","potential change in the governing legal standard, and"
"2228","(ii) to reverse the plaintiff's prior request for entry of"
"2229","judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure"
"2230","54(b). On July 28, 2017, Ropes & Gray, as Liaison"
"2231","Counsel for the Executive Committee of Exhibit A"
"2232","Shareholder Defendants in the Lawsuit, and several"
"2233","other"
"2234","defendants filed letters addressed to the District Court"
"2235","opposing the relief requested in the plaintiff's second"
"2236","letter. On August 14, 2017, the District Court issued"
"2237","an order denying the plaintiff's request to file a sixth"
"2238","amended complaint at that time, without prejudice to"
"2239","renewal in the event of a potential intervening change"
"2240","in the governing law of the Second Circuit as a result"
"2241","of any decision by the Supreme Court in the pending"
"2242","appeal of FTI Consulting, Inc. v. Merit Management"
"2243","Group (Merit Mgmt.), 830 F.3d 690 (7th Cir."
"2244","2016)."
"2245","On February 27, 2018, the Supreme Court issued a"
"2246","ruling in Merit Mgmt. On March 8, 2018, the plaintiff"
"2247","in the Lawsuit submitted a letter to the District Court,"
"2248","renewing his motion seeking authorization to file a"
"2249","sixth amended complaint adding a constructive"
"2250","fraudulent conveyance claim, which the plaintiff"
"2251","asserted is no longer foreclosed as a result of the Merit"
"2252","Mgmt. decision. On March 13, 2018, Liaison Counsel"
"2253","for the Executive Committee of Shareholder"
"2254","Defendants in the Lawsuit, and a number of individual"
"2255","defendants, made submissions to the District Court"
"2256","opposing the Lawsuit plaintiff's renewed request. On"
"2257","June 19, 2018, the District Court entered an order"
"2258","staying plaintiff's request to amend his complaint"
"2259","pending further action by the Second Circuit in the"
"2260","Bondholder Actions, and instructing the parties to"
"2261","consider and report to the District Court on potential"
"2262","means for a process to reach a global resolution of the"
"2263","Tribune MDL. On July 9, 2018, the parties submitted"
"2264","a joint letter in response to the District Court's"
"2265","instruction, which, among other things, set forth the"
"2266","parties' positions concerning a potential mediation"
"2267","process."
"2268","On April 3, 2018, Supreme Court Justices Kennedy"
"2269","and Thomas issued a Statement indicating that"
"2270","consideration of the petition for certiorari in the"
"2271","Bondholder Actions will be deferred for an
additional period of time because of the possibility"
"2272","that there might not be a quorum of Justices"
"2273","available to consider those cases. On April 10, 2018,"
"2274","the plaintiffs in the Bondholder Actions filed a motion"
"2275","in the Second Circuit requesting that the court recall"
"2276","its mandate, vacate its affirmation of the District"
"2277","Court's dismissal of their claims, and remand the"
"2278","Bondholder Actions to the District Court for further"
"2279","proceedings. On April 20, 2018, members of the"
"2280","Executive Committee of defendants in the Bondholder"
"2281","Actions filed an opposition to plaintiffs' motion. On"
"2282","May 15, 2018, the Second Circuit granted plaintiffs'"
"2283","motion to recall the court's mandate in anticipation
of further panel review."
"2284","On December 18, 2018, the plaintiff in the Lawsuit"
"2285","submitted a letter to the District Court, renewing his"
"2286","motion seeking authorization to file a sixth amended"
"2287","complaint adding a constructive fraudulent"
"2288","conveyance claim, and seeking to reinstate his"
"2289","intentional fraudulent conveyance claim. On"
"2290","December 19, 2018, Ropes & Gray, as Liaison"
"2291","Counsel for the Executive Committee of Shareholder"
"2292","Defendants in the Lawsuit, filed a letter opposing the"
"2293","plaintiff's requests. Also on December 19, 2018, the"
"2294","District Court issued an order scheduling a pretrial"
"2295","conference for January 14, 2019, and noting that any"
"2296","party could submit a letter to the court describing any
issues they would like the Court to address at the
conference. On January 7, 2019, the parties"
"2297","submitted letters reflecting their prior positions in"
"2298","response to the Court's order. On January 14, 2019,"
"2299","the District Court stated that it would leave stayed the"
"2300","plaintiff's request to file a sixth amended complaint"
"2301","adding a constructive fraudulent conveyance claim"
"2302","pending further action by the Second Circuit in the"
"2303","Bondholder Actions."
"2304","We express no opinion on the likely outcome of these"
"2305","matters. Management is currently assessing the"
"2306","Lawsuit and has not yet determined the effect, if any,"
"2307","on any series of the Trust."
