"1645","To the Board of Trustees of Northern Lights Fund"
"1646","Trust II"
"1647","and the Shareholders of Linde Hansen Contrarian"
"1648","Value Fund"
"1649","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1650","statements of Linde Hansen Contrarian Value Fund, a"
"1651","series of shares of beneficial interest in Northern Lights"
"1652","Fund Trust II (the Fund), as of November 30, 2018, and"
"1653","for the year then ended, in accordancef with the"
"1654","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1655","Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the"
"1656","Funds internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1657","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1658","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1659","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"1660","to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not"
"1661","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1662","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"1663","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1664","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"1665","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1666","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1667","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"1668","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1669","controls.  A companys internal control over financial"
"1670","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1671","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"1672","and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"1673","purposes in accordance with accounting principles"
"1674","generally accepted in the United States of America"
"1675","(GAAP).  A companys internal control over financial"
"1676","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1677","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1678","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1679","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"1680","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1681","necessary to permit preparation of the financial"
"1682","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"1683","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"1684","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1685","trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1686","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1687","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"1688","companys assets that could have a material effect on"
"1689","the financial statements."
"1690","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over"
