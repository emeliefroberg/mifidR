"1775","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"1776","for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1777","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"

"1781","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"1782","do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"1783","the Funds; internal control over financial"
"1784","reporting."
"1785","The management of the Funds are responsible for"
"1786","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1787","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"1788","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"

"1790","benefits and related costs of controls.  A funds"
"1791","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1792","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1793","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1794","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"1795","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1796","accounting principles.  A funds internal control"
"1797","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1798","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1799","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1800","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"1801","the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
