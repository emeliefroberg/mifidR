"1610","statements of HCM Tactical Growth Fund HCM Dividend"
"1611","Sector Fund and HCM Income Plus Fund (collectively"
"1612","the Funds) each a separate series of the Northern Lights"
"1613","Fund Trust III as of and for the year ended June 30 2018"
"1614","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1615","Accounting Oversight Board (United States) we"
"1616","considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1617","reporting including controls over safeguarding securities"
"1618","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1619","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1620","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"1621","N-CEN but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"1622","on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"1623","financial reporting. Accordingly we express no such"
"1624","opinion."
"1625","The management of the Funds are responsible for"
"1626","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1627","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility"
"1628","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"1629","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1630","controls. A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"1631","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1632","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1633","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1634","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1635","principles (GAAP). A fund's internal control over financial"
"1636","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (a)"
"1637","pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable"
"1638","detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1639","dispositions of the assets of the funds; (b) provide"
"1640","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1641","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"1642","in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and"
"1643","expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"1644","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1645","directors of the fund; and (c) provide reasonable"
"1646","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1647","unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of a fund's"
"1648","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1649","statements."
"1650","Because of inherent limitations internal control over"
"1651","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1652","misstatements. Also projections of any evaluation of"
"1653","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1654","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1655","conditions or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1656","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1657","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1658","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1659","allow management or employees in the normal course of"
"1660","performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect"
"1661","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is"
"1662","a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal"
"1663","control over financial reporting such that there is a"
"1664","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1665","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1666","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1667","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"1668","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"1669","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1670","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1671","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"1672","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1673","However we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal"
"1674","controls over financial reporting and their operation"
"1675","including controls over safeguarding of securities that we"
"1676","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as"
"1677","of June 30 2018."
"1678","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"1679","of management and the Board of Trustees of the Funds"
"1680","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"1681","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"1682","than these specified parties."
