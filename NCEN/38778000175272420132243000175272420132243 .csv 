"760"," thereunder to permit the Funds, as well as future investment"

"763","their cash balances remaining uninvested at the end of each"

"795","<TEXT>"
"796","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"797","To the Board of Trustees of and Shareholders of Franklin U.S. Government"
"798"," Money Fund"
"799","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"800","Franklin U.S. Government Money Fund the Fund as of and for the year"
"801"," ended June 30 2019 in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"802"," Company Accounting Oversight Board United States PCAOB we"
"803"," considered the Funds internal control over financial reporting"
"804"," including controls over safeguarding securities as a basis for"
"805"," designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"806"," our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"807"," requirements of Form NCEN but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"808"," opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"809"," financial reporting. Accordingly we do not express an opinion on the"
"810"," effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"811","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"812"," effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"813"," responsibility estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"814"," assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A companys"
"815"," internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"816"," provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"817"," reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"818"," purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"819"," A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"820"," policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records"
"821"," that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the"
"822"," transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide"
"823"," reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"824"," permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"825"," accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of"
"826"," the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"827"," management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable"
"828"," assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"829"," acquisition use or disposition of a companys assets that could have"
"830"," a material effect on the financial statements."
"831","Because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial"
"832","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also projections of"
"833","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"834"," that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or"
"835"," that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"836"," deteriorate."
"837","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"838"," the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"839"," employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions"
"840"," to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"841"," weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal"
"842"," control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable"
"843"," possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or"
"844"," interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on"
"845"," a timely basis."
"846","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"847","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"848"," and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"849"," over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"850"," standards established by the PCAOB. However we noted no deficiencies"
"851"," in the Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"852"," operation including controls over safeguarding securities that"
"853"," we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of June"
"854"," 30 2019."

"856"," Board of Trustees of Franklin U.S. Government Money Fund and the"
