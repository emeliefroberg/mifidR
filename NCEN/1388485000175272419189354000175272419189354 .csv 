"4383","During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Gotham Funds participated in a securities lending program offered by The Bank of New York Mellon (the Program), providing for the lending of securities to qualified brokers. Securities lending income includes earnings of such temporary cash investments, plus or minus any rebate to a borrower. These earnings (after any rebate) are then divided between the Bank of New York Mellon, as a fee for its services under the Program, and the Funds, according to agreed-upon rates. Collateral on all securities loaned is accepted in cash and is maintained at a minimum level of 102% (105% in the case of certain foreign securities) of the market value, plus interest, if applicable, of investments on loan. It is the Funds' policy to obtain additional collateral from or return excess collateral to the borrower by the end of the next business day, following the valuation date of the securities loaned. Therefore, the value of the collateral held may be temporarily less than the value of the securities on loan. Lending securities entails a risk of loss to the Funds if and to the extent that the market value of the securities loaned were to increase and the borrower did not increase the collateral accordingly, and the borrower fails to return the securities. Under the terms of the Program, the Funds are indemnified for such losses by The Bank of New York Mellon. Cash collateral may be held in a separate account managed by The Bank of New York Mellon, who is authorized to exclusively enter into overnight repurchase agreements, which are collateralized at 102% with securities issued or fully guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury; U.S. Government or any agency, instrumentality or authority of the U.S. government. Any securities purchased with cash collateral received are reflected in each Fund's Schedule of Investments. Additionally, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, certain Gotham Funds participated in a lender directed cash collateral release program (the Cash Release Program), through which a Fund may invest, consistent with its investment strategy, cash collateral received in connection with its securities lending activities and pay the securities lending agent a fee in connection with such program (the Cash Release Program Fees). The Cash Release Program Fees include rebates paid to borrowers (both directly by the Fund and indirectly by the securities lending agent) and additional financing fees paid to the securities lending agent. A Fund would typically use the Cash Release Program in lieu of reinvesting short sale proceeds because the cost of the Cash Release Program is expected to be less than the fees payable to a prime broker to release short sale proceeds for reinvestment. The dollar amounts of income and fees and compensation paid to all service providers related to those Funds that participated in securities lending activities including the Cash Release Program during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 are set forth in the table below.  The Cash Release Program was discontinued for the Funds below in August 2019.</P> <P STYLE=font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt>&nbsp;</P>"
