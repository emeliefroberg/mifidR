"3155","accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles,"
"3156","and that receipts and expenditures of the trust are being made"
"3157","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"3158","directors of the trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"3159","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"3160","acquisition, use or disposition of a Trusts assets that could"
"3161","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3162","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"3163","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"3164","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"3165","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3166","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"3167","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3168","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"3169","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"3170","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"3171","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
"3172","basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"3173","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"3174","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"3175","of the Trusts annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"3176","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3177","Our consideration of the Trusts internal control over financial"
"3178","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"3179","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"3180","that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"3181","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we"
"3182","noted no deficiencies in the Trusts internal control over financial"
"3183","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"3184","securities, which we consider to be a material weakness as defined"
