"816","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"817","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Franklin"
"818","New York Intermediate-Term Tax-Free Income Fund"
"819","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"820","statements of Franklin New York Intermediate-Term Tax-Free"
"821","Income Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year ended"
"822","September 30, 2018, in accordance with the standards"
"823","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"824","Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the"
"825","Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including"
"826","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"827","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"828","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"829","to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not"
"830","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"831","of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"832","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"833","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"834","reporting."
"835","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"836","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"837","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"838","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"839","benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"840","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"841","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"842","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"843","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"844","accounting principles.  A company's internal control over"
"845","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"846","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"847","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"848","and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"849","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"850","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"851","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"852","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"853","only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"854","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"855","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"856","or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material"
"857","effect on the financial statements."
"858","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"859","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"860"," Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"861"," periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"862","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"863","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"864","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"865","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"866","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"867","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"868","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"869","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"870","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's"
"871","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"872","detected on a timely basis."
"873","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"874","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"875","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"876"," over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"877"," standards established by the PCAOB.  However, we noted no deficiencies"
"878"," in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"879","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"880","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"881","September 30, 2018."
"882","This report is intended solely for the information and use of the"
"883","Board of Trustees of Franklin New York Intermediate-Term Tax-Free"

"1737","GOF P10 06/18"
"1738","SUPPLEMENT DATED JUNE 8, 2018"
"1739","TO THE CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE PROSPECTUS"
"1740","OF EACH OF THE FUNDS LISTED BELOW"
"1741","Franklin New York Tax-Free Trust"
"1742","Franklin New York Intermediate-Term Tax-Free Income Fund"
"1743","Notice of Automatic Conversion of Class C Shares to Class A Shares"
"1744","after 10-Year Holding Period"
"1745","At Board meetings held on February 26 and 27, 2018, the Board of"
"1746","Trustees approved an automatic conversion feature for the Fund's"
"1747"," Class C shares (which includes Class C1 shares as applicable) that"
"1748"," will automatically convert shareholders' Class C shares into Class"
"1749","A shares of the same Fund after they have been held for 10 years."
"1750","After conversion, your new shares will be subject to Class A"
"1751","shares' lower Rule 12b-1 fees.  The conversion feature will"
"1752","become effective on or about October 5, 2018.  Later that month"
"1753","Class C shares of the Fund that have been outstanding for 10 years"
"1754"," or more will automatically convert to Class A shares of such Fund"
"1755","on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes."
"1756","Thereafter, Class C shares of the Fund will convert automatically"
"1757","to Class A shares of such Fund on a monthly basis in the month of,"
"1758","or the month following, the 10-year anniversary of the Class C"
"1759","shares' purchase date. Class C shares of the Fund acquired"
"1760","through automatic reinvestment of dividends or distributions"
"1761","will convert to Class A shares of the Fund on the conversion"
"1762"," date pro rata with the converting Class C shares of the Fund"
"1763","that were not acquired through reinvestment of dividends or"
"1764","distributions."
"1765","Shareholders will not pay a sales charge, including a contingent"
"1766","deferred sales charge, upon the conversion of their Class C"
"1767","shares to Class A shares pursuant to this conversion feature. The"
"1768","automatic conversion of the Fund's Class C shares into Class A"
"1769","shares after the 10-year holding period is not expected to be a"
"1770","taxable event for federal income tax purposes. Shareholders should"
"1771"," consult with their tax advisor regarding the state and local tax"
"1772","consequences of such conversions."
"1773","Class C shares held through a financial intermediary in an omnibus"
"1774","account will be converted into Class A shares only if the"
"1775","intermediary can document that the shareholder has met the required"
"1776"," holding period. In certain circumstances, when shares are invested"
"1777","through retirement plans, omnibus accounts, and in certain other"
"1778"," instances, the Fund and its agents may not have transparency into"
"1779"," how long a shareholder has held Class C shares for purposes of"
"1780","determining whether such Class C shares are eligible for automatic"
"1781"," conversion into Class A shares and the financial intermediary may"
"1782"," not have the ability to track purchases to credit individual"
"1783","shareholders' holding periods.  This primarily occurs when shares"
"1784","are invested through certain record keepers for group retirement"
"1785","plans, where the intermediary cannot track share aging at the"
"1786","participant level.  In these circumstances, the Fund will not be able"
"1787"," to automatically convert Class C shares into Class A shares as"
"1788"," described above. In order to determine eligibility for conversion"
"1789","in these circumstances, it is the responsibility of the shareholder"
"1790"," or their financial intermediary to notify the Fund that the shareholder"
"1791"," is eligible for the conversion of Class C shares to Class A shares,"
"1792"," and the shareholder or their financial intermediary may be required"
"1793"," to maintain and provide the Fund with records that substantiate the"
"1794"," holding period of Class C shares. It is the financial intermediary's"
"1795"," (and not the Fund's) responsibility to keep records and to ensure"
"1796"," that the shareholder is credited with the proper holding period."
"1797","Please consult with your financial intermediary about your shares'"
"1798","eligibility for this conversion feature."
"1799","Also effective October 5, 2018, new accounts or plans may not be"
"1800","eligible to purchase Class C shares of the Fund if it is determined"
"1801","that the intermediary cannot track shareholder holding periods to"
"1802","determine whether a shareholder's Class C shares are eligible for"
"1803","conversion to Class A shares.  Accounts or plans (and their successor,"
"1804","related and affiliated plans) that have Class C shares of the Fund"
"1805","available to participants on or before October 5, 2018, may continue"
"1806","to open accounts for new participants in such share class and purchase"
"1807"," additional shares in existing participant accounts.  The Fund has no"
"1808","responsibility for overseeing, monitoring or implementing a financial"
"1809","intermediary's process for determining whether a shareholder meets"
"1810","the required holding period for conversion."
"1811","A financial intermediary may sponsor and/or control accounts,"
"1812","programs or platforms that impose a different conversion schedule"
"1813","or different eligibility requirements for the conversion of Class C"
"1814","shares into Class A shares. In these cases, Class C shareholders"
"1815","may convert to Class A shares under the policies of the financial"
"1816"," intermediary and the conversion may be structured as an exchange"
"1817"," of Class C shares for Class A shares of the same Fund. Financial"
"1818"," intermediaries will be responsible for making such exchanges in"
"1819","those circumstances. Please consult with your financial intermediary"
"1820","if you have any questions regarding your shares' conversion from"
"1821"," Class C shares to Class A shares."

"2242","ARTICLE III"
"2243","SHARES"
"2244","Section 1.	Division of Beneficial Interest."
"2245","(a)	The beneficial interest in the Trust shall be divided into"
"2246","Shares, each Share without a par value.  The number of Shares in the"
"2247","Trust authorized hereunder, and of each Series and Class as may be"
"2248","established from time to time, is unlimited.  The Board of Trustees"
"2249","may authorize the division of Shares into separate Classes of Shares"
"2250","and into separate and distinct Series of Shares and the division of"
"2251","any Series into separate Classes of Shares in accordance with the"
"2252","1940 Act.  The different Series and Classes shall be established and"
"2253","designated pursuant to Article III, Section 6 hereof.  If no separate"
"2254","Series or Classes of Series shall be established, the Shares shall have"
"2255"," the rights, powers and duties provided for herein and in Article III,"
"2256","Section 6 hereof to the extent relevant and not otherwise provided for"
"2257","herein, and all references to Series and Classes shall be construed"
"2258","(as the context may require) to refer to the Trust."
"2259","	The fact that the Trust shall have one or more established"
"2260","and designated Classes of the Trust, shall not limit the authority"
"2261","of the Board of Trustees to establish and designate additional"
"2262","Classes of the Trust.  The fact that one or more Classes of the Trust"
"2263","shall have initially been established and designated without any"
"2264"," specific establishment or designation of a Series (i.e., that all"
"2265","Shares of the Trust are initially Shares of one or more Classes)"
"2266","shall not limit the authority of the Board of Trustees to later establish"
"2267","and designate a Series and establish and designate the Class or Classes"
"2268"," of the Trust as Class or Classes, respectively, of such Series."
"2269","	The fact that a Series shall have initially been established"
"2270","and designated without any specific establishment or designation of"
"2271","Classes (i.e., that all Shares of such Series are initially of a"
"2272","single Class) shall not limit the authority of the Board of Trustees"
"2273","to establish and designate separate Classes of said Series.  The"
"2274","fact that a Series shall have more than one established and"
"2275","designated Class, shall not limit the authority of the Board of"
"2276","Trustees to establish and designate additional Classes of said"
"2277","Series."
"2278","(b)	The Board of Trustees shall have the power to issue"
"2279","authorized, but unissued Shares of the Trust, or any Series"
"2280","and Class thereof, from time to time for such consideration"
"2281","paid wholly or partly in cash, securities or other property,"
"2282","as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Trustees,"
"2283"," subject to any requirements or limitations of the 1940 Act."
"2284"," The Board of Trustees, on behalf of the Trust, may acquire and"
"2285"," hold as treasury shares, reissue for such consideration and on"
"2286","such terms as it may determine, or cancel, at its discretion from"
"2287","time to time, any Shares reacquired by the Trust.  The Board of"
"2288","Trustees may classify, reclassify or convert any unissued Shares"
"2289"," or any Shares of the Trust or any Series or Class thereof, that"
"2290"," were previously issued and are reacquired, into one or more"
"2291","Series or Classes that may be established and designated from"
"2292","time to time and, in connection therewith, cause some or all"
"2293","of the Shareholders of the Trust, such Series or Class to"
"2294","become Shareholders of such other Series or Class.  Notwithstanding"
"2295"," the foregoing, the Trust and any Series thereof may acquire,"
"2296","hold, sell and otherwise deal in, for purposes of investment or"
"2297"," otherwise, the Shares of any other Series of the Trust or"
"2298","Shares of the Trust, and such Shares shall not be deemed treasury"
"2299","shares or cancelled."
"2300","(c)	Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Article"
"2301","III, each Share shall entitle the holder to voting rights as"
"2302","provided in Article V hereof.  Shareholders shall have no"
"2303","preemptive or other right to subscribe for new or additional"
"2304","authorized, but unissued Shares or other securities issued by"
"2305"," the Trust or any Series thereof.  The Board of Trustees may"
"2306","from time to time divide or combine the Shares of the Trust or"
"2307","any particular Series thereof into a greater or lesser number of"
"2308","Shares of the Trust or that Series, respectively.  Such division or"
"2309"," combination shall not materially change the proportionate"
"2310"," beneficial interests of the holders of Shares of the Trust or"
"2311","that Series, as the case may be, in the Trust Property at the"
"2312"," time of such division or combination that is held with respect"
"2313","to the Trust or that Series, as the case may be."
"2314","(d)	Any Trustee, officer or other agent of the Trust, and"
"2315","any organization in which any such Person has an economic or"
"2316"," other interest, may acquire, own, hold and dispose of Shares"
"2317"," in the Trust or any Series and Class thereof, whether such"
"2318","Shares are authorized but unissued, or already outstanding, to"
"2319","the same extent as if such Person were not a Trustee, officer"
"2320","or other agent of the Trust; and the Trust or any Series may"
"2321","issue and sell and may purchase such Shares from any such Person"
"2322","or any such organization, subject to the limitations,"
"2323"," restrictions or other provisions applicable to the sale or"
"2324","purchase of such Shares herein and the 1940 Act."
"2325","Section 2.	Ownership of Shares.  The ownership of Shares"
"2326","shall be recorded on the books of the Trust kept by the Trust"
"2327"," or by a transfer or similar agent for the Trust, which books"
"2328"," shall be maintained separately for the Shares of the Trust"
"2329","and each Series and each Class thereof that has been established"
"2330","and designated.  No certificates certifying the ownership of Shares"
"2331","shall be issued except as the Board of Trustees may otherwise"
"2332"," determine from time to time.  The Board of Trustees may make"
"2333","such rules not inconsistent with the provisions of the 1940 Act"
"2334"," as it considers appropriate for the issuance of Share certificates,"
"2335","the transfer of Shares of the Trust and each Series and Class thereof,"
"2336","if any, and similar matters.  The record books of the Trust as kept"
"2337","by the Trust or any transfer or similar agent, as the case may be,"
"2338","shall be conclusive as to who are the Shareholders of the Trust"
"2339","and each Series and Class thereof and as to the number of Shares"
"2340","of the Trust and each Series and Class thereof held from time to"
"2341","time by each such Shareholder."
"2342","Section 3.	Sale of Shares.  Subject to the 1940 Act and"
"2343","applicable law, the Trust may sell its authorized but unissued"
"2344","Shares to such Persons, at such times, on such terms, and for"
"2345","such consideration as the Board of Trustees may from time to"
"2346","time authorize.  Each sale shall be credited to the individual"
"2347","purchaser's account in the form of full or fractional Shares of"
"2348","the Trust or such Series thereof (and Class thereof, if any), as"
"2349","the purchaser may select, at the net asset value per Share,"
"2350","subject to Section 22 of the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations"
"2351","adopted thereunder; provided, however, that the Board of Trustees"
"2352","may, in its sole discretion, permit the Principal Underwriter to"
"2353","impose a sales charge upon any such sale.  Every Shareholder by"
"2354","virtue of having become a Shareholder shall be bound by the terms"
"2355","of this Declaration of Trust.  Ownership of Shares shall not"
"2356","make any Shareholder a third-party beneficiary of any contract"
"2357","entered into by the Trust or any Series."
"2358","Section 4.	Status of Shares and Limitation of Personal"
"2359"," Liability.  Shares shall be deemed to be personal property"
"2360","giving to Shareholders only the rights provided in this Declaration"
"2361","of Trust, the By-Laws, and under applicable law.  Ownership of"
"2362","Shares shall not entitle the Shareholder to any title in or to"

"2364","for a partition or division of the same or for an accounting,"
"2365","nor shall the ownership of Shares constitute the Shareholders"

"2367","death, incapacity, dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy"
"2368","of a Shareholder during the existence of the Trust and any"
"2369","Series thereof shall not operate to dissolve the Trust or"
"2370","any such Series, nor entitle the representative of any"
"2371","deceased, incapacitated, dissolved, terminated or bankrupt"
"2372","Shareholder to an accounting or to take any action in court"
"2373","or elsewhere against the Trust, the Trustees or any such"
"2374","Series, but entitles such representative only to the rights"

"2379","bind personally any Shareholder, nor, except as specifically"
"2380","provided herein, to call upon any Shareholder for the payment"
"2381"," of any sum of money other than such as the Shareholder may"
"2382","at any time personally agree to pay.  Each Share, when issued"
"2383","on the terms determined by the Board of Trustees, shall be"
"2384","fully paid and nonassessable.  As provided in the DSTA,"
"2385","Shareholders shall be entitled to the same limitation of"
"2386"," personal liability as that extended to stockholders of a"
"2387"," private corporation organized for profit under the General"
"2388"," Corporation Law of the State of Delaware."
"2389","Section 5.	Power of Board of Trustees to Make Tax Status"
"2390"," Election.  The Board of Trustees shall have the power, in"
"2391","its discretion, to make such elections as to the tax status"
"2392","of the Trust and any Series as may be permitted or required"
"2393"," under the Code, without the vote of any Shareholder."

"2397","Shareholder approval, upon the adoption of a resolution by"
"2398"," not less than a majority of the then Board of Trustees,"
"2399","which resolution shall set forth such establishment and"
"2400","designation whether directly in such resolutions or by"
"2401","reference to, or approval of, another document that sets"

"2407","relative rights and preferences as between the different"
"2408","Series and Classes) otherwise than as provided herein."
"2409","Any action that may be taken by the Board of Trustees with"
"2410"," respect to any Series or Class, including any addition,"
"2411","modification, division, combination, classification,"

"2426"," liabilities of the Trust, the Series or any other Class and"
"2427","separate and distinct records on the books of the Trust for the"
"2428","Class shall be maintained for this purpose.  Subject to Article"
"2429","II hereof, each such Series shall operate as a separate and"
"2430"," distinct investment medium, with separately defined investment"
"2431","objectives and policies."
"2432","Shares of each Series (and Class where applicable) established"

"3428","incurred in connection with such Proceeding if such Person acted in"

"3448","shall be made by the Trust if authorized in the specific case on a"
"3449","determination that indemnification of the Agent is proper in the"

"3454"," proceeding against the Agent for insufficiency of evidence of any"
"3455","Disqualifying Conduct) or, (ii) in the absence of such a decision,"
"3456"," a reasonable determination, based upon a review of the facts, that"
"3457","the Agent was not liable by reason of Disqualifying Conduct, by (1)"

"3471","advancement of expenses is met: (i) the Agent shall provide a"
"3472","security for his undertaking, (ii) the Trust shall be insured"
"3473","against losses arising by reason of any lawful advances, or (iii)"
"3474"," a majority of a quorum of the disinterested, non-party Trustees"

"3476","shall determine, based on a review of readily available facts (as"
"3477","opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), that there is reason to believe"
"3478"," that the Agent ultimately will be found entitled to indemnification."
"3479","(e)	Other Contractual Rights.  Nothing contained in this Article"
"3480","shall affect any right to indemnification to which Persons other than"
"3481","Trustees and officers of the Trust or any subsidiary thereof may be"

"3485"," other fiduciary of an employee benefit plan in that Person's capacity"

"3487"," defined in Section 1 of this Article.  Nothing contained in this"

"3489"," trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary may be entitled by"
"3490"," contract or otherwise which shall be enforceable to the extent"
"3491","permitted by applicable law other than this Article."
"3492","(g)	Joint and Several Obligations.  Notwithstanding any other"
"3493","provision in this Declaration of Trust to the contrary, any amount"

"3522"," deemed not likely to succeed and therefore excused if a"
"3523","majority of the Board of Trustees, or a majority of any"
"3524","committee established to consider the merits of such action,"
"3525"," is composed of Trustees who are not independent trustees"
"3526"," (as such term is defined in the DSTA)."
