"1376","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED"
"1377","PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1378","Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"1379","AdvisorOne Funds"
"1380","Omaha, Nebraska"
"1381","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1382","statements of CLS Global Aggressive Equity Fund, CLS"
"1383","Diversified Equity Fund, CLS Growth and Income Fund,"
"1384","CLS Flexible Income Fund, and CLS Shelter Fund, each"
"1385","a series of shares of AdvisorOne Funds (the Funds) for"
"1386","the year ended April 30, 2020, in accordance with the"
"1387","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1388","Board (United States), we considered their internal"
"1389","control over financial reporting, including control"
"1390","activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1391","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1392","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"1393","comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not"
"1394","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1395","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"1396","financial reporting.   Accordingly, we express no such"
"1397","opinion."
"1398","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"1399","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1400","over financial reporting.   In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1401","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"1402","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"1403","A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1404","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1405","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1406","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1407","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1408","principles.   A fund's internal control over financial"
"1409","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1410","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1411","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1412","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1413","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1414","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1415","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1416","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"1417","are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"1418","of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"1419","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1420","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1421","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1422","financial statements."
"1423","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1424","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1425","misstatements.   Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1426","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1427","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1428","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1429","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1430","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1431","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1432","allow management or employees, in the normal course"

"1472","PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1473","Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"1474","AdvisorOne Funds"
"1475","Omaha, Nebraska"
"1476","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1477","statements of Milestone Treasury Obligations Fund (the"
"1478","Fund) for the year ended April 30, 2020, in accordance"
"1479","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1480","Oversight Board (United States), we considered its"
"1481","internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1482","control activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"1483","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1484","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"1485","comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not"
"1486","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1487","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"1488","financial reporting.   Accordingly, we express no such"
"1489","opinion."
"1490","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"1491","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1492","over financial reporting.   In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1493","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"1494","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"1495","A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1496","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1497","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1498","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1499","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1500","principles.   A fund's internal control over financial"
"1501","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1502","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1503","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1504","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1505","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1506","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1507","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1508","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"1509","are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"1510","of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"1511","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1512","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1513","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1514","financial statements."
"1515","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1516","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1517","misstatements.   Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1518","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1519","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1520","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1521","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1522","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1523","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1524","allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"1525","of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1526","detect misstatements on a timely basis.   A material"
"1527","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,"
"1528","in internal control over financial reporting, such that"
"1529","there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1530","misstatement of the fund's annual or interim financial"
"1531","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
