"5359","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"5360"," (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Funds'"
"5361"," internal control over financial reporting, including"
"5362"," controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"5363"," for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"5364"," of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"5365"," and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN,"
"5366","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"5367","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"5368"," financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express"
"5369","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"5370","control over financial reporting."
"5371","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"5372"," establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"5373"," over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"5374","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"5375"," are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"5376","related costs of controls. A company's internal"
"5377"," control over financial reporting is a process"
"5378","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"5379"," the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"5380"," preparation of financial statements for external"
"5381"," purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"5382","accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"5383","over financial reporting includes those policies"
"5384"," and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"5385","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"5386","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"5387"," of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"5388"," assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"5389"," to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"5390","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"5391"," and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"5392"," being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"5393"," management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"5394"," reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"5395"," detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"5396"," of a company's assets that could have a material effect"
"5397","on the financial statements."
"5398","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"5399","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"5400","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"5401","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"5402","the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"5403","because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"5404","degree of compliance with the policies or"
"5405","procedures may deteriorate."
"5406","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"5407"," reporting exists when the design or operation"
"5408","of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"5409"," in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"5410","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"5411"," timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"5412"," or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"5413","control over financial reporting, such that there"
"5414","is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"5415"," misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"5416","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"5417"," detected on a timely basis."
"5418","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control"
"5419"," over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"5420","described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily"
"5421"," disclose all deficiencies in internal control over"
"5422","financial reporting that might be material weaknesses"
"5423"," under standards established by the PCAOB. However, we"
"5424","noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over"
"5425"," financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"5426","over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"5427","material weakness as defined above as of April 30, 2020."
