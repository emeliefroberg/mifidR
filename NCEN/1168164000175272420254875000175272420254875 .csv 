"18265","CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"18266","effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial"
"18267","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"18268","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing"
"18269","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"18270","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"18271","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"

"18273","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"18274","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"18275","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"18276","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"18277","accounting principles. A company's internal control over"
"18278","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"18279","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"18280","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"18281","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"18282","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"18283","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"18284","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"18285","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"

"18288","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"18289","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"18290","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"18291","statements."
"18292","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"18293","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"18294","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"18295","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"18296","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"18297","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"18298","deteriorate."
"18299","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"18300","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"18301","management or employees, in the normal course of"
"18302","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"

"18304","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"18305","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"18306","possibility that a material misstatement of the company's"
