"1464","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"1465","Accounting Firm"
"1466","To the Board of Trustees of Deutsche DWS"
"1467","Market Trust and Shareholders of DWS RREEF"
"1468","Real Assets Fund:"
"1469","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"1470","consolidated financial statements of DWS"
"1471","RREEF Real Assets Fund (the Fund) (one of"
"1472","the funds constituting Deutsche DWS Market"
"1473","Trust) (the Trust), as of and for the year ended"
"1474","March 31, 2020, in accordance with the"
"1475","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1476","Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"1477","the Trust's internal control over financial"
"1478","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1479","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1480","procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1481","opinion on the consolidated financial statements"
"1482","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"1483","CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"1484","opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's"
"1485","internal control over financial reporting."
"1486","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1487","The management of the Trust is responsible for"
"1488","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1489","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1490","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1491","management are required to assess the expected"
"1492","benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"1493","company's internal control over financial"
"1494","reporting is a process designed to provide"
"1495","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1496","financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1497","financial statements for external purposes in"
"1498","accordance with U.S. generally accepted"
"1499","accounting principles. A company's internal"
"1500","control over financial reporting includes those"
"1501","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1502","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1503","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1504","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"1505","provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"1506","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"1507","of financial statements in accordance with U.S."
"1508","generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1509","that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"1510","are being made only in accordance with"
"1511","authorizations of management and directors of"
"1512","the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1513","assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1514","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"1515","disposition of a company's assets that could"
"1516","have a material effect on the financial"
"1517","statements."
"1518","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1519","control over financial reporting may not prevent"
"1520","or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"1521","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1522","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1523","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"1524","that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"1525","or procedures may deteriorate."
"1526","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1527","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"1528","a control does not allow management or"
"1529","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1530","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1531","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"1532","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1533","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1534","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1535","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1536","company's annual or interim financial"
"1537","statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"1538","timely basis."
"1539","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control"
"1540","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"1541","purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"1542","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1543","internal control that might be material"
"1544","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1545","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1546","(United States). However, we noted no"
"1547","deficiencies in the Trust's internal control over"
"1548","financial reporting and its operation, including"
"1549","controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"1550","consider to be a material weakness as defined"
"1551","above as of March 31, 2020."
"1552","This report is intended solely for the information"
"1553","and use of management and the Board of"
"1554","Trustees of Deutsche DWS Market Trust and the"
"1555","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"1556","intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
"1557","other than these specified parties."
