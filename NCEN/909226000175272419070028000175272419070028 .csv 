"1515","amendment on March 9, 2018."
"1516","Applicants requested an order under section 6(c) of the Investment"
"1517"," Company Act of 1940 (the"
"1518","Act) for an exemption from sections 18(f) and 21(b) of the Act,"
"1519"," under section 12(d)(1)(J) of"
"1520","the Act for an exemption from section 12(d)(1) of the Act, under"
"1521"," sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the"
"1522","Act for an exemption from sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2), and 17(a)(3)"
"1523"," of the Act, and under section"
"1524","17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit certain"
"1525","joint arrangements and"
"1526","transactions. The order supersedes a prior order1 and permits"
"1527","certain registered management"
"1528","investment companies to participate in a joint lending and"
"1529","borrowing facility."
"1530","On May 10, 2018, a notice of the filing of the application was"
"1531"," issued (Investment Company Act"
"1532","Release No. 33095). The notice gave interested persons an"
"1533"," opportunity to request a hearing and"
"1534","stated that an order disposing of the application would be issued"
"1535","unless a hearing was ordered."
"1536","No request for a hearing has been filed, and the Commission has"
"1537","not ordered a hearing."
"1538","The matter has been considered and it is found, on the basis of"
"1539","the information set forth in the"
"1540","application, as amended, that granting the requested exemption"
"1541"," is consistent with and appropriate"
"1542","in the public interest, and consistent with the protection of"
"1543","investors and the purposes fairly"
"1544","intended by the policy and provisions of the Act."
"1545","It is also found that the terms of the proposed transactions,"
"1546","including the consideration to be paid"
"1547","or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve"
"1548","overreaching on the part of any person"
