"4275","Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),"
"4276","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"4277","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"4278","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"4279","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"4280","the financial statements and to comply with the"
"4281","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"4282","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"4283","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"4284","do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"4285","Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"4286","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"4287","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"4288","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"4289","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"4290","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"4291","controls. A company's internal control over financial"
"4292","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"4293","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"4294","and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"4295","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"

"4300","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"4301","the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"

"4309","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"4310","disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"4311","material effect on the financial statements."
"4312","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"4313","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"4314","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"4315","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"4316","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"4317","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"4318","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"4319","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"4320","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"4321","allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"4322","of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"4323","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"4324","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"4325","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"4326","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"4327","misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"4328","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on"
"4329","a timely basis."
"4330","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"4331","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"4332","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"4333","all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting"
"4334","that might be material weaknesses under standards"

"4847","Basis for Opinion"
"4848","These financial statements are the responsibility of the"
"4849","Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an"
"4850","opinion on the Fund's financial statements based on our"
"4851","audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with"
"4852","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"

"4862","statements are free of material misstatement, whether"
"4863","due to error or fraud."
"4864","Our audits included performing procedures to assess the"
"4865","risks of material misstatement of the financial"
"4866","statements, whether due to error or fraud, and"
"4867","performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such"
"4868","procedures included examining, on a test basis,"
"4869","evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the"
"4870","financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating"
"4871","the accounting principles used and significant estimates"
"4872","made by management, as well as evaluating the overall"
"4873","presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures"
"4874","included confirmation of securities owned as of October"
"4875","31, 2018 by correspondence with the custodian, transfer"
