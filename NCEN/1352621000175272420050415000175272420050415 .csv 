"3530","in accordance with the standards of the"

"3533","considered the Funds internal control"
"3534","over financial reporting, including"

"3536","as a basis for designing our auditing"
"3537","procedures for the purpose of expressing"

"3542","of the Funds internal control over"
"3543","financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"3544","express no such opinion."
"3545","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"3546","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"3547","internal control over financial reporting."
"3548","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"3549","and judgments by management are required to"
"3550","assess the expected benefits and related"
"3551","costs of controls. A funds internal control"
"3552","over financial reporting is a process"
"3553","designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"3554","regarding the reliability of financial"
"3555","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"3556","statements for external purposes in accordance"
"3557","with generally accepted accounting principles."
"3558","A funds internal control over financial"
"3559","reporting includes those policies and"

"3561","maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"3562","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"3563","transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"3564","of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"3565","that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"3566","to permit preparation of financial statements"
"3567","in accordance with generally accepted"
"3568","accounting principles, and that receipts"

"3574","acquisition, use, or disposition of a funds"
"3575","assets that could have a material effect on"
"3576","the financial statements."
"3577","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"3578","control over financial reporting may not"

"3582","controls may become inadequate because of"
"3583","changes in conditions or that the degree of"

"3585","deteriorate."
"3586","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"3587","reporting exists when the design or operation"
"3588","of a control does not allow management or"

"3594","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"3595","possibility that a material misstatement of"

"3597","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3598","Our consideration of the Funds internal control"

"3601","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"3602","in internal control that might be material"
