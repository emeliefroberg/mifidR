"425","<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>The management of the Funds is responsible"

"428","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"

"430","A company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"431","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"432","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"433","with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"434","with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
