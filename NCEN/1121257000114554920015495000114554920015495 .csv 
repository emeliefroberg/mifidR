"1436","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1437","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements and financial highlights for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A company&#146;s internal control"
"1438","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"1439","(2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements and financial highlights in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only"
"1440","in accordance with authorizations of management and Board of Trustees of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets"

"1442","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1443","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P> <P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation"
"1444","of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
