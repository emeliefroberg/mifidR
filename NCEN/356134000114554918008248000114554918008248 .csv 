"1808","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but"

"1812","<P style=font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;>The"

"1814","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1815","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"

"1818","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1819","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally"

"1823"," the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Funds; (2)provide"
"1824","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"

"1831","<P style=font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;>Because"
"1832","of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not"
"1833","prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1834","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1835","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"1836","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>"

"1839","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"1840","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1841","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1842","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1843","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds"
"1844","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
