"28068","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"28069","opinion."
"28070","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing"

"28072","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"

"28077","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"28078","for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally"
"28079","accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"28080","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"28081","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"28082","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"28083","and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"28084","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"28085","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"

"28087","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"

"28090","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"28091","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"28092","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"28093","statements."
"28094","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"28095","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"28096","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"

"28141","Prospectuses:"
"28142","Legal Proceedings"
"28143","On August 27, 2018, Transamerica Asset Management, Inc."
"28144","(TAM), Aegon USA Investment Management, LLC"
"28145","(AUIM) and Transamerica Capital, Inc. (TCI) reached a"
"28146","settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the"
"28147","SEC) that resolved an investigation into asset allocation"
"28148","models and volatility overlays utilized by AUIM when it"
"28149","served as sub-adviser to certain Transamerica-sponsored"
"28150","mutual funds, and related disclosures.  TAM and TCI serve as"
"28151","investment manager and principal underwriter, respectively, to"
"28152","Transamerica-sponsored mutual funds.  TCI also serves as the"
"28153","principal underwriter to the variable life insurance and annuity"
"28154","products through which certain Transamerica-sponsored"
"28155","mutual funds are offered.  AUIM, an affiliate of TAM and"
"28156","TCI, serves as sub-adviser to a number of Transamerica-"
"28157","sponsored mutual funds."
"28158","The SEC's order instituting administrative and cease-and-"
"28159","desist proceedings (the Order) pertains to events that"
"28160","occurred during the period between July 2011 and June 2015,"
"28161","and, among other things, the operation and/or implementation"
"28162","of an asset allocation model utilized by AUIM when it served"
"28163","as sub-adviser to certain Transamerica tactical funds and asset"
"28164","allocation funds, the designation of the portfolio manager for"
"28165","certain of these funds as well as the operation and/or"
"28166","implementation of volatility overlays utilized by AUIM when"
"28167","it served as sub-adviser to the asset allocation funds.  The"
"28168","Order also states that the parties failed to make appropriate"
"28169","disclosures regarding these matters, including in marketing"
"28170","materials, and failed to have adequate compliance policies and"
"28171","procedures. The tactical funds are Transamerica Dynamic"

"28194","April 30, 2015 and to the Transamerica asset allocation funds"
"28195","on June 30, 2015."
"28196","Under the terms of the Order, AUIM, TAM and TCI were"
"28197","censured, and agreed, without admitting or denying the"
"28198","findings in the Order, to cease and desist from committing or"
"28199","causing any violations of certain statutory provisions and SEC"
"28200","rules.  AUIM agreed to pay civil penalties of $21,000,000,"
"28201","$24,599,896 in disgorgement and $3,682,195 in prejudgment"
"28202","interest.  TAM agreed to pay civil penalties of $10,500,000,"

"28204","interest.  TCI agreed to pay civil penalties of $4,000,000,"
"28205","$12,000,000 in disgorgement and $1,826,022 in prejudgment"
"28206","interest.  The amounts paid in disgorgement, prejudgment"
"28207","interest and civil penalties will be deposited into a Fair Fund"
"28208","for distribution to affected investors.  Affected investors are"
"28209","those who purchased or held the relevant mutual funds,"
"28210","variable life insurance and annuity investment portfolios and"
"28211","separately managed account strategies during the period"
"28212","between July 2011 and June 2015.  The Order states that these"
"28213","investors are to receive from the Fair Fund the pro rata fees"
"28214","and commissions paid by them during that period, subject to"
"28215","any de minimis threshold."
"28216","In accepting the settlement, the SEC considered the substantial"
"28217","cooperation and remedial efforts of AUIM, TAM and TCI.  In"
"28218","the Order, the SEC acknowledged that, after the start of the"
"28219","SEC staff's investigation but before the settlement, AUIM,"
"28220","TAM and TCI had voluntarily retained an independent"
"28221","compliance consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of"
"28222","certain compliance policies and procedures, internal controls"
"28223","and related procedures, and that AUIM, TAM and TCI had"
"28224","received the consultant's written findings and implemented the"
"28225","consultant's proposed changes.  The SEC also acknowledged"
"28226","that, in advance of receiving written findings and"
"28227","recommendations from the independent compliance"
"28228","consultant, AUIM, TAM and TCI had already begun making"
"28229","revisions and improvements to their compliance policies and"
"28230","procedures.  The SEC also considered that AUIM, TAM and"
"28231","TCI have retained the independent compliance consultant for"
"28232","further reviews through the completion of the consultant's"
"28233","follow-up review for fiscal year 2019."
"28234","The settlement does not impose any restrictions on the"
"28235","business or continued ability of AUIM, TAM or TCI to serve"
"28236","the funds."
"28237","Transamerica Financial Advisors, LLC (TFA), which serves"
"28238","as an intermediary for the Transamerica-sponsored mutual"
"28239","funds, also was a party to the settlement.  The findings in the"
"28240","Order with respect to TFA are unrelated to the mutual funds."
"28241","The foregoing is only a brief summary of the Order.  A copy"
"28242","of the Order is available on the SEC's website at"
"28243","https://www.sec.gov."
"28244","The funds are affected by many factors and risks: for example,"
"28245","the risk that the sub-advisers' judgments and investment"
"28246","decisions, and methods, tools, resources, information, models"
"28247","and analyses utilized in making investment decisions, are"
"28248","incorrect or flawed, do not produce the desired results, and"

Using derivatives may have a leveraging effect, increase fund volatility and not produce the result intended. Certain derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of the initial investment. Even a small investment in derivatives can have a disproportionate impact on the fund. Derivatives may be difficult to sell, unwind or value, and the counterparty (including, if applicable, </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>the fund&#146;s clearing broker, </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>the derivatives exchange or the clearinghouse) may default on its obligations to the fund. Derivatives are generally subject to the risks applicable to the assets, rates, indices or other indicators underlying the derivative. The value of a derivative may fluctuate more or less than, or otherwise not correlate well with, the underlying assets, rates, indices or other indicators to which it relates. The fund may be required to segregate or earmark liquid assets or otherwise cover its obligations under derivatives transactions and may have to liquidate positions before it is desirable in order to meet these segregation and coverage requirements. Use of derivatives may have different tax consequences for the fund than an investment in the underlying security, and those differences may affect the amount, timing and character of income distributed to shareholders. The U.S. government and foreign governments are in the process of adopting and implementing regulations governing derivatives markets, including mandatory clearing of certain derivatives, margin and reporting requirements. There may be additional regulation of the use of derivatives by registered investment companies, such as the fund, which could significantly affect their use. The ultimate impact of the regulations remains unclear. Additional regulation of derivatives may make derivatives more costly, limit their availability or utility, otherwise adversely affect their performance, limit fund investments in derivatives, or disrupt markets. For additional information </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>regarding derivatives, see &#147;More on Risks of Investing in the Funds </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>- More on Principal Risks: </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Times New Roman,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>Derivatives&#148; in the prospectus.</FONT></P>"
