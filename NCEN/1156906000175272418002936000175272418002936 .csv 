"1341","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1342","Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),"
"1343","we considered the Funds internal control over"
"1344","financial reporting, including controls over"
"1345","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"1346","our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1347","expressing our opinion on the financial statements"

"1353","internal control over financial reporting."
"1354","The management of the Fund is responsible for"

"1357","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"

"1379","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"1380","companys assets that could have a material effect on"
"1381","the financial statements."
"1382","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1383","control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"1384","detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any"
