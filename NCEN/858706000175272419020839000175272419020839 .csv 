"1258","			as of the Request Record Date entitled to cast not less than a"
"1259","			majority (the Special Meeting Percentage) of all of the votes"
"1260","			entitled to be cast on such matter at such meeting (the Special
			Meeting Request) shall be delivered to the Secretary.  In"
"1261","			addition, the Special Meeting Request shall set forth the purpose"

"1270","			of the Corporation which are owned of record and beneficially by"
"1271","			each such stockholder and the nominee holder for, and number of,"

"1273","			record by such stockholder, shall be sent to the Secretary by"

"1275","			by the Secretary within 60 days after the Request Record Date.  Any"

"1279","           (3)	The Secretary shall inform the requesting stockholders of the"
"1280","		   reasonably estimated cost of preparing and mailing the notice of"
"1281","		   meeting (including the Corporation's proxy materials).  The"
"1282","		   Secretary shall not be required to call a special meeting upon"
"1283","		   stockholder request and such meeting shall not be held unless, in"
"1284","		   addition to the documents required by paragraph (2) of this Section"
"1285","		   3(b), the Secretary receives payment of such reasonably estimated"
"1286","		   cost prior to the preparation and mailing or delivery of any notice"
"1287","		   of the meeting."
"1288","            (4)	Except as provided in the next sentence, any special meeting"
"1289","			shall be held at such place, date and time as may be designated by"
"1290","			the President, Chief Executive Officer or Board of Directors,"
"1291","			whoever has called the meeting.  In the case of any special meeting"
"1292","			called by the Secretary upon the request of stockholders (a"
"1293","			Stockholder-Requested Meeting), such meeting shall be held at"
"1294","			such place, date and time as may be designated by the Board of"
"1295","			Directors; provided, however, that the date of any"
"1296","			Stockholder-Requested Meeting shall be not more than 90 days after"
"1297","			the record date for such meeting (the Meeting Record Date); and"
"1298","			provided further that if the Board of Directors fails to"
"1299","			designate, within ten days after the date that a valid Special"
"1300","			Meeting Request is actually received by the Secretary (the"
"1301","			Delivery Date), a date and time for a Stockholder-Requested"
"1302","			Meeting, then such meeting shall be held at 2:00 p.m. local time"
"1303","			on the 90th day after the Meeting Record Date or, if such 90th day"
"1304","			is not a Business Day (as defined below), on the first preceding"
"1305","			Business Day; and provided further that in the event that the"
"1306","			Board of Directors fails to designate a place for a"
"1307","			Stockholder-Requested Meeting within ten days after the Delivery"
"1308","			Date, then such meeting shall be held at the principal executive"
"1309","			offices of the Corporation.  In fixing a date for any special"
"1310","			meeting, the President, Chief Executive Officer or Board of"
"1311","			Directors may consider such factors as he, she or it deems"
"1312","			relevant within the good faith exercise of business judgment,"
"1313","			including, without limitation, the nature of the matters to be"
"1314","			considered, the facts and circumstances surrounding any request"
"1315","			for meeting and any plan of the Board of Directors to call an"
"1316","			annual meeting or a special meeting.  In the case of any"
"1317","			Stockholder-Requested Meeting, if the Board of Directors fails to"
"1318","			fix a Meeting Record Date that is a date within 30 days after the"
"1319","			Delivery Date, then the close of business on the 30th day after"
"1320","			the Delivery Date shall be the Meeting Record Date."
"1321","            (5)	If at any time as a result of written revocations of requests"
"1322","			for the special meeting, stockholders of record (or their duly"
"1323","			authorized agents) as of the Request Record Date entitled to cast"
"1324","			less than the Special Meeting Percentage shall have delivered and"
"1325","			not revoked requests for a special meeting, the Secretary may"
"1326","			refrain from mailing the notice of the meeting or, if the notice"
"1327","			of the meeting has been mailed, the Secretary may revoke the"
"1328","			notice of the meeting at any time before ten days before the"
"1329","			meeting if the Secretary has first sent to all other requesting"
"1330","			stockholders written notice of such revocation and of intention to"
"1331","			revoke the notice of the meeting.  Any request for a special"
"1332","			meeting received after a revocation by the Secretary of a notice"
"1333","			of a meeting shall be considered a request for a new special"
"1334","			meeting."
"1335","            (6)	The Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President or the"
"1336","			Board of Directors may appoint regionally or nationally recognized"
"1337","			independent inspectors of elections to act as the agent of the"
"1338","			Corporation for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial"
"1339","			review of the validity of any purported Special Meeting Request"
"1340","			received by the Secretary.  For the purpose of permitting the"
"1341","			inspectors to perform such review, no such purported request"
"1342","			shall be deemed to have been delivered to the Secretary until the"
"1343","			earlier of (i) five Business Days after receipt by the Secretary"
"1344","			of such purported request and (ii) such date as the independent"
"1345","			inspectors certify to the Corporation that the valid requests"
"1346","			received by the Secretary represent stockholders of record entitled"
"1347","			to cast not less than the Special Meeting Percentage.  Nothing"
"1348","			contained in this paragraph (6) shall in any way be construed to"
"1349","			suggest or imply that the Corporation or any stockholder shall not"
"1350","			be entitled to contest the validity of any request, whether during"
"1351","			or after such five Business Day period, or to take any other"
"1352","			action (including, without limitation, the commencement,"
"1353","			prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto,"
"1354","			and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation)."
"1355","            (7)	For purposes of these Bylaws, Business Day shall mean any"
"1356","			day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banking"
"1357","			institutions in the State of New York are authorized or"
"1358","			obligated by law or executive order to close."
"1359","      Section 4.	Notice of Meetings of Stockholders.  Not less than ten"
"1360","	  nor more than 90 days before each meeting of stockholders, the"
"1361","	  Secretary shall give to each stockholder entitled to vote at such"
"1362","	  meeting and to each stockholder not entitled to vote who is entitled to"
"1363","	  notice of the meeting notice in writing or by electronic transmission"
"1364","	  stating the time and place of the meeting and, in the case of a special"
"1365","	  meeting or as otherwise may be required by any statute, the purpose for"
"1366","	  which the meeting is called, either by mail, presenting it to the"
"1367","	  stockholder personally, leaving it at the stockholder's residence or"
"1368","	  usual place of business, by electronic transmission or transmitting the"
"1369","	  notice to the stockholder in any other manner authorized by law.  If"
"1370","	  mailed, notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United"
"1371","	  States mail addressed to the stockholder at the stockholder's post"
"1372","	  office address as it appears upon the books of the Corporation, with"
"1373","	  postage thereon prepaid.  If transmitted electronically, such notice"
"1374","	  shall be deemed to be given when transmitted to the stockholder by an"
"1375","	  electronic transmission to any address or number of the stockholder at"
"1376","	  which the stockholder receives electronic transmissions.  The Corporation"
"1377","	  may give a single notice to all stockholders who share an address, which"
"1378","	  single notice shall be effective as to any stockholder at such address,"
"1379","	  unless a stockholder objects to receiving such single notice or revokes"
"1380","	  a prior consent to receiving such single notice.  Failure to give notice"
"1381","	  of any meeting to one or more stockholders, or any irregularity in such"
"1382","	  notice, shall not affect the validity of any meeting fixed in accordance"
"1383","	  with this Article II or the validity of any proceedings at any such"
"1384","	  meeting.  The Corporation may postpone or cancel a meeting of"
"1385","	  stockholders by making a public announcement (as defined in Section"

"2214","	  destroyed, stolen or mutilated certificate or certificates, or his or"
"2215","	  her legal representative, shall be required, as a condition precedent to"
"2216","	  the issuance of a new certificate or certificates, to give the"

"2381","<TEXT>"
"2382","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2383","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The New Germany Fund, Inc.:"
"2384","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of The New"
"2385","Germany Fund, Inc. (the Fund) as of and for the year ended December 31,"
"2386","2018, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"2387","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Fund's internal"
"2388","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"2389","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"2390","of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"2391","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"2392","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"2393","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"2394","internal control over financial reporting."
"2395","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"2396","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"2397","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"2398","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"2399","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"2400","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"2401","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"2402","accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial"
"2403","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2404","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2405","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"2406","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"2407","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"2408","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"2409","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"2410","and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"2411","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"2412","of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2413","statements."
"2414","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2415","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"2416","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"2417","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"2418","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2419","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"2420","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"2421","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"2422","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"2423","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"2424","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"2425","misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"2426","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2427","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"2428","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
