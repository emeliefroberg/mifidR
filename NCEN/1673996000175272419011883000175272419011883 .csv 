"1769","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"1770","Transamerica ETF Trust:"
"1771","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"

"1775","Risk ETF, DeltaShares (r) S&P 600 Managed Risk ETF and"
"1776","DeltaShares (r) S&P International Managed Risk ETF)"
"1777","(collectively, the Funds) as of and for the period ended"
"1778","December 31, 2018, in accordance with the standards of the"
"1779","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1780","States), we considered the Trust's internal control over"
"1781","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1782","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"1783","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1784","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"1785","CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1786","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over"
"1787","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"1788","opinion."
"1789","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing"
"1790","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1791","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1792","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1793","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"1794","company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1795","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1796","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1797","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"1798","with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"1799","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"1800","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"1801","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1802","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1803","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"1804","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1805","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1806","accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting"
"1807","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1808","company are being made only in accordance with"
"1809","authorizations of management and directors of the"
"1810","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1811","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1812","use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"1813","material effect on the financial statements."
"1814","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1815","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1816","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1817","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1818","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1819","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1820","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1821","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1822","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1823","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1824","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1825","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"1826","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1827","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1828","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1829","company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"1830","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1831","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over"
"1832","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"1833","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"1834","deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1835","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"1836","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1837","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trust's internal"
"1838","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"1839","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be"
"1840","a material weakness as defined above as of December 31,"
"1841","2018."

"1861","Supplement to the Currently"
"1862","Effective Prospectus"
"1863","The following replaces the existing Legal Proceedings"
"1864","disclosure in the Management - Investment Manager section"
"1865","of the Prospectus:"
"1866","Legal Proceedings"
"1867","On August 27, 2018, Transamerica Asset Management, Inc."
"1868","(TAM), Aegon USA Investment Management, LLC"
"1869","(AUIM) and Transamerica Capital, Inc. (TCI) reached a"
"1870","settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the"
"1871","SEC) that resolved an investigation into asset allocation"
"1872","models and volatility overlays utilized by AUIM when it served"
"1873","as sub-adviser to certain Transamerica-sponsored mutual funds,"
"1874","and related disclosures. TAM serves as investment manager to"
"1875","the funds. AUIM, an affiliate of TAM, has no role or"
"1876","involvement with respect to the funds. TCI, an affiliate of TAM"
"1877","that serves as principal underwriter to the Transamerica-"
"1878","sponsored mutual funds, serves as an intermediary for the funds."
"1879","The SEC's order instituting administrative and cease-and-desist"
"1880","proceedings (the Order) pertains to events that occurred"
"1881","during the period between July 2011 and June 2015, and,"
"1882","among other things, the operation and/or implementation of an"
"1883","asset allocation model utilized by AUIM when it served as sub-"
"1884","adviser to certain Transamerica-sponsored mutual funds, the"
"1885","designation of the portfolio manager for certain of these funds"
"1886","as well as the operation and/or implementation of volatility"
"1887","overlays utilized by AUIM when it served as sub-adviser to"
"1888","certain of these funds. The Order also states that the parties"
"1889","failed to make appropriate disclosures regarding these matters,"
"1890","including in marketing materials, and failed to have adequate"
"1891","compliance policies and procedures."
"1892","Under the terms of the Order, AUIM, TAM and TCI were"
"1893","censured, and agreed, without admitting or denying the findings"
"1894","in the Order, to cease and desist from committing or causing"
"1895","any violations of certain statutory provisions and SEC rules."
"1896","AUIM agreed to pay civil penalties of $21,000,000,"
"1897","$24,599,896 in disgorgement and $3,682,195 in prejudgment"
"1898","interest.    TAM  agreed  to  pay  civil  penalties  of"
"1899","$10,500,000,  $15,000,000  in  disgorgement  and"
"1900","$2,235,765 in prejudgment interest. TCI agreed to pay civil"
"1901","penalties of $4,000,000, $12,000,000 in disgorgement and"
"1902","$1,826,022 in prejudgment interest. The amounts paid in"
"1903","disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties will be"
"1904","deposited into a Fair Fund for distribution to affected investors."
"1905","Affected investors are those who purchased or held the relevant"
"1906","mutual funds, variable life insurance and annuity investment"
"1907","portfolios and separately managed account strategies during the"
"1908","period between July 2011 and June 2015. The Order states that"
"1909","these investors are to receive from the Fair Fund the pro rata"
"1910","fees and commissions paid by them during that period, subject"
"1911","to any de minimis threshold."
"1912","In accepting the settlement, the SEC considered the substantial"
"1913","cooperation and remedial efforts of AUIM, TAM   and TCI. In"
"1914","the Order, the SEC acknowledged that, after the start of the SEC"
"1915","staff's investigation but before the settlement, AUIM, TAM and"
"1916","TCI had voluntarily retained an independent compliance"
"1917","consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of certain"
"1918","compliance policies and procedures, internal controls and"
"1919","related procedures, and that AUIM, TAM and TCI had received"
"1920","the consultant's written findings and implemented the"
"1921","consultant's proposed changes. The SEC also acknowledged"
"1922","that, in advance of receiving written findings and"
"1923","recommendations from the independent compliance consultant,"
"1924","AUIM, TAM and TCI had already begun making revisions and"
"1925","improvements to their compliance policies and procedures. The"
"1926","SEC also considered that AUIM, TAM and TCI have retained"
"1927","the independent compliance consultant for further reviews"
"1928","through the completion of the consultant's follow-up review for"
"1929","fiscal year 2019."
"1930","The language in the settlement Order does not impose any"
"1931","restrictions on the business or continued ability of TAM or TCI"
"1932","to serve the funds."
"1933","Transamerica Financial Advisors, LLC (TFA), which serves"
"1934","as an intermediary for the Transamerica-sponsored mutual"
"1935","funds, also was a party to the settlement. The findings in the"
"1936","Order with respect to TFA are unrelated to the funds and the"
"1937","Transamerica-sponsored mutual funds."
"1938","The foregoing is only a brief summary of the Order. A copy of"
"1939","the Order is available on the SEC's website at"
"1940","https://www.sec.gov."
"1941","The funds are affected by many factors and risks: for example,"
"1942","the risk that the sub-adviser's judgments and investment"
"1943","decisions, and methods, tools, resources, information, models"
"1944","and analyses utilized in making investment decisions, are"
"1945","incorrect or flawed, do not produce the desired results, and"
"1946","cause the funds to lose value. See Principal Risks in the"
"1947","prospectus."
"1948","Investors Should Retain this"
