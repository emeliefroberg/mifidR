The settlement is subject to ongoing negotiations and approvals among independent third parties. As part of the settlement, Nasdaq and the Company have agreed to certain cash payments from the Company to Nasdaq and PureShares, and have executed an asset purchase agreement to transfer certain Company intellectual property and related assets, to a Nasdaq affiliate. If the events set forth in the settlement agreement do not occur, and a subsequent settlement is not reached, the resulting conditions may adversely affect the Adviser&#8217;s future operations. However, Management of the Trust and the Fund, after consultation with legal counsel, believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Fund&#8217;s financial statements.&#160;</p>"

A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Funds; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Funds are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Funds; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.&#160;</p>"
