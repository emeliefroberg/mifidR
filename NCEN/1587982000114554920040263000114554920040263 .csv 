"500","<TEXT>"
"501","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"502","Accounting Firm"
"503","To the Board of Trustees of Investment"
"504","Managers Series Trust II"
"505","and the Shareholders of AXS Multi-Strategy"
"506","Alternatives Fund"
"507","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"508","financial statements of AXS Multi-Strategy"
"509","Alternatives Fund (formerly KCM Macro Trends"
"510","Fund) (the Fund), a series of Investment"
"511","Managers Series Trust II, as of and for the year"
"512","ended April 30, 2020, in accordance with the"
"513","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"514","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we"
"515","considered the Fund s internal control over"
"516","financial reporting, including controls over"
"517","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"518","our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"519","expressing our opinion on the financial"
"520","statements and to comply with the requirements"
"521","of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"522","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"523","the Fund s internal control over financial"
"524","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"525","opinion."
"526","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"527","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"528","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"529","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"530","management are required to assess the"
"531","expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"532","A fund s internal control over financial reporting"
"533","is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"534","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"535","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"536","statements for external purposes in accordance"
"537","with generally accepted accounting principles"
"538","(GAAP). A fund s internal control over financial"
"539","reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"540","that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"541","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"542","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"543","assets of the fund; (b) provide reasonable"
"544","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"545","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"546","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that"
"547","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"548","made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"549","management and trustees of the fund; and (c)"
"550","provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"551","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"552","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund s assets"
"553","that could have a material effect on the financial"
"554","statements."
"555","Because of inherent limitations, internal control"
"556","over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"557","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"558","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"559","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"560","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"561","that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"562","or procedures may deteriorate."
"563","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"564","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"565","a control does not allow management or"
"566","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"567","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"568","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"569","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"570","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"571","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"572","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"573","Fund s annual or interim financial statements will"
"574","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"575","Our consideration of the Fund s internal control"
"576","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"577","purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"578","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"579","internal control that might be material"
"580","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"581","PCAOB. However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"582","the Fund s internal control over financial"
"583","reporting and its operation, including controls"
"584","over safeguarding of securities that we consider"
"585","to be a material weakness as defined above as"
"586","of April 30, 2020."
"587","This report is intended solely for the information"
"588","and use of management and the Board of"
"589","Trustees of the Fund and the Securities and"
"590","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be"
"591","and should not be used by anyone other than"
"592","these specified parties."
