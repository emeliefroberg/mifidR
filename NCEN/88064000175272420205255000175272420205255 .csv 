Fitzsimons et al. </FONT></I><FONT size=3 face=Times New Roman,Times New Roman,Times,serif>(the &#147;Lawsuit&#148;). The Lawsuit arises out of a leveraged buyout transaction (&#147;LBO&#148;) in 2007 by which loans were made to the Tribune Company to fund the LBO and shares of the Tribune Company held by shareholders were tendered for or were converted to a right to receive cash. Following the completion of the LBO in 2007, the Tribune Company filed for bankruptcy. The Lawsuit seeks to recover all payments made to the shareholders in the LBO. The Lawsuit has been consolidated in a multi-district litigation (the &#147;Tribune MDL&#148;) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, case no. 12-MC-2296 (the &#147;District Court&#148;).
