"1591","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1592","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1593","considered American Beacon Funds' internal control"
"1594","over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1595","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1596","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"

"1601","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1602","The management of American Beacon Funds is"

"1610","and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"1611","purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted"

"1615","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1616","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"1617","the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1618","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1619","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"1620","U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"1621","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made"
"1622","only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1623","and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1624","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1625","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"1626","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1627","statements."
