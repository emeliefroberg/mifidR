"961","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"

"963","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"

"1141","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1142","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"1143","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with"
"1144","the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1145","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1146","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1147","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1148","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1149","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1150","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1151","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1152","material misstatement of the fund's annual or interim financial"
"1153","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1154","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1155","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1156","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1157","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1158","standards established by the PCAOB. However, we noted no"
"1159","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"1160","and its operation, including controls for safeguarding securities,"
"1161","that we consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as"
"1162","of December 31, 2018."
