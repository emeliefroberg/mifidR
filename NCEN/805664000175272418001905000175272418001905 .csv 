"1305","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1306","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Templeton Growth Fund, Inc."
"1307","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"1308","Templeton Growth Fund, Inc. (the Fund) as of and for the year ended"
"1309","August 31, 2018, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1310","Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the"
"1311","Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1312","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"1313","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"1314","to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"1315","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"1316","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"1317","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"1318","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1319","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1320","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1321","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1322","related costs of controls.  A company's internal control over"
"1323","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1324","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1325","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"1326","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal"
"1327","control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"1328","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1329","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1330","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"1331","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"1332","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"1333","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"1334","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the"
