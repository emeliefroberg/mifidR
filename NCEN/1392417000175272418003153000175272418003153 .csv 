"545","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING"
"546","FIRM"
"547","To the Board of Trustees of MFS"
"548","Series Trust XIV and Shareholders of MFS Institutional"
"549","Money Market Portfolio:"
"550","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"551","statements of MFS Institutional Money Market"
"552","Portfolio (one of the series of MFS Series Trust XIV)"
"553","(the Fund)as of and forthe yearended August31,2018,"
"554","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"555","Accounting Oversight Board(United States)"
"556","we considered the Funds internal control"
"557","over financial reporting,including controls"
"558","oversafeguarding securities,as a basis fordesigning"
"559","our auditing proceduresforthe purpose ofexpressing"
"560","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"561","with the requirements of Form N-CEN,"
"562","but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"563","opinion on the effectiveness of"
"564","the Funds internal control overfinancialreporting."
"565","Accordingly,we express no such opinion."
"566","The management ofthe Fundis  responsible for establishing"
"567","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"568","reporting.In fulfilling this responsibility,estimates"
"569","and judgments by management are required to assess"
"570","the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"571","A fundsinternal control over financial reporting is"
"572","a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"573","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"574","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"575","purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"576","principles.A funds internal control over financial"
"577","reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"578","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,in"
"579","reasonable detail,accurately and fairly reflect the"
"580","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"581","fund;(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"582","are recorded as necessary to permit"
"583","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"584","generally accepted accounting principles,"
"585","and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"586","being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"587","of management of the fund and trustees of the trust;"
"588","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"589","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"590","acquisition, use, or disposition of a funds assets"
"591","that could have a material effect on the"
"592","financial statements."
"593","Because of its inherent limitations,internal control"
"594","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"595","misstatements.Also,projections of any evaluation of"
"596","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"597","that controls may becomeinadequate because of changes"
"598","in conditions or that the degree of compliance with"
"599","the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"600","A deficiency in internal control over"
"601","financial reporting exists when the design"
"602","or operation of a control does not allow"
"603","management or employees,in the normal"
"604","course of performing their assigned"
"605","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"606","on a timely basis.A material weakness is"
"607","a deficiency,or a combination of deficiencies,"
"608","in internal control over financial reporting,"
"609","such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"610","that a material misstatement of a funds annual"
"611","or interim financial statements will not"
"612","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"613","Our consideration of the Funds internal"
"614","control over financial reporting was for the"
"615","limited purpose described in the first"
"616","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"617","all deficiencies in internal control that"
"618","might be material weaknesses under standards"
"619","established by the Public Company Accounting"
"620","Oversight Board (United States).However,"
"621","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds"
"622","internal control over financial reporting"
"623","and its operation, including controls"
"624","for safeguarding securities, that"
"625","we consider to be a material weakness,"
"626","as defined above, as of August31,2018."
"627","This report is intended solely for the"
"628","information and use of management,"
