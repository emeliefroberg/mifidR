"1439","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"1440","Accounting Firm"
"1441","To the Board of Trustees of Deutsche DWS"
"1442","Securities Trust and Shareholders of DWS"
"1443","Health and Wellness Fund:"
"1444","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"1445","financial statements of DWS Health and"
"1446","Wellness Fund (one of the funds"
"1447","constituting Deutsche DWS Securities"
"1448","Trust) (the Trust), as of and for the year"
"1449","ended May 31, 2019, in accordance with the"
"1450","standards of the Public Company"
"1451","Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1452","States), we considered the Trust's internal"
"1453","control over financial reporting, including"
"1454","controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"1455","basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"1456","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1457","the financial statements and to comply with"
"1458","the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not"
"1459","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1460","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal"
"1461","control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"1462","we express no such opinion."
"1463","The management of the Trust is responsible"
"1464","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"1465","internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1466","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1467","judgments by management are required to"
"1468","assess the expected benefits and related"
"1469","costs of controls. A company's internal"
"1470","control over financial reporting is a process"
"1471","designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1472","regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"1473","and the preparation of financial statements"
"1474","for external purposes in accordance with"
"1475","U.S. generally accepted accounting"
"1476","principles. A company's internal control over"
"1477","financial reporting includes those policies"
"1478","and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1479","maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1480","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1481","transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"1482","of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1483","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1484","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1485","statements in accordance with U.S."
"1486","generally accepted accounting principles,"
"1487","and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1488","company are being made only in"
"1489","accordance with authorizations of"
"1490","management and directors of the company;"
"1491","and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1492","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1493","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1494","of a company's assets that could have a"
"1495","material effect on the financial statements."
"1496","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1497","control over financial reporting may not"
"1498","prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"1499","projections of any evaluation of"
"1500","effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"1501","the risk that controls may become"
"1502","inadequate because of changes in"
"1503","conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"1504","with the policies or procedures may"
"1505","deteriorate."
"1506","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1507","reporting exists when the design or"
"1508","operation of a control does not allow"
"1509","management or employees, in the normal"
"1510","course of performing their assigned"
"1511","functions, to prevent or detect"
"1512","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"1513","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"1514","of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"1515","financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1516","reasonable possibility that a material"
"1517","misstatement of the company's annual or"
"1518","interim financial statements will not be"
"1519","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1520","Our consideration of the Trust's internal"
"1521","control over financial reporting was for the"
"1522","limited purpose described in the first"
"1523","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"1524","disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"1525","that might be material weaknesses under"
"1526","standards established by the Public"
"1527","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1528","(United States). However, we noted no"
"1529","deficiencies in the Trust's internal control"
"1530","over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1531","including controls over safeguarding"
"1532","securities that we consider to be a material"
"1533","weakness as defined above as of May 31,"
"1534","2019."
"1535","This report is intended solely for the"
"1536","information and use of management and the"
"1537","Board of Trustees of Deutsche DWS"

"1539","Exchange Commission and is not intended"
