"1046","Accounting Firm"
"1047","To the Board of Trustees and Holders of"
"1048","Beneficial Interest of Government Cash"
"1049","Management Portfolio:"
"1050","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"1051","financial statements of Government Cash"
"1052","Management Portfolio (the Fund), as of and"
"1053","for the year ended December 31, 2019, in"
"1054","accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1055","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1056","States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"1057","control over financial reporting, including"
"1058","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"1059","for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1060","purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1061","financial statements and to comply with the"
"1062","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the"
"1063","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1064","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"1065","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"1066","such opinion."
"1067","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"1068","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1069","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1070","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1071","management are required to assess the expected"
"1072","benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"1073","company's internal control over financial"
"1074","reporting is a process designed to provide"
"1075","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1076","financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1077","financial statements for external purposes in"
"1078","accordance with U.S. generally accepted"
"1079","accounting principles. A company's internal"
"1080","control over financial reporting includes those"
"1081","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1082","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1083","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1084","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"1085","provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"1086","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"1087","of financial statements in accordance with U.S."
"1088","generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1089","that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"1090","are being made only in accordance with"
"1091","authorizations of management and directors of"
"1092","the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1093","assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1094","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"1095","disposition of a company's assets that could"
"1096","have a material effect on the financial"
"1097","statements."
"1098","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1099","control over financial reporting may not prevent"
"1100","or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"1101","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1102","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1103","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"1104","that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"1105","or procedures may deteriorate."
"1106","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1107","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"1108","a control does not allow management or"
"1109","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1110","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1111","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
