"725","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"

"736","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"737","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"738","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"739","generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  A"
"740","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"741","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"

"758","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"759","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"760","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"761","the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"762","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"763","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"764","A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,"
"765","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
