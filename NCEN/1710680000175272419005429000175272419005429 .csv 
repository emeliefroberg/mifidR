"613","      The Trust hereby appoints the Adviser to act"

"620","      The Adviser, at its own expense, shall"
"621","furnish the following services and facilities to the"
"622","Fund:"
"623","      (a) Investment Program. The"
"624","Adviser shall (i) furnish continuously an"
"625","investment program for the Fund,"
"626","(ii) determine (subject to the overall"
"627","supervision and review of the Trust's Board"
"628","of Trustees) the investments to be"

"635","The Adviser also shall manage, supervise"
"636","and conduct the other affairs and business of"
"637","the Fund and matters incidental thereto"
"638","pursuant to a separate administration"
"639","agreement with the Trust, subject always to"
"640","the control of the Trust's Board of Trustees,"
"641","and to the provisions of the organizational"
"642","documents of the Trust, the Registration"
"643","Statement of the Trust with respect to the"
"644","Fund and its shares of beneficial interest"
"645","(Shares), including the Fund's Prospectus"
"646","and Statement of Additional Information,"
"647","and the 1940 Act, in each case as from time"
"648","to time amended and in effect. Subject to the"
"649","foregoing, the Adviser shall have the"
"650","authority to engage, terminate and replace"
"651","one or more sub-advisers in connection with"
"652","the portfolio management of the Fund,"
"653","which sub-advisers may be affiliates of the"
"654","Adviser; provided, however, that the"
"655","Adviser shall remain responsible to the Trust"
"656","with respect to its duties and obligations on"
"657","behalf of the Fund set forth in this"
"658","Agreement. The Adviser agrees to furnish"
"659","advice and recommendations to the Fund"
"660","and the Board with respect to the selection"
"661","and continued employment of any sub-"
"662","adviser(s) to provide investment advisory"
"663","services for the portion(s) of the Fund's"
"664","portfolio specified by the Adviser and on"
"665","terms and conditions, including but not"
"666","limited to the compensation payable to any"
"667","such sub-adviser(s), approved in the manner"
"668","provided by applicable law."
"669","      (b) Portfolio Transactions. The"
"670","Adviser shall place all orders for the"
"671","purchase and sale of portfolio securities for"
"672","the account of the Fund with brokers or"
"673","dealers selected by the Adviser, although the"
"674","Fund will pay the actual brokerage"
"675","commissions on portfolio transactions in"
"676","accordance with Section 3(d)."
"677","      In placing portfolio transactions for the"
"678","Fund, it is recognized that the Adviser will give"
"679","primary consideration to securing the most"
"680","favorable price and efficient execution. Consistent"
"681","with this policy, the Adviser may, to the extent"
"682","permitted by Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"683","Exchange Act of 1934, consider the financial"
"684","responsibility, research and investment information"
"685","and other services provided by brokers or dealers"
"686","who may effect or be a party to any such transaction"
"687","or other transactions to which other clients of the"
"688","Adviser may be a party. It is understood that neither"
"689","the Fund nor the Adviser has adopted a formula for"
"690","allocation of the Fund's investment transaction"
"691","business. It is also understood that it is desirable for"
"692","the Fund that the Adviser have access to"
"693","supplemental investment and market research and"
"694","security and economic analysis provided by brokers"
"695","who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher"
"696","cost to the Fund than would otherwise result when"
"697","allocating brokerage transactions to other brokers"
"698","on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and"
"699","efficient execution. Therefore, the Adviser is"
"700","authorized to place orders for the purchase and sale"
"701","of securities for the Fund with such brokers, subject"
"702","to review by the Trust's Board of Trustees from"
"703","time to time with respect to the extent and"
"704","continuation of this practice. It is understood that"
"705","the services provided by such brokers may be useful"
"706","or beneficial to the Adviser in connection with its"
"707","services to other clients."
"708","      On occasions when the Adviser deems the"
"709","purchase or sale of a security to be in the best"
"710","interest of the Fund as well as other clients, the"
"711","Adviser, to the extent permitted by applicable laws"
"712","and regulations, may, but shall be under no"
"713","obligation to, aggregate the securities to be so sold"
"714","or purchased in order to obtain the most favorable"
"715","price or lower brokerage commissions and efficient"
"716","execution. In such event, allocation of the securities"
"717","so purchased or sold, as well as the expenses"
"718","incurred in the transaction, will be made by the"
"719","Adviser in the manner it considers to be the most"
"720","equitable and consistent with its fiduciary"
"721","obligations to the Fund and to such other clients."
"722","      SECTION 3. Allocation of Expenses."
"723","      Except for the services and facilities to be"
"724","provided by the Adviser pursuant to a separate"
"725","administration agreement with the Trust, the Fund"
"726","assumes and shall pay all expenses for all other"
"727","Fund operations and activities, and shall reimburse"
"728","the Adviser for any such expenses incurred by the"
"729","Adviser. Unless the Prospectus or Statement of"
"730","Additional Information of the Fund provides"

"746","in Section 2);"
"747","      (c) the charges and expenses of"
"748","bookkeeping, accounting and auditors;"

"827","      SECTION 4. Advisory Fee."
"828","      In return for the services and facilities to be"
"829","provided to the Fund by the Adviser as provided in"
"830","Section 2 hereof, the Fund will pay the Adviser a"
"831","monthly fee, computed and accrued daily, based on"
"832","an annual rate set forth in Exhibit A hereto of the"
"833","Fund's Average Daily Managed Assets, so long"
"834","as the Adviser has not waived all or a portion of"
"835","such compensation. Average Daily Managed
Assets of the Fund shall mean the average daily"
"836","value of the total assets of the Fund, less all accrued"
"837","liabilities of the Fund (other than the aggregate"
"838","amount of any outstanding borrowings constituting"
"839","financial leverage). The Adviser may waive a"
"840","portion of its fees. If this Agreement becomes"
"841","effective subsequent to the first day of a month or"
"842","shall terminate before the last day of a month,"
"843","compensation for such month shall be computed in"
"844","a manner consistent with the calculation of the fees"
"845","payable on a monthly basis. Subject to the"
"846","provisions of Section 5 below, the accrued fees will"
"847","be payable monthly as promptly as possible after"
"848","the end of each month during which this Agreement"
"849","is in effect."
"850","      SECTION 5. Reimbursements."
"851","      The parties agree that they may negotiate"
"852","from time to time for the Adviser to reimburse"
"853","certain costs and expenses of the Fund. If such an"
"854","agreement is in effect, the determination of whether"
"855","reimbursement for such costs and expenses is due"
"856","the Fund from the Adviser will be made on an"
"857","accrual basis once monthly, and if it is so"
"858","determined that such reimbursement is due, the"
"859","accrued amount of such reimbursement that is due"
"860","shall serve as an offset to the investment advisory"
"861","fee payable monthly by the Fund to the Adviser"
"862","pursuant to Section 4 hereof, and the amount to be"
"863","paid by the Adviser to the Fund as soon as is"
"864","practicable at the end of a fiscal year of the Fund"
"865","shall be equal to the difference between the"
"866","aggregate reimbursement due the Fund from the"
"867","Adviser for that fiscal year and the aggregate offsets"
"868","made by the Fund against the aggregate investment"
"869","advisory fees payable to the Adviser pursuant to"
"870","Section 4 hereof for that fiscal year by virtue of"
"871","such aggregate reimbursement. The foregoing"
"872","limitation on reimbursement of costs and expenses"
"873","shall exclude distribution and service fees,"
"874","brokerage commissions, short sale dividend"
"875","expense, taxes, deferred organization expenses and"
"876","extraordinary expenses (as determined by the Board"
"877","of the Trustees of the Fund in the exercise of its"
"878","business judgment)."
"879","      SECTION 6. Indemnification."
"880","      (a) The Trust hereby agrees to"
"881","indemnify the Adviser and each of the Adviser's"
"882","partners, officers, employees, and agents (including"
"883","any individual who serves at the Adviser's request"
"884","as director, officer, partner, trustee or the like of"
"885","another corporation) and controlling persons (each"
"886","such person being an Indemnitee) against any"
"887","liabilities and expenses, including amounts paid in"
"888","satisfaction of judgments, in compromise or as fines"
"889","and penalties, and counsel fees (all as provided in"
"890","accordance with applicable state law) reasonably"
"891","incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with the"
"892","defense or disposition of any action, suit or other"
"893","proceeding, whether civil or criminal, before any"
"894","court or administrative or investigative body in"
"895","which he may be or may have been involved as a"
"896","party or otherwise or with which he may be or may"
"897","have been threatened, while acting in any capacity"
"898","set forth above in this paragraph or thereafter by"
"899","reason of his having acted in any such capacity,"
"900","except with respect to any matter as to which he"
"901","shall have been adjudicated not to have acted in"
"902","good faith in the reasonable belief that his action"
"903","was in the best interest of the Trust and furthermore,"
"904","in the case of any criminal proceeding, so long as he"
"905","had no reasonable cause to believe that the conduct"
"906","was unlawful, provided, however, that (1) no"
"907","Indemnitee shall be indemnified hereunder against"
"908","any liability to the Trust or its shareholders or any"
"909","expense of such Indemnitee arising by reason of"
"910","(i) willful misfeasance, (ii) bad faith, (iii) gross"
"911","negligence (iv) reckless disregard of the duties"
"912","involved in the conduct of his position (the conduct"
"913","referred to in such clauses (i) through (iv) being"
"914","sometimes referred to herein as Disabling
Conduct), (2) as to any matter disposed of by"
"915","settlement or a compromise payment by such"
"916","Indemnitee, pursuant to a consent decree or"
"917","otherwise, no indemnification either for said"
"918","payment or for any other expenses shall be provided"
"919","unless there has been a determination that such"
"920","settlement or compromise is in the best interests of"
"921","the Trust and that such Indemnitee appears to have"
"922","acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that his"
"923","action was in the best interests of the Trust and did"
"924","not involve Disabling Conduct by such Indemnitee"
"925","and (3) with respect to any action, suit or other"
"926","proceeding voluntarily prosecuted by any"
"927","Indemnitee as plaintiff, indemnification shall be"
"928","mandatory only if the prosecution of such action,"
"929","suit or other proceeding by such Indemnitee was"
"930","authorized by a majority of the full Board of"
"931","Trustees of the Trust. Notwithstanding the"
"932","foregoing, the Trust shall not be obligated to"
"933","provide any such indemnification to the extent such"
"934","provision would waive any right that the Trust"
"935","cannot lawfully waive."
"936","      (b) The Trust shall make advance"
"937","payments in connection with the expenses of"
"938","defending any action with respect to which"
"939","indemnification might be sought hereunder if the"
"940","Trust receives a written affirmation of the"
"941","Indemnitee's good faith belief that the standard of"
"942","conduct necessary for indemnification has been met"
"943","and a written undertaking to reimburse the Trust"
"944","unless it is subsequently determined that he is"
"945","entitled to such indemnification and if the Trustees"
"946","of the Trust determine that the facts then known to"
"947","them would not preclude indemnification. In"
"948","addition, at least one of the following conditions"
"949","must be met: (1) the Indemnitee shall provide"
"950","adequate security for his undertaking, (2) the Trust"
"951","shall be insured against losses arising by reason of"
"952","any lawful advances, or (3) a majority of a quorum"
"953","of Trustees of the Trust who are neither interested
persons of the Trust (as defined in Section 2(a)(19)"
"954","of the 1940 Act) nor parties to the proceeding"
"955","(Disinterested Non-Party Trustees) or an"
"956","independent legal counsel in a written opinion, shall"
"957","determine, based on a review of readily available"
"958","facts (as opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), that"
"959","there is reason to believe that the Indemnitee"
"960","ultimately will be found entitled to indemnification."
"961","      (c) All determinations with respect to"
"962","indemnification hereunder shall be made (1) by a"
"963","final decision on the merits by a court or other body"
"964","of competent jurisdiction before whom the"
"965","proceeding was brought that such Indemnitee is not"
"966","liable by reason of Disabling Conduct or, (2) in the"
"967","absence of such a decision, by (i) a majority vote of"
"968","a quorum of the Disinterested Non-Party Trustees"
"969","of the Trust, or (ii) if such a quorum is not"
"970","obtainable or even if obtainable, if a majority vote"
"971","of such quorum so directs, independent legal"
"972","counsel in a written opinion."
"973","      (d) Each Indemnitee shall, in the"
"974","performance of its duties, be fully and completely"
"975","justified and protected with regard to any act or any"
"976","failure to act resulting from reliance in good faith"
"977","upon the books of account or other records of the"
"978","Trust, upon an opinion of counsel, or upon reports"
"979","made to the Trust by any of the Trust's officers or"
"980","employees or by any advisor, administrator,"
"981","manager, distributor, selected dealer, accountant,"
"982","appraiser or other expert or consultant selected with"
"983","reasonable care by the Trustees, officers or"
"984","employees of the Trust, regardless of whether such"
"985","counsel or other person may also be a Trustee."
"986","      (e) The rights accruing to any"
"987","Indemnitee under these provisions shall not exclude"
"988","any other right to which he may be lawfully"
"989","entitled."
"990","      SECTION 7. Relations with the Fund."
"991","      Subject to and in accordance with the"
"992","organizational documents of the Adviser and the"
"993","Trust, as well as their policies and procedures and"
"994","codes of ethics, it is understood that Trustees,"
"995","officers, agents and shareholders of the Fund are or"
"996","may be interested in the Adviser (or any successor"
"997","thereof) as directors, officers or otherwise, that"
"998","partners, officers and agents of the Adviser (or any"
"999","successor thereof) are or may be interested in the"
"1000","Fund as Trustees, officers, agents, shareholders or"
"1001","otherwise, and that the Adviser (or any such"
"1002","successor thereof) is or may be interested in the"
"1003","Fund as a shareholder or otherwise."
"1004","      SECTION 8. Liability of Adviser."
"1005","      The Adviser shall not be liable to the Fund"
"1006","for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for"
"1007","any loss suffered by the Fund in connection with the"
"1008","matters to which this Agreement relates; provided,"
"1009","however, that no provision of this Agreement shall"
"1010","be deemed to protect the Adviser against any"
"1011","liability to the Fund or its shareholders to which it"
"1012","might otherwise be subject by reason of any"
"1013","Disabling Conduct nor shall any provision hereof be"
"1014","deemed to protect any trustee or officer of the Fund"
"1015","against any such liability to which he might"
"1016","otherwise be subject by reason of any Disabling"
"1017","Conduct."
"1018","      SECTION 9. Duration and Termination of"
"1019","this Agreement."
"1020","      (a) Duration. This Agreement shall"
"1021","become effective on the date first set forth above,"
"1022","such date being the date on which this Agreement"
"1023","has been executed following: (1) the approval of the"
"1024","Trust's Board of Trustees, including approval by a"
"1025","vote of a majority of the Trustees who are not"
"1026","interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of"

"1028","called for the purpose of voting on such approval;"

"1072","hereunder are not to be deemed exclusive, and the"
"1073","Adviser (and its affiliates) shall be free to render"
"1074","similar services to others so long as its services"
"1075","hereunder are not impaired thereby; provided,"
"1076","however, that the Adviser will undertake no"
"1077","activities that, in its reasonable good faith judgment,"
"1078","will adversely affect the performance of its"
"1079","obligations under this Agreement. In addition, the"
"1080","parties may enter into other agreements pursuant to"
"1081","which the Adviser provides administrative or other,"
"1082","non-investment advisory services to the Fund, and"
"1083","the Adviser may be compensated for such other"
"1084","services."

"1089","address as such other party may designate from time"
"1090","to time for the receipt of such notices. Until further"

"1096","      This Agreement shall be construed in"
"1097","accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware"
"1098","and the applicable provisions of the 1940 Act. To"
"1099","the extent that applicable law of the State of"
"1100","Delaware, or any of the provisions herein, conflict"
"1101","with applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, the"
"1102","latter shall control. If any provision of this"
"1103","Agreement shall be held or made invalid by a court"
"1104","decision, statute, rule or otherwise, the remainder of"
"1105","this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. This"
"1106","Agreement may be executed in any number of"
"1107","counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be"
"1108","an original, but such counterparts shall, together,"
"1109","constitute only one instrument."
"1110","      SECTION 13. Use of the Name Highland."
"1111","      The Adviser has consented to the use by the"
"1112","Trust of the name or identifying word Highland in"

"1126","any change of its membership (which shall mean its"
"1127","general partner) within a reasonable time after such"
"1128","change. If the Adviser enters into a definitive"
"1129","agreement that would result in a change of control"
"1130","(within the meaning of the 1940 Act) of the"
"1131","Adviser, it agrees to give the Fund the lesser of"
"1132","60 days' written notice and such notice as is"
"1133","reasonably practicable before consummating the"

"1329","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"1330","Firm"
"1331","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"1332","Highland Floating Rate Opportunities Fund:"
"1333","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1334","statements of the Highland Floating Rate Opportunities"
"1335","Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year ended June 30,"
"1336","2018, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1337","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"1338","we considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1339","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1340","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1341","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"1342","on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1343","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"1344","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"1345","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"1346","we express no such opinion."
"1347","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"1348","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1349","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1350","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1351","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"1352","company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1353","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1354","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1355","preparation of financial statements for external"
"1356","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1357","accounting principles (GAAP). A company's internal"
"1358","control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"1359","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1360","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1361","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"1362","the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1363","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1364","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"1365","GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1366","company are being made only in accordance with"
"1367","authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"1368","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1369","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1370","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the"
"1371","company's assets that could have a material effect on"
"1372","the financial statements."
"1373","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1374","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1375","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1376","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"1377","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"1378","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"1379","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1380","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1381","exists when the design or operation of a control does"
"1382","not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"1383","course of performing their assigned functions, to"
"1384","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"1385","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1386","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1387","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1388","material misstatement of a company's annual or interim"
"1389","financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"1390","on a timely basis."
"1391","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"1392","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1393","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1394","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"1395","that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"1396","established by the Public Company Accounting"
"1397","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"1398","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1399","reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"1400","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"1401","material weakness as defined above as of June 30,"
"1402","2018."
"1403","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"1404","use of management and the Board of Trustees of"
"1405","Highland Floating Rate Opportunities Fund and the"
