"6485","of and for the year ended April 30, 2019, in accordance"
"6486","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"6487"," (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Funds' internal control"

"6490"," the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"

"6511","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"6512"," principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"6513","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"

"6515","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"6516","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"

"6518","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"

"6523","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"6524","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"

"6526","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"6527","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"6528"," misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness"
"6529","is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"6530"," control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"6531"," possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual"
"6532","or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"6533","on a timely basis."
"6534","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"6535","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"6536","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"6537","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"6538","standards established by the PCAOB. However, we noted no deficiencies"
"6539"," in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and"
"6540"," its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"6541","that we consider to be a material weakness as defined"
