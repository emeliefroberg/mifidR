"5139","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"5140","and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles."
"5141","A company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"5142","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"5143","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"

"5145","with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"

"5155","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that"

"5198","<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>SBL Fund has been named as a defendant and"
"5199","a putative member of the proposed defendant class of shareholders in the case entitled <I>Kirschner v. FitzSimons</I>, No. 12-2652"
"5200","(S.D.N.Y.) (formerly <I>Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Tribune Co. v. FitzSimons</I>, Adv. Pro. No. 10-54010 (Bankr."
"5201","D. Del.)) (the &ldquo;<I>FitzSimons</I> action&rdquo;), as a result of ownership by certain series of the SBL Fund of shares in"
"5202","the Tribune Company (&ldquo;Tribune&rdquo;) in 2007, when Tribune effected a leveraged buyout transaction (&ldquo;LBO&rdquo;) by"
"5203","which Tribune converted to a privately-held company. In his complaint, the plaintiff has alleged that, in connection with the LBO,"
"5204","Tribune insiders and shareholders were overpaid for their Tribune stock using financing that the insiders knew would, and ultimately"
"5205","did, leave Tribune insolvent. The plaintiff has asserted claims against certain insiders, major shareholders, professional advisers,"
"5206","and others involved in the LBO. The plaintiff is also attempting to obtain from former Tribune shareholders, including the SBL"
"5207","Fund, the proceeds they received in connection with the LBO.</P>"

"5209","<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>In June 2011, a group of Tribune creditors"
"5210","filed multiple actions against former Tribune shareholders involving state law constructive fraudulent conveyance claims arising"
"5211","out of the 2007 LBO (the &ldquo;SLCFC actions&rdquo;). SBL Fund has been named as a defendant in two of the SLCFC actions: <I>Deutsche"
"5212","Bank Trust Co. Americas v. Ohlson Enter.</I>, No. 12-0064 (S.D.N.Y.) and <I>Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Americas v. Cantor Fitzgerald"
"5213","&amp; Co.</I>, No. 11-4900 (S.D.N.Y.). In those actions, the creditors seek to recover from Tribune&rsquo;s former shareholders"

"5220","<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>On September 23, 2013, the District Court granted"
"5221","the defendants&rsquo; omnibus motion to dismiss the SLCFC actions, on the basis that the creditors lacked standing. On September"
"5222","30, 2013, the creditors filed a notice of appeal of the September 23 order. On October 28, 2013, the defendants filed a joint notice"
"5223","of cross-appeal of that same order. On March 29, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued its opinion on the"
"5224","appeal of the SLCFC actions. The appeals court affirmed the district court&rsquo;s dismissal of those lawsuits, but on different"
"5225","grounds than the district court. The appeals court held that while the plaintiffs have standing under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,"
"5226","their claims were preempted by Section 546(e) of the Bankruptcy Code&mdash;the statutory safe harbor for settlement payments. On"
"5227","April 12, 2016, the Plaintiffs in the SLCFC actions filed a petition seeking rehearing <I>en banc</I> before the appeals court."
"5228","On July 22, 2016, the appeals court denied the petition. On September 9, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari"
"5229","in the U.S. Supreme Court challenging the Second Circuit&rsquo;s decision that the safe harbor of Section 546(e) applied to their"
"5230","claims. The shareholder defendants, including the Funds, filed a joint brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari on October"
"5231","24, 2016. On April 3, 2018, Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas issued a &ldquo;Statement&rdquo; related to the petition for certiorari"
"5232","suggesting that the Second Circuit and/or District Court may want to take steps to reexamine the application of the Section 546(e)"
"5233","safe harbor to the previously dismissed state law constructive fraudulent transfer claims based on the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision"
"5234","in <I>Merit Management Group LP v. FTI Consulting, Inc</I>. On April 10, 2018, plaintiffs filed in the Second Circuit a motion"
"5235","for that court to recall its mandate, vacate its prior decision, and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent"
"5236","with <I>Merit Management</I>. On April 20, 2018, the shareholder defendants filed a response to plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to recall"
"5237","the mandate. On May 15, 2018, the Second Circuit issued an order recalling the mandate &ldquo;in anticipation of further panel"
"5238","review.&rdquo; On December 19, 2019, the Second Circuit issued an amended opinion that again affirmed the district court&rsquo;s"
"5239","ruling on the basis that plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were preempted by Section 546(e) of the Bankruptcy Code. Plaintiffs filed a motion"
"5240","for rehearing and rehearing <I>en banc </I>on January 2, 2020.</P>"

"5248","to dismiss the <I>FitzSimons</I> action, including a global motion to dismiss Count I, which is the claim brought against former"
"5249","Tribune shareholders for intentional fraudulent conveyance under U.S. federal law. On January 6, 2017, the United States District"
"5250","Court for the Southern District of New York granted the shareholder defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss the intentional fraudulent"
"5251","conveyance claim in the <I>FitzSimons</I> action. The Court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to allege that Tribune entered"
"5252","the LBO with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud its creditors, and therefore the complaint failed to state a claim. In"
"5253","dismissing the intentional fraudulent conveyance claim, the Court denied the plaintiff&rsquo;s request to amend the complaint."
"5254","The plaintiff requested that the Court direct entry of a final judgment in order to make the order immediately appealable. On February"
"5255","23, 2017, the Court issued an order stating that it intended to permit an interlocutory appeal of the dismissal order, but would"
"5256","wait to do so until it has resolved outstanding motions to dismiss filed by other defendants.</P>"

"5260","defendants opposed that request. On August 24, 2017, the Court denied the plaintiff&rsquo;s request without prejudice to renewal"
"5261","of the request in the event of an intervening change in the law. On March 8, 2018, the plaintiff renewed his request for leave"
"5262","to file a motion to amend the complaint to assert a constructive fraudulent transfer claim based on the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling"
"5263","in <I>Merit Management Group LP v. FTI Consulting, Inc. </I>The shareholder defendants opposed that request. On June 18, 2018 the"

"5266","<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>On December 18, 2018, plaintiff filed a letter"

"5268","and indicating plaintiff&rsquo;s intention to file another motion to amend the complaint to reinstate claims for intentional fraudulent"
"5269","transfer. The shareholder defendants opposed that request. On January 14, 2019, the court held a case management conference, during"
"5270","which the court stated that it would not lift the stay prior to further action from the Second Circuit in the SLCFC actions. The"
"5271","court further stated that it would allow the plaintiff to file a motion to amend to try to reinstate its intentional fraudulent"
"5272","transfer claim. The plaintiff has not yet filed any such motion. On January 23, 2019, the court ordered the parties still facing"
"5273","pending claims to participate in a mediation, to commence on January 28, 2019. The mediation did not result in a settlement of"
"5274","the claims against the shareholder defendants.</P>"
