"1482","period ended December 31, 2019, in accordance with the standards"
"1483","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"1484","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1485","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"1486","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1487","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"1488","with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"1489","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"1490","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no"

"1492","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"1493","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1494","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"

"1497","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1498","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1499","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1500","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles"
"1501","(GAAP).  A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"1502","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1503","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"1504","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1505","assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1506","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"1507","of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that"

"1513","material effect on the financial statements."
"1514","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"

"1516","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"

"1518","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"1519","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1520","deteriorate."
"1521","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1522","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1523","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1524","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1525","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"

"1529","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be"
