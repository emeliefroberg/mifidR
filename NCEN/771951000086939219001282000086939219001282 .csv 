"1204","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"1205","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1206","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"1207","Form NCEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1208","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"1209","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds"
