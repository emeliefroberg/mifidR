"4011","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"4012","Accounting Firm"
"4013","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of the"
"4014","Guardian Variable Products Trust"
"4015","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"4016","statements of the funds listed in Appendix I of Guardian"
"4017","Variable Products Trust (the Funds) as of and for the"
"4018","year ended December 31, 2018 in accordance with the"
"4019","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"4020","Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the"
"4021","Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"4022","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"4023","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"4024","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"4025","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"4026","N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"4027","on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"4028","financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an"
"4029","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"4030","control over financial reporting."
"4031","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"4032","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"4033","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"4034","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"4035","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"4036","A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"4037","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"4038","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"4039","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"4040","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"4041","principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"4042","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"4043","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"4044","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"4045","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"4046","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"4047","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"4048","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"4049","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"4050","company are being made only in accordance with"
"4051","authorizations of management and directors of the"
"4052","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"4053","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"4054","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"4055","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"4056","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"

"4063","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
