"3161","ARTICLE III SHARES"
"3162","Section 1.	Division of Beneficial Interest."
"3163","(a)	The beneficial interest in the Trust shall be divided"
"3164"," into Shares, each Share without a par value.  The number of"
"3165"," Shares in the Trust authorized hereunder, and of each Series"
"3166"," and Class as may be established from time to time, is"
"3167","unlimited.  The Board of Trustees may authorize the"
"3168"," division of Shares into separate Classes of Shares"
"3169"," and into separate and distinct Series of Shares and"
"3170"," the division of any Series into separate Classes of"
"3171"," Shares in accordance with the 1940 Act.  The different"
"3172"," Series and Classes shall be established and designated"
"3173"," pursuant to Article III, Section 6 hereof.  If no separate"
"3174"," Series or Classes of Series shall be established, the Shares"
"3175"," shall have the rights, powers and duties provided for herein"
"3176"," and in Article III, Section 6 hereof to the extent relevant"
"3177","and not otherwise provided for herein, and all references to"
"3178"," Series and Classes shall be construed (as the context may require)"
"3179"," to refer to the Trust."
"3180","(i)	The fact that the Trust shall have one or more"
"3181","established and designated Classes of the Trust, shall"
"3182","not limit the authority of the Board of Trustees to"
"3183","establish and designate additional Classes of the Trust."
"3184","  The fact that one or more Classes of the Trust shall"
"3185","have initially been established and designated without"
"3186","any specific establishment or designation of a Series"
"3187","(i.e., that all Shares of the Trust are initially"
"3188"," Shares of one or more Classes) shall not limit the"
"3189"," authority of the Board of Trustees to later"
"3190"," establish and designate a Series and establish"
"3191"," and designate the Class or Classes of the Trust"
"3192"," as Class or Classes, respectively, of such Series."
"3193","(ii)	The fact that a Series shall have initially"
"3194","been established and designated without any specific"
"3195","establishment or designation of Classes (i.e., that"
"3196","all Shares of such Series are initially of a single"
"3197","Class) shall not limit the authority of the Board of"
"3198","Trustees to establish and designate separate Classes"
"3199"," of said Series.  The fact that a Series shall have"
"3200","more than one established and designated Class,"
"3201","shall not limit the authority of the Board of"
"3202","Trustees to establish and designate additional"
"3203"," Classes of said Series."
"3204","(b)	The Board of Trustees shall have the"
"3205","power to issue authorized, but unissued Shares"
"3206","of the Trust, or any Series and Class thereof,"
"3207"," from time to time for such consideration paid"
"3208","wholly or partly in cash, securities or other"
"3209"," property, as may be determined from time to time"
"3210"," by the Board of Trustees, subject to any requirements"
"3211"," or limitations of the"
"3212","1940 Act.  The Board of Trustees, on behalf of the"
"3213","Trust, may acquire and hold as treasury shares,"
"3214","reissue for such consideration and on such terms"
"3215","as it may determine, or cancel, at its discretion"
"3216","from time to time, any Shares reacquired by the Trust."
"3217"," The Board of Trustees may classify, reclassify or"
"3218","convert any unissued Shares or any Shares of the Trust"
"3219","or any Series or Class thereof, that were previously"
"3220","issued and are reacquired, into one or more Series or"
"3221","Classes that may be established and designated from time"
"3222"," to time and, in connection therewith, cause"
"3223","some or all of the Shareholders of the Trust, such"
"3224","Series or Class to become Shareholders of such other"
"3225","Series or Class.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the"
"3226","Trust and any Series thereof may acquire, hold, sell"
"3227","and otherwise deal in, for purposes of investment or"
"3228"," otherwise, the Shares of any other Series of the"
"3229","Trust or Shares of the Trust, and such Shares shall"
"3230"," not be deemed treasury shares or cancelled."
"3231","(c)	Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of"
"3232","this Article III, each Share shall entitle the holder"
"3233"," to voting rights as provided in Article V hereof."
"3234"," Shareholders shall have no preemptive or other right"
"3235","to subscribe for new or additional authorized, but"
"3236","unissued Shares or other securities issued by the"
"3237","Trust or any Series thereof.  The Board of Trustees"
"3238"," may from time to time divide or combine the Shares"
"3239"," of the Trust or any particular Series thereof into"
"3240","a greater or lesser number of Shares of the Trust or"
"3241"," that Series, respectively.  Such division or"
"3242","combination shall not materially change the proportionate"
"3243"," beneficial interests of the holders of Shares of the"
"3244","Trust or that Series, as the case may be, in the Trust"
"3245","Property at the time of such division or combination"
"3246","that is held with respect to the Trust or that Series,"
"3247"," as the case may be."
"3248","(d)	Any Trustee, officer or other agent of the"
"3249","Trust, and any organization in which any such Person"
"3250"," has an economic or other interest, may acquire, own,"
"3251"," hold and dispose of Shares in the Trust or any Series"
"3252"," and Class thereof, whether such Shares are authorized"
"3253"," but unissued, or already outstanding, to the same extent"
"3254"," as if such Person were not a Trustee, officer or other"
"3255"," agent of the Trust; and the Trust or any Series may"
"3256"," issue and sell and may purchase such Shares from any"
"3257"," such Person or any such organization, subject to the"
"3258"," limitations, restrictions or other provisions"
"3259","applicable to the sale or purchase of such Shares"
"3260"," herein and the 1940 Act."

"3262","Shares shall be recorded on the books of the Trust kept"
"3263"," by the Trust or by a transfer or similar agent for the"
"3264"," Trust, which books shall be maintained separately for"
"3265"," the Shares of the Trust and each Series and each Class"
"3266"," thereof that has been established and designated.  No"
"3267","certificates certifying the ownership of Shares shall be"
"3268"," issued except as the Board of Trustees may otherwise"
"3269","determine from time to time.  The"
"3270","Board of Trustees may make such rules not inconsistent"
"3271"," with the provisions of the 1940 Act as it considers"
"3272","appropriate for the issuance of Share certificates,"
"3273","the transfer of Shares of the Trust and each Series"
"3274","and Class thereof, if any, and similar matters.  The"
"3275"," record books of the Trust as kept by the Trust or"
"3276","any transfer or similar agent, as the case may be,"
"3277","shall be conclusive as to who"
"3278","are the Shareholders of the Trust and each Series"
"3279","and Class thereof and as to the number of Shares of"
"3280"," the Trust and each Series and Class thereof held"
"3281","from time to time by each such Shareholder."
"3282","Section 3.	Sale of Shares.  Subject to the 1940"
"3283","Act and applicable law, the Trust may sell its authorized"
"3284"," but unissued Shares to such Persons, at such times, on"
"3285","such terms, and for such consideration as the Board of"
"3286","Trustees may from time to time authorize.  Each sale shall"
"3287"," be credited to the individual purchaser's account in the"
"3288","form of full or fractional Shares of the Trust or such Series"
"3289"," thereof (and Class thereof, if any), as the purchaser may"
"3290","select, at the net asset value per Share, subject to Section"
"3291"," 22 of the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations adopted"
"3292","thereunder; provided, however, that the Board of Trustees may,"
"3293"," in its sole discretion, permit the Principal Underwriter to"
"3294"," impose a sales charge upon any such sale.  Every Shareholder"
"3295"," by virtue of having become a Shareholder shall be bound by"
"3296"," the terms of this Declaration of Trust."
"3297","Ownership of Shares shall not make any Shareholder a third-party"
"3298"," beneficiary of any contract entered into by the Trust or"
"3299"," any Series."

"3301","Liability.  Shares shall be deemed to be personal property"
"3302"," giving to Shareholders only the rights provided in this"
"3303"," Declaration of Trust, the By-Laws, and under applicable law."
"3304","  Ownership of Shares shall not entitle the Shareholder to"
"3305","any title in or to the whole or any part of the Trust Property"

"3310"," bankruptcy of a Shareholder during the existence of the Trust"
"3311"," and any Series thereof shall not operate to dissolve the Trust"
"3312"," or any such Series, nor entitle the representative of any deceased,"
"3313"," incapacitated, dissolved, terminated or bankrupt Shareholder to an"
"3314","accounting or to take any action in court or elsewhere against the"
"3315","Trust, the Trustees or any such Series, but entitles such"
"3316","representative"
"3317"," only to the rights of said deceased, incapacitated, dissolved,"
"3318","terminated or bankrupt Shareholder under this Declaration of"
"3319","Trust.  Neither the Trust nor the Trustees, nor any officer,"
"3320"," employee or agent of the Trust, shall have any power to bind"
"3321","personally any Shareholder, nor, except as specifically"
"3322","provided herein, to call upon any Shareholder for the payment"
"3323"," of any sum of money other than such as the Shareholder may"
"3324","at any time personally agree to pay.  Each Share, when issued"
"3325"," on the terms determined by the Board of Trustees, shall be"
"3326"," fully paid and nonassessable.  As provided in the DSTA,"
"3327","Shareholders shall be entitled to the same limitation of"
"3328"," personal liability as that extended to stockholders of"
"3329","a private corporation organized for profit under the General"
"3330"," Corporation Law of the State of Delaware."
"3331","Section 5.	Power of Board of Trustees to Make Tax"
"3332","Status Election.  The Board of Trustees shall have the"

"3338"," and Classes.  The establishment and designation of any"
"3339","Series or Class shall be effective, without the requirement"
"3340"," of Shareholder approval, upon the adoption of a resolution"
"3341"," by not less than a majority of the then Board of Trustees,"
"3342","which resolution shall set forth such establishment and"

"3346","including any registration statement of the Trust and any"
"3347","amendment of this Declaration of Trust, and may provide,"
"3348","to the extent permitted by the DSTA, for rights, powers"
"3349","and duties of such Series or Class (including variations"
"3350"," in the relative rights and preferences as between the"

"3367","from any other Class of the Series.  As appropriate, in a manner"
"3368"," determined by the Board of Trustees, the liabilities belonging"
"3369","to any such Class shall be held and accounted for separately from"
"3370"," the liabilities of the Trust, the Series or any other Class and"

"3384"," Series, together with all assets in which such consideration is"
"3385"," invested or reinvested, all income, earnings, profits, and"
"3386","proceeds thereof from whatever source derived, including,"

"3398"," derived from any reinvestment of such proceeds, in whatever"
"3399","form the same may be, are herein referred to as assets held
 with respect to that Series.  In the event that there are"
"3400","any assets, income, earnings, profits and proceeds thereof,"
"3401"," funds or payments"
"3402","which are not readily identifiable as assets held with respect"
"3403"," to any particular Series (collectively General Assets),"
"3404","the Board of Trustees, or an appropriate officer as determined"
"3405"," by the Board of Trustees, shall allocate such General Assets to"

"3412"," of all Series for all purposes."
"3413","(b)	Liabilities Held with Respect to a Particular"
"3414","Series or"
"3415"," Class.  The assets of the Trust held with respect to"

"3428"," which are not readily identifiable as being liabilities held"
"3429","with respect to any particular Series (collectively"

"3440","Persons who have extended credit that has been allocated to a"
"3441"," particular Series, or who have a"
"3442","claim or contract that has been allocated to any particular"
"3443","Series, shall look exclusively to the assets of that particular"
"3444"," Series for payment of such credit, claim, or contract.  In the"
"3445"," absence of"
"3446","an express contractual agreement so limiting the claims of such"
"3447","creditors, claimants and contract providers, each creditor,"
"3448","claimant and contract provider shall be deemed nevertheless to"
"3449","have impliedly agreed to such limitation."
"3450","Subject to the right of the Board of Trustees in its discretion"
"3451"," to allocate General"
"3452","Liabilities as provided herein, the debts, liabilities,"
"3453","obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise"
"3454","existing with respect to a particular Series, whether such Series"
"3455"," is now authorized and existing pursuant to this Declaration of"
"3456"," Trust or is hereafter authorized and existing pursuant to this"
"3457"," Declaration of Trust, shall be enforceable against the assets"
"3458","held with respect to that Series only, and not against the assets"
"3459"," of any other Series or the Trust generally and none of the debts,"

"3464"," this limitation on liabilities between and among Series shall"
"3465"," be set forth in the Certificate of Trust pursuant to the DSTA,"
"3466"," and upon"
"3467","the giving of such notice in the Certificate of Trust, the"
"3468","statutory provisions of Section 3804 of the DSTA relating to"
"3469"," limitations on liabilities between and among Series (and the"
"3470"," statutory effect under Section 3804 of setting forth such"
"3471","notice in the Certificate of Trust) shall become applicable"
"3472"," to the Trust and each Series."
"3473","Liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges, reserves"
"3474","and expenses related to the distribution of, and other"
"3475","identified expenses that should or may properly be allocated"
"3476"," to, the Shares of a particular Class may be charged to and"
"3477"," borne solely by such Class.  The bearing of expenses solely"
"3478"," by a particular Class of Shares may be appropriately reflected"
"3479"," (in a manner determined by the Board of Trustees) and may"
"3480","affect the net asset value attributable to, and the dividend,"
"3481"," redemption and liquidation rights of, such Class.  Each"
"3482","allocation of liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges,"
"3483"," reserves and expenses by or under the direction of the Board"
"3484"," of Trustees shall be conclusive and binding upon the"
"3485","Shareholders of all Classes for all purposes. All Persons"
"3486"," who have extended credit that has been allocated to a"
"3487","particular Class, or who have a claim or contract that"
"3488","has been allocated to any particular Class, shall look,"
"3489","and may be required by contract to look, exclusively to"

"3496"," any distribution paid upon dissolution of the Trust or of"
"3497","any Series with respect to, nor any redemption of, the Shares"

"3499"," the Trust other than from the assets held with respect to"
"3500"," such Series, nor, except as specifically provided in Section 7"
"3501"," of this Article III, shall any Shareholder of any particular"
"3502","Series otherwise have any right or claim against the assets"
"3503","held with respect to any other Series or the Trust generally"
"3504"," except, in the case of a right or claim against the assets"
"3505"," held with respect to any other Series, to the extent that"
"3506","such Shareholder has such a right or claim hereunder as a"
"3507","Shareholder of such other Series.  The Board of Trustees"
"3508"," shall have full discretion, to the extent not inconsistent"
"3509"," with the 1940 Act, to determine which items shall be treated"
"3510"," as income and which items as capital; and each such determination"
"3511"," and allocation shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders."
"3512","(d)	Voting.  All Shares of the Trust entitled to vote on a matter"
"3513"," shall vote in the aggregate without differentiation between the Shares"
"3514"," of the separate Series, if any, or"
"3515","separate Classes, if any; provided that (i) with respect to any matter"
"3516"," that affects only the interests of some but not all Series, then only"
"3517"," the Shares of such affected Series, voting separately, shall"
"3518","be entitled to vote on the matter, (ii) with respect to any matter that"
"3519"," affects only the interests of some but not all Classes, then only the"
"3520"," Shares of such affected Classes, voting separately, shall be entitled"
"3521"," to vote on the matter; and (iii) notwithstanding the foregoing, with"
"3522","respect to any matter as to which the 1940 Act or other applicable law"
"3523","or regulation requires voting, by Series or by Class, then the Shares"
"3524","of the Trust shall vote as prescribed in such law or regulation."
"3525","(e)	Equality.  Each Share of any particular Series shall be equal"
"3526"," to each other Share of such Series (subject to the rights and"
"3527","preferences with respect to separate Classes of such Series)."
"3528","(f)	Fractions.  A fractional Share of the Trust or a Series shall"
"3529"," carry proportionately all the rights and obligations of a whole Share"
"3530","of the Trust or such Series, including rights with respect to voting,"
"3531","receipt of dividends and distributions, redemption of Shares and"
"3532","dissolution of the Trust or that Series."
"3533","(g)	Exchange Privilege.  The Board of Trustees shall have the"
"3534"," authority to provide that the holders of Shares of any Series shall"
"3535"," have the right to exchange said Shares for Shares of one or more"
"3536","other Series in accordance with such requirements and procedures as"
"3537"," may be established by the Board of Trustees, and in accordance with"
"3538"," the 1940 Act."
"3539","(h)	Combination of Series or Classes."
"3540","(i)	The Board of Trustees shall have the authority, without the"
"3541","approval, vote or consent of the Shareholders of any Series, unless"
"3542"," otherwise required by applicable law, to combine the assets and"
"3543","liabilities held with respect to any two or more Series into assets"
"3544"," and liabilities held with respect to a single Series; provided that"
"3545"," upon completion of such combination of Series, the interest of"
"3546","each Shareholder, in the combined assets and liabilities held with"
"3547"," respect to the combined Series shall equal the interest of each"
"3548"," such Shareholder in the aggregate of the assets and liabilities"
"3549","held with respect to the Series that were combined."
"3550","(ii)	The Board of Trustees shall have the authority, without"
"3551","the approval, vote or consent of the Shareholders of any Series or"

"4907"," Trustees, and without a Shareholder vote, may cause the Trust"
"4908"," or any one or more Series to convert to a master feeder"
"4909"," structure (a structure in which a feeder fund invests all"

"4911"," in securities directly) and thereby cause existing Series"
"4912"," of the Trust to either become feeders in a master fund, or"
"4913"," to become master funds in which other funds are feeders."
"4914","Section 4.	Absence of Appraisal or Dissenters' Rights."

"5017","with the advice of counsel, that any of such provisions is"
"5018"," in conflict with the 1940 Act, the Code, the DSTA, or with"

"5114","SUPPLEMENT DATED JUNE 8, 2018"
"5115","TO THE CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE PROSPECTUS"
"5116","OF EACH OF THE FUNDS LISTED BELOW"
"5117","Templeton Global Investment Trust"
"5118","Templeton Emerging Markets Balanced"
"5119","Fund"
"5120","Templeton Global Balanced Fund"
"5121","Notice of Automatic Conversion of Class C Shares to Class A"
"5122"," Shares after 10-Year Holding Period"
"5123","At Board meetings held on February 26 and 27, 2018, the Board"
"5124","of Trustees approved an automatic conversion feature for the"
"5125","Fund's Class C shares (which includes Class C1 shares as"
"5126"," applicable) that will automatically convert shareholders'"
"5127"," Class C shares into Class A shares of the same Fund after"
"5128","they have been held for 10 years. After conversion, your"
"5129","new shares will be subject to Class A shares' lower Rule"
"5130","12b-1 fees. The conversion feature will become effective"
"5131","on or about October 5, 2018.  Later that month Class C"
"5132","shares of the Fund that have been outstanding for 10 years"
"5133"," or more will automatically convert to Class A shares of"
"5134"," such Fund on the basis of the relative net asset values"
"5135","of the two classes. Thereafter, Class C shares of the Fund"
"5136"," will convert automatically to Class A shares of such Fund"
"5137"," on a monthly basis in the month of, or the month following,"
"5138"," the 10-year anniversary of the Class C shares' purchase date."
"5139"," Class C shares of the Fund acquired through automatic"
"5140"," reinvestment of dividends or distributions will convert to"
"5141"," Class A shares of the Fund on the conversion date pro rata"
"5142"," with the converting Class C shares of the Fund that were"
"5143"," not acquired through reinvestment of dividends or distributions."
"5144","Shareholders will not pay a sales charge, including a contingent"
"5145"," deferred sales charge, upon the conversion of their Class C shares"
"5146"," to Class A shares pursuant to this conversion feature. The"
"5147","automatic conversion of the Fund's Class C shares into Class"
"5148"," A shares after the 10-year holding period is not expected to"
"5149"," be a taxable event for federal income tax purposes. Shareholders"
"5150"," should consult with their tax advisor regarding the state and"
"5151"," local tax consequences of such conversions."
"5152","Class C shares held through a financial intermediary in an omnibus"
"5153"," account will be converted into Class A shares only if the"
"5154"," intermediary can document that the shareholder has met the"
"5155"," required holding period. In certain circumstances, when"
"5156"," shares are invested through retirement plans, omnibus"
"5157"," accounts, and in certain other instances, the Fund and"
"5158"," its agents may not have transparency into how long a"
"5159","shareholder has held Class C shares for purposes of"
"5160","determining whether such Class C shares are eligible"
"5161","for automatic conversion into Class A shares and the"
"5162","financial intermediary may not have the ability to track"
"5163"," purchases to credit individual shareholders' holding periods."
"5164","  This primarily occurs when shares are invested through certain"
"5165"," record keepers for group retirement plans, where the intermediary"
"5166"," cannot track share aging at the participant level.  In these"
"5167"," circumstances, the Fund will not be able to automatically"
"5168"," convert Class C shares into Class A shares as described"
"5169","above. In order to determine eligibility for conversion in"
"5170"," these circumstances, it is the responsibility of the shareholder"
"5171"," or their financial intermediary to notify the Fund that the"
"5172"," shareholder is eligible for the conversion of Class C shares to"
"5173"," Class A shares, and the shareholder or their financial intermediary"
"5174"," may be required to maintain and provide the Fund with records that"
"5175"," substantiate the holding period of Class C shares. It is the financial"
"5176"," intermediary's (and not the Fund's) responsibility to keep records and"
"5177"," to ensure that the shareholder is credited with the proper holding"
"5178"," period. Please consult with your financial intermediary about your"
"5179"," shares' eligibility for this conversion feature."
"5180","Also effective October 5, 2018, new accounts or plans may not be"
"5181"," eligible to purchase Class C shares of the Fund if it is determined"
"5182"," that the intermediary cannot track shareholder holding periods to"
"5183"," determine whether a shareholder's Class C shares are eligible for"
"5184"," conversion to Class A shares.  Accounts or plans (and their"
"5185","successor, related and affiliated plans) that have Class C shares"
"5186"," of the Fund available to participants on or before October 5,"
"5187","2018, may continue to open accounts for new participants in such"
"5188"," share class and purchase additional shares in existing participant"
"5189"," accounts.  The Fund has no responsibility for overseeing,"
"5190","monitoring or implementing a financial intermediary's process"
"5191"," for determining whether a shareholder meets the required holding"
"5192"," period for conversion."
"5193","A financial intermediary may sponsor and/or control accounts,"
"5194"," programs or platforms that impose a different conversion schedule"
"5195"," or different eligibility requirements for the conversion of Class"
"5196"," C shares into Class A shares. In these cases, Class C shareholders"
"5197"," may convert to Class A shares under the policies of the financial"
"5198"," intermediary and the conversion may be structured as an exchange"
"5199"," of Class C shares for Class A shares of the same Fund. Financial"
"5200"," intermediaries will be responsible for making such exchanges in"
"5201"," those circumstances. Please consult with your financial"
"5202","intermediary if you have any questions regarding your shares'"
"5203"," conversion from Class C shares to Class A shares."

"5495","provided, that an alternative to the execution of a written proxy"
"5496"," may be permitted as described in the next paragraph of this Section"

"5505","delivered to the Trust stating that the proxy is revoked,"
"5506","(b) by a subsequent proxy executed by such person, (c)"

"5514"," be valid after the expiration of eleven (11) months from the date"
"5515"," of the proxy unless otherwise expressly provided in the proxy."
"5516","The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is"
"5517","irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of the General"
"5518","Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Unless revoked,"
"5519","any proxy given in connection with a postponed or adjourned"
"5520"," meeting for which a new record date is fixed shall continue"
"5521"," to be valid so long as the Shareholder giving such proxy is"
"5522"," a Shareholder of record on such new such record date."

"5532","or prior to the exercise of the proxy, the secretary of the Trust"
"5533"," receives a specific written notice to the contrary from any one of"
"5534"," them.  A proxy purporting to be by or on behalf of a Shareholder"

"5538"," entitle the Shareholder to vote at any adjournment or postponement"
"5539"," of a Shareholder meeting."
"5540","Subject to the provisions of the DSTA, the Declaration of Trust or"

"5542"," relating to proxies, and judicial interpretations thereunder, shall"
"5543"," govern all matters concerning the giving, voting or validity of"
"5544","proxies, as if the Trust were a Delaware corporation and the"
"5545","Shareholders were stockholders of a Delaware corporation."

"6240","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"6241","To the Board of Trustees of Templeton Global Investment Trust"
"6242","and Shareholders of Templeton Global Balanced Fund"
"6243","and Templeton Emerging Markets Balanced Fund"
"6244","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"6245"," Templeton Global Balanced Fund and its subsidiary"
"6246","and Templeton Emerging Markets Balanced Fund (the Funds)"
"6247","as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, in accordance with the"
"6248","standards of the"
"6249","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),"
"6250","we considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"6251","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"6252","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"6253","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"6254","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"6255","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"6256","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"6257","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"6258","reporting."
"6259","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"6260","and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"6261","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"6262","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"6263","controls.  A company's internal control over financial reporting is"
"6264","a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"6265","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"6266","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"6267","accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial"
"6268","reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"6269","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"6270","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"6271","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"6272","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"6273","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"6274","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"6275","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"6276","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"6277","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"6278","or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material"
"6279","effect on the financial statements."
"6280","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"6281","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"6282","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"6283","are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"6284","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"6285","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"6286","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"6287","the design or operation of a control does"
"6288","not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"6289","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"6290","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"6291","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"6292","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"6293","material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial"
"6294","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"6295","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"6296","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"6297","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"6298","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"6299","standards established by the PCAOB.  However, we noted the following"
"6300","deficiency in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and"
"6301","its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"6302","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"6303","December 31, 2018."
"6304","Management and PwC identified that at December 31, 2018 management's"
"6305","controls were ineffective related to internal control over financial"
"6306","reporting specific to the monitoring of market events following the"
"6307","close of trading in foreign stock markets that assist in determining"
"6308","the reliability of the values of the foreign securities held by the"
"6309","Funds and which may require the use of fair valuation factors to account"
"6310","for changes in the values of those securities subsequent to the local"
"6311","close of the foreign market but prior to the net asset calculation of"
"6312","the Funds. This material weakness did not result in misstatements in"
"6313","the Funds' interim or annual financial statements.  However, this"
"6314","material weakness could result in misstatements of security values"
"6315","and unrealized gains or losses and associated disclosures that would"
"6316","result in a material misstatement of the financial statements that would"
"6317","not be prevented or detected. As a result, a material weakness exists"
"6318","at December 31, 2018 for the Funds."
"6319","Effective November 1, 2018 the Registrant's controls were further"
"6320","enhanced through the implementation of a daily secondary review of"
"6321","market events following the close of trading on foreign stock"
"6322","markets to ensure the appropriate application of market level fair"
"6323","value. We have not performed any procedures to assess this corrective"
"6324","action, including its sufficiency in addressing the material"
"6325","weakness described above."
"6326","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"6327","of the Board of Trustees of Templeton Global Investment Trust"
"6328","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"6329","to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
