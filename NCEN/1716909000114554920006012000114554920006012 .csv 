"390","Report of Independent Registered"
"391","Public Accounting Firm"
"392","To the Shareholders and Board"
"393","of Trustees of Cushing Mutual"
"394","Funds Trust"
"395","In planning and performing our"
"396","audit of the financial statements"
"397","of Cushing NextGen Infrastructure"
"398","Fund (formerly, Cushing MLP"
"399","Infrastructure Fund), a series"
"400","of Cushing Mutual Funds Trust"
"401","(the ?Fund?) as of and for the"
"402","year ended November 30, 2019,"
"403","in accordance with the standards"
"404","of the Public Company Accounting"
"405","Oversight Board (United States),"
"406","we considered the Fund?s internal"
"407","control over financial reporting,"
"408","including controls over safeguarding"
"409","securities, as a basis for"
"410","designing our auditing procedures"
"411","for the purpose of expressing our"
"412","opinion on the financial statements"
"413","and to comply with the requirements"
"414","of Form N-CEN, but not for the"
"415","purpose of expressing an opinion"
"416","on the effectiveness of the Fund?s"
"417","internal control over financial"
"418","reporting. Accordingly, we express"
"419","no such opinion."
"420","The management of the Fund is"
"421","responsible for establishing and"
"422","maintaining effective internal"
"423","control over financial reporting."
"424","In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"425","estimates and judgments by"
"426","management are required to assess"
"427","the expected benefits and related"
"428","costs of controls. A fund?s"
"429","internal control over financial"
"430","reporting is a process designed"
"431","to provide reasonable assurance"
"432","regarding the reliability of"
"433","financial reporting and the"
"434","preparation of financial"
"435","statements for external purposes"
"436","in accordance with U.S. generally"
"437","accepted accounting principles."
"438","A fund?s internal control over"
"439","financial reporting includes"
"440","those policies and procedures"
"441","that (1) pertain to the"
"442","maintenance of records that,"
"443","in reasonable detail, accurately"
"444","and fairly reflect the"
"445","transactions and dispositions"
"446","of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"447","provide reasonable assurance"
"448","that transactions are recorded"
"449","as necessary to permit preparation"
"450","of financial statements in"
"451","accordance with U.S. generally"
"452","accepted accounting principles,"
"453","and that receipts and expenditures"
"454","of the fund are being made only"
"455","in accordance with authorizations"
"456","of management and trustees of"
"457","the fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"458","assurance regarding prevention or"
"459","timely detection of unauthorized"
"460","acquisition, use or disposition"
"461","of a fund's assets that could"
"462","have a material effect on the"
"463","financial statements."
"464","Because of its inherent"
"465","limitations, internal control"
"466","over financial reporting may"
"467","not prevent or detect misstatements."
"468","Also, projections of any evaluation"
"469","of effectiveness to future periods"
"470","are subject to the risk that"
"471","controls may become inadequate"
"472","because of changes in conditions,"
"473","or that the degree of compliance"
"474","with the policies or procedures"
"475","may deteriorate."
"476","A deficiency in internal"
"477","control over financial reporting"
"478","exists when the design or"
"479","operation of a control does"
"480","not allow management or employees,"
"481","in the normal course of performing"
"482","their assigned functions, to"
"483","prevent or detect misstatements"
"484","on a timely basis.  A material"
"485","weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"486","combination of deficiencies,"
"487","in internal control over"
"488","financial reporting, such"
"489","that there is a reasonable"
"490","possibility that a material"
"491","misstatement of a fund?s"
"492","annual or interim financial"
"493","statements will not be prevented"
"494","or detected on a timely basis."
"495","Our consideration of the"
"496","Fund?s internal control over"
"497","financial reporting was for"
"498","the limited purpose described"
"499","in the first paragraph and would"
"500","not necessarily disclose all"
"501","deficiencies in internal control"
"502","that might be material weaknesses"
"503","under standards established by"
"504","the Public Company Accounting"
"505","Oversight Board (United States)."
"506","However, we noted no deficiencies"
"507","in the Fund?s internal control"
"508","over financial reporting and"
"509","its operation, including controls"
"510","over safeguarding securities,"
"511","that we consider to be a material"
"512","weakness as defined above as"
"513","of November 30, 2019."
"514","This report is intended solely"
"515","for the information and use of"
"516","management and the Board of"
"517","Trustees of the Fund and the"
"518","Securities and Exchange"
"519","Commission and is not intended"
"520","to be and should not be used"
