"922","<div style=FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; TEXT-ALIGN: justify>In June of 2014 and in August of 2014, two separate class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of investors in Davis New York Venture Fund (DNYVF) against Davis Selected Advisers, L.P. and Davis Selected Advisers &#8211; N.Y., Inc. (Davis Selected Advisers, L.P.'s sub-adviser). The plaintiffs claim that the defendants (the Davis Entities) charged DNYVF excessive fees to manage DNYVF. In September of 2014, these two claims were consolidated into one lawsuit. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages and other relief. The Davis Entities believe that the action is without merit and have undertaken a vigorous defense in these proceedings. Although no determination can be made at this time, it is not anticipated that this lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on the Davis Entities, their assets, or the Fund.</div>"

In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)&#160;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&#160;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&#160;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</div>"

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</div>"
