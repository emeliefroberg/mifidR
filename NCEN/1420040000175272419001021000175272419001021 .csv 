"3378","A deficiency in internal"

"3405","Our consideration of the"

"3407","over financial reporting"
"3408","was for the limited"
"3409","purpose described in"
"3410","the first paragraph and"
"3411","would not necessarily"
"3412","disclose all deficiencies"
"3413","in internal control that"
"3414","might be material"
"3415","weaknesses under"
"3416","standards established"
"3417","by the PCAOB."
"3418","However, we noted no"
"3419","deficiencies in the"

"3421","over financial reporting"
"3422","and its operation,"
"3423","including controls over"
"3424","safeguarding securities"
"3425","that we consider to be a"
"3426","material weakness, as"
"3427","defined above, as of"
"3428","October 31, 2018."
"3429","This report is intended"
"3430","solely for the"
