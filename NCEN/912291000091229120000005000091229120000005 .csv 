"1214","<TEXT>"
"1215","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1216","To the Board of Trustees of Franklin Real Estate Securities Trust"
"1217","and Shareholders of Franklin Real Estate Securities Fund"
"1218","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"1219","of Franklin Real Estate Securities Fund (the Fund) as of and for"
"1220","the year ended April 30, 2020, in accordance with the standards"
"1221","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)"
"1222"," (PCAOB), we considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1223"," reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"1224"," basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1225"," expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"1226"," with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"1227"," expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"1228"," control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"1229","we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1230"," Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"1231","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"1232"," and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1233"," reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"1234","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1235","expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"1236"," A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"1237","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1238","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1239","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"1240"," purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1241","accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"1242","over financial reporting includes those policies"
"1243","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1244"," of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"1245"," and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"1246"," of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1247"," assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"1248"," to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1249"," accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"1250"," and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"1251"," being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1252"," management and directors of the company; and"
"1253","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1254","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1255"," acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"1256","assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1257","financial statements."
"1258","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1259"," control over financial reporting may not prevent"
"1260","or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"1261"," evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"1262","are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1263"," inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"1264","or that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"1265","or procedures may deteriorate."
"1266","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1267","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"1268"," a control does not allow management or employees,"
"1269"," in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1270"," functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1271"," timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1272"," or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"1273"," over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1274"," reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"1275"," of the company's annual or interim financial"
"1276","statements will not be prevented or detected on"
"1277"," a timely basis."
"1278","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control"
"1279","over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1280"," described in the first paragraph and would not"
