"767","Exempt Income Fund:"
"768","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"769","statements of Putnam New York Tax Exempt Fund (the Fund), as of"
"770","and for the year ended November 30, 2019, in accordance with"
"771","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"772","(United States), we considered the Funds internal control over"
"773","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"774","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"775","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"776","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN,"
"777","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"778","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"779","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"780","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"781","maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"782","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"783","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"784","benefits and related costs of controls. A companys internal"
"785","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"786","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"787","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"788","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"789","accounting principles (GAAP). A companys internal control over"
"790","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"791","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"792","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"793","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"794","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"795","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"796","accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"797","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"798","of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide"
"799","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"800","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys"
