"25901","retained an independent compliance consultant to"

"25910","begun making revisions and improvements to their"

"25995","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"

"26000","CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"26001","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"26002","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"26003","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"26004","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"26005","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"26006","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"26007","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal"
"26008","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"26009","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"26010","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"26011","for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally"
"26012","accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"26013","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"26014","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"26015","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"26016","and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"26017","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"26018","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"26019","accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting"
"26020","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"

"26024","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"26025","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"26026","statements."
"26027","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"26028","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"26029","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"26030","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"26031","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"26032","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"26033","deteriorate."
"26034","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"26035","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"26036","management or employees, in the normal course of"

"26413","different countries, including the"
"26414","United States. The fund may invest in"
"26415","emerging markets. The fund primarily"

"26444","PRINCIPAL RISKS:"
"26445","The fund will no longer be subject to"

"26448","Call. These risks will"
"26449","be removed from the Principal Risks"
"26450","section of the Prospectus and Summary"
"26451","Prospectus. In addition, the following"
"26452","principal risks"
"26453","will be added to the Principal Risks"
"26454","section of the Prospectus and Summary"
"26455","Prospectus as principal risks of"
"26456","investing in the fund:"
"26457","Currency Hedging - The portfolio may"
"26458","hedge its currency risk using currency"
"26459","futures, forwards or options. However,"
"26460","hedging"
"26461","strategies and/or these instruments may"
"26462","not always work as intended, and a"
"26463","portfolio may be worse off than if it"
"26464","had not used a"
"26465","hedging strategy or instrument."
"26466","Derivatives - Using derivatives exposes"
"26467","the fund to additional risks and can"
"26468","increase fund losses and reduce"
"26469","opportunities for"
"26470","gains when market prices, interest"
"26471","rates, currencies, or the derivatives"
"26472","themselves, behave in a way not"
"26473","anticipated by the fund."
"26474","Using derivatives may have a leveraging"
"26475","effect, increase fund volatility and"
"26476","not produce the result intended."
"26477","Certain derivatives"
"26478","have the potential for unlimited loss,"
"26479","regardless of the size of the initial"
"26480","investment. Derivatives may bedifficult"
"26481","to sell, unwind or"
"26482","value, and the counterparty may default"
"26483","on its obligations tothe fund."
"26484","Derivatives are generally subject to"
"26485","the risks applicable to"
"26486","the assets, rates, indices or other"
"26487","indicators underlying the derivative."
"26488","The value of a derivative may fluctuate"
"26489","more than, or"
"26490","otherwise not correlate well with, the"
"26491","underlying assets, rates, indices or"
"26492","other indicators to which it relates."
"26493","Use of derivatives"
"26494","may have different tax consequences for"
"26495","the fund than an investment in the"
"26496","underlying security, and those"
"26497","differences may affect"
"26498","the amount, timing and character of"
"26499","income distributed to shareholders. The"
"26500","U.S. government and foreign governments"
"26501","are in the"
"26502","process of adopting and implementing"
"26503","regulations governing derivatives"
"26504","markets, including mandatory clearing"
"26505","of certain"
"26506","derivatives, margin and reporting"
"26507","requirements. The ultimate impact of"
"26508","the regulations remains unclear."
"26509","Additional regulation of"
"26510","derivatives may make derivatives more"
"26511","costly, limit their availability or"
"26512","utility, otherwise adversely affect"
"26513","their performance, or"
"26514","disrupt markets. For additional"
"26515","information regarding derivatives, see"
"26516","More on Risks of Investing in the
Funds - More on
Principal Risks: Derivatives in this"
"26517","prospectus. In addition, the SEC has"
"26518","proposed a new rule that would"
"26519","changethe regulation of"
"26520","the use of derivatives by registered"
"26521","investment companies, such as the fund."
"26522","If the proposed rule, or a different"
"26523","rule, takes effect, it"
"26524","could limit the ability of the fund to"
"26525","invest in derivatives."
"26526","Growth Stocks - Returns on growth"
"26527","stocks may not move in tandem with"
"26528","returns on other categories of stocks"
"26529","or the market as a"
"26530","whole. Growth stocks typically are"
"26531","particularly sensitive to market"
"26532","movements because their market prices"
"26533","tend to reflect future"
"26534","expectations. When it appears those"
"26535","expectations may not be met, the prices"
"26536","of growth securities typically fall."
"26537","Growth stocks as a"
"26538","group may be out of favor and"
"26539","underperform the overall equity market"
"26540","for a long period of time, for example,"
"26541","while the market"
"26542","favors value stocks."
"26543","Leveraging - The value of your"
"26544","investment may be more volatile to the"
"26545","extent that the fund borrows or uses"
"26546","derivatives or other"
"26547","investments, such as ETFs, that have"
"26548","embedded leverage. Other risks also"
"26549","will be compounded because leverage"
"26550","generally"
"26551","magnifies the effect of a change in the"
"26552","value of an asset and creates a risk of"
"26553","loss of value on a larger pool of"
"26554","assets than the fund"
"26555","would otherwise have. The use of"
"26556","leverage is considered to be a"
"26557","speculative investment practice and may"
"26558","result in the loss of a"
"26559","substantial amount, and possibly all,"
"26560","of the fund's assets. The fund also may"
"26561","have to sell assets at inopportune"
"26562","times to satisfy its"
"26563","obligations or meet segregation"
"26564","requirements."
"26565","Liquidity - The portfolio may make"
"26566","investments that are illiquid or that"
"26567","become illiquid after purchase."
"26568","Investments may become"
"26569","illiquid due to the lack of an active"
"26570","market, a reduced number of traditional"
"26571","market participants, or reduced"
"26572","capacity of traditional"
"26573","market participants to make a market in"
"26574","securities. The liquidity and value of"
"26575","investments can deteriorate rapidly and"
"26576","those"
"26577","investments may be difficult or"
"26578","impossible for the portfolio to sell,"
"26579","particularly during times of market"
"26580","turmoil. Illiquid"
"26581","investments canbedifficult to value."
"26582","Markets may become illiquid when, for"
"26583","instance, there are few, if any,"
"26584","interested buyers or"
"26585","sellers or when dealers are unwilling"
"26586","to make a market for certain"
"26587","securities. As a general matter,"
"26588","dealers recently have been less"
"26589","willing to make markets for fixed"
"26590","income securities. If the portfolio is"
"26591","forced to sell an illiquid investment"
"26592","to meet redemption"
"26593","requests or other cash needs, the"
"26594","portfolio may be forced to sell at a"
"26595","loss. The portfolio may not receive its"
"26596","proceeds from the sale"
"26597","of securities for an extended period"
"26598","(for example, several weeks or even"
"26599","longer)."
"26600","Preferred Stock - Preferred stock's"
"26601","right to dividends and liquidation"
"26602","proceeds is junior to the rights of a"
"26603","company's debt"
"26604","securities. The value of preferred"
"26605","stock may be subject to factors that"
"26606","affect fixed income and equity"
"26607","securities, including changes"
"26608","in interest rates and in a company's"
"26609","creditworthiness. The value of"
"26610","preferred stock tends to vary more with"
"26611","fluctuations in the"
"26612","underlying common stock and less with"
"26613","fluctuations in interest rates and"
"26614","tends to exhibit greater volatility."
"26615","Shareholders of"
"26616","preferred stock may suffer a loss of"
"26617","value if dividends are not paid and"
"26618","have limited voting rights."
"26619","Warrants and Rights - Warrants and"
"26620","rights may be considered more"
"26621","speculative than certain other types of"
"26622","investments because"
"26623","they do not entitle a holder to the"
"26624","dividends or voting rights for the"
"26625","securities that may be purchased. They"
"26626","do not represent any"
"26627","rights in the assets of the issuing"
"26628","company, and cease to have value if not"
"26629","exercised prior to the expiration date."

"27938","PineBridge Investments LLC"
"27939","Original Issue Date: 2005"
"27940","Last Revision Date: March 2013"
"27941","I. Introduction"
"27942","Proxy voting is an important right of"
"27943","shareholders, such as PineBridge"
"27944","Clients, for which PineBridge must take"
"27945","reasonable care and"
"27946","diligence to ensure such rights are"
"27947","properly and timely exercised."
"27948","PineBridge, as a fiduciary for its"
"27949","Clients, must vote proxies in"
"27950","each Client's best interest."
"27951","II. Policy Statement"
"27952","Proxy Procedures"
"27953","As a registered investment adviser that"
"27954","votes (or delegates the voting of)"
"27955","securities held in Client portfolios,"
"27956","PineBridge has"
"27957","implemented proxy voting procedures"
"27958","that are reasonably designed to help"
"27959","ensure that a) PineBridge votes proxies"
"27960","in the best"
"27961","interest of its Clients; b) describes"
"27962","its proxy voting procedures to its"
"27963","Clients, and c) discloses to Clients"
"27964","how they may obtain"
"27965","information on how PineBridge voted"
"27966","their proxies. These procedures are"
"27967","designed to help enable PineBridge to"
"27968","manage material"
"27969","conflicts of interest. While PineBridge"
"27970","must disclose its votes upon request to"
"27971","Clients, no public disclosure is"
"27972","required. (Note that"
"27973","disclosure is required for any mutual"
"27974","funds advised by PineBridge, on Form N-"
"27975","PX.)"
"27976","Record-Keeping"
"27977","PineBridge must retain (i) these proxy"
"27978","voting policies and procedures; (ii)"
"27979","proxy statements received regarding"
"27980","Client securities;"
"27981","(iii) records of votes it casts on"
"27982","behalf of Clients; (iv) records of"
"27983","Client requests for proxy voting"
"27984","information, and; (v) any"
"27985","documents prepared by PineBridge that"
"27986","were material to making a decision how"
"27987","to vote, or that memorialized the basis"
"27988","for the"
"27989","decision. PineBridge may rely on proxy"
"27990","statements filed on EDGAR instead of"
"27991","keeping its own copies, and rely on"
"27992","proxy statements"
"27993","and records of proxy votes cast by"
"27994","PineBridge that are maintained by"
"27995","contract with a third party proxy"
"27996","voting service or other third"
"27997","party."
"27998","Proxies of Shares of Non-U.S."
"27999","Corporations"
"28000","PineBridge has implemented general"
"28001","voting policies with respect to non-"
"28002","U.S. shares owned by Clients. However,"
"28003","although U.S."
"28004","companies must give shareholders at"
"28005","least 20 days' advance notice to vote"
"28006","proxies, some non-U.S. companies may"
"28007","provide"
"28008","considerably shorter notice or none at"
"28009","all. PineBridge is not required to"
"28010","rush voting decisions in order to"
"28011","meet an impractical"
"28012","deadline, and as a result, PineBridge"
"28013","or PineBridge affiliates' regional"
"28014","designees under certain circumstances"
"28015","may not vote certain"
"28016","proxies. In addition, certain non-U.S."
"28017","regulations impose additional costs to"
"28018","a Portfolio that votes proxies, and"
"28019","PineBridge will take"
"28020","that into consideration when"
"28021","determining whether or not to vote."
"28022","Policy on Monitoring Class Action Suits"
"28023","In the event that PineBridge has"
"28024","purchased the same security for a"
"28025","Client's portfolio alongside its"
"28026","investments on behalf of itself or"
"28027","an affiliate, PineBridge generally will"
"28028","seek to inform a Client that such"
"28029","Client may also have a cause of action"
"28030","whenever such issuer"
"28031","is subject to class action litigation."
"28032","PineBridge as a general matter will"
"28033","also make available to the Client such"
"28034","rights, if any, as that"
"28035","PineBridge may have against any such"
"28036","issuer in its capacity as the Client's"
"28037","agent, and PineBridge will, where"
"28038","possible, give the"
"28039","Client such assistance as it may"
"28040","reasonably require to exercise its"
"28041","rights in any such action."
"28042","PineBridge generally does not, however,"
"28043","search out potential legal claims or"
"28044","monitor class action lawsuits against"
"28045","issuers arising"
"28046","from investments held in a Client"
"28047","portfolio, nor may PineBridge institute"
"28048","a lawsuit on a Client's behalf arising"
"28049","from investments"
"28050","held in the Client portfolio."
"28051","In addition, given the size and breadth"
"28052","of PineBridge's business, it is"
"28053","possible that there may be situations"
"28054","in which PineBridge or an"
"28055","affiliate might become aware of a"
"28056","potential lawsuit with respect to a"
"28057","security, one of which may also be held"
"28058","within a Client"
"28059","portfolio. In these situations, there"
"28060","is the possibility, due to"
"28061","confidentiality requirements or"
"28062","conflicts of interest, that PineBridge"
"28063","would be restricted from informing a"
"28064","Client of potential legal actions and"
"28065","activities."
"28066","In the case of a material conflict"
"28067","between the interests of PineBridge and"
"28068","those of its Clients, PineBridge will"
"28069","take steps to address"
"28070","such conflicts (which may include"
"28071","consulting with counsel), and will"
"28072","attempt to resolve all conflicts in the"
"28073","Client's best interest."
"28074","III. Procedures"
"28075","PineBridge will vote proxies in the"
"28076","best interests of its Clients, which"
"28077","may result in different voting results"
"28078","for proxies for the same"
"28079","issuer."
"28080",".. Compliance is responsible for"
"28081","ensuring that the PineBridge ADV"
"28082","includes the appropriate language"
"28083","summarizing"
"28084","PineBridge's proxy voting procedures"
"28085","and for updating the summary in the ADV"
"28086","whenever the procedures are updated."
"28087","Compliance is also responsible for"
"28088","consulting with Legal to ensure that"
"28089","PineBridge's proxy voting policy is"
"28090","kept up to date"
"28091","and in a form appropriate for"
"28092","transmission to Clients."
"28093",".. If a Client or potential Client"
"28094","requests a copy of the Proxy Voting"
"28095","Policy from Client Relations or Sales,"
"28096","Compliance should"
"28097","be contacted for the most recent"
"28098","version, or it may be obtained from the"
"28099","intranet. Client Relations will send to"
"28100","such Client a"
"28101","copy of the current version of the"
"28102","voting procedures within 7 days and"
"28103","will ensure that Compliance receives a"
"28104","log of each"
"28105","Client's request and the action taken."
"28106",".. If a Client requests access to the"
"28107","records of how PineBridge voted its"
"28108","proxies, the Client should be assured"
"28109","that this will be"
"28110","provided, and Compliance should be"
"28111","consulted. Compliance has access to"
"28112","these proxy voting records."
"28113",".. PineBridge has established a Proxy"
"28114","Committee (the Committee). The"
"28115","PineBridge Proxy Committee is comprises"
"28116","members"
"28117","of Compliance, the Investment"
"28118","Department, and senior management."
"28119",".. The Committee conducts an annual"
"28120","review of the proxy voting guidelines"
"28121","for domestic and non-U.S. Portfolios."
"28122","Guidelines"
"28123","are reviewed to ensure that the"
"28124","interests of PineBridge's Clients are"
"28125","best served."
"28126",".. Issues not addressed in the voting"
"28127","guidelines are determined on a case-by-"
"28128","case basis with input from the"
"28129","Committee and"
"28130","portfolio managers."
"28131",".. PineBridge has engaged a third party"
"28132","vendor to administer proxy voting on"
"28133","its behalf. The vendor receives, in a"
"28134","majority of"
"28135","cases, proxies directly from the"
"28136","Client's custodian and votes them based"
"28137","on PineBridge's general voting"
"28138","guidelines."
"28139",".. In circumstances where PineBridge"
"28140","receives proxies directly, these"
"28141","proxies must be sent to the vendor"
"28142","promptly. The vendor"
"28143","then votes them in accordance with"
"28144","PineBridge's general voting guidelines."
"28145","The vendor maintains a listing of all"
"28146","votes cast on"
"28147","behalf of PineBridge Clients."

"28371","The fund normally invests primarilyin"
"28372","inflation-protected securities issued"
"28373","by the U.S. government, its agencies"
"28374","and"
"28375","instrumentalities. The fund also"

"28412","by the underlying fundamental"
"28413","correlation to key components of"
"28414","inflation."
"28415","The fund invests primarily in"
"28416","investment-grade debt securities, but"
"28417","may also invest in lower quality debt"
"28418","securities. The fund may"
"28419","not invest more than 10% of its net"
"28420","assets inbelow investment-grade debt"

"28426","or are of"
"28427","comparable quality as determined by the"
"28428","fund's sub- adviser."
"28429","The fund seeks to maintain an average"
"28430","portfolio duration that is within ?20%"
"28431","of the duration of the Bloomberg"
"28432","Barclays U.S."

"28438","invest in securities of any maturity"
"28439","and securities that are denominated in"
"28440","U.S. dollars and in"

"28442","The portfolio managers of the fund use"
"28443","both top down and bottom up"
"28444","analysis to determine security and"
"28445","duration positions for"
"28446","the fund. Both top-down and bottom-up"

"28448","fundamental, valuation and technical"
"28449","framework for"
"28450","comprehensive analysis of all factors"
"28451","which affect asset pricing. These"
"28452","factors are jointly determined and are"
"28453","interdependent."
"28454","Security sales decisions are driven by"
"28455","the same criteria as purchase"
"28456","decisions."
"28457","The fund may, but is not required to,"
"28458","engage in certain investment strategies"
"28459","involving derivatives, such as options,"
"28460","futures,"
"28461","forward currency contracts and swaps,"
"28462","including, but not limited to, interest"
"28463","rate or foreign currency transactions,"
"28464","total return and"
"28465","creditdefault swaps. These investment"
"28466","strategies may be employed to either"
"28467","mitigate risk or generate income."
"28468","PRINCIPAL RISKS:"
"28469","The fund will no longer be subject to"

"28471","and these risks are removedfrom the"
"28472","Principal Risks"
"28473","section of the Prospectus and Summary"
"28474","Prospectus. The following principal"
"28475","risks are added to the Principal
Risks section of the"
"28476","Prospectus and Summary Prospectus as"
"28477","principal risks of investing in the"
"28478","fund:"
"28479","Convertible Securities - Convertible"
"28480","securities share investment"
"28481","characteristics of both fixed income"
"28482","and equity securities. The"
"28483","value of these securities may vary more"
"28484","with fluctuations in the value of the"
"28485","underlying common stock than with"
"28486","fluctuations in"
"28487","interest rates. The value of"
"28488","convertible securities also may be less"
"28489","volatile than the underlying common"
"28490","stock. Convertible"
"28491","securities generally offer lower"
"28492","interest or dividend yields than"
"28493","nonconvertible securities of similar"
"28494","quality. The fund could lose"
"28495","money if the issuer of a convertible"
"28496","security is unable to meet its"
"28497","financial obligations or goes bankrupt."
"28498","Currency Hedging - The fund may hedge"
"28499","its currency risk using currency"
"28500","futures, forwards or options. However,"
"28501","hedging"
"28502","strategies and/or these instruments may"
"28503","not always work as intended, and a fund"
"28504","may be worse off than if it had not"
"28505","used a"
"28506","hedging strategy or instrument."
"28507","Focused Investing -To the extent the"
"28508","fund invests in a limited number of"
"28509","countries, regions, sectors, industries"
"28510","or market"
"28511","segments, or in a limited number of"
"28512","issuers, the fund will be more"
"28513","susceptible to negative events"
"28514","affecting those countries, regions,"
"28515","sectors, industries, segments or"
"28516","issuers, and the value of its shares"
"28517","may be more volatile than if invested"
"28518","more widely. Local"
"28519","events, such as political upheaval,"
"28520","financial troubles, or natural"
"28521","disasters may disrupt a country's or"
"28522","region's securities markets."
"28523","Geographic risk is especially high in"
"28524","emerging markets."
"28525","Hybrid Instruments - Investing in"
"28526","hybrid instruments involves a"
"28527","combination of risks, including risks"
"28528","of investing in securities,"
"28529","commodities, options, futures, and"
"28530","currencies. An investment in a hybrid"
"28531","instrument may entail significant risks"
"28532","in addition to"
"28533","those associated with traditional"
"28534","fixed-income or convertible securities."
"28535","Money Market Funds - An investment in a"
"28536","money market fund is not a bank"
"28537","deposit, and is not insured or"
"28538","guaranteed by the"
"28539","Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation"
"28540","(FDIC) or any other government"
"28541","agency. Although money market funds"
"28542","generally seek"
"28543","to maintain a stable net asset value of"
"28544","$1.00 per share, it is possible to lose"
"28545","money by investing in a money market"
"28546","fund."
"28547","Repurchase Agreements - If the other"
"28548","party to a repurchase agreement"
"28549","defaults on its obligation, the fund"
"28550","may suffer delays and"
"28551","incur costs or lose money in exercising"
"28552","its rights under the agreement. If the"
"28553","seller fails to repurchase the security"
"28554","and the market"
"28555","value declines, the fund could lose"
"28556","money. If the seller becomes insolvent"
"28557","and subject to liquidation or"
"28558","reorganization under"
"28559","applicable bankruptcy or other laws,"
"28560","the fund's abilityto dispose of the"
"28561","underlying securities may be"
"28562","restricted. In addition, if the"
"28563","fund is characterized by a court as an"
"28564","unsecured creditor, it would be at risk"
"28565","of losing some or all of the principal"
"28566","and interest"
"28567","involved in the transaction."
"28568","Yield - The amount of income received"
"28569","by the fund will go up or down"
"28570","depending on day-to-day variations in"
"28571","short-term interest"
"28572","rates, and when interest rates are very"
"28573","low the fund's expenses could absorb"
"28574","all or a significant portion of the"

"28680","Original Issue Date: 2005"
"28681","Last Revision Date: March 2013"
"28682","I. Introduction"
"28683","Proxy voting is an important right of"
"28684","shareholders, such as PineBridge"
"28685","Clients, for which PineBridge must take"
"28686","reasonable care and"
"28687","diligence to ensure such rights are"
"28688","properly and timely exercised."
"28689","PineBridge, as a fiduciary for its"
"28690","Clients, must vote proxies in"
"28691","each Client's best interest."
"28692","II. Policy Statement"
"28693","Proxy Procedures"
"28694","As a registered investment adviser that"
"28695","votes (or delegates the voting of)"
"28696","securities held in Client portfolios,"
"28697","PineBridge has"
"28698","implemented proxy voting procedures"
"28699","that are reasonably designed to help"
"28700","ensure that a) PineBridge votes proxies"
"28701","in the best"
"28702","interest of its Clients; b) describes"
"28703","its proxy voting procedures to its"
"28704","Clients, and c) discloses to Clients"
"28705","how they may obtain"
"28706","information on how PineBridge voted"
"28707","their proxies. These procedures are"
"28708","designed to help enable PineBridge to"
"28709","manage material"
"28710","conflicts of interest. While PineBridge"
"28711","must disclose its votes upon request to"
"28712","Clients, no public disclosure is"
"28713","required. (Note that"

"28725","information, and; (v) any"

"28728","to vote, or that memorialized the basis"
"28729","for the"
"28730","decision. PineBridge may rely on proxy"
"28731","statements filed on EDGAR instead of"

"28753","deadline, and as a result, PineBridge"
"28754","or PineBridge affiliates' regional"
"28755","designees under certain circumstances"
"28756","may not vote certain"
"28757","proxies. In addition, certain non-U.S."
"28758","regulations impose additional costs to"
"28759","a Portfolio that votes proxies, and"
"28760","PineBridge will take"
"28761","that into consideration when"
"28762","determining whether or not to vote."
"28763","Policy on Monitoring Class Action Suits"
"28764","In the event that PineBridge has"
"28765","purchased the same security for a"
"28766","Client's portfolio alongside its"
"28767","investments on behalf of itself or"
"28768","an affiliate, PineBridge generally will"
"28769","seek to inform a Client that such"
"28770","Client may also have a cause of action"
"28771","whenever such issuer"
"28772","is subject to class action litigation."
"28773","PineBridge as a general matter will"
"28774","also make available to the Client such"
"28775","rights, if any, as that"
"28776","PineBridge may have against any such"
"28777","issuer in its capacity as the Client's"
"28778","agent, and PineBridge will, where"
"28779","possible, give the"
"28780","Client such assistance as it may"
"28781","reasonably require to exercise its"
"28782","rights in any such action."
"28783","PineBridge generally does not, however,"
"28784","search out potential legal claims or"
"28785","monitor class action lawsuits against"
"28786","issuers arising"
"28787","from investments held in a Client"
"28788","portfolio, nor may PineBridge institute"
"28789","a lawsuit on a Client's behalf arising"
"28790","from investments"
"28791","held in the Client portfolio."
"28792","In addition, given the size and breadth"
"28793","of PineBridge's business, it is"
"28794","possible that there may be situations"
"28795","in which PineBridge or an"
"28796","affiliate might become aware of a"
"28797","potential lawsuit with respect to a"
"28798","security, one of which may also be held"
"28799","within a Client"
"28800","portfolio. In these situations, there"
"28801","is the possibility, due to"
"28802","confidentiality requirements or"
"28803","conflicts of interest, that PineBridge"
"28804","would be restricted from informing a"
"28805","Client of potential legal actions and"
"28806","activities."
"28807","In the case of a material conflict"
"28808","between the interests of PineBridge and"
"28809","those of its Clients, PineBridge will"
"28810","take steps to address"
"28811","such conflicts (which may include"
"28812","consulting with counsel), and will"
"28813","attempt to resolve all conflicts in the"
"28814","Client's best interest."
"28815","III. Procedures"
"28816","PineBridge will vote proxies in the"

"28826","and for updating the summary in the ADV"

"28840","intranet. Client Relations will send to"
"28841","such Client a"
"28842","copy of the current version of the"
"28843","voting procedures within 7 days and"
"28844","will ensure that Compliance receives a"
"28845","log of each"
"28846","Client's request and the action taken."
"28847",".. If a Client requests access to the"
"28848","records of how PineBridge voted its"
"28849","proxies, the Client should be assured"
"28850","that this will be"
"28851","provided, and Compliance should be"
"28852","consulted. Compliance has access to"
"28853","these proxy voting records."
"28854",".. PineBridge has established a Proxy"

"28863","Guidelines"
"28864","are reviewed to ensure that the"
"28865","interests of PineBridge's Clients are"

"28868","guidelines are determined on a case-by-"
"28869","case basis with input from the"
"28870","Committee and"
"28871","portfolio managers."
"28872",".. PineBridge has engaged a third party"
"28873","vendor to administer proxy voting on"
"28874","its behalf. The vendor receives, in a"
"28875","majority of"
"28876","cases, proxies directly from the"
"28877","Client's custodian and votes them based"
"28878","on PineBridge's general voting"
"28879","guidelines."
"28880",".. In circumstances where PineBridge"
"28881","receives proxies directly, these"
"28882","proxies must be sent to the vendor"
"28883","promptly. The vendor"
"28884","then votes them in accordance with"
"28885","PineBridge's general voting guidelines."
"28886","The vendor maintains a listing of all"
"28887","votes cast on"
