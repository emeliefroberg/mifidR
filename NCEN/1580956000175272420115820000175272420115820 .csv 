"598","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"599","Firm"
"600","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of"
"601","Cohen & Steers MLP & Energy Opportunity Fund, Inc."
"602","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"603","statements of Cohen & Steers MLP & Energy"
"604","Opportunity Fund, Inc. (the Fund) as of and for the"
"605","year ended November 30, 2018, in accordance with"
"606","the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"607","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we"
"608","considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"609","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"610","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"611","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"612","on"
"613","the financial statements and to comply with the"
"614","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"615","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"616","internal control over financial reporting."
"617","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"618","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"619","financial"
"620","reporting."
"621","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"622","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"623","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"624","estimates and judgments by management are"
"625","required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"626","costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"627","financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"628","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"629","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"630","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"631","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's"
"632","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"633","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"634","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"635","accurately"
"636","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"637","the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"638","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"639","to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"640","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"641","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"642","fund"
"643","are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"644","of management and directors of the fund; and (3)"
"645","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"646","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"647","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"648","effect on the financial statements."
"649","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"650","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"651","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"652","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"653","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"654","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"655","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"656","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"657","exists when the design or operation of a control"
"658","does not allow management or employees, in the"
"659","normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"660","to"
"661","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"662","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"663","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"664","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"665","that a"
"666","material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim"
"667","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"668","detected on a timely basis."
"669","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"670","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"671","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"672","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"673","over"
"674","financial reporting that might be material weaknesses"
"675","under standards established by the PCAOB."
"676","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"677","internal control over financial reporting and its"
"678","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"679","securities, that we consider to be a material weakness"
"680","as"
"681","defined above as of November 30, 2018."
