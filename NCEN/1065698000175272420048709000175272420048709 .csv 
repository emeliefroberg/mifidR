"7734","to permit preparation of financial statements"
"7735","in accordance with generally accepted"

"7737","expenditures of the fund are being made"
"7738","only in accordance with authorizations of"

"7741","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"7742","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition"
"7743","of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"7744","effect on the financial statements."
"7745","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"7746","control over financial reporting may not"
"7747","prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"7748","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"
"7749","to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"7750","controls may become inadequate because of"
"7751","changes in conditions or that the degree of"

"7753","may deteriorate."
"7754","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"7755","reporting exists when the design or"
"7756","operation of a control does not allow"
"7757","management or employees, in the normal"
"7758","course of performing their assigned"
"7759","functions, to prevent or detect"
"7760","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"7761","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"7762","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"7763","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"7764","possibility that a material misstatement of a"
"7765","fund's annual or interim financial statements"
"7766","will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"7767","basis."
"7768","Our consideration of the Funds' internal"
"7769","control over financial reporting was for the"
"7770","limited purpose described in the first"
"7771","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"7772","all deficiencies in internal control that might"
"7773","be material weaknesses under standards"
"7774","established by the Public Company"
"7775","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"7776","However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"7777","Funds' internal control over financial"
"7778","reporting and their operation, including"
"7779","controls for safeguarding securities, that we"
"7780","consider to be a material weakness, as"
"7781","defined above, as of December 31, 2019."
