"813","of California and American Funds Tax-Exempt Fund of New York (hereafter referred to as the &#147;Funds&#148;) as of and for the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2018, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"

"818","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"819","A fund&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"

"823","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"824","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P> <P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"825","control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
