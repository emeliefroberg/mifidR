"1457","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Calvert"
"1458","Social Investment Fund:"
"1459","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"

"1461","Calvert Bond Fund, Calvert Equity Fund, Calvert"

"1467","September 30, 2018, in accordance with the standards"
"1468","of the Public Company Accounting"
"1469","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1470","Funds? internal control over financial"
"1471","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1472","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1473","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"1474","on the financial statements and to comply"
"1475","with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the"
"1476","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1477","effectiveness of the Funds? internal control over"
"1478","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"1479","such opinion."
"1480","Management of the Funds is responsible for"
"1481","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1482","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1483","estimates and judgments by management"
"1484","are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"1485","costs of controls. The Funds? internal"
"1486","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1487","provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1488","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1489","of financial statements for external"
"1490","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1491","accounting principles. The Funds? internal control"
"1492","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1493","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1494","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1495","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"1496","of the assets of the Funds; (2) provide reasonable"
"1497","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1498","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"1499","in accordance with generally accepted"
"1500","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1501","expenditures of the Funds are being made only in"
"1502","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1503","Trustees of the Funds; and (3) provide"
"1504","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1505","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"1506","disposition of the Funds? assets that could have a"
"1507","material effect on the financial statements."
"1508","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1509","financial reporting may not prevent or"
"1510","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"1511","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1512","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1513","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"1514","that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1515","procedures may deteriorate."
"1516","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1517","exists when the design or operation"
"1518","of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"1519","in the normal course of performing"
"1520","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1521","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"1522","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1523","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1524","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"1525","that a material misstatement of the Funds?"
"1526","annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1527","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1528","Our consideration of the Funds? internal control over"
"1529","financial reporting was for the limited"
"1530","purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1531","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1532","internal control that might be material weaknesses"
"1533","under standards established by the Public"
"1534","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1535","However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"1536","the Funds? internal control over financial reporting and"
"1537","its operation, including controls over"
"1538","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"1539","material weakness as defined above as of"
