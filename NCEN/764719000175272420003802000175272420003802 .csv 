"1987","<TEXT>"
"1988","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"1989","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1990","To the Board of Trustees of MFS Series Trust XV and the"
"1991","Shareholders of MFS Commodity Strategy Fund and MFS"
"1992","Global Alternative Strategy Fund:"
"1993","In planning and performing our audits of the consolidated"
"1994","financial statements of MFS Commodity Strategy Fund"
"1995","and subsidiary and the financial statements of MFS Global"
"1996","Alternative Strategy Fund (each a series of MFS Series"
"1997","Trust XV) (the Funds) as of and for the year ended"
"1998","October 31, 2019, in accordance with the standards of"
"1999","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"2000","States), we considered the Funds? internal control over"
"2001","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"2002","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"2003","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinions on"
"2004","the financial statements and to comply with the"
"2005","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"2006","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds?"
"2007","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"2008","express no such opinion."
"2009","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"2010","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"2011","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"2012","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"2013","assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"2014","controls.  A fund?s internal control over financial reporting"
"2015","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2016","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"2017","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"2018","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2019","principles.  A fund?s internal control over financial"
"2020","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"2021","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"2022","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2023","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"2024","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2025","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2026","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"2027","and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"2028","made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"2029","management of the fund and trustees of the trust; and"
"2030","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"2031","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"2032","disposition of a fund?s assets that could have a material"
"2033","effect on the financial statements."
"2034","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2035","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2036","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2037","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"2038","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2039","conditions or that the degree of compliance with the"
"2040","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2041","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"2042","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"2043","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"2044","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2045","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is"
"2046","a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2047","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"2048","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a"
"2049","fund?s annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"2050","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2051","Our consideration of the Funds? internal control over"
"2052","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"2053","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"2054","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"2055","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"2056","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"2057","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds? internal"
"2058","control over financial reporting and their operation,"
"2059","including controls for safeguarding securities, that we"
"2060","consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as"
"2061","of October 31, 2019."
"2062","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"2063","of management, the Board of Trustees of MFS Series"
"2064","Trust XV and the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"2065","and is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"2066","anyone other than these specified parties."
