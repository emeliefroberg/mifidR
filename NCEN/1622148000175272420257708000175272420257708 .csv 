"572","FIRM"
"573","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"574","Highland Global Allocation Fund"
"575","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"576","financial statements of Highland Global Allocation"
"577","Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year ended"
"578","September 30, 2020, in accordance with the standards"
"579","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"580","(United States), we considered the Funds internal"
"581","control over financial reporting, including controls"
"582","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"583","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"584","expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"585","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN,"
"586","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"587","the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"588","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no"
"589","such opinion."
"590","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"591","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"592","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"593","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"594","management are required to assess the expected"
"595","benefits and related costs of controls.  A funds"
"596","internal control over financial reporting is a"

"598","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"599","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"600","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"601","accounting principles (GAAP).  A funds internal"
"602","control over financial reporting includes those"
"603","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"604","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"605","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"606","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"607","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"608","as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"609","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that"
"610","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made"
"611","only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"612","and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"613","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"614","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"615","funds assets that could have a material effect on"
"616","the financial statements."
"617","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"618","control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"619","detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any"
"620","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"621","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"622","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"623","the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"624","procedures may deteriorate."
"625","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"626","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"627","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"628","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"629","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"630","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"631","or combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"632","over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"633","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"634","of the Funds annual or interim financial statements"
"635","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"636","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"637","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"638","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"639","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"640","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"641","standards established by the Public Company"
"642","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"643","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds"
"644","internal control over financial reporting and its"
"645","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"646","securities, that we consider to be a material"
"647","weakness as defined above as of September 30, 2020."
"648","This report is intended solely for the information"
"649","and use of management and the Board of Trustees of"
"650","the Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission"

"652","anyone other than these specified parties."
