"726","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"727","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"728","To the Trustees and Investors of"
"729","Worldwide Health Sciences Portfolio:"
"730","In planning and performing our audit of"
"731","the financial statements of Worldwide"
"732","Health Sciences Portfolio (the"
"733","?Portfolio?) as of and for the year"
"734","ended August 31, 2018, in accordance"
"735","with the standards of the Public"
"736","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"737","(United States) (PCAOB), we considered"
"738","the Portfolio?s internal control"
"739","over financial reporting, including"
"740","controls over safeguarding securities,"
"741","as a basis for designing our auditing"
"742","procedures for the purpose of"
"743","expressing our opinion on the financial"
"744","statements and to comply with the"
"745","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for"
"746","the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"747","the effectiveness of the"
"748","Portfolio?s internal control over"
"749","financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"750","express no such opinion."
"751","The management of the Portfolio is"
"752","responsible for establishing and"
"753","maintaining effective internal control"
"754","over"
"755","financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"756","responsibility, estimates and judgments"
"757","by management are required to"
"758","assess the expected benefits and"
"759","related costs of controls. A"
"760","portfolio?s internal control over"
"761","financial reporting is"
"762","a process designed to provide"
"763","reasonable assurance regarding the"
"764","reliability of financial reporting and"
"765","the"
"766","preparation of financial statements for"
"767","external purposes in accordance with"
"768","generally accepted accounting"
"769","principles. A portfolio?s internal"
"770","control over financial reporting"
"771","includes those policies and procedures"
"772","that (1)"
"773","pertain to the maintenance of records"
"774","that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"775","and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"776","dispositions of the assets of the"
"777","portfolio; (2) provide reasonable"
"778","assurance that transactions are"
"779","recorded as"
"780","necessary to permit preparation of"
"781","financial statements in accordance with"
"782","generally accepted accounting"
"783","principles, and that receipts and"
"784","expenditures of the portfolio are being"
"785","made only in accordance with"
"786","authorizations of management and"
"787","trustees of the portfolio; and (3)"
"788","provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"789","prevention or timely detection of"
"790","unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"791","disposition of a portfolio?s assets"
"792","that could"
"793","have a material effect on the financial"
"794","statements."
"795","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"796","internal control over financial"
"797","reporting may not prevent or detect"
"798","misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"799","evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"800","periods are subject to the risk that"
"801","controls may become inadequate because"
"802","of changes in conditions, or that the"
"803","degree of compliance with the"
"804","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"805","A deficiency in internal control over"
"806","financial reporting exists when the"
"807","design or operation of a control does"
"808","not"
"809","allow management or employees, in the"
"810","normal course of performing their"
"811","assigned functions, to prevent or"
"812","detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"813","A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"814","a combination of deficiencies, in"
"815","internal control over financial"
"816","reporting, such that there is a"
"817","reasonable possibility that a material"
"818","misstatement of"
"819","the portfolio?s annual or interim"
"820","financial statements will not be"
"821","prevented or detected on a timely"
"822","basis."
"823","Our consideration of the Portfolio?s"
"824","internal control over financial"
"825","reporting was for the limited purpose"
"826","described"
"827","in the first paragraph and would not"
"828","necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"829","in internal control that might be"
"830","material"
"831","weaknesses under standards established"
"832","by the PCAOB. However, we noted no"
"833","deficiencies in the Portfolio?s"
"834","internal control over financial"
"835","reporting and its operation, including"
"836","controls for safeguarding securities,"
"837","that we"
"838","consider to be a material weakness, as"
"839","defined above, as of August 31, 2018."
"840","This report is intended solely for the"
"841","information and use of management and"
"842","the Trustees of Worldwide Health"
