(Davis Selected Advisers, L.P.'s sub-adviser). The plaintiffs claim that the defendants (the Davis Entities) charged DNYVF excessive fees to manage DNYVF. In September of 2014, these two claims were consolidated into one lawsuit. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages and other relief. The Davis Entities believe that the action is without merit and have undertaken a vigorous defense in these proceedings. Although no determination can be made at this time, it is not anticipated that this lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on the Davis Entities, their assets, or the Fund.</div>"
