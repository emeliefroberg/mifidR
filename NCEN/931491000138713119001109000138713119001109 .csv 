"516","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"517","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"518","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures"
