"1686","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"1687","Firm"
"1688","To the Board of Trustees of Schroder Series Trust"
"1689","and Shareholders of Schroder Total Return Fixed"
"1690","Income Fund, Schroder Short Duration Bond Fund,"
"1691","Schroder Emerging Markets Small Cap Fund, Schroder"
"1692","Long Duration Investment-Grade Bond Fund, and"
"1693","Schroder Core Bond Fund"
"1694","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"1695","financial statements of Schroder Total Return Fixed"
"1696","Income Fund, Schroder Short Duration Bond Fund,"
"1697","Schroder Emerging Markets Small Cap Fund, Schroder"
"1698","Long Duration Investment-Grade Bond Fund, and"
"1699","Schroder Core Bond Fund (five of the Funds"
"1700","constituting Schroder Series Trust, hereafter"
"1701","collectively referred to as the Funds) as of and for"
"1702","the year ended October 31, 2019, in accordance with"
"1703","the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1704","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we"
"1705","considered the Funds internal control over financial"
"1706","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1707","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1708","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"1709","on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1710","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose"
"1711","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1712","Funds internal control over financial"
"1713","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"1714","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"1715","control over financial reporting."
"1716","The management of the Funds are responsible for"
"1717","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1718","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1719","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1720","management are required to assess the expected"
"1721","benefits and related costs of controls. A companys"
"1722","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1723","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1724","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1725","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"1726","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1727","accounting principles. A companys internal control"
"1728","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1729","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1730","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1731","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"1732","the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1733","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1734","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1735","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"1736","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1737","expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"1738","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1739","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1740","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"1741","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"1742","companys assets that could have a material effect on"
"1743","the financial statements."
"1744","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1745","control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"1746","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"1747","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1748","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1749","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"1750","the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1751","procedures may deteriorate."
"1752","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1753","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1754","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1755","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1756","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1757","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1758","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1759","control over financial reporting, such that there is"
"1760","a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1761","misstatement of the companys annual or interim"
"1762","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1763","detected on a timely basis."
"1764","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"1765","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1766","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1767","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"1768","control over financial reporting that might be"
"1769","material weaknesses under standards established by"
"1770","the PCAOB. However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"1771","Funds internal control over financial reporting and"
"1772","its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1773","securities, that we consider to be a material"
"1774","weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2019."
