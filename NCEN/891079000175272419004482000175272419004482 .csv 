"2828","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"2829","Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we"
"2830","considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2831","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"2832","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"2833","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"2834","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"2835","CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"2836","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2837","reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"2838","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2839","reporting."
"2840","The management of the Funds are responsible for"
"2841","establishing and maintaining effective internal control over"
"2842","financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"2843","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"2844","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's"
"2845","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"2846","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"2847","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"2848","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"2849","with generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's"
"2850","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"2851","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"2852","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2853","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"2854","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"2855","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"2856","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"2857","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"2858","the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"2859","authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and"
"2860","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"2861","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"2862","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"2863","effect on the financial statements."
"2864","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2865","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2866","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"2867","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2868","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"2869","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"2870","deteriorate."
"2871","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2872","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"2873","management or employees, in the normal course of"
"2874","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"

"2877","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"2878","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2879","funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"2880","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2881","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"2882","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"

"2884","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that"

"2906","Highland Global Allocation Fund (the Fund)"
"2907","Item G.1.a.i. - Legal Proceedings"
"2908","Case or Docket Number: 3:18-cv-02360-M"
"2909","Full Names of Principal Parties: Susan Lanotte,"
"2910","derivatively on behalf of Highland Global Allocation"
"2911","fund, and on behalf of herself and all others similarly"
"2912","situated v. Highland Capital Management Fund"
"2913","Advisors, L.P., Timothy Hui, Bryan Ward, Bob Froehlich,"
"2914","John Honis, Ethan Powell, Highland Global Allocation"
"2915","Brief Description: The Fund received a shareholder"
"2916","demand letter dated March 1, 2018, from an individual"
"2917","purporting to be a shareholder of the Fund (the"
"2918","Demand Letter). The Demand Letter alleges that the"
"2919","current and former Board breached their fiduciary"
"2920","duties, and the Investment Adviser breached its"
"2921","advisory agreement, in relation to the Fund's"
"2922","investment in shares of an affiliated mutual fund, the"
"2923","Highland Energy MLP Fund (also a series of the Trust)."
"2924","The Fund holds $17.4 million (or 58.5%) of the Highland"
"2925","Energy MLP Fund. Upon receipt of the Demand Letter,"
"2926","the Board formed a Demand Review Committee"
"2927","(DRC) comprised entirely of independent trustees to"
"2928","investigate these claims and to make a"
"2929","recommendation to the Board regarding whether"
"2930","pursuit of these claims is in the best interests of the"
"2931","Fund. Aided by independent counsel to the committee,"
"2932","the DRC engaged in a thorough and detailed review of"
"2933","the allegations contained in the Demand Letter. Upon"
"2934","completion of its evaluation, the DRC recommended"
"2935","that the Fund's independent trustees, who represent a"
"2936","majority of the Board, reject the demand specified in"
"2937","the shareholder Demand Letter. After considering the"
"2938","report of the DRC, the independent trustees"
"2939","unanimously agreed and rejected the demand, noting"
"2940","that the Demand Letter contained material factual"
"2941","errors and incorrect assumptions, and the proposed suit"
"2942","was meritless and should not be pursued. A copy of the"
"2943","report was provided to the purported shareholder and"
"2944","her counsel."
"2945","Notwithstanding the foregoing, the purported"
"2946","shareholder (the Plaintiff) filed a shareholder"
"2947","derivative suit against the Fund, certain members of the"
"2948","Board and the Investment Adviser on September 5,"
"2949","2018 (the Shareholder Litigation). Based on the"
"2950","extensive pre-suit investigation and the resulting report,"
"2951","the Fund, Board and Investment Adviser believe the"
"2952","claims made in the Shareholder Litigation are without"
"2953","merit and intend to vigorously defend against them. The"
"2954","case is Lanotte v. Highland Global Allocation Fund et al,"
"2955","3:18-cv-02360, U.S. District Court for the Northern"
"2956","District of Texas (Dallas). The Demand Letter and the"
"2957","Shareholder Litigation are not related to the Proposals"
"2958","and do not alter the intention of the Fund and the"
"2959","Investment Adviser to redomicile the Fund and convert"
"2960","the Fund into a closed-end fund."

"2969","RE: Report on Internal Controls - Highland Funds II"
"2970","Within 90 days prior to the filing date of the"
"2971","Shareholder Report on Form N-CSR, Management"
"2972","carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the"
"2973","design and operation of the Registrant's disclosure"
"2974","controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the"
"2975","principal executive officer and principal financial officer"
"2976","concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and"
"2977","procedures were not effective due to a material"
"2978","weakness for the Highland Global Allocation Fund (the"
"2979","Fund) relating to the application of ASC 820 and"
"2980","reasonableness and reliability of assumptions used in"
"2981","the fair value model which are monitored by the"
"2982","Valuation Committee through the operation of a review"
"2983","control. This control was not designed at an appropriate"
"2984","level of precision to ensure the accurate valuation of"
"2985","Level 3 securities. A material weakness (as defined in"
"2986","Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) is a deficiency, or a"
"2987","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"2988","financial reporting such that there is a reasonable"
"2989","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2990","Registrant's annual or interim financial statements will"
"2991","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. This"
"2992","material weakness resulted in material pricing errors"
"2993","related to a hard-to-value security held by Fund, over a"
"2994","period of time, which resulted in the reprocessing of"
"2995","investor capital activity, as well as material"
"2996","misstatements to the Fund's semi-annual financial"
"2997","statements as of March 31, 2018 and a material error"
"2998","that was corrected in the annual financial statements"
"2999","for the year ended September 30, 2018. Additionally,"
"3000","this material weakness could result in a misstatement to"
"3001","the investment balances or disclosures that would"
"3002","result in a material misstatement to the annual or"
"3003","interim financial statements that would not be"
"3004","prevented or detected."
"3005","Management has developed a plan to remediate the"
"3006","material weakness described above. Management"
"3007","utilizes a Valuation Sub-Committee as part of its existing"
"3008","valuation process. Management will undertake the"
"3009","addition of a review control by adding one or more"
"3010","members to the Valuation Sub-Committee to conduct"
"3011","control activities designed to operate at a level of"
"3012","precision which will enable such errors to be detected."
"3013","Additionally, Management will undertake"
"3014","enhancements to its Valuation Committee by providing"
"3015","training materials to members of its Valuation"
"3016","Committee with respect to the application of ASC 820"
"3017","as well as the usage of subject matter expert inputs as"
"3018","inputs to fair value determinations. Finally,"
"3019","management will undertake enhancements to its"
"3020","review control by designing additional control activities"
"3021","to more precisely assess the application of ASC 820 to"
"3022","fair value models."
