"657","<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>The management of the Funds is responsible"

"660","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"661","and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"662","A fund&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"663","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"664","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"665","with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"666","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"667","use or disposition of a fund&rsquo;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"

"669","<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"670","control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"

"672","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"

"676","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination"
"677","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
