"867","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"868","Accounting Firm"
"869","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of"
"870","Calvert Variable Series, Inc.:"
"871","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"872","financial statements of Calvert VP SRI Balanced"
"873","Portfolio and Calvert VP SRI Mid Cap Portfolio,"
"874","each a series of Calvert Variable Series, Inc."
"875","(hereafter referred to as the Funds), as of and"
"876","for the year ended December 31, 2018, in"
"877","accordance with the standards of the Public"
"878","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"879","States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"880","control over financial reporting, including"
"881","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"882","for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"883","purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"884","financial statements and to comply with the"
"885","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the"
"886","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"887","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"888","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"889","such opinion."
"890","Management of the Funds is responsible for"
"891","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"892","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"893","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"894","management are required to assess the expected"
"895","benefits and related costs of controls. The"
"896","Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"897","is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"898","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"899","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"900","statements for external purposes in accordance"
"901","with generally accepted accounting principles."
"902","The Funds' internal control over financial"
"903","reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"904","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"905","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"906","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"907","assets of the Funds; (2) provide reasonable"
"908","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"909","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"910","statements in accordance with generally"
"911","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"912","and expenditures of the Funds are being made"
"913","only in accordance with authorizations of"
"914","management and directors of the Funds; and (3)"
"915","provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"916","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"917","acquisition, use, or disposition of the Funds'"
"918","assets that could have a material effect on the"
"919","financial statements."
"920","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"921","control over financial reporting may not prevent"
"922","or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"923","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"924","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"925","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"926","that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"927","or procedures may deteriorate."
"928","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"929","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"930","a control does not allow management or"
"931","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"932","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"933","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"934","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"935","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"936","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"937","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"938","Funds' annual or interim financial statements"
"939","will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"940","basis."
"941","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control"
"942","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"943","purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"944","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"945","internal control that might be material"
"946","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"947","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"948","(United States). However, we noted no"
"949","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over"
"950","financial reporting and its operation, including"
"951","controls over safeguarding securities that we"
"952","consider to be a material weakness as defined"
"953","above as of December 31, 2018."
"954","This report is intended solely for the information"
"955","and use of management and the Board of"
"956","Directors of the Funds and the Securities and"
"957","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be"
"958","and should not be used by anyone other than"
"959","these specified parties."
