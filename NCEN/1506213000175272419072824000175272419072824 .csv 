"1030","Strategy ETF, Strategy Shares EcoLogical Strategy ETF,"
"1031","and Strategy Shares NASDAQ 7 HANDL(TM) Index ETF and Board"

"1036","Shares EcoLogical Strategy ETF (formally EcoLogical Strategy"
"1037","ETF), and Strategy Shares NASDAQ 7 HANDL(TM) Index ETF"
"1038","(the Funds), each a series of Strategy Shares, as of and"
"1039","for the year ended April 30, 2019, in accordance with the"
"1040","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1041","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control"
"1042","over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1043","securities, as a basis for designing  our auditing procedures"
"1044","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1045","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN,"
"1046","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1047","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1048","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1049","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"1050","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1051","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1052","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"1053","benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal"
"1054","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"1055"," reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"1056","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"1057","purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles"
"1058","(GAAP).  A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1059","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1060"," records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"1061","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"1062","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1063","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"1064","with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"1065","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"1066","of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1067","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"1068","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1069","financial statements."
"1070","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1071"," reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"1072","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1073","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1074","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1075","procedures may deteriorate."
"1076","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1077"," the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1078","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"1079","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness"
"1080","is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"1081","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1082","material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial statements"
"1083","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1084","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"1085","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1086","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"1087","material weaknesses under  standards established by the Public Company"
