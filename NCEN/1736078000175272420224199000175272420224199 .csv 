"2008","Board (United States), we considered the Funds"
"2009","internal control over financial reporting, including"
"2010","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"2011","for designing our auditing procedures for the"

"2015","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"2016","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"

"2030","control over financial reporting includes those"

"2032","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"2033","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2034","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"2035","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"

"2045","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"2046","control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
