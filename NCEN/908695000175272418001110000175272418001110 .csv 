"4454","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"4455","To the Shareholders and"
"4456","Board of Trustees of USAA Mutual Funds Trust"
"4457","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of the USAA"
"4458","Mutual Funds Trust (comprising the USAA Aggressive Growth Fund, the USAA"
"4459","Capital Growth Fund,  the USAA Growth & Income Fund, the USAA Growth Fund,"
"4460","the USAA High Income Fund, the USAA Income Fund, the USAA Income Stock Fund,"
"4461","the USAA Intermediate-Term Bond Fund, the USAA Money Market Fund, the USAA"
"4462","Science & Technology Fund, the USAA Short-Term Bond Fund, the USAA Small Cap"
"4463","Stock Fund, and the USAA Value Fund) as of and for the year ended July 31,"
"4464","2018, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"4465","Oversight Board (United States), we considered USAA Mutual Funds Trusts"
"4466","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"4467","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"4468","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"4469","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"4470","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of USAA Mutual Funds Trusts"
"4471","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"4472","opinion."
"4473","The management of USAA Mutual Funds Trust is responsible for establishing"
"4474","and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"4475","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"4476","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"4477","USAA Mutual Funds Trusts internal control over financial reporting is a"
"4478","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability"
"4479","of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"4480","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"4481","principles. USAA Mutual Funds Trusts internal control over financial"
"4482","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"4483","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"4484","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of  USAA Mutual"
"4485","Funds Trust; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"4486","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"4487","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"4488","receipts and expenditures of USAA Mutual Funds Trust are being made only"
"4489","in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of USAA"
"4490","Mutual Funds Trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"4491","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"4492","disposition of USAA Mutual Funds Trusts assets that could have a"
"4493","material effect on the financial statements."
"4494","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"4495","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"4496","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"4497","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"4498","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"4499","procedures may deteriorate."
"4500","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"4501","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"4502","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"4503","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"4504","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"4505","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"4506","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of USAA Mutual"
"4507","Funds Trusts annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"4508","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"4509","Our consideration of USAA Mutual Funds Trusts internal control over"
"4510","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the"
"4511","first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"4512","in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"4513","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"4514","States). However, we noted no deficiencies in USAA Mutual Funds"
"4515","Trusts internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"4516","including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to"
"4517","be a material weakness as defined above as of July 31, 2018."
"4518","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"4519","management and the Board of Trustees of USAA Mutual Funds Trust and"
"4520","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be"
