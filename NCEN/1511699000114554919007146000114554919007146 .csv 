"1085","<DESCRIPTION>MUHLENKAMP FUND INTERNAL CONTROL LETTER"
"1086","<TEXT>"
"1087","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1088","To the Shareholders of Muhlenkamp Fund and"
"1089","Board of Trustees of Managed Portfolio Series"
"1090","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"1091","Muhlenkamp Fund (the Fund), a series of Managed Portfolio"
"1092","Series, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, in"
"1093","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1094","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's"
"1095","internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"1096","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1097","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1098","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"
"1099","the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"1100","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"1101","internal control over financial reporting."
"1102","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1103","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1104","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"1105","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"1106","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1107","controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"1108","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1109","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1110","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1111","generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  A"
"1112","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1113","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1114","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"1115","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"1116","the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1117","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1118","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"1119","GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"1120","being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1121","management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"1122","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"1123","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"1124","fund's assets that could have a material effect"
"1125","on the financial statements."
"1126","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1127","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"1128","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1129","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1130","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1131","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1132","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1133","the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"1134","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1135","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"1136","A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,"
"1137","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1138","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's"
"1139","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1140","detected on a timely basis."
