"937","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"938","for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting"
"939","principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes"
"940","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"941","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"942","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"943","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"944","statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles,"
"945","and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"946","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and"
"947","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"948","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company&#8217;s assets that could"
"949","have a material effect on the financial statements.</font></p>"
