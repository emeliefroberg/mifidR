"3530","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"3531","To the Board of Trustees of Franklin Global Trust and Shareholders of"
"3532","Franklin Emerging Market Debt Opportunities Fund,"
"3533","Franklin Global Listed Infrastructure Fund,"
"3534","Franklin International Growth Fund and Franklin International Small Cap Fund"
"3535","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"3536","Franklin Emerging Market Debt Opportunities Fund,"
"3537","Franklin Global Listed Infrastructure Fund,"
"3538","Franklin International Growth Fund and"
"3539","Franklin International Small Cap Fund (constituting Franklin Global Trust,"
"3540","hereafter collectively referred to as the Funds)as of and for the"
"3541","year ended July 31, 2018, in accordance with the standards of the"
"3542","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)(PCAOB),"
"3543","we considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"3544","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"3545","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"3546","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"3547","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"3548","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"3549","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"3550","internal control over financial reporting."
"3551","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"3552","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"3553","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"3554","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"3555","A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed"
"3556","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"3557","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"3558","purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"3559","A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"3560","policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records"
"3561","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"3562"," and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"3563","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"3564","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"3565","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"3566","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"3567","with authorizations of management and directors of the company;"
"3568","and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"3569","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"3570","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3571","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"3572","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"3573","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject"
"3574","to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes"
"3575","in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"3576","or procedures may deteriorate."
"3577","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"3578","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"3579","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"3580","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"3581","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"3582","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"3583","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's"
"3584","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"3585","detected on a timely basis."
"3586","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"3587","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"3588","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"3589","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"3590","weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB.  However, we"
"3591","noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"3592","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"3593","securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as defined"
"3594","above as of July 31, 2018."

"4065","acquire and hold as treasury shares, reissue for such consideration"
"4066","and on such terms as it may determine, or cancel, at its discretion"
"4067","from time to time, any Shares reacquired by the Trust.  The Board of"
"4068","Trustees may classify, reclassify or convert any unissued Shares or"
"4069","any Shares of the Trust or any Series or Class thereof, that were"
"4070","previously issued and are reacquired, into one or more Series or"
"4071","Classes that may be established and designated from time to time and,"
"4072","in connection therewith, cause some or all of the Shareholders of the"
"4073","Trust, such Series or Class to become Shareholders of such other Series"

"4080","Article V hereof.  Shareholders shall have no preemptive or other"
"4081","right to subscribe for new or additional authorized, but unissued Shares"
"4082","or other securities issued by the Trust or any Series thereof.  The Board of"
"4083","Trustees may from time to time divide or combine the Shares of the Trust"
"4084","or any particular Series thereof into a greater or lesser number of"
"4085","Shares of the Trust or that Series, respectively.  Such division or c"
"4086","ombination shall not materially change the proportionate beneficial"
"4087","interests of the holders of Shares of the Trust or that Series, as"
"4088","the case may be, in the Trust Property at the time of such division"
"4089","or combination that is held with respect to the Trust or that Series,"
"4090","as the case may be."
"4091","(d)	Any Trustee, officer or other agent of the Trust, and any"
"4092","organization in which any such Person has an economic or other"
"4093","interest, may acquire, own, hold and dispose of Shares in the"

"4095","authorized but unissued, or already outstanding, to the same"
"4096","extent as if such Person were not a Trustee, officer or other"
"4097","agent of the Trust; and the Trust or any Series may issue and"
"4098","sell and may purchase such Shares from any such Person or any"
"4099","such organization, subject to the limitations, restrictions or"

"4103","shall be recorded on the books of the Trust kept by the Trust"
"4104","or by a transfer or similar agent for the Trust, which books"
"4105","shall be maintained separately for the Shares of the Trust and"
"4106","each Series and each Class thereof that has been established"
"4107","and designated.  No certificates certifying the ownership of"
"4108","Shares shall be issued except as the Board of Trustees may"
"4109","otherwise determine from time to time.  The Board of Trustees"
"4110","may make such rules not inconsistent with the provisions of"
"4111","the 1940 Act as it considers appropriate for the issuance of"
"4112","Share certificates, the transfer of Shares of the Trust and"
"4113","each Series and Class thereof, if any, and similar matters."
"4114","The record books of the Trust as kept by the Trust or any"
"4115","transfer or similar agent, as the case may be, shall be"

"4129","adopted thereunder; provided, however, that the Board of Trustees may,"
"4130","in its sole discretion, permit the Principal Underwriter to impose a"
"4131","sales charge upon any such sale.  Every Shareholder by virtue of"

"4137","Shares shall be deemed to be personal property giving to Shareholders"
"4138","only the rights provided in this Declaration of Trust, the By-Laws,"

"4157","any time personally agree to pay.  Each Share, when issued on the"
"4158","terms determined by the Board of Trustees, shall be fully paid and"

"4201","this purpose.  Subject to Article II hereof, each such Series"
"4202","shall operate as a separate and distinct investment medium, with"
"4203","separately defined investment objectives and policies."
"4204","Shares of each Series (and Class where applicable) established and"
"4205","designated pursuant to this Section 6, unless otherwise provided"

"4218","purposes, subject only to the rights of creditors with respect to"

"4220","of the Trust.  Such consideration, assets, income, earnings, profits"
"4221","and proceeds thereof, from whatever source derived, including, without"
"4222","limitation, any proceeds derived from the sale, exchange or liquidation"
"4223","of such assets, and any funds or payments derived from any reinvestment"

"4225","to as assets held with respect to that Series.  In the event that"
"4226","there are any assets, income, earnings, profits and proceeds thereof,"
"4227","funds or payments which are not readily identifiable as assets held"
"4228","with respect to any particular Series (collectively General Assets),"
"4229","the Board of Trustees, or an appropriate officer as determined by"

"4243","obligations, costs, charges, reserves and expenses incurred, contracted"
"4244","for or otherwise existing with respect to a particular Series are herein"
"4245","referred to as liabilities held with respect to that Series.  Any"
"4246","liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges, reserves and expenses"
"4247","of the Trust which are not readily identifiable as being liabilities"
"4248","held with respect to any particular Series"
"4249","(collectively General Liabilities) shall be allocated by the Board"
"4250","of Trustees, or an appropriate officer as determined by the Board of"
"4251","Trustees, to and among any one or more of the Series in such manner"
"4252","and on such basis as the Board of Trustees in its sole discretion deems"
"4253","fair and equitable.  Each allocation of liabilities, debts, obligations,"
"4254","costs, charges, reserves and expenses by or under the direction of the"
"4255","Board of Trustees shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders"
"4256","of all Series for all purposes.  All Persons who have extended credit"
"4257","that has been allocated to a particular Series, or who have a claim or"
"4258","contract that has been allocated to any particular Series, shall look"
"4259","exclusively to the assets of that particular Series for payment of such"
"4260","credit, claim, or contract.  In the absence of an express contractual"
"4261","agreement so limiting the claims of such creditors, claimants and"
"4262","contract providers, each creditor, claimant and contract provider"
"4263","shall be deemed nevertheless to have impliedly agreed to such limitation."
"4264","Subject to the right of the Board of Trustees in its discretion to"
"4265","allocate General Liabilities as provided herein, the debts, liabilities,"
"4266","obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise"
"4267","existing with respect to a particular Series, whether such Series"
"4268","is now authorized and existing pursuant to this Declaration of Trust"
"4269","or is hereafter authorized and existing pursuant to this Declaration of"
"4270","Trust, shall be enforceable against the assets held with respect to that"
"4271","Series only, and not against the assets of any other Series or the Trust"
"4272","generally and none of the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses"
"4273","incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to the Trust"
"4274","generally or any other Series thereof shall be enforceable against the"
"4275","assets held with respect to such Series.  Notice of this limitation on"
"4276","liabilities between and among Series shall be set forth in the Certificate"
"4277","of Trust pursuant to the DSTA, and upon the giving of such notice in the"
"4278","Certificate of Trust, the statutory provisions of Section 3804 of the DSTA"
"4279","relating to limitations on liabilities between and among Series (and the"
"4280","statutory effect under Section 3804 of setting forth such notice in the"
"4281","Certificate of Trust) shall become applicable to the Trust and each Series."

"4283","related to the distribution of, and other identified expenses that"
"4284","should or may properly be allocated to, the Shares of a particular Class"
"4285","may be charged to and borne solely by such Class.  The bearing of"
"4286","expenses solely by a particular Class of Shares may be appropriately"
"4287","reflected (in a manner determined by the Board of Trustees) and may"
"4288","affect the net asset value attributable to, and the dividend, redemption"
"4289","and liquidation rights of, such Class.  Each allocation of liabilities,"
"4290","debts, obligations, costs, charges, reserves and expenses by or under"
"4291","the direction of the Board of Trustees shall be conclusive and binding"
"4292","upon the Shareholders of all Classes for all purposes.  All Persons"
"4293","who have extended credit that has been allocated to a particular Class,"
"4294","or who have a claim or contract that has been allocated to any particular"
"4295","Class, shall look, and may be required by contract to look, exclusively"
"4296","to that particular Class for payment of such credit, claim, or contract."
"4297","(c)	Dividends, Distributions and Redemptions.  Notwithstanding any"
"4298","other provisions of this Declaration of Trust, including, without"

"4301","or of any Series with respect to, nor any redemption of, the Shares of"
"4302","any Series or Class of such Series shall be effected by the Trust other"
"4303","than from the assets held with respect to such Series, nor, except as"
"4304","specifically provided in Section 7 of this Article III, shall any"

"4306","against the assets held with respect to any other Series or the Trust"
"4307","generally except, in the case of a right or claim against the assets"
"4308","held with respect to any other Series, to the extent that such"
"4309","Shareholder has such a right or claim hereunder as a Shareholder of"
"4310","such other Series.  The Board of Trustees shall have full discretion,"
"4311","to the extent not inconsistent with the 1940 Act, to determine which"
"4312","items shall be treated as income and which items as capital; and each"
"4313","such determination and allocation shall be conclusive and binding upon"
"4314","the Shareholders."
"4315","(d)	Voting.  All Shares of the Trust entitled to vote on a matter"
"4316","shall vote in the aggregate without differentiation between the Shares"
"4317","of the separate Series, if any, or separate Classes, if any; provided"
"4318","that (i) with respect to any matter that affects only the interests of"
"4319","some but not all Series, then only the Shares of such affected Series,"
"4320","voting separately, shall be entitled to vote on the matter, (ii) with"
"4321","respect to any matter that affects only the interests of some but not"
"4322","all Classes, then only the Shares of such affected Classes, voting"

"4324","notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any matter as to"
"4325","which the 1940 Act or other applicable law or regulation requires"
"4326","voting, by Series or by Class, then the Shares of the Trust shall"
"4327","vote as prescribed in such law or regulation."

"4332","shall carry proportionately all the rights and obligations of a"
"4333","whole Share of the Trust or such Series, including rights with"
"4334","respect to voting, receipt of dividends and distributions, redemption"
"4335"," of Shares and dissolution of the Trust or that Series."
"4336","(g)	Exchange Privilege.  The Board of Trustees shall have the"
"4337","authority to provide that the holders of Shares of any Series shall"
"4338","have the right to exchange said Shares for Shares of one or more"
"4339","other Series in accordance with such requirements and procedures as"
"4340","may be established by the Board of Trustees, and in accordance"
"4341","with the 1940 Act."
"4342","(h)	Combination of Series or Classes."
"4343","	The Board of Trustees shall have the authority, without the"
"4344","approval, vote or consent of the Shareholders of any Series, unless"
"4345","otherwise required by applicable law, to combine the assets and"
"4346","liabilities held with respect to any two or more Series into assets"
"4347","and liabilities held with respect to a single Series; provided that"
"4348","upon completion of such combination of Series, the interest of each"
"4349","Shareholder, in the combined assets and liabilities held with respect"
"4350","to the combined Series shall equal the interest of each such Shareholder"
"4351","in the aggregate of the assets and liabilities held with respect to the"
"4352","Series that were combined."
"4353","	The Board of Trustees shall have the authority, without the"
"4354","approval, vote or consent of the Shareholders of any Series or Class,"
"4355","unless otherwise required by applicable law, to combine, merge or"
"4356","otherwise consolidate the Shares of two or more Classes of Shares of a"
"4357","Series with and/or into a single Class of Shares of such Series,"
"4358","with such designation, preference, conversion or other rights,"
"4359","voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications,"
"4360","terms and conditions of redemption and other characteristics as the"
"4361","Trustees may determine; provided, however, that the Trustees shall"
"4362","provide written notice to the affected Shareholders of any such transaction."

"4374","quorum of Shareholders of such Class are present, or by action of the"
"4375","Shareholders of such Class by written consent without a meeting pursuant"
"4376","to Article V, Section 3; or (ii) at the discretion of the Board of"
"4377","Trustees either (A) at any time there are no Shares outstanding of"

"5164","that indemnification of the Agent is proper in the circumstances by (i)"

"5171","based upon a review of the facts, that the Agent was not liable by"
"5172","reason of Disqualifying Conduct, by (1) the vote of a majority of a"
"5173","quorum of the Trustees who are not (x) interested persons of the"
"5174","Trust as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, (y) parties to"

"5184","Agent shall provide a security for his undertaking, (ii) the Trust"
"5185","shall be insured against losses arising by reason of any lawful"
"5186","advances, or (iii) a majority of a quorum of the disinterested,"
"5187","non-party Trustees of the Trust, or an independent legal counsel"
"5188","in a written opinion, shall determine, based on a review of readily"
"5189","available facts (as opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), that"
"5190","there is reason to believe that the Agent ultimately will be found"
"5191","entitled to indemnification."
"5192","(e)	Other Contractual Rights.  Nothing contained in this"

"5673","EXHIBIT ITEM: Terms of new or amended securities"
"5674","GOF P10 06/18"
"5675","SUPPLEMENT DATED JUNE 8, 2018"
"5676","TO THE CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE PROSPECTUS"
"5677","OF EACH OF THE FUNDS LISTED BELOW"
"5678","Franklin Global Trust"
"5679","Franklin Global Listed Infrastructure Fund"
"5680","Franklin International Growth Fund"
"5681","Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund"
"5682","Notice of Automatic Conversion of Class C Shares to"
"5683","Class A Shares after 10 Year Holding Period"
"5684","At Board meetings held on February 26 and 27, 2018,"
"5685","the Board of Trustees approved an automatic conversion feature"
"5686","for the Fund's Class C shares (which includes Class C1 shares"
"5687","as applicable) that will automatically convert shareholders'"
"5688","Class C shares into Class A shares of the same Fund after"
"5689","they have been held for 10 years. After conversion, your new"
"5690","shares will be subject to Class A shares' lower Rule 12b-1 fees."
"5691","The conversion feature will become effective on or about October 5, 2018."
"5692","Later that month Class C shares of the Fund that have been outstanding"
"5693","for 10 years or more will automatically convert to Class A shares of"
"5694","such Fund on the basis of the relative net asset values of the"
"5695","two classes. Thereafter, Class C shares of the Fund will convert"
"5696","automatically to Class A shares of such Fund on a monthly basis"
"5697","in the month of, or the month following, the 10-year anniversary"
"5698","of the Class C shares' purchase date. Class C shares of the Fund"
"5699","acquired through automatic reinvestment of dividends or distributions"
"5700","will convert to Class A shares of the Fund on the conversion date"
"5701","pro rata with the converting Class C shares of the Fund that were"
"5702","not acquired through reinvestment of dividends or distributions."
"5703","Shareholders will not pay a sales charge, including a contingent"
"5704","deferred sales charge, upon the conversion of their Class C shares"
"5705","to Class A shares pursuant to this conversion feature. The automatic"
"5706","conversion of the Fund's Class C shares into Class A shares after"
"5707","the 10-year holding period is not expected to be a taxable event for"
"5708","federal income tax purposes. Shareholders should consult with their"
"5709","tax advisor regarding the state and local tax consequences of such"
"5710","conversions."
"5711","Class C shares held through a financial intermediary in an"
"5712","omnibus account will be converted into Class A shares only"
"5713","if the intermediary can document that the shareholder has met"
"5714","the required holding period. In certain circumstances, when shares"
"5715","are invested through retirement plans, omnibus accounts, and in"
"5716","certain other instances, the Fund and its agents may not have"
"5717","transparency into how long a shareholder has held Class C shares"
"5718","for purposes of determining whether such Class C shares are"
"5719","eligible for automatic conversion into Class A shares and the"
"5720","financial intermediary may not have the ability to track"
"5721","purchases to credit individual shareholders' holding periods."
"5722","This primarily occurs when shares are invested through certain"
"5723","record keepers for group retirement plans, where the intermediary"
"5724","cannot track share aging at the participant level.  In these"
"5725","circumstances, the Fund will not be able to automatically"
"5726","convert Class C shares into Class A shares as described above."
"5727","In order to determine eligibility for conversion in these"
"5728","circumstances, it is the responsibility of the shareholder or"
"5729","their financial intermediary to notify the Fund that the"
"5730","shareholder is eligible for the conversion of Class C shares to"
"5731","Class A shares, and the shareholder or their financial intermediary"
"5732","may be required to maintain and provide the Fund with records that"
"5733","substantiate the holding period of Class C shares. It is the"
"5734","financial intermediary's (and not the Fund's) responsibility to"
"5735","keep records and to ensure that the shareholder is credited"
"5736","with the proper holding period. Please consult with your"
"5737","financial intermediary about your shares' eligibility for"
"5738","this conversion feature."
"5739","Also effective October 5, 2018, new accounts or plans"
"5740","may not be eligible to purchase Class C shares of the"
"5741","Fund if it is determined that the intermediary cannot"
"5742","track shareholder holding periods to determine whether a"
"5743","shareholder's Class C shares are eligible for conversion to"
"5744","Class A shares.  Accounts or plans (and their successor,"
"5745","related and affiliated plans) that have Class C shares of the"
"5746","Fund available to participants on or before October 5, 2018, may"
"5747","continue to open accounts for new participants in such share class and"
"5748","purchase additional shares in existing participant accounts."
"5749","The Fund has no responsibility for overseeing, monitoring or"
"5750","implementing a financial intermediary's process for determining"
"5751","whether a shareholder meets the required holding period for conversion."
"5752","A financial intermediary may sponsor and/or control accounts, programs"
"5753","or platforms that impose a different conversion schedule or different"
"5754","eligibility requirements for the conversion of Class C shares into"
"5755","Class A shares. In these cases, Class C shareholders may convert to"
"5756","Class A shares under the policies of the financial intermediary and the"
"5757","conversion may be structured as an exchange of Class C shares for"
"5758","Class A shares of the same Fund. Financial intermediaries will be"
"5759","responsible for making such exchanges in those circumstances."
"5760","Please consult with your financial intermediary if you have any"
"5761","questions regarding your shares' conversion from Class C shares"
"5762","to Class A shares."
