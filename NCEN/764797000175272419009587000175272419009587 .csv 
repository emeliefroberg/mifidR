"5147","for the year ended December 31, 2018, in accordance with"
"5148","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"5149","Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Fund's"

"5152","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"5153","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"

"5159","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"

"5164","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"5165","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
