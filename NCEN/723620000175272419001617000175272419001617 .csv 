"4061","JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. et al. and numbered Adv."
"4062","No. 09-00504 (MG). In addition to the Fund, the lawsuit"
"4063","also names over five hundred other institutional"
"4064","investors as defendants. The lawsuit does not allege any"
"4065","misconduct by the defendants, but seeks to recover"
"4066","payments made by General Motors Corporation (n/k/a"
"4067","Motors Liquidation Company) and its affiliates"
"4068","(collectively, GM) to the defendants shortly prior to and"
"4069","after GM's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on June 1, 2009"
"4070","(the Petition Date). The complaint alleges that GM"
"4071","made the payments to the defendants under a certain"
"4072","term loan agreement, dated as of November 29, 2006,"
"4073","as amended by that first amendment dated as of March"
"4074","4, 2009 (the Term Loan Agreement); that the payments"
"4075","occurred both during the ninety (90) days prior to the"
"4076","Petition Date (the Prepetition Transfer) and after the"
"4077","Petition Date when all amounts due under the Term"
"4078","Loan Agreement were paid in full in connection with"
"4079","GM's postpetition financing (the Postpetition Transfer);"
"4080","that the lien purportedly securing the Term Loan"
"4081","Agreement was not perfected as of the Petition Date;"
"4082","and that the lenders under the Term Loan Agreement"
"4083","should therefore have been treated as unsecured"
"4084","creditors rather than paid in full as secured creditors."
"4085","The plaintiff seeks avoidance of the lien securing the"
"4086","Term Loan Agreement as unperfected under Section"
"4087","544(a) of the Bankruptcy Code; disgorgement of all"
"4088","amounts paid to the defendants as Postpetition Transfer"
"4089","(plus interest) under Section 549 of the Bankruptcy"
"4090","Code; and disallowance of any bankruptcy claims of the"
"4091","defendants against GM until they repay all such amounts"
"4092","under Section 502(d) of the Bankruptcy Code. On"
"4093","November 17, 2016, all claims against High Income"
"4094","relating to the Prepetition Transfer were dismissed from"
"4095","the action. On May 5, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court"
"4096","concluded the evidentiary portion of a trial on certain"
"4097","legal issues with respect to the defendants' right to the"
"4098","Postpetition Transfer. On September 26, 2017, the"
"4099","Bankruptcy Court issued its decision (a) the"
"4100","representative list of fixtures that still secure the term"
"4101","loan; and (b) the valuation of those fixtures. The"
"4102","Bankruptcy Court held that 33 of the 40 assets at issue"
"4103","were fixtures and that the majority of the assets should"
"4104","be valued on a going concern basis. The Motors"
"4105","Liquidation Company Avoidance Action Trust sought"
"4106","leave to appeal portions of the decision on October 10,"
"4107","2017. The motion for leave to appeal was denied on"
"4108","September 7, 2018. The parties agreed to attend"
"4109","mediation in front of David Geronemus, Esq. in an"
"4110","attempt to consensually resolve the dispute. While no"
"4111","resolution was reached on a global settlement, the"
"4112","mediation sessions helped narrow the remaining issues"
"4113","in the litigation. The parties are proceeding with"
"4114","additional discovery to continue narrowing the issues in"
"4115","the case and anticipate having another trial in the Spring"
"4116","of 2019 to determine whether an additional 11"
"4117","representative assets are fixtures. During 2009, High"
"4118","Income received pay downs from GM in connection with"
"4119","the term loan totaling approximately $5.9 million. High"
"4120","Income cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuit. If the"
"4121","lawsuit were to be decided or settled in a manner"
"4122","adverse to the Fund, the payment of such judgment or"
"4123","settlement could have an adverse effect on the Fund's"
"4124","NAV. However, no liability for litigation relating to this"
"4125","matter has been accrued in the financial statements as"
"4126","neither the likelihood nor the amount of any liability can"
"4127","reasonably be determined at this time. High Income will"
"4128","incur legal expenses associated with the defense of the"
"4129","lawsuit."
