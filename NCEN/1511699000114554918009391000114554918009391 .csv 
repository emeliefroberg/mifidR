"719","the year ended September 30, 2018, in accordance with the"

"723","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"724","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"725","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"726","comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not"
"727","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"

"735","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"736","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"737","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"738","generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  A"
"739","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"740","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"741","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"742","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"743","the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"

"756","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"757","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"758","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"759","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"760","the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"761","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"762","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"763","A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,"
"764","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"765","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds'"
"766","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"767","detected on a timely basis."
"768","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"769","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"770","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"771","that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"772","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"773","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial"
