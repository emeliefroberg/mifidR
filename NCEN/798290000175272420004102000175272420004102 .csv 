"2114","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2115","To the Board of Trustees of HSBC Funds and Shareholders of"
"2116","each of the eight funds listed below:"
"2117","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"2118","of HSBC Frontier Markets Fund, HSBC High Yield Fund, HSBC Strategic"
"2119","Income Fund, HSBC Opportunity Fund, HSBC Opportunity Fund (Class I),"
"2120","HSBC Opportunity Portfolio, HSBC U.S. Government Money Market Fund"
"2121","and HSBC U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund (constituting HSBC Funds,"
"2122","hereafter collectively referred to as the Funds) as of and for the"
"2123","year ended October 31, 2019, in accordance with the standards of the"
"2124","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),"
"2125","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"2126","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"2127","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"2128","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"2129","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"2130","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"2131","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"2132","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"2133","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"2134","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"2135","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"2136","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"2137","costs of controls.  A company's internal control over financial"
"2138","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2139","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"2140","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"2141","generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal"
"2142","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"2143","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"2144","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"2145","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"2146","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"2147","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2148","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"2149","and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"2150","only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"2151","of the company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"2152","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"2153","disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect"
"2154","on the financial statements."
"2155","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2156","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"2157","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"2158","are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"2159","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"2160","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2161","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2162","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"2163","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"2164","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"2165","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"2166","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"2167","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"2168","misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial"
"2169","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2170","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2171","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2172","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"2173","in internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"2174","weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB.  However,"
"2175","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over"
"2176","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"2177","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness"
"2178","as defined above as of October 31, 2019."
"2179","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"2180","management and the Board of Trustees of HSBC Funds and the"
"2181","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be"
"2182","and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"2183","parties."
