"783","including control"
"784","activities for"
"785","safeguarding securities,"
"786","as a basis for designing"
"787","our auditing procedures"
"788","for the purpose of"

"790","on the financial"
"791","statements and to"

"795","purpose of expressing"
"796","an opinion on the"
"797","effectiveness of the"
"798","Trust's internal control"
"799","over financial reporting."
"800","Accordingly, we"
"801","express no such"
"802","opinion."
"803","The management of the"
"804","Trust is responsible for"
"805","establishing and"
"806","maintaining effective"
"807","internal control over"
"808","financial reporting.   In"
"809","fulfilling this"
"810","responsibility, estimates"
"811","and judgments by"
"812","management are"
"813","required to assess the"
"814","expected benefits and"
"815","related costs of controls."
"816","A company's internal"
"817","control over financial"
"818","reporting is a process"
"819","designed to provide"
"820","reasonable assurance"
"821","regarding the reliability"

"865","disposition of a"
"866","company's assets that"

"868","effect on the financial"
"869","statements."
"870","Because of inherent"
"871","limitations, internal"
"872","control over financial"
"873","reporting may not"
"874","prevent or detect"
"875","misstatements.   Also,"
"876","projections of any"
"877","evaluation of"
"878","effectiveness to future"
"879","periods are subject to"
"880","the risk that controls"

"882","because of changes in"
"883","conditions, or that the"
"884","degree of compliance"
"885","with the policies or"
"886","procedures may"
"887","deteriorate."
"888","A deficiency in internal"
"889","control over financial"
"890","reporting exists when"
"891","the design or operation"
"892","of a control does not"
"893","allow management or"
"894","employees, in the"
"895","normal course of"
"896","performing their"
"897","assigned functions, to"
"898","prevent or detect"
"899","misstatements on a"
"900","timely basis.   A"
"901","material weakness is a"
"902","deficiency, or"
"903","combination of"
"904","deficiencies, in internal"
"905","control over financial"
"906","reporting, such that"
"907","there is a reasonable"
"908","possibility that a"
"909","material misstatement"
"910","of the company's"
"911","annual or interim"
"912","financial statements will"
"913","not be prevented or"
"914","detected on a timely"
"915","basis."

"920","Our consideration of the"

"922","over financial reporting"
"923","was for the limited"
"924","purpose described in the"
"925","first paragraph and"
"926","would not necessarily"
"927","disclose all deficiencies"

"930","weaknesses under"
"931","standards established by"
"932","the Public Company"
"933","Accounting Oversight"
"934","Board (United States)."
"935","However, we noted no"
"936","deficiencies in the"
"937","Trust's internal control"
"938","over financial reporting"
"939","and its operation,"
"940","including controls for"
"941","safeguarding securities,"
