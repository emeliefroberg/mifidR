"1946","To the Board of Trustees of Franklin Floating Rate Master Trust and"
"1947","Shareholders of Franklin Floating Rate Master Series,Franklin Lower"
"1948","Tier Floating Rate Fund and Franklin Middle Tier Floating Rate Fund"
"1949","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"

"1951","Rate Fund and Franklin Middle Tier Floating Rate Fund"
"1952","(constituting Franklin Floating Rate Master Trust, hereafter"
"1953","collectively referred to as the Funds) as of and for the year"
"1954","ended July 31, 2018, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1955","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),"
"1956","we considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"1957","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1958","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1959","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1960","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"1961","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"1962","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"1963","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"1964","financial reporting."
"1965","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1966","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1967","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1968","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"1969","costs of controls.  A company's internal control over financial"
"1970","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1971","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1972","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1973","generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal"
"1974","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1975","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"1976","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"1977","and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"1978","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1979","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1980","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"1981","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"1982","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"1983","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1984","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1985","use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material"
"1986","effect on the financial statements."
"1987","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1988","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"1989","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"1990","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1991","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1992","procedures may deteriorate."
"1993","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1994","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"1995","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1996","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"1997","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1998","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that"
"1999","there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2000","company's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"2001","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2002","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"2003","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2004","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"2005","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"2006","weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB.  However,"
"2007","we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over"
"2008","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"2009","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness"
"2010","as defined above as of July 31, 2018."

"2436","Section 1.	Division of Beneficial Interest."
"2437","(a)	The beneficial interest in the Trust shall be divided into"
"2438","Shares, each Share without a par value.  The number of Shares in the"
"2439","Trust authorized hereunder, and of each Series and Class as may be"
"2440","established from time to time, is unlimited.  The Board of Trustees"
"2441","may authorize the division of Shares into separate Classes of Shares"
"2442","and into separate and distinct Series of Shares and the division of"
"2443","any Series into separate Classes of Shares in accordance with the"
"2444","1940 Act.  The different Series and Classes shall be established and"
"2445","designated pursuant to Article III, Section 6 hereof.  If no separate"
"2446","Series or Classes of Series shall be established, the Shares shall"
"2447","have the rights, powers and duties provided for herein and in"
"2448","Article III, Section 6 hereof to the extent relevant and not"
"2449","otherwise provided for herein, and all references to Series and"
"2450","Classes shall be construed (as the context may require) to refer to"
"2451","the Trust."
"2452","	The fact that the Trust shall have one or more established and"
"2453","designated Classes of the Trust, shall not limit the authority of the"
"2454","Board of Trustees to establish and designate additional Classes of"
"2455","the Trust.  The fact that one or more Classes of the Trust shall have"
"2456","initially been established and designated without any specific"
"2457","establishment or designation of a Series (i.e., that all Shares of"
"2458","the Trust are initially Shares of one or more Classes) shall not"
"2459","limit the authority of the Board of Trustees to later establish and"
"2460","designate a Series and establish and designate the Class or Classes"
"2461","of the Trust as Class or Classes, respectively, of such Series."
"2462","	The fact that a Series shall have initially been established"
"2463","and designated without any specific establishment or designation of"
"2464","Classes (i.e., that all Shares of such Series are initially of a"
"2465","single Class) shall not limit the authority of the Board of Trustees"
"2466","to establish and designate separate Classes of said Series.  The"
"2467","fact that a Series shall have more than one established and"
"2468","designated Class, shall not limit the authority of the Board"
"2469","of Trustees to establish and designate additional Classes of said"
"2470","Series."
"2471","(b)	The Board of Trustees shall have the power to issue authorized,"
"2472","but unissued Shares of the Trust, or any Series and Class thereof,"
"2473","from time to time for such consideration paid wholly or partly in"
"2474","cash, securities or other property, as may be determined from time"
"2475","to time by the Board of Trustees, subject to any requirements or"
"2476","limitations of the 1940 Act.  The Board of Trustees, on behalf of"
"2477","the Trust, may acquire and hold as treasury shares, reissue for such"
"2478","consideration and on such terms as it may determine, or cancel, at"
"2479","its discretion from time to time, any Shares reacquired by the Trust."
"2480","  The Board of Trustees may classify, reclassify or convert any"
"2481","unissued Shares or any Shares of the Trust or any Series or Class"
"2482","thereof, that were previously issued and are reacquired, into one"
"2483","or more Series or Classes that may be established and designated from"
"2484","time to time and, in connection therewith, cause some or all of the"
"2485","Shareholders of the Trust, such Series or Class to become"
"2486","Shareholders of such other Series or Class.  Notwithstanding the"
"2487","foregoing, the Trust and any Series thereof may acquire, hold,"
"2488","sell and otherwise deal in, for purposes of investment or otherwise,"
"2489","the Shares of any other Series of the Trust or Shares of the Trust,"
"2490","and such Shares shall not be deemed treasury shares or cancelled."
"2491","(c)	Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Article III,"
"2492","each Share shall entitle the holder to voting rights as provided in"
"2493","Article V hereof.  Shareholders shall have no preemptive or other"
"2494","right to subscribe for new or additional authorized, but unissued"
"2495","Shares or other securities issued by the Trust or any Series thereof."
"2496","  The Board of Trustees may from time to time divide or combine the"
"2497","Shares of the Trust or any particular Series thereof into a greater"
"2498","or lesser number of Shares of the Trust or that Series, respectively."
"2499","Such division or combination shall not materially change the"
"2500","proportionate beneficial interests of the holders of Shares of the"
"2501","Trust or that Series, as the case may be, in the Trust Property at"
"2502","the time of such division or combination that is held with respect"
"2503","to the Trust or that Series, as the case may be."
"2504","(d)	Any Trustee, officer or other agent of the Trust, and any"
"2505","organization in which any such Person has an economic or other"
"2506","interest, may acquire, own, hold and dispose of Shares in the Trust"
"2507","or any Series and Class thereof, whether such Shares are authorized"
"2508","but unissued, or already outstanding, to the same extent as if such"
"2509","Person were not a Trustee, officer or other agent of the Trust; and"
"2510","the Trust or any Series may issue and sell and may purchase such"
"2511","Shares from any such Person or any such organization, subject to the"
"2512","limitations, restrictions or other provisions applicable to the sale"
"2513","or purchase of such Shares herein and the 1940 Act."
"2514","Section 2.	Ownership of Shares.  The ownership of Shares shall be"
"2515","recorded on the books of the Trust kept by the Trust or by a"
"2516","transfer or similar agent for the Trust, which books shall be"
"2517","maintained separately for the Shares of the Trust and each Series"
"2518","and each Class thereof that has been established and designated."
"2519","No certificates certifying the ownership of Shares shall be issued"
"2520","except as the Board of Trustees may otherwise determine from time"
"2521","to time.  The Board of Trustees may make such rules not inconsistent"
"2522","with the provisions of the 1940 Act as it considers appropriate for"
"2523","the issuance of Share certificates, the transfer of Shares of the"
"2524","Trust and each Series and Class thereof, if any, and similar matters."
"2525","The record books of the Trust as kept by the Trust or any transfer"
"2526","or similar agent, as the case may be, shall be conclusive as to who"
"2527","are the Shareholders of the Trust and each Series and Class thereof"
"2528","and as to the number of Shares of the Trust and each Series and"
"2529","Class thereof held from time to time by each such Shareholder."
"2530","Section 3.	Sale of Shares.  Subject to the 1940 Act and a"
"2531","pplicable law, the Trust may sell its authorized but unissued Shares"
"2532","to such Persons, at such times, on such terms, and for such"
"2533","consideration as the Board of Trustees may from time to time"
"2534","authorize.  Each sale shall be credited to the individual purchaser's"
"2535","account in the form of full or fractional Shares of the Trust or such"
"2536","Series thereof (and Class thereof, if any), as the purchaser may"
"2537","select, at the net asset value per Share, subject to Section 22 of"
"2538","the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder;"
"2539","provided, however, that the Board of Trustees may, in its sole"
"2540","discretion, permit the Principal Underwriter to impose a sales charge"
"2541","upon any such sale.  Every Shareholder by virtue of having become a"
"2542","Shareholder shall be bound by the terms of this Declaration of Trust."
"2543","Ownership of Shares shall not make any Shareholder a third-party"

"2546","Shares shall be deemed to be personal property giving to Shareholders"
"2547","only the rights provided in this Declaration of Trust, the By-Laws,"
"2548","and under applicable law.  Ownership of Shares shall not entitle the"
"2549","Shareholder to any title in or to the whole or any part of the Trust"
"2550","Property or right to call for a partition or division of the same or"

"2565","payment of any sum of money other than such as the Shareholder may at"
"2566","any time personally agree to pay.  Each Share, when issued on the"
"2567","terms determined by the Board of Trustees, shall be fully paid and"

"2577","Section 6.	Establishment and Designation of Series and Classes."
"2578","The establishment and designation of any Series or Class shall be"
"2579","effective, without the requirement of Shareholder approval, upon the"
"2580","adoption of a resolution by not less than a majority of the then"
"2581","Board of Trustees, which resolution shall set forth such"
"2582","establishment and designation whether directly in such resolutions"
"2583","or by reference to, or approval of, another document that sets"
"2584","forth the designation or otherwise identifies such Series or Class,"

"2595","Each Series shall be separate and distinct from any other Series,"
"2596","separate and distinct records on the books of the Trust shall be"
"2597","maintained for each Series, and the assets and liabilities belonging"
"2598","to any such Series shall be held and accounted for separately from"
"2599","the assets and liabilities of the Trust or any other Series.  Each"
"2600","Class of the Trust shall be separate and distinct from any other"
"2601","Class of the Trust.  Each Class of a Series shall be separate and"
"2602","distinct from any other Class of the Series.  As appropriate, in a"
"2603","manner determined by the Board of Trustees, the liabilities"
"2604","belonging to any such Class shall be held and accounted for"
"2605","separately from the liabilities of the Trust, the Series or any other"
"2606","Class and separate and distinct records on the books of the Trust for"

"2610","objectives and policies."
"2611","Shares of each Series (and Class where applicable) established and"
"2612","designated pursuant to this Section 6, unless otherwise provided to"

"2615","powers and duties:"
"2616","(a)	Assets Held with Respect to a Particular Series.  All"
"2617","consideration received by the Trust for the issue or sale of Shares"
"2618","of a particular Series, together with all assets in which such"
"2619","consideration is invested or reinvested, all income, earnings,"

"2624","the same may be, shall irrevocably be held with respect to that"
"2625","Series for all purposes, subject only to the rights of creditors"
"2626","with respect to that Series, and shall be so recorded upon the books"
"2627","of account of the Trust.  Such consideration, assets, income,"
"2628","earnings, profits and proceeds thereof, from whatever source derived,"
"2629","including, without limitation, any proceeds derived from the sale,"
"2630","exchange or liquidation of such assets, and any funds or payments"
"2631","derived from any reinvestment of such proceeds, in whatever form the"
"2632","same may be, are herein referred to as assets held with respect to
 that Series.  In the event that there are any assets, income,"
"2633","earnings, profits and proceeds thereof, funds or payments which are"
"2634","not readily identifiable as assets held with respect to any"
"2635","particular Series (collectively General Assets), the Board of"
"2636","Trustees, or an appropriate officer as determined by the Board of"
"2637","Trustees, shall allocate such General Assets to, between or among"
"2638","any one or more of the Series in such manner and on such basis as"
"2639","the Board of Trustees, in its sole discretion, deems fair and"
"2640","equitable, and any General Asset so allocated to a particular Series"
"2641","shall be held with respect to that Series.  Each such allocation by"
"2642","or under the direction of the Board of Trustees shall be conclusive"
"2643","and binding upon the Shareholders of all Series for all purposes."
"2644","(b)	Liabilities Held with Respect to a Particular Series or Class."
"2645","The assets of the Trust held with respect to a particular Series"
"2646","shall be charged with the liabilities, debts, obligations, costs,"

"2648","for or otherwise existing with respect to such Series.  Such"
"2649","liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges, reserves and"
"2650","expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect"
"2651","to a particular Series are herein referred to as liabilities held
with respect to that Series.  Any liabilities, debts, obligations,"
"2652","costs, charges, reserves and expenses of the Trust which are not"
"2653","readily identifiable as being liabilities held with respect to any"
"2654","particular Series (collectively General Liabilities) shall be"
"2655","allocated by the Board of Trustees, or an appropriate officer as"
"2656","determined by the Board of Trustees, to and among any one or more of"
"2657","the Series in such manner and on such basis as the Board of"
"2658","Trustees in its sole discretion deems fair and equitable.  Each"
"2659","allocation of liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges,"
"2660","reserves and expenses by or under the direction of the Board of"
"2661","Trustees shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders of all"
"2662","Series for all purposes.  All Persons who have extended credit that"
"2663","has been allocated to a particular Series, or who have a claim or"
"2664","contract that has been allocated to any particular Series, shall look"
"2665","exclusively to the assets of that particular Series for payment of"
"2666","such credit, claim, or contract.  In the absence of an express"
"2667","contractual agreement so limiting the claims of such creditors,"
"2668","claimants and contract providers, each creditor, claimant and"
"2669","contract provider shall be deemed nevertheless to have impliedly"
"2670","agreed to such limitation."
"2671","Subject to the right of the Board of Trustees in its discretion to"
"2672","allocate General Liabilities as provided herein, the debts,"
"2673","liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or"
"2674","otherwise existing with respect to a particular Series, whether such"
"2675","Series is now authorized and existing pursuant to this Declaration"
"2676","of Trust or is hereafter authorized and existing pursuant to this"
"2677","Declaration of Trust, shall be enforceable against the assets held"
"2678","with respect to that Series only, and not against the assets of any"
"2679","other Series or the Trust generally and none of the debts,"
"2680","liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or"
"2681","otherwise existing with respect to the Trust generally or any other"
"2682","Series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets held with"
"2683","respect to such Series.  Notice of this limitation on liabilities"
"2684","between and among Series shall be set forth in the Certificate of"
"2685","Trust pursuant to the DSTA, and upon the giving of such notice in"
"2686","the Certificate of Trust, the statutory provisions of Section 3804"
"2687","of the DSTA relating to limitations on liabilities between and among"
"2688","Series (and the statutory effect under Section 3804 of setting forth"
"2689","such notice in the Certificate of Trust) shall become applicable to"
"2690","the Trust and each Series."
"2691","Liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges, reserves and expenses"
"2692","related to the distribution of, and other identified expenses that"
"2693","should or may properly be allocated to, the Shares of a particular"
"2694","Class may be charged to and borne solely by such Class.  The bearing"
"2695","of expenses solely by a particular Class of Shares may be appropriat"
"2696","ely reflected (in a manner determined by the Board of Trustees) and"
"2697","may affect the net asset value attributable to, and the dividend,"
"2698","redemption and liquidation rights of, such Class.  Each allocation"
"2699","of liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges, reserves and"
"2700","expenses by or under the direction of the Board of Trustees shall"
"2701","be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders of all Classes for"
"2702","all purposes.  All Persons who have extended credit that has been"
"2703","allocated to a particular Class, or who have a claim or contract"
"2704","that has been allocated to any particular Class, shall look, and may"
"2705","be required by contract to look, exclusively to that particular Class"
"2706","for payment of such credit, claim, or contract."
"2707","(c)	Dividends, Distributions and Redemptions.  Notwithstanding any"

"2711","Trust or of any Series with respect to, nor any redemption of, the"
"2712","Shares of any Series or Class of such Series shall be effected by the"

"2717","other Series or the Trust generally except, in the case of a right or"
"2718","claim against the assets held with respect to any other Series, to"
"2719","the extent that such Shareholder has such a right or claim hereunder"
"2720","as a Shareholder of such other Series.  The Board of Trustees shall"
"2721","have full discretion, to the extent not inconsistent with the 1940"
"2722","Act, to determine which items shall be treated as income and which"
"2723","items as capital; and each such determination and allocation shall be"
"2724","conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders."
"2725","(d)	Voting.  All Shares of the Trust entitled to vote on a matter"
"2726","shall vote in the aggregate without differentiation between the"
"2727","Shares of the separate Series, if any, or separate Classes, if any;"
"2728","provided that (i) with respect to any matter that affects only the"
"2729","interests of some but not all Series, then only the Shares of such"
"2730","affected Series, voting separately, shall be entitled to vote on"
"2731","the matter, (ii) with respect to any matter that affects only the"
"2732","interests of some but not all Classes, then only the Shares of such"
"2733","affected Classes, voting separately, shall be entitled to vote on"
"2734","the matter; and (iii) notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to"
"2735","any matter as to which the 1940 Act or other applicable law or"
"2736","regulation requires voting, by Series or by Class, then the Shares"
"2737","of the Trust shall vote as prescribed in such law or regulation."

"2739","equal to each other Share of such Series (subject to the rights"
"2740","and preferences with respect to separate Classes of such Series)."
"2741","(f)	Fractions.  A fractional Share of the Trust or a Series shall"
"2742","carry proportionately all the rights and obligations of a whole"
"2743","Share of the Trust or such Series, including rights with respect to"
"2744","voting, receipt of dividends and distributions, redemption of Shares"
"2745","and dissolution of the Trust or that Series."
"2746","(g)	Exchange Privilege.  The Board of Trustees shall have the"

"2750","as may be established by the Board of Trustees, and in accordance"
"2751","with the 1940 Act."
"2752","(h)	Combination of Series or Classes."

"2754","approval, vote or consent of the Shareholders of any Series, unless"
"2755","otherwise required by applicable law, to combine the assets and"

"2760","to the combined Series shall equal the interest of each such"
"2761","Shareholder in the aggregate of the assets and liabilities held with"
"2762","respect to the Series that were combined."
"2763","	The Board of Trustees shall have the authority, without the"

"2769","powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications,"
"2770","terms and conditions of redemption and other characteristics as the"

"3370","the case may be, and the Board of Trustees may abolish any such"
"3371","reserve in the manner in which the reserve was created."

"3486","reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such"
"3487","Agent (such conduct referred to herein as Disqualifying Conduct),"
"3488","and for nothing else."
"3489","(c)	Subject to subsection (b) of this Section 1 and to the fullest"

"3493","Investment Adviser or Principal Underwriter of the Trust."
"3494","(d)	No Agent, when acting in its respective capacity as such,"

"3526","control restrictions which might affect the liquidity of the Trust's"
"3527","assets or from any war or political act of any foreign government to"
"3528","which such assets might be exposed, except, in the case of a Trustee"

"3541","law, any Person who was or is a party, potential party or non-party"
"3542","witness or is threatened to be made a party, potential party or"
"3543","non-party witness to any Proceeding by reason of the fact that such"
"3544","Person is or was an Agent of the Trust, against Expenses, judgments,"
"3545","fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably"
"3546","incurred in connection with such Proceeding if such Person acted in"
"3547","good faith or in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no"
"3548","reasonable cause to believe the conduct of such Person was unlawful."
"3549","The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,"

"3554","(b)	Exclusion of Indemnification.  Notwithstanding any provision to"

"3561","which that action was brought shall determine, upon application or"
"3562","otherwise, that in view of all the circumstances of the case, that"
"3563","Person was not liable by reason of that Person's Disqualifying"
"3564","Conduct."
"3565","(c)	Required Approval.  Any indemnification under this Article shall"
"3566","be made by the Trust if authorized in the specific case on a"
"3567","determination that indemnification of the Agent is proper in the"
"3568","circumstances by (i) a final decision on the merits by a court or"
"3569","other body before whom the proceeding was brought that the Agent was"
"3570","not liable by reason of Disqualifying Conduct (including, but not"
"3571","limited to, dismissal of either a court action or an administrative"
"3572","proceeding against the Agent for insufficiency of evidence of any"
"3573","Disqualifying Conduct) or, (ii) in the absence of such a decision,"
"3574","a reasonable determination, based upon a review of the facts, that"
"3575","the Agent was not liable by reason of Disqualifying Conduct, by"
"3576","(1) the vote of a majority of a quorum of the Trustees who are not"
"3577","(x) interested persons of the Trust as defined in Section 2(a)(19)"
"3578","of the 1940 Act, (y) parties to the proceeding, or (z) parties who"

"3588","one of the following conditions for the advancement of expenses is"
"3589","met: (i) the Agent shall provide a security for his undertaking,"

"3591","any lawful advances, or (iii) a majority of a quorum of the"
"3592","disinterested, non-party Trustees of the Trust, or an independent"
"3593","legal counsel in a written opinion, shall determine, based on a"
"3594","review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial-type"
"3595","inquiry), that there is reason to believe that the Agent ultimately"
"3596","will be found entitled to indemnification."
"3597","(e)	Other Contractual Rights.  Nothing contained in this Article"
"3598","shall affect any right to indemnification to which Persons other"
"3599","than Trustees and officers of the Trust or any subsidiary thereof may"
"3600","be entitled by contract or otherwise."
"3601","(f)	Fiduciaries of Employee Benefit Plan.  This Article does not"
"3602","apply to any Proceeding against any trustee, investment manager or"
"3603","other fiduciary of an employee benefit plan in that Person's capacity"
"3604","as such, even though that Person may also be an Agent of the Trust"
"3605","as defined in Section 1 of this Article.  Nothing contained in this"
"3606","Article shall limit any right to indemnification to which such a"
"3607","trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary may be entitled by"
"3608","contract or otherwise which shall be enforceable to the extent"
"3609","permitted by applicable law other than this Article."
"3610","(g)	Joint and Several Obligations.  Notwithstanding any other"
"3611","provision in this Declaration of Trust to the contrary, any amount"
"3612","of indemnification and any advancement of expenses that any Agent"
"3613","is entitled to be paid under Section 2 shall be deemed to be joint"
"3614","and several obligations of the Trust and each Series, and the assets"
"3615","of the Trust and each Series shall be subject to the claims of any"
"3616","Agent therefor under this Article VII; provided that any such"
"3617","liability, expense or obligation may be allocated and charged by"
"3618","the Board of Trustees between or among the Trust and/or any one or"
"3619","more Series (and Classes) in such manner as the Board of Trustees"
"3620","in its sole discretion deem fair and equitable."
"3621","Section 3.	Insurance.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable"
"3622","law, the Board of Trustees shall have the authority to purchase"
"3623","with Trust Property, insurance for liability and for all Expenses"
"3624","reasonably incurred or paid or expected to be paid by an Agent in"
"3625","connection with any Proceeding in which such Agent becomes involved"
"3626","by virtue of such Agent's actions, or omissions to act, in its"
"3627","capacity or former capacity with the Trust, whether or not the Trust"
"3628","would have the power to indemnify such Agent against such liability."
"3629","Section 4.	Derivative Actions.  In addition to the requirements set"
"3630","forth in Section 3816 of the DSTA, a Shareholder or Shareholders may"
"3631","bring a derivative action on behalf of the Trust only if the"
"3632","following conditions are met:"
"3633","(a)	The Shareholder or Shareholders must make a pre-suit demand upon"
"3634","the Board of Trustees to bring the subject action unless an effort"
"3635","to cause the Board of Trustees to bring such an action is not likely"
"3636","to succeed.  For purposes of this Section 4, a demand on the Board"
"3637","of Trustees shall only be deemed not likely to succeed and therefore"
"3638","excused if a majority of the Board of Trustees, or a majority of any"
"3639","committee established to consider the merits of such action, is"
"3640","composed of Trustees who are not independent trustees (as such term"
"3641","is defined in the DSTA)."
"3642","(b)	Unless a demand is not required under paragraph (a) of this"

"3646","which such action relates, shall join in the request for the Board"
"3647","of Trustees to commence such action; and"
"3648","(c)	Unless a demand is not required under paragraph (a) of this"
"3649","Section 4, the Board of Trustees must be afforded a reasonable"
"3650","amount of time to consider such Shareholder request and to"
"3651","investigate the basis of such claim.  The Board of Trustees shall be"
"3652","entitled to retain counsel or other advisors in considering the"
"3653","merits of the request and shall require an undertaking by the"
"3654","Shareholders making such request to reimburse the Trust for the"
"3655","expense of any such advisors in the event that the Board of Trustees"
"3656","determine not to bring such action."
"3657","For purposes of this Section 4, the Board of Trustees may designate a"
"3658","committee of one Trustee to consider a Shareholder demand if"
"3659","necessary to create a committee with a majority of Trustees who are"
"3660","independent trustees (as such term is defined in the DSTA)."
"3661","In addition to all suits, claims or other actions (collectively,"

"4251","adjournment is for more than one hundred and eighty (180) days"
"4252","from the record date set for the original meeting, in which case,"
"4253","the Board of Trustees shall set a new record date as provided in"
"4254","Article V of the Declaration of Trust and give written notice to"
"4255","each Shareholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned"
"4256","meeting in accordance with the provisions of Sections 3 and 4"
"4257","of this Article II.  At any postponed or adjourned meeting, any"
"4258","business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the"
"4259","original meeting."
"4260","Section 6.	VOTING."
"4261","(a)	The Shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of"
"4262","Shareholders and the Shareholder vote required to take action"
"4263","shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the"
"4264","Declaration of Trust.  Unless determined by the inspector of the"
"4265","meeting to be advisable, the vote on any question need not be by"
"4266","written ballot."
"4267","(b)	Unless otherwise determined by the Board at the time it"
"4268","approves an action to be submitted to the Shareholders for approval,"
"4269","Shareholder approval of an action shall remain in effect until such"
"4270","time as the approved action is implemented or the Shareholders vote"
"4271","to the contrary.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an agreement of"
"4272","merger, consolidation, conversion or reorganization may be terminated"
"4273","or amended notwithstanding prior approval if so authorized by such"
"4274","agreement of merger, consolidation, conversion or reorganization"
"4275","pursuant to Section 3815 of the DSTA and/or pursuant to the"
"4276","Declaration of Trust, these By-Laws and Section 3806 of the DSTA."
"4277","Section 7.	WAIVER OF NOTICE BY CONSENT OF ABSENT SHAREHOLDERS."
"4278","Attendance by a Shareholder, in person or by proxy, at a meeting"
"4279","shall constitute a waiver of notice of that meeting with respect"
"4280","to that Shareholder, except when the Shareholder attends the meeting"
"4281","for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the"
"4282","meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting"
"4283","is not lawfully called or convened.  Whenever notice of a Shareholders'"
"4284","meeting is required to be given to a Shareholder under the Declaration"
"4285","of Trust or these By-Laws, a written waiver thereof, executed before"
"4286","or after the time notice is required to be given, by such Shareholder"
"4287","or his or her attorney thereunto authorized, shall be deemed equivalent"
"4288","to such notice.  The waiver of notice need not specify the purpose of,"
"4289","or the business to be transacted at, the meeting."
"4290","Section 8.	PROXIES.  Every Shareholder entitled to vote for"
"4291","Trustees or on any other matter that may properly come before the"
"4292","meeting shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or"
"4293","more agents authorized by a written proxy executed by the Shareholder"
"4294","and filed with the secretary of the Trust before being voted;"
"4295","provided, that an alternative to the execution of a written proxy"
"4296","may be permitted as described in the next paragraph of this Section 8."
"4297","A proxy shall be deemed executed if the Shareholder's name is placed"
"4298","on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic"
"4299","or electronic transmission (as defined in Section 3806 of the DSTA)"
"4300","or otherwise) by the Shareholder or the Shareholder's attorney-in-fact."
"4301","A valid proxy that does not state that it is irrevocable shall"
"4302","continue in full force and effect unless (i) revoked by the person"
"4303","executing it before the vote pursuant to that proxy is taken (a) by"
"4304","a writing delivered to the Trust stating that the proxy is revoked,"
"4305","(b) by a subsequent proxy executed by such person, (c) attendance at"
"4306","the meeting and voting in person by the person executing that proxy,"
"4307","or (d) revocation by such person using any electronic, telephonic,"
"4308","computerized or other alternative means authorized by the Trustees"
"4309","for authorizing the proxy to act; or (ii) written notice of the death"
"4310","or incapacity of the maker of that proxy is received by the Trust"
"4311","before the vote pursuant to that proxy is counted; provided, however,"
"4312","that no proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven (11)"
"4313","months from the date of the proxy unless otherwise expressly provided"
"4314","in the proxy.  The revocability of a proxy that states on its face"
"4315","that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of the"
"4316","General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Unless revoked,"
"4317","any proxy given in connection with a postponed or adjourned meeting"
"4318","for which a new record date is fixed shall continue to be valid so"
"4319","long as the Shareholder giving such proxy is a Shareholder of"
"4320","record on such new such record date."
"4321","With respect to any Shareholders' meeting, the Board, or, in case"
"4322","the Board does not act, the president, any vice president or the"
"4323","secretary, may permit proxies by electronic transmission (as defined"
"4324","in Section 3806 of the DSTA), telephonic, computerized,"
"4325","telecommunications or other reasonable alternative to the execution"
"4326","of a written instrument authorizing the holder of the proxy to act."
"4327","A proxy with respect to Shares held in the name of two or more"
"4328","Persons shall be valid if executed, or a permitted alternative"
"4329","to execution is used, by any one of them unless, at or prior to"
"4330","the exercise of the proxy, the secretary of the Trust receives"
"4331","a specific written notice to the contrary from any one of them."
"4332"," A proxy purporting to be by or on behalf of a Shareholder shall"
"4333","be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise"
"4334","and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest with the challenger."
"4335","Unless otherwise specifically limited by their terms, proxies"
"4336","shall entitle the Shareholder to vote at any adjournment or"
"4337","postponement of a Shareholder meeting."
"4338","Subject to the provisions of the DSTA, the Declaration of Trust"
"4339","or these By-Laws, the General Corporation Law of the State of"
"4340","Delaware relating to proxies, and judicial interpretations"
"4341","thereunder, shall govern all matters concerning the giving,"
"4342","voting or validity of proxies, as if the Trust were a Delaware"
"4343","corporation and the Shareholders were stockholders of a Delaware"
"4344","corporation."
"4345","Section 9.	INSPECTORS.  Before any meeting of Shareholders,"
"4346","the chairperson of the Board, or in the absence of the"
"4347","chairperson of the Board, the president of the Trust, or in"

"4349","authorized officer of the Trust, may appoint any person other"
"4350","than nominees for office to act as inspector at the meeting or"

"4352","appear or fails or refuses to act, the chairperson of the Board,"

"4354","of the Trust, or in the absence of the president, any vice president"

"4372","Section 1.	VACANCIES."
"4373","(a)	Whenever a vacancy in the Board shall occur (by reason of death,"
"4374","resignation, removal, retirement, an increase in the authorized number"
"4375","of Trustees or other cause), until such vacancy is filled as provided"
"4376","herein or the number of authorized Trustees constituting the Board of"
"4377","Trustees is decreased pursuant to Article IV, Section 1 of the"
"4378","Declaration of Trust, the Trustee(s) then in office, regardless of"
"4379","the number and even if less than a quorum, shall have all the powers"
"4380","granted to the Board and shall discharge all the duties imposed upon"
"4381","the Board by the Declaration of Trust and these By-Laws as though"
"4382","such number constitutes the entire Board."
"4383","(b)	Vacancies in the Board of Trustees may be filled by not less"
"4384","than a majority vote of the Trustee(s) then in office, regardless of"
"4385","the number and even if less than a quorum and a meeting of Shareholders"
"4386","shall be called for the purpose of electing Trustees if required by"
"4387","the 1940 Act.  Notwithstanding the above, whenever and for so long as"
"4388","the Trust is a participant in or otherwise has in effect a plan under"
"4389","which the Trust may be deemed to bear expenses of distributing its"
"4390","Shares as that practice is described in Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act,"
"4391","then the selection and nomination of each of the Trustees who is not"
"4392","an interested person (as that term is defined in the 1940 Act ) of"
"4393","the Trust, any Adviser or the principal underwriter of the Trust"
"4394","(such Trustees are referred to herein as disinterested Trustees),"
"4395","shall be, and is, committed to the discretion of the disinterested"
"4396","Trustees remaining in office.  In the event that all Trustee offices"
"4397","become vacant, an authorized officer of the Investment Adviser shall"
"4398","serve as the sole remaining Trustee effective upon the vacancy in the"
"4399","office of the last Trustee.  In such case, an authorized officer of"
"4400","the Investment Adviser, as the sole remaining Trustee, shall, as soon"
"4401","as practicable, fill all of the vacancies on the Board; provided,"
"4402","however, that the percentage of Trustees who are disinterested Trustees"
"4403","shall be no less than that permitted by the 1940 Act.  Upon the"
"4404","qualification of such Trustees, the authorized officer of the Investment"
"4405","Adviser shall resign as Trustee and a meeting of the Shareholders"
"4406","shall be called, as required by the 1940 Act, for the election of"
"4407","Trustees.  An appointment of a Trustee may be made by the Trustees then"
"4408","in office in anticipation of a vacancy to occur by reason of retirement,"
"4409","resignation, or removal of a Trustee, or an increase in number of"
"4410","Trustees effective at a later date, provided that said appointment shall"
"4411","become effective only at the time or after the expected vacancy occurs."
"4412","Section 2.	PLACE OF MEETINGS AND MEETINGS BY TELEPHONE; PROXIES."
"4413","All meetings of the Board may be held at any place within or outside the"
"4414","State of Delaware that is designated from time to time by the Board,"

"4416","the Board, the president of the Trust, or in the absence of the"

"4418","In the absence of such a designation, regular meetings shall be held at"
"4419","the offices of the Trust.  Any meeting, regular or special, may be held,"

"4423","Trustees shall be deemed to be present in person at such meeting."
