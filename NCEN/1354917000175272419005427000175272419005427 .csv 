"2194","RE: Report on Internal Controls - Highland Funds I"
"2195","Within 90 days prior to the filing date of the"
"2196","Shareholder Report on Form N-CSR, the Registrant had"
"2197","carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and"
"2198","with the participation of the Registrant's management,"
"2199","including the Registrant's principal executive officer and"
"2200","principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the"
"2201","design and operation of the Registrant's controls and"
"2202","procedures over financial reporting. Based on such"
"2203","evaluation, the Registrant's principal executive officer"
"2204","and principal financial officer concluded that the"
"2205","Registrant's controls and procedures over financial"
"2206","reporting were ineffective due to a material weakness"
"2207","determination for the Highland Opportunistic Credit"
"2208","Fund relating to a management review control over"
"2209","certain hard-to-value securities that was not designed"
"2210","at an appropriate level of precision to assess the"
"2211","reasonableness and reliability of certain inputs to the"
"2212","fair value model. A material weakness (as defined in"
"2213","Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) is a deficiency, or"
"2214","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"2215","financial reporting such that there is a reasonable"
"2216","possibility that a material misstatement in our annual or"
"2217","interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"2218","detected on a timely basis. The control deficiency"
"2219","resulted in no material misstatement to the Highland"
"2220","Opportunistic Credit Fund's financial statements."
"2221","Remediation Plan. We are currently developing our"
"2222","plans to remediate the material weakness described"
"2223","above. Management is designing additional procedures"
"2224","to strengthen its management review control over the"

"2242","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"2243","Highland Funds I:"
"2244","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"2245","statements of Highland Long/Short Equity Fund,"
"2246","Highland Long/Short Healthcare Fund, Highland Merger"
"2247","Arbitrage Fund, Highland Opportunistic Credit Fund,"
"2248","and Highland/iBoxx Senior Loan ETF (collectively, the"
"2249","Funds), each a series of Highland Funds I, as of and for"
"2250","the year ended June 30, 2018, in accordance with the"
"2251","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"2252","Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"2253","internal control over financial reporting, including"
"2254","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"2255","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2256","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"2257","to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but"
"2258","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"2259","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"2260","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"2261","opinion."
"2262","Management of the Funds is responsible for"
"2263","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"2264","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"2265","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"2266","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"2267","controls. A company's internal control over financial"
"2268","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"2269","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"2270","and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"2271","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2272","accounting principles (GAAP). A company's internal"
"2273","control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"2274","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"2275","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2276","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"2277","the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"2278","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2279","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"2280","GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"2281","company are being made only in accordance with"
"2282","authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"2283","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"2284","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"2285","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the"
"2286","company's assets that could have a material effect on"
"2287","the financial statements."
"2288","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2289","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2290","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2291","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"2292","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"2293","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"2294","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2295","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"2296","exists when the design or operation of a control does"
"2297","not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"2298","course of performing their assigned functions, to"
"2299","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"2300","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"2301","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"2302","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"2303","material misstatement of a company's annual or interim"
"2304","financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"2305","on a timely basis."
"2306","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"2307","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"2308","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"2309","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"2310","that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"2311","established by the Public Company Accounting"
"2312","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted"
"2313","the following matter involving internal control over"
"2314","financial reporting and its operation for the Highland"
"2315","Opportunistic Credit Fund (HOCF) that we consider to"
"2316","be a material weakness as defined above. These"
"2317","conditions were considered in determining the nature,"
"2318","timing, and extend of the procedures to be performed"
"2319","in our audit of the financial statement of HOCF for the"
"2320","year ended June 30, 2018, and this report does not"
"2321","affect our report thereon dated September 24, 2018."
"2322","The HOCF management review control over certain"
"2323","hard-to-value securities was not designed at an"
"2324","appropriate level of precision to assess the"
"2325","reasonableness and reliability of certain inputs to the"
"2326","fair value model. The control deficiency resulted in no"
"2327","material misstatement to HOCF's financial statements."
"2328","However, this control deficiency creates a reasonable"
"2329","possibility that a material misstatement to the financial"
"2330","statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"2331","timely basis, and therefore we concluded that the"
"2332","control deficiency represents a material weakness in"
"2333","HOCF's internal control over financial reporting."
"2334","However, for the audits of Highland Long/Short Equity"
"2335","Fund, Highland Long/Short Healthcare Fund, Highland"
"2336","Merger Arbitrage Fund, and Highland/iBoxx Senior Loan"
"2337","ETF, we noted no deficiencies in those funds' internal"
"2338","control over financial reporting and their operation,"
"2339","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"2340","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as"
"2341","of June 30, 2018."
"2342","This report is intended solely for the information and"
