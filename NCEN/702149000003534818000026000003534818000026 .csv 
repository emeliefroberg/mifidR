FONT-FAMILY:Georgia,Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP:0px>To the Board of Trustees of The North Carolina Capital Management Trust and<font style=FONT-SIZE:11pt; FONT-FAMILY:Times New Roman> </font>Shareholders of Term Portfolio and Government Portfolio:</p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:11px; FONT-FAMILY:Georgia,Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP:0px>In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Term Portfolio and Government Portfolio (two of the funds constituting The North Carolina Capital Management Trust, hereafter collectively referred to as the <font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#147;</font>Funds<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#148;</font>) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#147;</font>PCAOB<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#148;</font>), we considered the Funds<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font> internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font> internal control over financial reporting. &nbsp;Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font> internal control over financial reporting.</p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:11px; FONT-FAMILY:Georgia,Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP:0px>The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. &nbsp;In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. &nbsp;A fund<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. &nbsp;A fund<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:11px; FONT-FAMILY:Georgia,Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP:0px>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. &nbsp;Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:11px; FONT-FAMILY:Georgia,Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP:0px>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. &nbsp;A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font> annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:11px; FONT-FAMILY:Georgia,Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP:0px>Our consideration of the Funds<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font> internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB. &nbsp;However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font> internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of June 30, 2018.</p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:11px;
