"1103","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1104","To the Shareholders of Muhlenkamp Fund and"
"1105","Board of Trustees of Managed Portfolio Series"
"1106","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"1107","Muhlenkamp Fund (the Fund), a series of Managed Portfolio"
"1108","Series, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, in"
"1109","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1110","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's"
"1111","internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"1112","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1113","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1114","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"
"1115","the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"1116","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"1117","internal control over financial reporting."
"1118","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1119","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1120","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"1121","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"1122","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1123","controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"1124","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1125","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1126","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1127","generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  A"
"1128","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1129","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1130","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
