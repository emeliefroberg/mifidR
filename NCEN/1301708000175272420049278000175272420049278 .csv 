"2208","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2209","To the Board of Trustees of and Shareholders of Allianz Variable"
"2210","Insurance Products Fund of Funds Trust"
"2211","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"2212","statements of each of the funds constituting Allianz Variable"
"2213","Insurance Products Fund of Funds Trust (as listed in Appendix A"
"2214","and hereafter referred to collectively as the Funds) as of and"
"2215","for the year ended December 31, 2019, in accordance with the"
"2216","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"2217","(United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Funds' internal"
"2218","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"2219","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"2220","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"2221","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"2222","Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"2223","on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"2224","financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an"
"2225","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"2226","control over financial reporting."
"2227","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"2228","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"2229","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"2230","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"2231","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal"
"2232","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"2233","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"2234","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"2235","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2236","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"2237","reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"2238","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"2239","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2240","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"2241","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2242","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"2243","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"2244","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"2245","authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and"
"2246","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"2247","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"2248","fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2249","statements."
"2250","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2251","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2252","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"2253","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2254","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"2255","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2256","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2257","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"2258","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"2259","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"2260","on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2261","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"2262","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
