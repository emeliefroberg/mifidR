"860","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"861","To the shareholders of Center Coast Brookfield MLP"
"862","Focus Fund and the Board of Trustees of Brookfield"
"863","Investment Funds"
"864","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"865","financial statements of Center Coast Brookfield MLP"
"866","Focus Fund, a series of the Brookfield Investment"
"867","Trust (the ?Fund?), as of September 30, 2019 and"
"868","for the year ended September 30, 2019, in accordance"
"869"," with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"870","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered"
"871"," the Fund?s internal control over financial reporting,"
"872"," including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"873"," basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"874","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"875","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"876","Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"877","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund?s"
"878","internal control over financial reporting."
"879","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"880","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"881","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"882","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"883","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"884","management are required to assess the expected"
"885","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund?s"
"886","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"887","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"888"," regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"889"," and the preparation of financial statements for"
"890"," external purposes in accordance with generally"
"891","accepted accounting principles. A fund?s internal"
"892","control over financial reporting includes those"
"893","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"894"," maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"895"," accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"896","and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"897","provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"898","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"899"," of financial statements in accordance with"
"900","generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"901","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"902","being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"903","of management and directors of the fund; and (3)"
"904"," provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"905"," or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"906","use, or disposition of a fund?s assets that could"
"907"," have a material effect on the financial statements."
"908","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"909","control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"910","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"911","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"912","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"913","inadequate because of changes in conditions or"
"914","that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"915","or procedures may deteriorate."
"916","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"917","reporting exists when the design or operation"
"918","of a control does not allow management or"
"919","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"920","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"921"," misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"922","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"923","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"924"," reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"925","possibility that a material misstatement of"
"926","the fund?s annual or interim financial statements"
"927","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"928","Our consideration of the Fund?s internal control"
"929"," over financial reporting was for the limited"
"930","purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"931","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"932"," in internal control that might be material"
"933","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"934"," PCAOB. However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"935"," Fund?s internal control over financial reporting"
"936"," and its operation, including controls for"
"937","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be"
"938","a material weakness, as defined above, as of"
"939","September 30, 2019."
