A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font> annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</P>"
