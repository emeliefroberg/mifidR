"1589","SUPPLEMENT DATED JUNE 8, 2018"
"1590","TO THE CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE PROSPECTUS"
"1591","OF EACH OF THE FUNDS LISTED BELOW"
"1592","Templeton Developing Markets Trust"
"1593","Notice of Automatic Conversion of Class C Shares to"
"1594"," Class A Shares after 10-Year Holding Period"
"1595","At Board meetings held on February 26 and 27, 2018,"
"1596"," the Board of Trustees approved an automatic conversion"
"1597"," feature for the Fund's Class C shares (which includes Class C1"
"1598","shares as applicable) that will automatically convert shareholders'"
"1599"," Class C shares into Class A shares of the same Fund after they"
"1600","have been held for 10 years. After conversion, your new shares will"
"1601"," be subject to Class A shares' lower Rule 12b-1 fees. The conversion"
"1602"," feature will become effective on or about October 5, 2018.  Later"
"1603","that month Class C shares of the Fund that have been outstanding for"
"1604"," 10 years or more will automatically convert to Class A shares of"
"1605","such Fund on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two"
"1606"," classes. Thereafter, Class C shares of the Fund will convert"
"1607","automatically to Class A shares of such Fund on a monthly basis"
"1608","in the month of, or the month following, the 10-year anniversary"
"1609"," of the Class C shares' purchase date. Class C shares of the Fund"
"1610"," acquired through automatic reinvestment of dividends or"
"1611","distributions will convert to Class A shares of the Fund on the"
"1612"," conversion date pro rata with the converting Class C shares of"
"1613"," the Fund that were not acquired through reinvestment of dividends"
"1614"," or distributions."
"1615","Shareholders will not pay a sales charge, including a contingent"
"1616","deferred sales charge, upon the conversion of their Class C shares"
"1617","to Class A shares pursuant to this conversion feature."
"1618","The automatic conversion of the Fund's Class C shares into"
"1619"," Class A shares after the 10-year holding period is not"
"1620","expected to be a taxable event for federal income tax purposes."
"1621"," Shareholders should consult with their tax advisor regarding"
"1622"," the state and local tax consequences of such conversions."
"1623","Class C shares held through a financial intermediary in an"
"1624","omnibus account will be converted into Class A shares only"
"1625"," if the intermediary can document that the shareholder has"
"1626","met the required holding period. In certain circumstances,"
"1627","when shares are invested through retirement plans, omnibus"
"1628","accounts, and in certain other instances, the Fund and its"
"1629","agents may not have transparency into how long a shareholder"
"1630"," has held Class C shares for purposes of determining whether"
"1631"," such Class C shares are eligible for automatic conversion"
"1632","into Class A shares and the financial intermediary may not"
"1633","have the ability to track purchases to credit individual"
"1634","shareholders' holding periods.  This primarily occurs when"
"1635","shares are invested through certain record keepers for group"
"1636"," retirement plans, where the intermediary cannot track share"
"1637"," aging at the participant level.  In these circumstances, the"
"1638","Fund will not be able to automatically convert Class C shares"
"1639"," into Class A shares as described above. In order to determine"
"1640"," eligibility for conversion in these circumstances, it is the"
"1641"," responsibility of the shareholder or their financial intermediary"
"1642"," to notify the Fund that the shareholder is eligible for the"
"1643","conversion of Class C shares to Class A shares, and the shareholder"
"1644"," or their financial intermediary may be required to maintain and"
"1645","provide the Fund with records that substantiate the holding period"
"1646"," of Class C shares. It is the financial intermediary's (and not"
"1647","the Fund's) responsibility to keep records and to ensure that"
"1648","the shareholder is credited with the proper holding period."
"1649","Please consult with your financial intermediary about your"
"1650"," shares' eligibility for this conversion feature."
"1651","Also effective October 5, 2018, new accounts or plans may"
"1652","not be eligible to purchase Class C shares of the Fund if"
"1653","it is determined that the intermediary cannot track shareholder"
"1654"," holding periods to determine whether a shareholder's Class C"
"1655"," shares are eligible for conversion to Class A shares.  Accounts"
"1656"," or plans (and their successor, related and affiliated plans)"
"1657","that have Class C shares of the Fund available to participants"
"1658"," on or before October 5, 2018, may continue to open accounts"
"1659"," for new participants in such share class and purchase additional"
"1660"," shares in existing participant accounts.  The Fund has no"
"1661","responsibility for overseeing, monitoring or implementing a"
"1662"," financial intermediary's process for determining whether a"
"1663","shareholder meets the required holding period for conversion."
"1664","A financial intermediary may sponsor and/or control accounts,"
"1665"," programs or platforms that impose a different conversion"
"1666","schedule or different eligibility requirements for the conversion"
"1667"," of Class C shares into Class A shares. In these cases, Class C"
"1668","shareholders may convert to Class A shares under the policies of"
"1669"," the financial intermediary and the conversion may be structured"
"1670"," as an exchange of Class C shares for Class A shares of the same"
"1671"," Fund. Financial intermediaries will be responsible for making"
"1672"," such exchanges in those circumstances. Please consult with your"
"1673","financial intermediary if you have any questions regarding your"
"1674"," shares' conversion from Class C shares to Class A shares."

"1683","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1684","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"1685","Templeton Developing Markets Trust"
"1686","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"1687","Templeton Developing Markets Trust (the Fund) as of and for the"
"1688","year ended December 31, 2018, in accordance with the standards of"
"1689","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),"
"1690","we considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"1691","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1692","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1693","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"1694","of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1695","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1696","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"1697","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"1698","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1699","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"1700","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"1701","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1702","controls.  A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"1703","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1704","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1705","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1706","accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over"
"1707","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1708","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1709","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"1710","the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1711","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1712","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1713","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"1714","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1715","and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1716","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1717","use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material"
"1718","effect on the financial statements."
"1719","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1720","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"1721","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1722","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"1723","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1724","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1725","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1726","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1727","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"1728","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"1729","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"1730","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1731","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's"
"1732"," annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1733","detected on a timely basis."
"1734","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1735","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"1736","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"1737","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"1738","standards established by the PCAOB.  However, we noted the following"
"1739","deficiency in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and"
"1740","its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"1741","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of December"
"1742","31, 2018."
"1743","Management and PwC identified that at December 31, 2018 management's"
"1744","controls were ineffective related to internal control over financial"
"1745","reporting specific to the monitoring of market events following the"
"1746","close of trading in foreign stock markets that assist in determining"
"1747","the reliability of the values of the foreign securities held by the Fund"
"1748","and which may require the use of fair valuation factors to account for"
"1749","changes in the values of those securities subsequent to the local close of"
"1750","the foreign market but prior to the net asset calculation of the Fund."
"1751","This material weakness did not result in misstatements in the Fund's"
"1752","interim or annual financial statements.  However, this material weakness"
"1753","could result in misstatements of security values and unrealized gains"
"1754","or losses and associated disclosures that would result in a material"
"1755","misstatement of the financial statements that would not be prevented or"
"1756","detected. As a result, a material weakness exists at December 31,"
"1757","2018 for the Fund. Effective November 1, 2018 the Registrant's controls"
"1758","were further enhanced through the implementation of a daily secondary"
"1759","review of market events following the close of trading on foreign stock"
"1760","markets to ensure the appropriate application of market level fair"
"1761","value. We have not performed any procedures to assess this corrective"
"1762","action, including its sufficiency in addressing the material weakness"
"1763","described above."

"1765","the Board of Trustees of Templeton Developing Markets Trust and the"

"3285","in furtherance of, and in addition to, and not in"
"3286","limitation of, the general powers conferred upon the"
"3287","Trust by the DSTA and the other laws of the State of"
"3288","Delaware or otherwise; nor shall the enumeration of one"
"3289"," thing be deemed to exclude another, although it be of"

"3291","ARTICLE III SHARES"
"3292","Section 1.	Division of Beneficial Interest."
"3293","(a)	The beneficial interest in the Trust shall"
"3294","be divided into Shares, each Share without a par value."
"3295","The number of Shares in the Trust authorized hereunder,"
"3296","and of each Series and Class as may be established from"
"3297","time to time, is unlimited.  The Board of Trustees may"
"3298","authorize the division of Shares into separate Classes of"
"3299"," Shares and into separate and distinct Series of Shares"
"3300","and the division of any Series into separate Classes of"
"3301","Shares in accordance with the 1940 Act.  The different"
"3302","Series and Classes shall be established and designated"
"3303","pursuant to Article III, Section 6 hereof.  If no separate"
"3304","Series or Classes of Series shall be established, the"
"3305","Shares shall have the rights, powers and duties provided"
"3306","for herein and in Article III, Section 6 hereof to the"
"3307","extent relevant and not otherwise provided for herein,"
"3308","and all references to Series and Classes shall be"
"3309","construed (as the context may require) to refer to"
"3310","the Trust."
"3311","(i)	The fact that the Trust shall have one or more"
"3312","established and designated Classes of the Trust, shall"
"3313","not limit the authority of the Board of Trustees to"
"3314","establish and designate additional Classes of the Trust."
"3315","The fact that one or more Classes of the Trust shall have"
"3316","initially been established and designated without any"
"3317","specific establishment or designation of a Series (i.e., that"
"3318","all Shares of the Trust are initially Shares of one"
"3319","or more Classes) shall not limit the authority of the"
"3320","Board of Trustees to later establish and designate a"
"3321","Series and establish and designate the Class or Classes"
"3322","of the Trust as Class or Classes, respectively, of"
"3323","such Series."
"3324","(ii)	The fact that a Series shall have initially"
"3325","been established and designated without any specific"
"3326","establishment or designation of Classes (i.e., that all"
"3327","Shares of such Series are initially of a single Class)"
"3328","shall not limit the authority of the Board of Trustees to"
"3329","establish and designate separate Classes of said Series."
"3330"," The fact that a Series shall have more than one established"
"3331","and designated Class, shall not limit the authority"
"3332","of the Board of Trustees to establish and designate"
"3333","additional Classes of said Series."
"3334","(b)	The Board of Trustees shall have the power to"
"3335"," issue authorized, but unissued Shares of the Trust,"
"3336","or any Series and Class thereof, from time to time"
"3337","for such consideration paid wholly or partly in cash,"
"3338","securities or other property, as may be determined"
"3339","from time to time by the Board of Trustees, subject"
"3340","to any requirements or limitations of the"
"3341","1940 Act.  The Board of Trustees, on behalf of the"
"3342","Trust, may acquire and hold as treasury shares, reissue"
"3343"," for such consideration and on such terms as it may"
"3344","determine, or cancel, at its discretion from time to"
"3345","time, any Shares reacquired by the Trust.  The Board"
"3346","of Trustees may classify, reclassify or convert any"
"3347","unissued Shares or any Shares of the Trust or any"
"3348","Series or Class thereof, that were previously issued"
"3349","and are reacquired, into one or more Series or Classes"
"3350"," that may be established and designated from time to"
"3351","time and, in connection therewith, cause"
"3352","some or all of the Shareholders of the Trust, such"
"3353","Series or Class to become Shareholders of such"
"3354","other Series or Class.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,"
"3355","the Trust and any Series thereof may acquire, hold,"
"3356","sell and otherwise deal in, for purposes of investment"
"3357","or otherwise, the Shares of any other Series of the"
"3358","Trust or Shares of the Trust, and such Shares shall"
"3359","not be deemed treasury shares or cancelled."
"3360","(c)	Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of"
"3361","this Article III, each Share shall entitle the holder"
"3362","to voting rights as provided in Article V hereof."
"3363","Shareholders shall have no preemptive or other right"
"3364"," to subscribe for new or additional authorized, but"
"3365","unissued Shares or other securities issued by the"
"3366","Trust or any Series thereof.  The Board of Trustees"
"3367","may from time to time divide or combine the Shares"
"3368","of the Trust or any particular Series thereof into a"
"3369","greater or lesser number of Shares of the Trust or"
"3370"," that Series, respectively.  Such division or"
"3371","combination shall not materially change the"
"3372","proportionate beneficial interests of the holders"
"3373","of Shares of the Trust or that Series, as the case"
"3374"," may be, in the Trust Property at the time of such"
"3375","division or combination that is held with respect to"
"3376"," the Trust or that Series, as the case may be."
"3377","(d)	Any Trustee, officer or other agent of"
"3378","the Trust, and any organization in which any such"
"3379","Person has an economic or other interest, may acquire,"
"3380","own, hold and dispose of Shares in the Trust or any"
"3381"," Series and Class thereof, whether such Shares are"
"3382","authorized but unissued, or already outstanding, to"
"3383","the same extent as if such Person were not a Trustee,"
"3384","officer or other agent of the Trust; and the Trust or"
"3385","any Series may issue and sell and may purchase such"
"3386","Shares from any such Person or any such organization,"
"3387","subject to the limitations, restrictions or other"
"3388","provisions applicable to the sale or purchase of"
"3389","such Shares herein and the 1940 Act."
"3390","Section 2.	Ownership of Shares.  The ownership of"
"3391","Shares shall be recorded on the books of the Trust kept"
"3392"," by the Trust or by a transfer or similar agent for the"
"3393","Trust, which books shall be maintained separately for"
"3394","the Shares of the Trust and each Series and each Class"
"3395","thereof that has been established and designated."
"3396","No certificates certifying the ownership of Shares"
"3397","shall be issued except as the Board of Trustees may"
"3398","otherwise determine from time to time.  The"
"3399","Board of Trustees may make such rules not inconsistent"
"3400","with the provisions of the 1940 Act as it considers"
"3401","appropriate for the issuance of Share certificates, the"
"3402","transfer of Shares of the Trust and each Series and Class"
"3403","thereof, if any, and similar matters.  The record books"
"3404","of the Trust as kept by the Trust or any transfer or"
"3405","similar agent, as the case may be, shall be conclusive"
"3406"," as to who are the Shareholders of the Trust and each Series"
"3407","and Class thereof and as to the number of Shares of the"
"3408"," Trust and each Series and Class thereof held from time"
"3409","to time by each such Shareholder."
"3410","Section 3.	Sale of Shares.  Subject to the 1940 Act"
"3411","and applicable law, the Trust may sell its authorized but"
"3412","unissued Shares to such Persons, at such times, on such"
"3413","terms, and for such consideration as the Board of Trustees"
"3414"," may from time to time authorize.  Each sale shall be"
"3415","credited to the individual purchaser's account in the"
"3416","form of full or fractional Shares of the Trust or such"
"3417","Series thereof (and Class thereof, if any), as the purchaser"
"3418"," may select, at the net asset value per Share, subject to"
"3419","Section 22 of the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations"
"3420","adopted thereunder; provided, however, that the Board of"
"3421","Trustees may, in its sole discretion, permit the Principal"
"3422","Underwriter to impose a sales charge upon any such sale."
"3423","Every Shareholder by virtue of having become a Shareholder"
"3424","shall be bound by the terms of this Declaration of Trust."
"3425","Ownership of Shares shall not make any Shareholder a"
"3426","third-party beneficiary of any contract entered into"
"3427","by the Trust or any Series."
"3428","Section 4.	Status of Shares and Limitation of"
"3429"," Personal Liability.  Shares shall be deemed to be personal"
"3430","property giving to Shareholders only the rights provided in"
"3431","this Declaration of Trust, the By-Laws, and under"
"3432","applicable law.  Ownership of Shares shall not entitle"
"3433","the Shareholder to any title in or to the whole or any"
"3434"," part of the Trust Property or right to call for a"
"3435","partition or division of the same or for an accounting,"
"3436","nor shall the ownership of Shares constitute the"
"3437","Shareholders as partners.  Subject to Article VIII,"

"3440","existence of the Trust and any Series thereof shall not"
"3441","operate to dissolve the Trust or any such Series, nor"
"3442","entitle the representative of any deceased, incapacitated,"
"3443","dissolved, terminated or bankrupt Shareholder to an"
"3444","accounting or to take any action in court or elsewhere"

"3446","entitles such representative only to the rights of said"
"3447","deceased, incapacitated, dissolved, terminated or bankrupt"
"3448","Shareholder under this Declaration of Trust.  Neither the"
"3449","Trust nor the Trustees, nor any officer, employee or agent"
"3450","of the Trust, shall have any power to bind personally"
"3451","any Shareholder, nor, except as specifically provided"
"3452","herein, to call upon any Shareholder for the payment of"
"3453"," any sum of money other than such as the Shareholder"
"3454","may at any time personally agree to pay.  Each Share,"
"3455","when issued on the terms determined by the Board of Trustees,"
"3456","shall be fully paid and nonassessable.  As provided"
"3457","in the DSTA, Shareholders shall be entitled to the"
"3458","same limitation of personal liability as that extended"
"3459","to stockholders of a private corporation organized for"
"3460","profit under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware."
"3461","Section 5.	Power of Board of Trustees to Make"
"3462","Tax Status Election.  The Board of Trustees shall have"
"3463"," the power, in its discretion, to make such elections"
"3464"," as to the tax status of the Trust and any Series as may"

"3466","vote of any Shareholder."
"3467","Section 6.	Establishment and Designation of"
"3468","Series and Classes.  The establishment and designation"
"3469"," of any Series or Class shall be effective, without"
"3470","the requirement of Shareholder approval, upon the"
"3471","adoption of a resolution by not less than a majority"
"3472","of the then Board of Trustees, which resolution"
"3473","shall set forth such establishment and designation"
"3474","whether directly in such resolutions or by reference"
"3475"," to, or approval of, another document that sets forth"
"3476"," the designation or otherwise identifies such Series"
"3477","or Class, including any registration statement of the"
"3478"," Trust and any amendment of this Declaration of Trust,"
"3479","and may provide, to the extent permitted by the DSTA,"
"3480","for rights, powers and duties of such Series or Class"
"3481","(including variations in the relative rights and"
"3482","preferences as between the different Series"
"3483","and Classes) otherwise than as provided herein."
"3484","Any action that may be taken by the Board of"

"3497"," and liabilities of the Trust or any other Series."
"3498","Each Class of the Trust shall be separate and distinct"
"3499","from any other Class of the Trust.  Each Class of a"
"3500","Series shall be separate and distinct"
"3501","from any other Class of the Series.  As appropriate,"
"3502","in a manner determined by the Board of Trustees, the"
"3503","liabilities belonging to any such Class shall be held"
"3504","and accounted for separately from the liabilities of"
"3505"," the Trust, the Series or any other Class and"
"3506","separate and distinct records on the books of the"
"3507"," Trust for the Class shall be maintained for this"
"3508","purpose.  Subject to Article II hereof, each such"

"3510","investment medium, with separately defined investment"
"3511"," objectives and policies."
"3512","Shares of each Series (and Class where applicable)"
"3513","established and designated pursuant to this Section 6,"

"3528"," irrevocably be held with respect to that Series for"
"3529","all purposes, subject only to the rights of creditors"
"3530","with respect to that Series, and shall be so recorded"
"3531"," upon the books of account of the Trust.  Such consideration,"

"3535","liquidation of such assets, and any funds or payments"
"3536","derived from any reinvestment of such proceeds, in"
"3537","whatever form the same may be, are herein referred to"
"3538","as assets held with respect to that Series.  In the"
"3539","event that there are any assets, income, earnings, profits"
"3540","and proceeds thereof, funds or payments"

"3549"," particular Series shall be held with respect to"
"3550","that Series.  Each such allocation by or under the"
"3551","direction of the Board of Trustees shall be conclusive"
"3552","and binding upon the Shareholders of all Series"
"3553","for all purposes."
"3554","(b)	Liabilities Held with Respect to a Particular"
"3555","Series or Class.  The assets of the Trust held with"

"3557","the liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges,"

"3584"," such credit, claim, or contract.  In the absence of"
"3585","an express contractual agreement so limiting the"
"3586","claims of such creditors, claimants and contract"
"3587","providers, each creditor, claimant and contract"
"3588","provider shall be deemed nevertheless to have"
"3589","impliedly agreed to such limitation."
"3590","Subject to the right of the Board of Trustees"
"3591","in its discretion to allocate General"
"3592","Liabilities as provided herein, the debts,"

"3612","relating to limitations on liabilities between and among"
"3613","Series (and the statutory effect under Section 3804 of"
"3614","setting forth such notice in the Certificate of Trust)"
"3615"," shall become applicable to the Trust and each Series."
"3616","Liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges,"
"3617","reserves and expenses related to the distribution"
"3618","of, and other identified expenses that should or may"
"3619"," properly be allocated to, the Shares of a particular"

"3621"," The bearing of expenses solely by a particular Class of"
"3622","Shares may be appropriately reflected (in a manner"
"3623"," determined by the Board of Trustees) and may affect"

"3632","particular Class, or who have a claim or contract"
"3633"," that has been allocated to any particular Class,"
"3634","shall look, and may be required by contract to look,"
"3635"," exclusively to that particular Class for payment of"
"3636"," such credit, claim, or contract."
"3637","(c)	Dividends, Distributions and Redemptions."
"3638","Notwithstanding any other provisions of this"
"3639","Declaration of Trust, including, without limitation,"
"3640","Article VI hereof, no dividend or distribution including,"
"3641","without limitation, any distribution paid upon dissolution"
"3642"," of the Trust or of any Series with respect to, nor any"
"3643","redemption of, the Shares of any Series or Class of such"

"3646","specifically provided in Section 7 of this Article III,"
"3647","shall any Shareholder of any particular Series otherwise"
"3648","have any right or claim against the assets held with"
"3649","respect to any other Series or the Trust generally except,"
"3650","in the case of a right or claim against the assets held"
"3651"," with respect to any other Series, to the extent that such"
"3652","Shareholder has such a right or claim hereunder as a"
"3653","Shareholder of such other Series.  The Board of Trustees"
"3654"," shall have full discretion, to the extent not"
"3655"," inconsistent with the 1940 Act, to determine which"
"3656"," items shall be treated as income and which items as"
"3657","capital; and each such determination and allocation"
"3658","shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders."
"3659","(d)	Voting.  All Shares of the Trust entitled to"
"3660","vote on a matter shall vote in the aggregate without"
"3661","differentiation between the Shares of the separate"
"3662","Series, if any, or"
"3663","separate Classes, if any; provided that (i) with"

"3671"," the matter; and (iii) notwithstanding the foregoing, with"
"3672"," respect to any matter as to which the 1940 Act or other"
"3673","applicable law or regulation requires voting, by Series or"
"3674"," by Class, then the Shares of the Trust shall vote as"
"3675","prescribed in such law or regulation."
"3676","(e)	Equality.  Each Share of any particular Series"
"3677","shall be equal to each other Share of such Series"

"3680","(f)	Fractions.  A fractional Share of the Trust or a"
"3681","Series shall carry proportionately all the rights and"
"3682","obligations of a whole Share of the Trust or such Series,"

"3684","dividends and distributions, redemption of Shares and"
"3685","dissolution of the Trust or that Series."
"3686","(g)	Exchange Privilege.  The Board of Trustees shall"
"3687"," have the authority to provide that the holders of Shares"
"3688","of any Series shall have the right to exchange said Shares"
"3689"," for Shares of one or more other Series in accordance with"

"3696","to combine the assets and liabilities held with respect to"
"3697","any two or more Series into assets and liabilities held with"
"3698","respect to a single Series; provided that upon completion of"
"3699","such combination of Series, the interest of"
"3700","each Shareholder, in the combined assets and liabilities"
"3701","held with respect to the combined Series shall equal the"
"3702","interest of each such Shareholder in the aggregate of the"
"3703","assets and liabilities held with respect to the Series"
"3704"," that were combined."
"3705","(ii)	The Board of Trustees shall have the authority,"
"3706","without the approval, vote or consent of the Shareholders"
"3707","of any Series or Class, unless otherwise required by"
"3708","applicable law, to combine, merge or otherwise consolidate"
"3709","the Shares of two or more Classes of Shares of a Series"
"3710","with and/or into a single Class of Shares of such Series,"
"3711","with such designation, preference, conversion or other rights,"
"3712","voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends,"
