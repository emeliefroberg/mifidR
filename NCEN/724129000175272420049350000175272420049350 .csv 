"597","principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"598","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"599","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"600","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"601","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"602","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"603","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"604","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"605","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"606","company are being made only in accordance with"
"607","authorizations of management and directors of the"
"608","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"609","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"610","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"611","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"612","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"613","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"614","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"615","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"616","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"617","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"618","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"619","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"620","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"621","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"622","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"623","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is"
"624","a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"625","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"626","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"627","the company's annual or interim financial statements"
"628","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"629","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"630","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"631","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"632","all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"633","reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"634","standards established by the PCAOB. However, we noted"
"635","no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over"
"636","financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"637","over safeguarding securities that we consider to be"
"638","material weaknesses as defined above as of December 31,"
