"843","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"844","The Miller Investment Trust Funds:"
"845","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"846","financial statements of The Miller Convertible Bond"
"847","Fund, Miller Convertible Plus Bond Fund, and the Miller"
"848","Intermediate Bond Fund (collectively, the Funds) as of"
"849","and for the year ended October 31, 2018, in accordance"
"850","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"851","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"852","Funds internal control over financial reporting, including"
"853","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"854","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"855","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"856","to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not"
"857","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"858","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"859","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"860","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"861","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"862","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"863","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"864","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"865","controls. A companys internal control over financial"
"866","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"867","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"868","and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"869","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"870","accounting principles. A companys internal control over"
"871","financial reporting includes those policies and"
"872","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"873","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"874","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"875","the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"876","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"877","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
