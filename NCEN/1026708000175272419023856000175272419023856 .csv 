"427","of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"428","financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance"
"429","with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
