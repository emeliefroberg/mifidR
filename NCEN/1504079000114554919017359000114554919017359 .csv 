"2294","year ended March 31 2019 in accordance with the standards of"
"2295","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)"
"2296","We considered the Funds internal control over financial reporting"
"2297","including controls over safeguarding securities as a basis"
"2298","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2299","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"2300","with the requirements of Form N-CEN but not for the purpose of"
"2301","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"2302","control over financial reporting. Accordingly we express no"
"2303","such opinion."
"2304","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"2305","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"2306","In fulfilling this responsibility estimates and judgments by"
"2307","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"2308","related costs of controls. A funds internal control over"
"2309","financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"2310","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"2311","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"2312","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2313","accounting principles (GAAP). A funds internal control over"
"2314","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"2315","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable"
"2316","detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2317","dispositions of the assets of the fund (2) provide"
"2318","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"2319","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"2320","GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"2321","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"2322","trustees of the fund and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"2323","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"2324","acquisition use or disposition of a funds assets that"
"2325","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2326","Because of its inherent limitations internal control"
"2327","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2328","misstatements. Also projections of any evaluation of"
"2329","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"2330","that controls may become inadequate because of changes"
"2331","in conditions or that the degree of compliance with"
"2332","the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2333","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"2334","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"2335","allow management or employees in the normal course of"
"2336","performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect"
"2337","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"2338","deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control"
"2339","over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable"
"2340","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds"
"2341","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented"
"2342","or detected on a timely basis."
"2343","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"2344","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"2345","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"2346","all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"2347","material weakness under standards established by the"
"2348","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"2349","States). However we noted no deficiencies in the Funds"
"2350","internal control over financial reporting and its operation"
"2351","including controls over safeguarding securities that we"
"2352","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as"
"2353","of March 31 2019."
