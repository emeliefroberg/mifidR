"404","including controls over"
"405","safeguarding securities,"
"406","as a basis for designing"
"407","our auditing procedures"

"410","on the financial"

"419","over financial reporting."
"420","Accordingly, we express"
"421","no such opinion."
"422","The management of the"
"423","Fund is responsible for"
"424","establishing and"
"425","maintaining effective"
"426","internal control over"
"427","financial reporting.  In"
"428","fulfilling this"
"429","responsibility,"

"431","judgments by"

"490","effect on the financial"
"491","statements."
"492","Because of inherent"
"493","limitations, internal"
"494","control over financial"
"495","reporting may not"
"496","prevent or detect"
"497","misstatements.  Also,"
"498","projections of any"
"499","evaluation of"

"501","periods are subject to"
"502","the risk that controls"
"503","may become"

"505","changes in conditions"
"506","or that the degree of"
"507","compliance with the"
"508","policies or procedures"
"509","may deteriorate."
"510","A deficiency in internal"
"511","control over financial"
"512","reporting exists when"
"513","the design or operation"
"514","of a control does not"
"515","allow management or"
"516","employees, in the"
"517","normal course of"
"518","performing their"
"519","assigned functions, to"
"520","prevent or detect"
"521","misstatements on a"
"522","timely basis.  A material"
"523","weakness is a"
"524","deficiency, or"
"525","combination of"
"526","deficiencies, in internal"
"527","control over financial"
"528","reporting, such that"
"529","there is a reasonable"
"530","possibility that a"
"531","material misstatement"
"532","of the Funds annual or"
"533","interim financial"
"534","statements will not be"
"535","prevented or detected"
"536","on a timely basis."
"537","Our consideration of"
"538","the Fund's internal"
"539","control over financial"
"540","reporting was for the"
"541","limited purpose"
"542","described in the first"
"543","paragraph and would"
"544","not necessarily disclose"
"545","all deficiencies in"
"546","internal control that"
"547","might be material"
"548","weaknesses under"
"549","standards established"
"550","by the PCAOB."
"551","However, we noted no"
"552","deficiencies in the"
"553","Funds internal control"
"554","over financial reporting"
"555","and its operation,"
"556","including controls over"
"557","safeguarding securities"
"558","that we consider to be"
"559","a material weakness, as"
"560","defined above, as of"
"561","December 31, 2018."
