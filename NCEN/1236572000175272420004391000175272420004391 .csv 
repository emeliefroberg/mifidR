"566","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"567","Firm"
"568","To the Board of Trustees of Schroder Global Series"
"569","Trust and Shareholders of Schroder North American"
"570","Equity Fund"
"571","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"572","financial statements of Schroder North American"
"573","Equity Fund (constituting Schroder Global Series"
"574","Trust, hereafter referred to as the Fund)  as of and"
"575","for the year ended October 31, 2019, in accordance"
"576","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"577","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we"
"578","considered the Funds internal control over financial"
"579","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"580","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"581","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"582","on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"583","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose"
"584","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"585","Funds internal control over financial"
"586","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"587","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"588","control over financial reporting."
"589","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"590","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"591","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"592","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"593","management are required to assess the expected"
"594","benefits and related costs of controls. A companys"
"595","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"596","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"597","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"598","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"599","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"600","accounting principles. A companys internal control"
"601","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"602","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"603","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"604","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"605","the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"606","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"607","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"608","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"609","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"610","expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"611","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"612","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"613","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"614","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"615","companys assets that could have a material effect on"
"616","the financial statements."
"617","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
