"688","then ended, in accordance with the standards of the"
"689","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"690","States) (PCAOB), we considered the Funds internal"

"698","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"699","The management of the Fund is responsible for"

"701","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"702","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"703","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"

"725","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over"

"729","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"730","changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance"
"731","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"732","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"

"734","not allow management or employees, in the normal"
