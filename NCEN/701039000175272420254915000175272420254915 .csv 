"2710","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2711","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders of The Calvert Fund:"
"2712","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"2713","statements of Calvert Income Fund, Calvert Short Duration"
"2714","Income Fund, Calvert Long-Term Income Fund, Calvert"
"2715","Ultra-Short Duration Income Fund, and Calvert High Yield"
"2716","Bond Fund, each a series of The Calvert Fund (hereafter"
"2717","referred to as the Funds), as of and for the year ended"
"2718","September 30, 2020, in accordance with the standards of the"
"2719","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"2720","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2721","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"2722","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2723","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"2724","comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the"
"2725","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"2726","Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"2727","we express no such opinion."
"2728","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"2729","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"2730","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"2731","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"2732","related costs of controls. The Funds' internal control over"
"2733","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"2734","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"2735","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"2736","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The"
"2737","Funds' internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"2738","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"2739","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"2740","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Funds; (2)"
"2741","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2742","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2743","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"2744","that receipts and expenditures of the Funds are being made"
"2745","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"2746","Trustees of the Funds; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"2747","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"2748","acquisition, use, or disposition of the Funds' assets that could"
"2749","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2750","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2751","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2752","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"2753","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2754","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"2755","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"2756","deteriorate."
"2757","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2758","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"2759","management or employees, in the normal course of"
"2760","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2761","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"2762","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2763","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"2764","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds' annual"
"2765","or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"2766","detected on a timely basis."
"2767","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2768","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2769","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
