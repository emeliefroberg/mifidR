"2126","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"2127","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"2128","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2129","principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes"

"2131","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"2132","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"2133","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"2134","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"2135","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"2136","fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"2137","management of the fund and trustees of the trust; and (3) provide"
"2138","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"2139","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets that could"
"2140","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2141","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2142","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"2143","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"

"2149","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"2150","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A"
"2151","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"2152","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"2153","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the fund's annual"
"2154","or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"

"2160","the PCAOB. However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"2161","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"2162","controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"2163","material weakness, as defined above, as of September 30, 2019."
