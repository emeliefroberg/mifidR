"2694","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2695","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"2696","State Street Institutional Funds"
"2697","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"2698","statements of State Street Institutional Funds (the Trust)"
"2699","(comprising, respectively, State Street Active Core Bond"
"2700","Fund, State Street Institutional International Equity Fund,"
"2701","State Street Institutional Premier Growth Equity Fund, State"
"2702","Street Institutional Small-Cap Equity Fund and State Street"
"2703","Institutional U.S. Equity Fund (the Funds) as of and for the"
"2704","year ended September 30, 2019 in accordance with the"
"2705","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"2706","(United States), we considered the Trust's internal control"
"2707","over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"2708","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"2709","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"2710","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"2711","CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"2712","effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial"
"2713","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2714","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing"
"2715","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"2716","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"2717","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"2718","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal"
"2719","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"2720","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"2721","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"2722","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2723","accounting principles. A company's internal control over"
"2724","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"2725","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"2726","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2727","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"2728","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2729","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2730","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"2731","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"2732","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"2733","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"2734","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"2735","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"2736","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2737","statements."
"2738","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2739","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2740","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"2741","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2742","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"2743","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"2744","deteriorate."
"2745","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2746","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"2747","management or employees, in the normal course of"
"2748","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2749","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"2750","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2751","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"2752","possibility that a material misstatement of the company's"
"2753","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"2754","detected on a timely basis."
"2755","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial"
"2756","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2757","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"2758","in internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"2759","standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"2760","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"2761","deficiencies in the Trust's internal control over financial"
"2762","reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"2763","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material"
"2764","weakness as defined above as of September 30, 2019."
"2765","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"2766","management and the Board of Trustees of SSGA Funds and"
"2767","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"2768","to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"2769","specified parties."
