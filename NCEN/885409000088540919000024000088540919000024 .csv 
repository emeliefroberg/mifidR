"956","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"957","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"

"962","<p style=margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;><font face=eyinterstate light lang=EN-US style=font-size:9.0pt;>The management of the Company is responsible"

"967","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"968","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"969","accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s"
"970","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"971","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"972","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"973","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"974","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"975","accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"976","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"977","authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"978","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"979","acquisition, use or disposition of a company&#8217;s assets that could have a"
"980","material effect on the financial statements.</font></p>"
