"1191","<TEXT>"
"1192","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1193","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The New Germany Fund, Inc.:"
"1194","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of The New"
"1195","Germany Fund, Inc. (the Fund) as of and for the year ended December 31,"
"1196","2018, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1197","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Fund's internal"
"1198","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1199","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"1200","of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1201","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"1202","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"1203","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"1204","internal control over financial reporting."
"1205","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1206","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1207","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1208","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"1209","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1210","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1211","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1212","accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial"
"1213","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1214","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1215","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"1216","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1217","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1218","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1219","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1220","and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1221","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1222","of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1223","statements."
"1224","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1225","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1226","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1227","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1228","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1229","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1230","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1231","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1232","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1233","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1234","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1235","misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"1236","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1237","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"1238","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1239","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"1240","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1241","PCAOB.  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over"
"1242","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1243","securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of"
"1244","December 31, 2018."
"1245","This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Board of"
"1246","Directors of The New Germany Fund, Inc. and the Securities and Exchange"
"1247","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"1248","than these specified parties."

"1306","			in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities"
"1307","			Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or pursuant"

"1320","			Secretary."
"1321","            (2)	In order for any stockholder to request a special meeting to"

"1324","			signed by stockholders of record (or their duly authorized agents)"
"1325","			as of the Request Record Date entitled to cast not less than a"
"1326","			majority (the Special Meeting Percentage) of all of the votes"
"1327","			entitled to be cast on such matter at such meeting (the Special

"1328","			addition, the Special Meeting Request shall set forth the purpose"
"1329","			of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at it"
"1330","			(which shall be limited to the matters set forth in the Record"
"1331","			Date Request Notice received by the Secretary), shall bear the"
"1332","			date of signature of each such stockholder (or other agent)"

"1336","			Meeting Request is signed), the class and number of shares of stock"
"1337","			of the Corporation which are owned of record and beneficially by"
"1338","			each such stockholder and the nominee holder for, and number of,"

"1342","			by the Secretary within 60 days after the Request Record Date.  Any"

"1346","           (3)	The Secretary shall inform the requesting stockholders of the"
"1347","		   reasonably estimated cost of preparing and mailing the notice of"
"1348","		   meeting (including the Corporation's proxy materials).  The"
"1349","		   Secretary shall not be required to call a special meeting upon"
"1350","		   stockholder request and such meeting shall not be held unless, in"
"1351","		   addition to the documents required by paragraph (2) of this Section"
"1352","		   3(b), the Secretary receives payment of such reasonably estimated"
"1353","		   cost prior to the preparation and mailing or delivery of any notice"
"1354","		   of the meeting."
"1355","            (4)	Except as provided in the next sentence, any special meeting"
"1356","			shall be held at such place, date and time as may be designated by"
"1357","			the President, Chief Executive Officer or Board of Directors,"
"1358","			whoever has called the meeting.  In the case of any special meeting"
"1359","			called by the Secretary upon the request of stockholders (a"
"1360","			Stockholder-Requested Meeting), such meeting shall be held at"
"1361","			such place, date and time as may be designated by the Board of"
"1362","			Directors; provided, however, that the date of any"
"1363","			Stockholder-Requested Meeting shall be not more than 90 days after"
"1364","			the record date for such meeting (the Meeting Record Date); and"
"1365","			provided further that if the Board of Directors fails to"
"1366","			designate, within ten days after the date that a valid Special"
"1367","			Meeting Request is actually received by the Secretary (the"
"1368","			Delivery Date), a date and time for a Stockholder-Requested"
"1369","			Meeting, then such meeting shall be held at 2:00 p.m. local time"
"1370","			on the 90th day after the Meeting Record Date or, if such 90th day"
"1371","			is not a Business Day (as defined below), on the first preceding"
"1372","			Business Day; and provided further that in the event that the"
"1373","			Board of Directors fails to designate a place for a"
"1374","			Stockholder-Requested Meeting within ten days after the Delivery"
"1375","			Date, then such meeting shall be held at the principal executive"
"1376","			offices of the Corporation.  In fixing a date for any special"
"1377","			meeting, the President, Chief Executive Officer or Board of"
"1378","			Directors may consider such factors as he, she or it deems"
"1379","			relevant within the good faith exercise of business judgment,"
"1380","			including, without limitation, the nature of the matters to be"
"1381","			considered, the facts and circumstances surrounding any request"
"1382","			for meeting and any plan of the Board of Directors to call an"
"1383","			annual meeting or a special meeting.  In the case of any"
"1384","			Stockholder-Requested Meeting, if the Board of Directors fails to"
"1385","			fix a Meeting Record Date that is a date within 30 days after the"
"1386","			Delivery Date, then the close of business on the 30th day after"
"1387","			the Delivery Date shall be the Meeting Record Date."
"1388","            (5)	If at any time as a result of written revocations of requests"
"1389","			for the special meeting, stockholders of record (or their duly"
"1390","			authorized agents) as of the Request Record Date entitled to cast"
"1391","			less than the Special Meeting Percentage shall have delivered and"
"1392","			not revoked requests for a special meeting, the Secretary may"
"1393","			refrain from mailing the notice of the meeting or, if the notice"
