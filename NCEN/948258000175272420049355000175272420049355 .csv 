"1571","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"1572","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1573","To the Board of Directors of M Fund, Inc."
"1574","and the Shareholders of M International Equity Fund,"
"1575","M Large Cap Growth Fund,"
"1576","M Capital Appreciation Fund and M Large Cap Value"
"1577","Fund"
"1578","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1579","statements of M International Equity Fund, M Large Cap"
"1580","Growth Fund, M Capital Appreciation Fund and M Large"
"1581","Cap Value Fund, each a series of shares of beneficial"
"1582","interest in M Fund, Inc. (the Funds), as of December"
"1583","31, 2019, and for the year then ended, in accordance"
"1584","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1585","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we"
"1586","considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1587","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1588","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1589","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1590","the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1591","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"1592","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"1593","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"1594","express no such opinion."
"1595","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"1596","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1597","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1598","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"1599","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1600","controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"1601","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1602","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1603","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1604","in accordance with accounting principles generally"
"1605","accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  A"
"1606","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1607","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1608","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1609","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1610","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1611","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1612","necessary to permit preparation of the financial"
"1613","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"1614","and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"1615","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1616","directors of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1617","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1618","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"1619","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1620","statements."
"1621","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1622","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1623","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1624","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1625","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1626","conditions or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1627","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1628","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1629","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1630","allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"1631","of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1632","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"1633","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,"
"1634","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there"
"1635","is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"1636","of the Funds' annual or interim financial statements will"
"1637","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1638","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"1639","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"1640","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1641","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1642","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1643","PCAOB.  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"1644","Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1645","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1646","securities, that we consider to be a material weakness,"
"1647","as defined above, as of December 31, 2019."
"1648","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
