"750","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"751","To the Trustees and Shareholders of Putnam Massachusetts Tax"
"752","Exempt Income Fund:"
"753","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"754","of Putnam Massachusetts Tax Exempt Income Fund (the Fund) as of"
"755","and for the year ended May 31, 2020, in accordance with the"
"756","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"757","States) (PCAOB), we considered the Funds internal control over"
"758","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"759","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"760","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"761","and to comply with the requirements of Form NCEN, but not for the"
"762","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"763","Funds internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"764","do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds"
"765","internal control over financial reporting."
"766","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"767","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"768","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"769","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"770","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"771","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"772","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"773","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"774","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"775","companys internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"776","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"777","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"778","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"779","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"780","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"781","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"782","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"783","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"784","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"785","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"786","disposition of a companys assets that could have a material"
"787","effect on the financial statements."
"788","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"789","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"790","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"791","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"792","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"793","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"794","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"795","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"796","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"797","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
