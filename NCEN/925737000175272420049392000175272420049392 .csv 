"845","Firm"
"846","To the Board of Trustees of Bishop Street Funds and"
"847","Shareholders of High Grade Income Fund and Hawaii"
"848","Municipal Bond Fund"
"849","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"850","financial statements of High Grade Income Fund and"
"851","Hawaii Municipal Bond Fund (constituting Bishop"
"852","Street Funds, hereafter collectively referred to as"
"853","the Funds) as of and for the year ended December 31,"
"854","2019, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"855","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)"
"856","(PCAOB), we considered the Funds internal control"
"857","over financial reporting, including controls over"
"858","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"859","our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"860","expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"861","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN,"
"862","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"863","the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"864","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express"
"865","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds"
"866","internal control over financial reporting."
"867","The management of the Funds are responsible for"
"868","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"869","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"870","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"871","management are required to assess the expected"
"872","benefits and related costs of controls. A companys"
"873","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"874","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"875","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"876","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"877","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"878","accounting principles. A companys internal control"
"879","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"880","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"881","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"882","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"883","the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"884","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"885","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"886","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"887","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"888","expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"889","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"890","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"891","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"892","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"893","companys assets that could have a material effect on"
