"6773","On May 10, 2018, a notice of the filing of the application was"
"6774"," issued (Investment Company Act"

"6841","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"6842","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"6843","Franklin Mutual Series Funds:"
"6844","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"6845","statements of Franklin Mutual Shares Fund, Franklin Mutual"
"6846","Quest Fund, Franklin Mutual Beacon Fund, Franklin Mutual"
"6847","Global Discovery Fund, Franklin Mutual European Fund,"
"6848"," Franklin Mutual Financial Services Fund, and Franklin Mutual"
"6849","International Fund (seven funds comprising Franklin Mutual"
"6850","Series Funds) (collectively, the  Funds) as of and for the"
"6851","year ended December 31, 2019, in accordance with the standards"
"6852","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"6853","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"6854","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"6855","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"6856"," of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"6857","to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for"
"6858","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"6859","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"6860","we express no such opinion."
"6861","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"6862","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"6863","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"6864","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"6865"," costs of controls. A company's internal control over financial"
"6866","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"6867","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"6868","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"6869","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"6870","A company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"6871","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"6872"," of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"6873","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"6874","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"6875","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"6876","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"6877","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"6878","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"6879","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"6880","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"6881","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"6882","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"6883","statements."
"6884","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"6885","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"6886","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"6887"," are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"6888","because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"6889","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"6890","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"6891","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"6892","management"
"6893","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"6894","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"6895"," A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"6896","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"6897","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"6898","misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial"
"6899","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"6900","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"6901","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"6902","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"6903","in internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"6904","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"6905","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"6906","Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"6907","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider"
"6908","to be a material weakness as defined above as of February 19, 2020."
"6909","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"6910","management and Board of Trustees of Franklin Mutual Series"
"6911","Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"6912","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"6913","than these specified parties."
