"1290","<TEXT>"
"1291","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1292","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Central and Eastern Europe"
"1293","Fund, Inc.:"
"1294","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of The"
"1295","Central and Eastern Europe Fund, Inc. (the Fund) as of and for the year"
"1296","ended October 31, 2018, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1297","Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Fund's"
"1298","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1299","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1300","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1301","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1302","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"1303","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"1304","internal control over financial reporting."
"1305","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1306","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1307","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1308","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"1309","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1310","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1311","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1312","accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial"
"1313","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1314","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1315","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"1316","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1317","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1318","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1319","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1320","and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1321","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1322","of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1323","statements."
"1324","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1325","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1326","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1327","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1328","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1329","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1330","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1331","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1332","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1333","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1334","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"1335","the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1336","detected on a timely basis."
"1337","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"1338","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1339","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"1340","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1341","PCAOB.  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over"
"1342","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1343","securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of"
"1344","October 31, 2018."

"1346","Directors of The Central and Eastern Europe Fund, Inc. and the Securities"

"1475","	Date, then such meeting shall be held at the principal executive"
"1476","	offices of the Corporation.  In fixing a date for any special"
"1477","	meeting, the President, Chief Executive Officer or Board of"
"1478","	Directors may consider such factors as he, she or it deems"
"1479","	relevant within the good faith exercise of business judgment,"
"1480","	including, without limitation, the nature of the matters to be"
"1481"," 	considered, the facts and circumstances surrounding any request"
"1482","	for meeting and any plan of the Board of Directors to call an"

"1490","	authorized agents) as of the Request Record Date entitled to cast"
"1491","	less than the Special Meeting Percentage shall have delivered and"
"1492","	not revoked requests for a special meeting, the Secretary may"
"1493","	refrain from mailing the notice of the meeting or, if the notice"
"1494","	of the meeting has been mailed, the Secretary may revoke the"
"1495","	notice of the meeting at any time before ten days before the"
"1496","	meeting if the Secretary has first sent to all other requesting"
"1497","	stockholders written notice of such revocation and of intention"
"1498","	to revoke the notice of the meeting.  Any request for a special"
"1499","	meeting received after a revocation by the Secretary of a notice"
"1500","	of a meeting shall be considered a request for a new special"
"1501","	meeting."
"1502","    (6) The Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President or the"
"1503","	Board of Directors may appoint regionally or nationally recognized"
"1504","	independent inspectors of elections to act as the agent of the"
"1505","	Corporation for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial"
"1506","	review of the validity of any purported Special Meeting Request"
"1507","	received by the Secretary.  For the purpose of permitting the"
"1508","	inspectors to perform such review, no such purported request shall"
"1509","	be deemed to have been delivered to the Secretary until the"
"1510","	earlier of (i) five Business Days after receipt by the Secretary"
"1511","	of such purported request and (ii) such date as the independent"
"1512","	inspectors certify to the Corporation that the valid requests"
"1513","	received by the Secretary represent stockholders of record"
"1514","	entitled to cast not less than the Special Meeting Percentage."
"1515","	Nothing contained in this paragraph (6) shall in any way be"
"1516","	construed to suggest or imply that the Corporation or any"
"1517","	stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of"
"1518","	any request, whether during or after such five Business Day"
"1519","	period, or to take any other action (including, without"
"1520","	limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any"
"1521","	litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive"
"1522","	relief in such litigation)."

"1531","	entitled to notice of the meeting notice in writing or by electronic"
"1532","	transmission stating the time and place of the meeting and, in the case"
"1533","	of a special meeting or as otherwise may be required by any statute, the"
"1534","	purpose for which the meeting is called, either by mail, presenting it"
"1535","	to the stockholder personally, leaving it at the stockholder's residence"
"1536","	or usual place of business, by electronic transmission or transmitting"
"1537","	the notice to the stockholder in any other manner authorized by law.  If"
"1538","	mailed, notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United"
"1539","	States mail addressed to the stockholder at the stockholder's post"
"1540","	office address as it appears upon the books of the Corporation, with"
"1541","	postage thereon prepaid.  If transmitted electronically, such notice"
"1542","	shall be deemed to be given when transmitted to the stockholder by an"

"1545","	Corporation may give a single notice to all stockholders who share an"
"1546","	address, which single notice shall be effective as to any stockholder"
"1547","	at such address, unless a stockholder objects to receiving such single"
"1548","	notice or revokes a prior consent to receiving such single notice."
"1549","	Failure to give notice of any meeting to one or more stockholders, or"
"1550","	any irregularity in such notice, shall not affect the validity of any"
"1551","	meeting fixed in accordance with this Article II or the validity of any"
"1552","	proceedings at any such meeting.  The Corporation may postpone or cancel"
