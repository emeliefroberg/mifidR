"2797","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2798","To the Shareholders and"
"2799","Board of Trustees of MFS Series"
"2800","Trust VI"
"2801","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"2802","financial statements of MFS Global"
"2803","Equity Fund, MFS Global Total Return Fund"
"2804","and MFS Utilities Fund (the Funds)"
"2805","(three of the series constituting MFS Series"
"2806","Trust VI (the Trust)) as of and for"
"2807","the year ended October 31, 2019, in"
"2808","accordance with the standards of the"
"2809","Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"2810","Board (United States), we considered the"
"2811","Trust?s internal control over financial"
"2812","reporting, including controls over"
"2813","safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"2814","for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"2815","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"2816","statements and to comply"
"2817","with the requirements of Form N-CEN,"
"2818","but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"2819","opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust?s internal control over financial"
"2820","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2821"," The management of the Trust is responsible for"
"2822","establishing and maintaining"
"2823","effective internal control over financial"
"2824","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"2825","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"2826","to assess the expected"
"2827","benefits and related costs of controls. A company?s"
"2828","internal control over"
"2829","financial reporting is a process designed"
"2830","to provide reasonable assurance"
"2831","regarding the reliability of financial"
"2832","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"2833","statements for external purposes in accordance"
"2834","with U.S. generally accepted"
"2835","accounting principles. A company?s internal"
"2836","control over financial reporting"
"2837","includes those policies and procedures"
"2838","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"2839","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"2840","and fairly reflect the transactions"
"2841","and dispositions of the assets of the"
"2842","company; (2) provide reasonable"
"2843","assurance that transactions are recorded"
"2844","as necessary to permit preparation of"
"2845","financial statements in accordance with"
"2846","U.S. generally accepted accounting"
"2847","principles, and that receipts and"
"2848","expenditures of the company are being made"
"2849","only in accordance with authorizations of"
"2850","management and directors of the"
"2851","company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"2852","assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"2853","detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"2854","use or disposition of a company?s assets"
"2855","that could have a material effect on the"
"2856","financial statements."
"2857","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"2858","internal control over financial reporting may"
"2859","not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2860","Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2861","effectiveness to future periods are subject"
"2862","to the risk that controls may become"
"2863","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"2864","or that the degree of compliance"
"2865","with the policies or procedures may"
"2866","deteriorate."
"2867","A deficiency in internal control over"
"2868","financial reporting exists when the design"
"2869","or operation of a control does not allow management"
"2870","or employees, in the"
"2871","normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"2872","to prevent or detect"
"2873","misstatements on a timely basis."
"2874","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2875","combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"2876","over financial reporting, such"
"2877","that there is a reasonable possibility"
"2878","that a material misstatement of the"
"2879","company?s annual or interim financial"
"2880","statements will not be prevented or"
"2881","detected on a timely basis."
"2882","Our consideration of the Trust?s internal"
"2883","control over financial reporting was"
"2884","for the limited purpose described in the"
"2885","first paragraph and would not"
"2886","necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"2887","in internal control that might be material"
"2888","weaknesses under standards established by"
"2889","the Public Company Accounting"
"2890","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted"
"2891","no deficiencies in the"
"2892","Trust?s internal control over financial reporting"
"2893","and its operation, including"
"2894","controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"2895","we consider to be a material"
"2896","weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2019."
"2897","This report is intended solely for the information"
"2898","and use of management and"
"2899","the Board of Trustees of MFS Series Trust VI"
"2900","and the Securities and Exchange"
"2901","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"2902","than these specified parties."
