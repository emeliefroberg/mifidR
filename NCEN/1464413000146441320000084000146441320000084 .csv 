"474","      over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but"

"480","      accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and"
"481","      that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"

"483","    <div style=text-align: justify;>&#160;</div>"
"484","    <div style=text-align: justify;>Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.&#160; Also, projections of any evaluation of"

"487","    <div style=text-align: justify;>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"488","      normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.&#160; A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
