"995","Accounting Firm"
"996","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of"
"997","Sanford C. Bernstein Fund II, Inc.:"
"998","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"999","financial statements of Sanford C. Bernstein Fund"
"1000","II, Inc. (the Fund), (comprising the Intermediate"

"1002","year ended September 30, 2020, in accordance with"
"1003","the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1004","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1005","Fund's  internal control over financial reporting,"
"1006","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"1007","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1008","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1009","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"1010","Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"1011","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"1012","internal control over financial reporting."
"1013","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1014","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"1015","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1016","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1017","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1018","management are required to assess the expected"
"1019","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's"
"1020","internal control over financial reporting is a process"

"1022","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1023","preparation of financial statements for external"
"1024","purposes in accordance with U.S. generally"

"1028","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1029","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"

"1031","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"1032","as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1033","statements in accordance with U.S. generally"
"1034","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"1035","and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"1036","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1037","directors of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1038","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"1039","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"

"1042","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"

"1050","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1051","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1052","control does not allow management or employees,"
"1053","in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1054","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"

"1056","a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"1057","over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1058","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"1059","of the fund's annual or interim financial statements"

"1068","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"1069","internal control over financial reporting and its"
