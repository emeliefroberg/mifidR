"3253","A deficiency in internal"
"3254","control over financial"
"3255","reporting exists when"
"3256","the design or operation"
"3257","of a control does not"
"3258","allow management or"

"3269","deficiencies, in internal"
"3270","control over financial"
"3271","reporting, such that"
"3272","there is a reasonable"
"3273","possibility that a"
"3274","material misstatement"
"3275","of the Fund's annual or"
"3276","interim financial"
"3277","statements will not be"

"3280","Our consideration of the"
