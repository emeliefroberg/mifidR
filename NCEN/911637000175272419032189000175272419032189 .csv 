"1021","as of and for the year ended September 30, 2018, in"
"1022","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1023","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1024","considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1025","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1026","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1027","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1028","the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1029","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"1030","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"1031","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"

"1033","The management of the Fund is responsible for"

"1035","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"

"1038","A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"

"1040","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1041","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1042","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"

"1044","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1045","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1046","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1047","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1048","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"

"1056","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"1057","effect on the financial statements."
"1058","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"

"1062","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1063","conditions or that the degree of compliance with the"

"1073","misstatement of a fund's annual or interim financial"
"1074","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
