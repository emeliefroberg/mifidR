"3310","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"3311","To the Board of Trustees of Templeton Funds and Shareholders of"
"3312","Templeton World Fund Templeton Foreign Fund and"
"3313","Templeton International Climate Change Fund"
"3314","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"3315","statements of Templeton World Fund, Templeton Foreign Fund"
"3316","and Templeton International Climate Change Fund"
"3317","(constituting Templeton Funds, hereafter collectively"
"3318","referred to as the Funds) as of and for the period"
"3319","ended August 31, 2018, in accordance with the standards"
"3320","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),"
"3321","we considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"3322","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"3323","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"3324","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"3325","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"3326","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"3327","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"3328","we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness"
"3329","of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"3330","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"3331","and maintaining effective internal control over"
"3332","financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"3333","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"3334","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"3335","A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"3336","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"3337","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"3338","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"3339","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"3340","A company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"3341","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"3342","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"3343","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"3344","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"3345","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"3346","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"3347","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"3348","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"3349","the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"3350","of management and directors of the company and (3) provide"
"3351","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"3352","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"3353","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3354","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"3355","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"3356","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"3357","future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"3358","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"3359","that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"3360","procedures may deteriorate."
"3361","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"3362","exists when the design or operation of a control does"
"3363","not allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"3364","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3365","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"3366","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"3367","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"3368","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"3369","company's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"3370","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3371","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"3372","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"3373","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3374","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"3375","control over financial reporting that might be"
"3376","material weaknesses under standards established"
"3377","by the PCAOB.  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"3378","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and"
"3379","its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"3380","securities, that we consider to be a material"
"3381","weakness as defined above as of August 31, 2018."

"3440","The automatic conversion of the Fund's Class C shares"
"3441","into Class A shares after the 10-year holding period is"
"3442","not expected to be a taxable event for federal income"
"3443","tax purposes. Shareholders should consult with their"
"3444","tax advisor regarding the state and local tax consequences"
"3445","of such conversions."
"3446","Class C shares held through a financial intermediary in"
"3447","an omnibus account will be converted into Class A shares"
"3448","only if the intermediary can document that the shareholder"
"3449","has met the required holding period. In certain circumstances,"
"3450","when shares are invested through retirement plans, omnibus accounts,"
"3451","and in certain other instances, the Fund and its agents may not have"
"3452","transparency into how long a shareholder has held Class C shares for"
"3453","purposes of determining whether such Class C shares are eligible for"
"3454","automatic conversion into Class A shares and the financial"
"3455","intermediary may not have the ability to track purchases to"
"3456","credit individual shareholders' holding periods. This"
"3457","primarily occurs when shares are invested through certain"
"3458","record keepers for group retirement plans, where the"
"3459","intermediary cannot track share aging at the participant"
"3460","level.  In these circumstances, the Fund will not be able"
"3461","to automatically convert Class C shares into"
"3462","Class A shares as described above. In order to"
"3463","determine eligibility for conversion in these"
"3464","circumstances, it is the responsibility of the"
"3465","shareholder or their financial intermediary to"
"3466","notify the Fund that the shareholder is eligible"
"3467","for the conversion of Class C shares to"
"3468","Class A shares, and the shareholder or their"
"3469","financial intermediary may be required to"
"3470","maintain and provide the Fund with records"
"3471","that substantiate the holding period of"
"3472","Class C shares. It is the financial"
"3473","intermediary's (and not the Fund's) responsibility to keep"
"3474","records and to ensure that the shareholder is credited with t"
"3475","he proper holding period. Please consult with your financial"
"3476","intermediary about your shares' eligibility for this"
"3477","conversion feature."
"3478","Also effective October 5, 2018, new accounts or plans"
"3479","may not be eligible to purchase Class C shares of the"
"3480","Fund if it is determined that the intermediary cannot"
"3481","track shareholder holding periods to determine whether a"
"3482","shareholder's Class C shares are eligible for conversion"
"3483","to Class A shares.  Accounts or plans (and their successor,"
"3484","related and affiliated plans) that have Class C shares"
"3485","of the Fund available to participants on or before"
"3486","October 5, 2018, may continue to open accounts for"
"3487","new participants in such share class and purchase"
"3488","additional shares in existing participant accounts."
"3489","The Fund has no responsibility for overseeing,"
"3490","monitoring or implementing a financial intermediary's"
"3491","process for determining whether a shareholder meets"
"3492","the required holding period for conversion."
"3493","A financial intermediary may sponsor and/or"
"3494","control accounts, programs or platforms that"
"3495","impose a different conversion schedule or"
"3496","different eligibility requirements for the"
"3497","conversion of Class C shares into Class A shares. In these"
"3498","cases, Class C shareholders may convert to Class A shares"
"3499","under the policies of the financial intermediary and the"
"3500"," conversion may be structured as an exchange of Class C shares"
"3501"," for Class A shares of the same Fund. Financial intermediaries"
"3502","will be responsible for making such exchanges in those circumstances."
"3503","Please consult with your financial intermediary if you have any"
"3504","questions regarding your shares' conversion from Class C shares to"
"3505","Class A shares."

"3927","SHARES"
"3928","Section 1.	Division of Beneficial Interest."
"3929","(a)	The beneficial interest in the Trust shall be divided into"
"3930","Shares, each Share without a par value.  The number of Shares in"
"3931","the Trust authorized hereunder, and of each Series and Class as"
"3932","may be established from time to time, is unlimited.  The Board of"
"3933","Trustees may authorize the division of Shares into separate Classes of"
"3934","Shares and into separate and distinct Series of Shares and the division"
"3935","of any Series into separate Classes of Shares in accordance with"
"3936","the 1940 Act.  The different Series and Classes shall be established"
"3937"," and designated pursuant to Article III, Section 6 hereof.  If no"
"3938","separate Series or Classes of Series shall be established, the"
"3939","Shares shall have the rights, powers and duties provided for herein"
"3940","and in Article III, Section 6 hereof to the extent relevant and not"
"3941"," otherwise provided for herein, and all references to Series"
"3942"," and Classes shall be construed (as the context may require) to"
"3943"," refer to the Trust."
"3944","	The fact that the Trust shall have one or more established"
"3945","and designated Classes of the Trust, shall not limit the authority"
"3946","of the Board of Trustees to establish and designate additional"
"3947","Classes of the Trust.  The fact that one or more Classes of the"
"3948"," Trust shall have initially been established and designated"
"3949"," without any specific establishment or designation of a Series"
"3950","(i.e., that all Shares of the Trust are initially Shares of"
"3951","one or more Classes) shall not limit the authority of the"
"3952"," Board of Trustees to later establish and designate a Series"
"3953"," and establish and designate the Class or Classes of the"
"3954","Trust as Class or Classes, respectively, of such Series."
"3955","	The fact that a Series shall have initially been"
"3956","established and designated without any specific establishment or"
"3957"," designation of Classes (i.e., that all Shares of such Series are"
"3958"," initially of a single Class) shall not limit the authority of the"
"3959","Board of Trustees to establish and designate separate Classes of"
"3960","said Series.  The fact that a Series shall have more than one"
"3961","established and designated Class, shall not limit the authority"
"3962"," of the Board of Trustees to establish and designate"
"3963"," additional Classes of said Series."
"3964","(b)	The Board of Trustees shall have the power to issue"
"3965","authorized, but unissued Shares of the Trust, or any Series"
"3966","and Class thereof, from time to time for such consideration"
"3967"," paid wholly or partly in cash, securities or other property,"
"3968"," as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Trustees,"
"3969","subject to any requirements or limitations of the 1940 Act.  The"
"3970","Board of Trustees, on behalf of the Trust, may acquire and hold as"
"3971"," treasury shares, reissue for such consideration and on such terms"
"3972","as it may determine, or cancel, at its discretion from time to time,"
"3973","any Shares reacquired by the Trust.  The Board of Trustees may"
"3974"," classify, reclassify or convert any unissued Shares or any Shares"
"3975","of the Trust or any Series or Class thereof, that were previously"
"3976","issued and are reacquired, into one or more Series or Classes that"
"3977","may be established and designated from time to time and, in connection"
"3978","therewith, cause some or all of the Shareholders of the Trust, such"
"3979","Series or Class to become Shareholders of such other Series or Class."
"3980","Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust and any Series thereof may"
"3981","acquire, hold, sell and otherwise deal in, for purposes of investment"
"3982"," or otherwise, the Shares of any other Series of the Trust or Shares"
"3983","of the Trust, and such Shares shall not be deemed treasury shares or"
"3984"," cancelled."
"3985","(c)	Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Article III,"
"3986","each Share shall entitle the holder to voting rights as provided in"
"3987","Article V hereof.  Shareholders shall have no preemptive or other"
"3988","right to subscribe for new or additional authorized, but unissued"
"3989","Shares or other securities issued by the Trust or any Series thereof."
"3990","The Board of Trustees may from time to time divide or combine the"
"3991","Shares of the Trust or any particular Series thereof into a greater"
"3992","or lesser number of Shares of the Trust or that Series, respectively."
"3993"," Such division or combination shall not materially change the"
"3994","proportionate beneficial interests of the holders of Shares of"
"3995","the Trust or that Series, as the case may be, in the Trust"
"3996","Property at the time of such division or combination that"
"3997"," is held with respect to the Trust or that Series, as the"
"3998","case may be."
"3999","(d)	Any Trustee, officer or other agent of the Trust,"
"4000","and any organization in which any such Person has an economic"
"4001"," or other interest, may acquire, own, hold and dispose of"
"4002","Shares in the Trust or any Series and Class thereof, whether"
"4003","such Shares are authorized but unissued, or already outstanding,"
"4004","to the same extent as if such Person were not a Trustee, officer"
"4005"," or other agent of the Trust; and the Trust or any Series may"
"4006","issue and sell and may purchase such Shares from any such Person"
"4007"," or any such organization, subject to the limitations,"
"4008","restrictions or other provisions applicable to the sale or"
"4009"," purchase of such Shares herein and the 1940 Act."
"4010","Section 2.	Ownership of Shares.  The ownership of"
"4011","Shares shall be recorded on the books of the Trust kept"
"4012"," by the Trust or by a transfer or similar agent for the"
"4013"," Trust, which books shall be maintained separately for"
"4014","the Shares of the Trust and each Series and each Class"
"4015","thereof that has been established and designated."
"4016"," No certificates certifying the ownership of Shares shall be"
"4017"," issued except as the Board of Trustees may otherwise determine"
"4018"," from time to time.  The Board of Trustees may make such rules"
"4019"," not inconsistent with the provisions of the 1940 Act as it"
"4020","considers appropriate for the issuance of Share certificates,"
"4021"," the transfer of Shares of the Trust and each Series and"
"4022","Class thereof, if any, and similar matters.  The record books"
"4023"," of the Trust as kept by the Trust or any transfer or"
"4024","similar agent, as the case may be, shall be conclusive as"
"4025"," to who are the Shareholders of the Trust and each Series"
"4026"," and Class thereof and as to the number of Shares of the"
"4027","Trust and each Series and Class thereof held from time to"
"4028"," time by each such Shareholder."
"4029","Section 3.	Sale of Shares.  Subject to the 1940 Act and"
"4030","applicable law, the Trust may sell its authorized but unissued"
"4031"," Shares to such Persons, at such times, on such terms, and for"
"4032"," such consideration as the Board of Trustees may from time"
"4033","to time authorize.  Each sale shall be credited to the"
"4034","individual purchaser's account in the form of full or"
"4035"," fractional Shares of the Trust or such Series thereof"
"4036"," (and Class thereof, if any), as the purchaser may select,"
"4037","at the net asset value per Share, subject to Section 22 of"
"4038"," the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder;"
"4039","provided, however, that the Board of Trustees may, in its"
"4040","sole discretion, permit the Principal Underwriter to impose"
"4041"," a sales charge upon any such sale.  Every Shareholder by"
"4042"," virtue of having become a Shareholder shall be bound by"
"4043","the terms of this Declaration of Trust.  Ownership of Shares"
"4044"," shall not make any Shareholder a third-party beneficiary"
"4045"," of any contract entered into by the Trust or any Series."
"4046","Section 4.	Status of Shares and Limitation of Personal Liability."
"4047"," Shares shall be deemed to be personal property giving to Shareholders only"
"4048","the rights provided in this Declaration of Trust, the By-Laws, and under"
"4049","applicable law.  Ownership of Shares shall not entitle the Shareholder"
"4050"," to any title in or to the whole or any part of the Trust Property"
"4051","or right to call for a partition or division of the same or for"
"4052","an accounting, nor shall the ownership of Shares constitute the"

"4054","the death, incapacity, dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a"
"4055","Shareholder during the existence of the Trust and any Series thereof"
"4056"," shall not operate to dissolve the Trust or any such Series, nor"

"4063"," the Trust nor the Trustees, nor any officer, employee or agent"
"4064"," of the Trust, shall have any power to bind personally any"
"4065"," Shareholder, nor, except as specifically provided herein, to"
"4066"," call upon any Shareholder for the payment of any sum of money"
"4067","other than such as the Shareholder may at any time personally"
"4068"," agree to pay.  Each Share, when issued on the terms determined"
"4069","by the Board of Trustees, shall be fully paid and nonassessable."
"4070","As provided in the DSTA, Shareholders shall be entitled to the same"
"4071","limitation of personal liability as that extended to stockholders"

"4073"," the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware."
"4074","Section 5.	Power of Board of Trustees to Make Tax Status Election."
"4075","The Board of Trustees shall have the power, in its discretion, to make"
"4076","such elections as to the tax status of the Trust and any Series as"

"4079","Section 6.	Establishment and Designation of Series and Classes."
"4080"," The establishment and designation of any Series or Class shall be"
"4081","effective, without the requirement of Shareholder approval, upon the"

"4083","Board of Trustees, which resolution shall set forth such establishment"
"4084"," and designation whether directly in such resolutions or by reference"
"4085","to, or approval of, another document that sets forth the designation"
"4086","or otherwise identifies such Series or Class, including any registration"

"4093","with respect to any Series or Class, including any addition,"
"4094"," modification, division, combination, classification,"
"4095"," reclassification, change of name or termination, may be made"

"4111","Subject to Article II hereof, each such Series shall operate as"
"4112"," a separate and distinct investment medium, with separately"
"4113","defined investment objectives and policies."
"4114","Shares of each Series (and Class where applicable) established"

"4161"," (collectively General Liabilities) shall be allocated by the"
"4162","Board of Trustees, or an appropriate officer as determined by"
"4163"," the Board of Trustees, to and among any one or more of the Series"
"4164","in such manner and on such basis as the Board of Trustees in its"
"4165","sole discretion deems fair and equitable.  Each allocation of"

"4173","for payment of such credit, claim, or contract.  In the absence of an"
"4174"," express contractual agreement so limiting the claims of such"
"4175"," creditors, claimants and contract providers, each creditor, claimant"
"4176","and contract provider shall be deemed nevertheless to have impliedly"
"4177","agreed to such limitation."
"4178","Subject to the right of the Board of Trustees in its discretion to"
"4179","allocate General Liabilities as provided herein, the debts, liabilities,"
"4180","obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing"
"4181","with respect to a particular Series, whether such Series is now"
"4182","authorized and existing pursuant to this Declaration of Trust or is"
"4183","hereafter authorized and existing pursuant to this Declaration of Trust,"

"4192"," upon the giving of such notice in the Certificate of Trust, the"
"4193","statutory provisions of Section 3804 of the DSTA relating to"
"4194","limitations on liabilities between and among Series (and the statutory"

"4198"," reserves and expenses related to the distribution of, and"
"4199","other identified expenses that should or may properly"
"4200","be allocated to, the Shares of a particular"
"4201"," Class may be charged to and borne solely by such Class.  The"
"4202"," bearing of expenses solely by a particular Class of Shares may be"
"4203","appropriately reflected (in a manner determined by the Board of"
"4204"," Trustees) and may affect the net asset value attributable to, and"
"4205"," the dividend, redemption and liquidation rights of, such Class."
"4206","Each allocation of liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges,"
"4207","reserves and expenses by or under the direction of the Board of"

"4209","all Classes for all purposes.  All Persons who have extended credit"
"4210"," that has been allocated to a particular Class, or who have a claim"
"4211"," or contract that has been allocated to any particular Class, shall"
"4212","look, and may be required by contract to look, exclusively to that"
"4213"," particular Class for payment of such credit, claim, or contract."

"4216","limitation, Article VI hereof, no dividend or distribution including,"
"4217","without limitation, any distribution paid upon dissolution of the"
"4218","Trust or of any Series with respect to, nor any redemption of, the"
"4219"," Shares of any Series or Class of such Series shall be effected"
"4220"," by the Trust other than from the assets held with respect to such"

"4225"," of a right or claim against the assets held with respect to any other"
"4226","Series, to the extent that such Shareholder has such a right or claim"
"4227","hereunder as a Shareholder of such other Series.  The Board of"
"4228"," Trustees shall have full discretion, to the extent not inconsistent"
"4229","with the 1940 Act, to determine which items shall be treated as income"
"4230","and which items as capital; and each such determination and allocation"
"4231","shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders."
"4232","(d)	Voting.  All Shares of the Trust entitled to vote on a matter"
"4233"," shall vote in the aggregate without differentiation between the"

"5254","in considering the merits of the request and shall require"
"5255"," an undertaking by the Shareholders making such request"
"5256","to reimburse the Trust for the expense of any such advisors"
