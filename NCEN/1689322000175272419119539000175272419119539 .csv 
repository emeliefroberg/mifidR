"252","<DESCRIPTION>AUDITOR'S REPORT"
"253","<TEXT>"
"254","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"255","To the Shareholders and"
"256","Board of Trustees of"
"257","USCF Mutual Funds Trust"
"258","In planning and performing our audit of the USCF Mutual Funds Trust (the"
"259","Trust) comprised of the consolidated financial statements of USCF Commodity"
"260","Strategy Fund and Subsidiary (the initial series of the USCF Mutual Funds"
"261","Trust) (the Fund), as of March 31, 2019 and for the period from July 1, 2018"
"262","through March 31, 2019, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"263","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"264","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"265","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"266","of expressing our opinion on the consolidated financial statements and to"
"267","comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"268","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"269","financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"270","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"271","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"272","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"273","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"274","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal"
"275","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"276","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"277","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"278","accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  A company's internal control over"
"279","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"280","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"281","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company (2)"
"282","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"283","permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with"
"284","GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"285","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and"
"286","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"287","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could"
"288","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"289","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may"
"290","not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"291","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"292","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"293","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"294","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"295","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"296","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"297","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"298","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"299","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"300","the Funds' annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be"
"301","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"302","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"303","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"304","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"305","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"306","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies"
"307","in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and their operations,"
"308","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"309","material weakness as defined above as of March 31, 2019 and for the period"
"310","from July 1, 2018 through March 31, 2019."
"311","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management, the"
"312","Board of Trustees of USCF Mutual Funds Trust and the Securities and Exchange"
"313","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"314","than these specified parties."
