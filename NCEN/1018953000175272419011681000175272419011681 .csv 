"727","To the Board of Directors of Transamerica Financial Life"
"728","Insurance Company and Contract holders of Transamerica"
"729","Asset Allocation Variable Funds:"
"730","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"731","statements of Transamerica Asset Allocation Variable"
"732","Funds (the Trust) (comprising, respectively,"
"733","Transamerica Asset Allocation - Short Horizon"
"734","Subaccount, Transamerica Asset Allocation - Intermediate"
"735","Horizon Subaccount and Transamerica Asset Allocation -"
"736","Intermediate/Long Horizon Subaccount) (collectively, the"
"737","Subaccounts) as of and for the year ended December 31,"
"738","2018, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"739","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"740","considered the Trust's internal control over financial"
"741","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"742","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"743","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"744","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"745","CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"746","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over"
"747","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"748","opinion."
"749","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing"
"750","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"751","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"752","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"753","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"754","company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"755","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"756","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"757","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"758","with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"759","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"760","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"761","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"762","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"763","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"764","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"765","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"766","accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting"
"767","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"768","company are being made only in accordance with"
"769","authorizations of management and directors of the"
"770","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"771","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"772","use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"773","material effect on the financial statements."
"774","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"775","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"776","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"777","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"778","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"779","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"780","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"781","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"782","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"783","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"784","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"785","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"786","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"787","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"788","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"789","company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"790","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"791","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over"
"792","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"793","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"794","deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"795","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"796","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"797","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trust's internal"
"798","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"799","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be"
"800","a material weakness as defined above as of December 31,"
"801","2018."
"802","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"803","management and the Board of Trustees of the Trust and the"
"804","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to"
"805","be and should not be used by anyone other than these"

"822","Effective Prospectus"
"823","* * *"
"824","The following replaces the existing Legal Proceedings"
"825","disclosure in the Transamerica Asset Allocation Variable
Funds section of the Prospectus:"
"826","Legal Proceedings"
"827","On August 27, 2018, Transamerica Asset Management, Inc."
"828","(TAM), Aegon USA Investment Management, LLC"
"829","(AUIM) and Transamerica Capital, Inc. (TCI) reached a"
"830","settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the"
"831","SEC) that resolved an investigation into asset allocation"
"832","models and volatility overlays utilized by AUIM when it served"
"833","as sub-adviser to certain Transamerica-sponsored mutual funds,"
"834","and related disclosures. TAM and TCI serve as investment"
"835","manager and principal underwriter, respectively, to"
"836","Transamerica-sponsored mutual funds. TCI also serves as the"
"837","principal underwriter to the variable life insurance and annuity"
"838","products  through which certain Transamerica-sponsored"
"839","mutual funds are offered. AUIM, an affiliate of TAM and TCI,"
"840","serves as sub-adviser to a number of Transamerica-sponsored"
"841","mutual funds."
"842","The SEC's order instituting administrative and cease-and-desist"
"843","proceedings (the Order) pertains to events that occurred"
"844","during the period between July 2011 and June 2015, and,"
"845","among other things, the operation and/or implementation of an"
"846","asset allocation model utilized by AUIM when it served as sub-"
"847","adviser to  certain  Transamerica tactical funds and asset"
"848","allocation funds, the designation of the portfolio manager for"
"849","certain of these funds as well as the operation and/or"
"850","implementation of volatility overlays utilized by AUIM when it"
"851","served as sub- adviser to the asset allocation funds. The Order"
"852","also states that the parties failed to make appropriate disclosures"
"853","regarding these matters, including in marketing materials, and"
"854","failed to have adequate compliance policies and procedures."
"855","The tactical funds are Transamerica Dynamic Income"
"856","(formerly, Transamerica Tactical Income), Transamerica"
"857","Dynamic Allocation (formerly, Transamerica Tactical Rotation)"
"858","and Transamerica Dynamic Allocation II (formerly,"
"859","Transamerica Tactical Allocation, and now reorganized into"
"860","Transamerica Dynamic Allocation). The asset allocation funds"
"861","are Transamerica Managed Risk - Conservative ETF VP"
"862","(formerly, Transamerica Vanguard ETF Portfolio -"
"863","Conservative VP and Transamerica Index 35 VP), Transamerica"
"864","Managed Risk - Balanced ETF VP (formerly, Transamerica"
"865","Vanguard ETF Portfolio - Balanced VP and Transamerica"
"866","Index 50 VP), Transamerica Managed Risk - Growth ETF VP"
"867","(formerly, Transamerica Vanguard ETF Portfolio - Growth VP"
"868","and Transamerica Index 75 VP), Transamerica QS Investors"
"869","Active Asset Allocation - Conservative VP (formerly,"
"870","Transamerica Aegon Active Asset Allocation - Conservative"
"871","VP), Transamerica QS Investors Active Asset Allocation -"
"872","Moderate VP (formerly, Transamerica Aegon Active Asset"
"873","Allocation - Moderate VP) and Transamerica QS Investors"
"874","Active Asset Allocation - Moderate Growth VP (formerly,"
"875","Transamerica Aegon Active Asset Allocation - Moderate"
"876","Growth VP). AUIM ceased to serve as sub-adviser to the"
"877","Transamerica tactical funds on April 30, 2015 and to the"
"878","Transamerica asset allocation funds on June 30, 2015."
"879","Under the terms of the Order, AUIM, TAM and TCI were"
"880","censured, and agreed, without admitting or denying the findings"
"881","in the Order, to cease and desist from committing or causing"
"882","any violations of certain statutory provisions and SEC rules."
"883","AUIM agreed to pay civil penalties of $21,000,000,"
"884","$24,599,896 in disgorgement and $3,682,195 in prejudgment"
"885","interest.    TAM  agreed  to  pay  civil  penalties  of"
"886","$10,500,000,  $15,000,000  in  disgorgement  and"
"887","$2,235,765 in prejudgment interest. TCI agreed to pay civil"
"888","penalties of $4,000,000, $12,000,000 in disgorgement and"
"889","$1,826,022 in prejudgment interest. The amounts paid in"
"890","disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties will be"
"891","deposited into a Fair Fund for distribution to affected investors."
"892","Affected investors are those who purchased or held the relevant"
"893","mutual funds, variable life insurance and annuity investment"
"894","portfolios and separately managed account strategies during the"
"895","period between July 2011 and June 2015. The Order states that"
"896","these investors are to receive from the Fair Fund the pro rata"
"897","fees and commissions paid by them during that period, subject"
"898","to any de minimis threshold."
"899","In accepting the settlement, the SEC considered the substantial"
"900","cooperation and remedial efforts of AUIM, TAM  and TCI."
"901","In the Order, the SEC acknowledged that, after the start of the"
"902","SEC staff's investigation but before the"
"903","settlement, AUIM, TAM and TCI had voluntarily retained an"
"904","independent compliance consultant to conduct a comprehensive"
"905","review of certain compliance policies and procedures, internal"
"906","controls and related procedures, and that AUIM, TAM and TCI"
"907","had received the consultant's written findings and implemented"
"908","the  consultant's proposed changes. The SEC also"
"909","acknowledged that, in advance of receiving written findings and"
"910","recommendations from the independent compliance consultant,"
"911","AUIM, TAM and TCI had already begun making revisions and"
"912","improvements to their compliance policies and procedures. The"
"913","SEC also considered that AUIM, TAM and TCI have retained"
"914","the independent compliance consultant for further reviews"
"915","through the completion of the consultant's follow-up review for"
"916","fiscal year 2019."
"917","The settlement does not impose any restrictions on the business"
"918","or continued ability of AUIM, TAM or TCI to serve the funds."
"919","Transamerica Financial Advisors, LLC (TFA), which serves"
"920","as an intermediary for the Transamerica-sponsored mutual"
"921","funds, also was a party to the settlement. The findings in the"
"922","Order with respect to TFA are unrelated to the mutual funds."
"923","The foregoing is only a brief summary of the Order. A copy of"
"924","the Order is available on the SEC's website at"
"925","https://www.sec.gov."
"926","The funds are affected by many factors and risks: for example,"
"927","the risk that the sub-advisers' judgments and investment"
"928","decisions, and methods, tools, resources, information, models"
"929","and analyses utilized in making investment decisions, are"
"930","incorrect or flawed, do not produce the desired results, and"
"931","cause the funds to lose value. See Principal Risks in the"
"932","prospectus."
