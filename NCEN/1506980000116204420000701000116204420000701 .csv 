"348","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"349","To the Shareholders of Tarkio Fund and"
"350","Board of Trustees of Clark Fork Trust"
"351","In  planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Tarkio Fund"
"352","(the Fund), a series of the Clark Fork Trust, as of and for the year ended May"
"353","31, 2020,  in  accordance  with  the  standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"354","Oversight Board (United States), we considered  the Fund's internal control over"
"355","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"356","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose  of expressing our opinion"
"357","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements  of  Form N-CEN,"
"358","but  not  for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness  of  the"
"359","Fund's internal  control  over  financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no"
"360","such opinion."
"361","The  management  of the Fund is responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining"
"362","effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.   In  fulfilling  this"
"363","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"364","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"365","financial reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable assurance"
"366","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"367","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"368","accounting   principles  (GAAP).   A  fund's  internal  control  over  financial"
"369","reporting includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that  (1)  pertain  to the"
"370","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"371","the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the fund; (2) provide"
"372","reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are recorded as necessary  to  permit"
"373","preparation of financial statements in accordance  with  GAAP, and that receipts"
"374","and   expenditures  of  the  fund  are  being  made  only  in  accordance   with"
"375","authorizations  of  management  and  trustees  of  the  fund;  and  (3)  provide"
"376","reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"377","acquisition, use or disposition of  a  fund's  assets that could have a material"
"378","effect on the financial statements."
"379","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control  over  financial reporting"
"380","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"381","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"382","inadequate  because of changes in conditions, or that the degree  of  compliance"
"383","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"384","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"385","or operation  of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"386","course  of  performing   their   assigned   functions,   to  prevent  or  detect"
"387","misstatements  on  a  timely  basis.   A material weakness is a  deficiency,  or"
"388","combination of deficiencies, in internal  control over financial reporting, such"
"389","that  there is a reasonable possibility that  a  material  misstatement  of  the"
"390","Fund's  annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"391","on a timely basis."
"392","Our consideration  of  the  Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"393","for  the  limited  purpose described  in  the  first  paragraph  and  would  not"
"394","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"395","weaknesses  under  standards   established  by  the  Public  Company  Accounting"
"396","Oversight Board (United States).   However,  we  noted  no  deficiencies  in the"
"397","Fund's  internal  control  over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"398","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material weakness"
"399","as defined above as of May 31, 2020."
"400","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"401","Board of Trustees of the Fund  and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"402","not intended to be and should not  be  used by anyone other than these specified"
"403","parties."
