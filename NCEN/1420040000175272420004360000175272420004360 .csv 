"3945","that the degree of"

"3949","A deficiency in internal"
"3950","control over financial"
"3951","reporting exists when"
"3952","the design or operation"
"3953","of a control does not"

"3963","deficiency, or"
"3964","combination of"
"3965","deficiencies, in internal"
"3966","control over financial"
"3967","reporting, such that"
"3968","there is a reasonable"

"3972","interim financial"
"3973","statements will not be"
"3974","prevented or detected"

"3976","Our consideration of the"
"3977","Funds' internal control"
"3978","over financial reporting"
"3979","was for the limited"
"3980","purpose described in"
"3981","the first paragraph and"
"3982","would not necessarily"
"3983","disclose all deficiencies"

"3985","might be material"
"3986","weaknesses under"
"3987","standards established"

"3989","However, we noted no"

"3992","over financial reporting"
"3993","and its operation,"
"3994","including controls over"
"3995","safeguarding securities"

"3997","material weakness, as"
"3998","defined above, as of"
