"1607","To the Board of Trustees of Franklin Real Estate Securities Trust"
"1608"," and Shareholders of Franklin Real Estate Securities Fund"
"1609","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"1610","of Franklin Real Estate Securities Fund (the Fund) as of and"
"1611"," for the year ended April 30, 2019, in accordance with the standards"
"1612","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),"
"1613"," we considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"1614","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"1615","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"1616","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"1617","of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"1618"," on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"1619","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express"
"1620","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"1621","control over financial reporting."
"1622","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"1623"," and maintaining effective internal control over"
"1624","financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1625","estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1626"," the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"1627","A company's internal control over financial reporting is"
"1628"," a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1629","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1630","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"1631","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1632","accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"1633"," over financial reporting includes those policies"
"1634","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1635"," records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1636"," fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"1637","of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1638","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1639","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1640","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"1641","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1642","expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"1643","accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"1644"," of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1645","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1646","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"1647","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1648","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1649","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1650"," Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"1651"," future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1652","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"1653"," the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures"
