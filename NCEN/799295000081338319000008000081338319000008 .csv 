"1555","Global Fixed Income Fund (the Fund), a series of Dreyfus Investment Funds, as"
"1556","of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, in accordance with the standards"
"1557","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"

"1566","of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1567","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"1568","and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1569","related costs of controls. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial"
"1570","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1571","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"1572","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles"
"1573","(GAAP). A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1574","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1575","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1576","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"1577","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1578","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"1579","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"1580","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"1581","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a company&#8217;s"
"1582","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</font></p>"

"1584","<p style=margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;><font face=Times New Roman lang=EN-US style=font-size:11.0pt;>Because"
"1585","of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not"
"1586","prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1587","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1588","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1589","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </font></p>"
