"1636","Item G.1.a.i - Deutsche DWS Institutional Funds"
"1637","(formerly DWS Institutional Funds)"
"1638","On December 7, 2010, Deutsche DWS Institutional"
"1639","Funds (formerly DWS Institutional Funds) (the"
"1640","Trust) was named as a defendant in the First"
"1641","Amended Complaint filed by the Official"
"1642","Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the U.S."
"1643","Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in the"
"1644","lawsuit styled Official Committee of Unsecured"
"1645","Creditors of Tribune Company, et al., v. Fitzsimons"
"1646","et al. (the Lawsuit).  The Lawsuit arises out of a"
"1647","leveraged buyout transaction (LBO) in 2007 by"
"1648","which loans were made to the Tribune Company to"
"1649","fund the LBO and shares of the Tribune Company"
"1650","held by shareholders were tendered for or were"
"1651","converted to a right to receive cash.  Following the"
"1652","completion of the LBO in 2007, the Tribune"
"1653","Company filed for bankruptcy.  The Lawsuit seeks"
"1654","to recover all payments made to the shareholders in"
"1655","the LBO.  The Lawsuit has been consolidated in a"
"1656","multi-district litigation (the Tribune MDL) in the"
"1657","United States District Court for the Southern"
"1658","District of New York, case no. 12-MC-2296 (the"
"1659","District Court).  At the outset of the Lawsuit, the"
"1660","District Court issued a scheduling order which"
"1661","stayed all substantive proceedings in the Lawsuit"
"1662","until after the decision on motions to dismiss based"
"1663","on certain defenses common to the defendants filed"
"1664","in related cases."
"1665","On September 23, 2013, the District Court entered"
"1666","an order granting the defendants' motion to dismiss"
"1667","in certain of those related cases (the Bondholder
Actions) due to the pendency of the Lawsuit"
"1668","seeking recoveries on similar grounds, and the"
"1669","plaintiffs in Bondholder Actions appealed that order"
"1670","to the United States Court of Appeals for the"
"1671","Second Circuit.  On April 25, 2014, the District"
"1672","Court entered an order governing the upcoming"
"1673","stage of the Lawsuit, which directed Ropes & Gray,"
"1674","as Liaison Counsel to the Shareholder Defendants,"
"1675","to file a global motion to dismiss (the Global
Motion to Dismiss) the Lawsuit on behalf of all"
"1676","shareholder defendants named in Exhibit A to the"
"1677","current Fifth Amended Complaint (including the"
"1678","Trust).  The Global Motion to Dismiss was filed on"
"1679","May 23, 2014."
"1680","On March 29, 2016, the Second Circuit, in a"
"1681","unanimous opinion, affirmed the District Court's"
"1682","dismissal of the Bondholder Actions.  The"
"1683","Bondholder Actions plaintiffs subsequently filed a"
"1684","petition for rehearing, which the Second Circuit"
"1685","denied on July 22, 2016.  On September 9, 2016,"
"1686","the Bondholder Actions plaintiffs filed a petition for"
"1687","a writ of certiorari of the Second Circuit's decision"
"1688","in the U.S. Supreme Court."
"1689","On January 6, 2017, the District Court granted the"
"1690","Global Motion to Dismiss, dismissing the only"
"1691","claim asserted against the shareholder defendants"
"1692","named in the Lawsuit, and denied the plaintiff's"
"1693","request for leave to amend the Complaint."
"1694","On April 3, 2018, Supreme Court Justices Kennedy"
"1695","and Thomas issued a Statement indicating that"
"1696","consideration of the petition for certiorari in the"
"1697","Bondholder Actions will be deferred for an
additional period of time because of the possibility"
"1698","that there might not be a quorum of Justices"
"1699","available to consider those cases.  The Statement"
"1700","also said that this deferral would allow the Second"
"1701","Circuit or the District Court to consider whether to"
"1702","recall the mandate, entertain a motion to vacate the"
"1703","earlier judgment, or provide any other available"
"1704","relief in light of the Supreme Court's decision in"
"1705","another case, FTI Consulting, Inc. v. Merit"
"1706","Management Group, 830 F.3d 690 (7th Cir. 2016)"
"1707","(Merit Mgmt.).  On April 10, 2018, the"
"1708","Bondholder Actions plaintiffs filed a motion"
"1709","requesting that the Second Circuit recall its"
"1710","mandate, vacate its affirmation of the District"
"1711","Court's dismissal of their claims, and remand the"
"1712","Bondholder Actions to the District Court for further"
"1713","proceedings."
"1714","On May 15, 2018, the Second"
"1715","Circuit granted plaintiffs' motion to recall the"
"1716","court's mandate in anticipation of further panel
review. On December 19, 2019, the Second Circuit"
"1717","affirmed its prior dismissal of the Bondholder"
"1718","Actions plaintiffs' claims, notwithstanding the"
"1719","Supreme Court's decision in Merit Mgmt. On"
"1720","January 2, 2020, the Bondholder Actions plaintiffs"
"1721","filed a motion requesting that the Second Circuit"
"1722","panel reconsider that ruling or that the full Second"
"1723","Circuit review the opinion en banc (the"
"1724","Reconsideration Motion). On February 6, 2020,"
"1725","the Second Circuit denied the Reconsideration"
"1726","Motion."
"1727","On April 4, 2019, the plaintiff in the Lawsuit filed a"
"1728","motion to amend his complaint to add constructive"
"1729","fraudulent conveyance claims against shareholder"
"1730","defendants based on an alleged change in governing"
"1731","law resulting from the Supreme Court's decision in"
"1732","Merit Mgmt.  On April 23, 2019, the District Court"
"1733","denied that motion.  On July 15, 2019, the plaintiff"
"1734","in the Lawsuit filed a notice of appeal to the Second"
"1735","Circuit for these District Court rulings in the"
"1736","Lawsuit.  On January 7, 2020, the plaintiff filed his"
"1737","opening appellate brief."
"1738","We express no opinion on the likely outcome of"
"1739","these matters. Management is currently assessing"
"1740","the Lawsuit and has not yet determined the effect, if"
"1741","any, on any series of the Trust."

"1751","To the Board of Trustees of Deutsche DWS"
"1752","Institutional Funds and Shareholders of DWS"
"1753","Equity 500 Index Fund and DWS S&P 500"

"1758","Funds) (two of the funds constituting"
"1759","Deutsche DWS Institutional Funds) (the"
"1760","Trust), as of and for the year ended December"
"1761","31, 2019, in accordance with the standards of the"
"1762","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1763","(United States), we considered the Trust's"
"1764","internal control over financial reporting,"
"1765","including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"1766","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"1767","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1768","financial statements and to comply with the"
"1769","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the"
"1770","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1771","effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over"
"1772","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"1773","such opinion."
"1774","The management of the Trust is responsible for"
"1775","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1776","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1777","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1778","management are required to assess the expected"
"1779","benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"1780","company's internal control over financial"
"1781","reporting is a process designed to provide"
"1782","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1783","financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1784","financial statements for external purposes in"
"1785","accordance with U.S. generally accepted"
"1786","accounting principles. A company's internal"
"1787","control over financial reporting includes those"
"1788","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1789","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1790","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1791","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"1792","provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"1793","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"1794","of financial statements in accordance with U.S."
"1795","generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1796","that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"1797","are being made only in accordance with"
"1798","authorizations of management and directors of"
"1799","the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1800","assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1801","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"1802","disposition of a company's assets that could"
"1803","have a material effect on the financial"
"1804","statements."
"1805","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1806","control over financial reporting may not prevent"
"1807","or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"1808","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1809","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1810","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"1811","that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"1812","or procedures may deteriorate."
"1813","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1814","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"1815","a control does not allow management or"
"1816","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1817","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1818","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"1819","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1820","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1821","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1822","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1823","company's annual or interim financial"
"1824","statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"1825","timely basis."
"1826","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control"
"1827","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"1828","purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"1829","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1830","internal control that might be material"
"1831","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1832","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1833","(United States). However, we noted no"
"1834","deficiencies in the Trust's internal control over"
"1835","financial reporting and its operation, including"
"1836","controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"1837","consider to be a material weakness as defined"
"1838","above as of December 31, 2019."
