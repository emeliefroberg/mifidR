"2515","<P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>The management of the Series is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"2516","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A Series&#146; internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2517","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Series&#146; internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"2518","policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Series; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that"
"2519","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Series are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"2520","of management and Trustees of the Series; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a Series&#146; assets that could have a material effect on the financial"

"2522","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>"
"2523","<P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
