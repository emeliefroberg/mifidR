"1344","<TEXT>"
"1345","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1346","To the Board of Trustees of Franklin Templeton Global Trust"
"1347","and Shareholders of Templeton Global Currency Fund"
"1348","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"1349","financial statements of Templeton Global Currency Fund (the Fund)"
"1350","as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, in accordance with"
"1351","the standards of the"
"1352","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),"
"1353","we considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"1354","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1355","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1356","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1357","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"1358","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"1359","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion"
"1360","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1361","reporting."
"1362","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1363","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1364","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"1365","are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"1366","costs of controls.  A company's internal control over financial"
"1367","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1368","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1369","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"1370","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal"
"1371","control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"1372","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1373","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1374","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"1375","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1376","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1377","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"1378","the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"1379","of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1380","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1381","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could"
"1382","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1383","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1384","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"1385","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1386","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1387","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1388","procedures may deteriorate."
"1389","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1390","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1391","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"1392","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"1393","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"1394","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1395","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's"
"1396","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1397","detected on a timely basis."
"1398","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1399","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the"
"1400","first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"1401","in internal control over financial reporting that might"
"1402","be material weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB."
"1403","  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control"
"1404","over financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"1405","over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material"
"1406","weakness as defined above as of December 31, 2018."
"1407","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"1408","of the Board of Trustees of Franklin Templeton Global Trust"
"1409","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"1410","to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1430","Franklin Templeton Global Trust"
"1431","Templeton Global Currency Fund"
"1432","Notice of Automatic Conversion of Class C Shares to Class A Shares"
"1433","after 10-Year Holding Period"
"1434","At Board meetings held on February 26 and 27, 2018, the Board"
"1435","of Trustees approved an automatic conversion feature for the"
"1436","Fund's Class C shares (which includes Class C1 shares as applicable)"
"1437","that will automatically convert shareholders' Class C shares into Class"
"1438","A shares of the same Fund after they have been held for 10 years. After"
"1439","conversion, your new shares will be subject to Class A shares' lower"
"1440","Rule 12b-1 fees. The conversion feature will become effective on or"
"1441","about October 5, 2018.  Later that month Class C shares of the Fund"
"1442","that have been outstanding for 10 years or more will automatically"
"1443","convert to Class A shares of such Fund on the basis of the relative"
"1444","net asset values of the two classes. Thereafter, Class C shares of"
"1445","the Fund will convert automatically to Class A shares of such Fund"
"1446","on a monthly basis in the month of, or the month following, the"
"1447","10-year anniversary of the Class C shares' purchase date. Class"
"1448","C shares of the Fund acquired through automatic reinvestment of"
"1449","dividends or distributions will convert to Class A shares of the"
"1450","Fund on the conversion date pro rata with the converting Class C"
"1451","shares of the Fund that were not acquired through reinvestment of"
"1452","dividends or distributions."
"1453","Shareholders will not pay a sales charge, including a contingent"
"1454","deferred sales charge, upon the conversion of their Class C shares"
"1455","to Class A shares pursuant to this conversion feature. The automatic"
"1456","conversion of the Fund's Class C shares into Class A shares after the"
"1457","10-year holding period is not expected to be a taxable event for federal"
"1458","income tax purposes. Shareholders should consult with their tax advisor"
"1459","regarding the state and local tax consequences of such conversions."
"1460","Class C shares held through a financial intermediary in an omnibus"
"1461","account will be converted into Class A shares only if the intermediary"
"1462","can document that the shareholder has met the required holding period."
"1463","In certain circumstances, when shares are invested through retirement"
"1464","plans, omnibus accounts, and in certain other instances, the Fund and"
"1465","its agents may not have transparency into how long a shareholder has"
"1466","held Class C shares for purposes of determining whether such Class C"
"1467","shares are eligible for automatic conversion into Class A shares and"
"1468","the financial intermediary may not have the ability to track purchases"
"1469","to credit individual shareholders' holding periods.  This primarily"
"1470","occurs when shares are invested through certain record keepers for"
"1471","group retirement plans, where the intermediary cannot track share"
"1472","aging at the participant level.  In these circumstances, the Fund"
"1473","will not be able to automatically convert Class C shares into Class"
"1474","A shares as described above. In order to determine eligibility for"
"1475","conversion in these circumstances, it is the responsibility of the"
"1476","shareholder or their financial intermediary to notify the Fund that"
"1477","the shareholder is eligible for the conversion of Class C shares to"
"1478","Class A shares, and the shareholder or their financial intermediary"
"1479","may be required to maintain and provide the Fund with records that"
"1480","substantiate the holding period of Class C shares. It is the"
"1481","financial intermediary's (and not the Fund's) responsibility"
"1482","to keep records and to ensure that the shareholder is credited"
"1483","with the proper holding period. Please consult with your financial"
"1484","intermediary about your shares' eligibility for this conversion feature."
"1485","Also effective October 5, 2018, new accounts or plans may not be eligible"
"1486","to purchase Class C shares of the Fund if it is determined that the"
"1487","intermediary cannot track shareholder holding periods to determine"
"1488","whether a shareholder's Class C shares are eligible for conversion"
"1489","to Class A shares.  Accounts or plans (and their successor, related"
"1490","and affiliated plans) that have Class C shares of the Fund available"
"1491","to participants on or before October 5, 2018, may continue to open"
"1492","accounts for new participants in such share class and purchase"
"1493","additional shares in existing participant accounts.  The Fund"
"1494","has no responsibility for overseeing, monitoring or implementing"
"1495","a financial intermediary's process for determining whether a"
"1496","shareholder meets the required holding period for conversion."
"1497","A financial intermediary may sponsor and/or control accounts,"
"1498","programs or platforms that impose a different conversion schedule"
"1499","or different eligibility requirements for the conversion of Class"
"1500","C shares into Class A shares. In these cases, Class C shareholders"
"1501","may convert to Class A shares under the policies of the financial"
"1502","intermediary and the conversion may be structured as an exchange"
"1503","of Class C shares for Class A shares of the same Fund. Financial"
"1504","intermediaries will be responsible for making such exchanges in"
"1505","those circumstances. Please consult with your financial intermediary"
"1506","if you have any questions regarding your shares' conversion from"
"1507","Class C shares to Class A shares."

MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS
Section 1.	PLACE OF MEETINGS.  Meetings of Shareholders shall
be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware
designated by the Board.  In the absence of any such designation
by the Board, Shareholders' meetings shall be held at the
offices of the Trust.
Section 2.	MEETINGS.  Any meeting of Shareholders may be
called at any time by the Board, by the chairperson of the Board or
by the president of the Trust for the purpose of taking action
upon any matter deemed by the Board to be necessary or desirable.
To the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, a meeting of the
Shareholders for the purpose of electing Trustees may also
be called by the chairperson of the Board.  There shall be
no annual meetings of the Shareholders for the election of
Trustees or the transaction of any other business except as
required by the 1940 Act or other applicable federal law.
In the event any annual meeting of the Shareholders is to be held,
it shall be held at the principal executive office of the Trust
or as otherwise determined by the Board of Trustees. Special meetings
of the Shareholders shall be held as provided herein or in the
Declaration of Trust or as otherwise required by the 1940 Act
or other applicable federal law. Except as required by federal law,
including the 1940 Act, the Shareholders shall not be entitled to
call, or to have the Secretary call, meetings of the Shareholders.
To the extent required by federal law, including the 1940 Act,
special meetings of the Shareholders shall be called by the
Secretary upon the request of the Shareholders owning Shares
representing at least the percentage of the total combined
votes of all Shares of the Trust issued and outstanding
required by federal law, including the 1940 Act, provided that
(a) such request shall state the purposes of such meeting
and the matters proposed to be acted on, and (b)
the Shareholders requesting such meeting shall have paid
to the Trust the reasonably estimated cost of preparing
and mailing the notice thereof, which an authorized officer
of the Trust shall determine and specify to such Shareholders.
No meeting shall be called upon the request of Shareholders
to consider any matter which is substantially the same
as a matter voted upon at any meeting of the Shareholders
held during the preceding twelve (12) months, unless
requested by the holders of a majority of all Shares entitled
to be voted at such meeting.
Section 3.	NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING.  Notice of any
meeting of Shareholders shall be given to each Shareholder entitled
to vote at such meeting in accordance with Section 4 of this Article II
not less than ten (10) nor more than one hundred and twenty (120) days
before the date of the meeting.  The notice shall specify (i) the
place, date and hour of the meeting, and (ii) the general nature
of the business to be transacted and to the extent required by
the 1940 Act, the purpose or purposes thereof.
Section 4.	MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE.  Notice of any meeting
of Shareholders shall be given either personally or by United States mail,
courier, cablegram, telegram, facsimile or electronic mail, or other
form of communication permitted by then current law, charges prepaid,
addressed to the Shareholder or to the group of Shareholders at the
same address as may be permitted pursuant to applicable laws, or as
Shareholders may otherwise consent, at the address of that Shareholder
appearing on the books of the Trust or its transfer or other duly
authorized agent or provided in writing by the Shareholder to
the Trust for the purpose of notice.  Notice shall be deemed to be given when
delivered personally, deposited in the United States mail or with a
courier, or sent by cablegram, telegram, facsimile or electronic
mail.  If no address of a Shareholder appears on the Trust's books
or has been provided in writing by a Shareholder, notice shall be
deemed to have been duly given without a mailing, or substantial
equivalent thereof, if such notice shall be available to the
Shareholder on written demand of the Shareholder at
the offices of the Trust.
If any notice addressed to a Shareholder at the address of that
Shareholder appearing on the books of the Trust or that has been
provided in writing by that Shareholder to the Trust for
the purpose of notice, is returned to the Trust marked to indicate
that the notice to the Shareholder cannot be delivered
at that address, all future notices or reports shall be
deemed to have been duly given without further mailing,
or substantial equivalent thereof, if such notices shall
be available to the Shareholder on written demand of the
Shareholder at the offices of the Trust. In the absence of fraud,
any irregularities in the notice of any meeting or the nonreceipt
of any such notice by any of the Shareholders shall not
invalidate any action otherwise properly taken at any such meeting.
Section 5.	POSTPONED AND ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE.  Prior to
the date upon which any meeting of Shareholders is to be held,
the Board of Trustees may postpone such meeting one or more times
for any reason by giving notice to each Shareholder entitled
to vote at the meeting so postponed of the place, date
and hour at which such meeting will be held.  Such notice shall
be given not fewer than two (2) days before the date of such meeting
and otherwise in accordance with this Article II.  Any Shareholders'
meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from
time to time for any reason whatsoever by vote of the holders of
Shares entitled to vote holding not less than a majority of the
Shares present in person or by proxy at the meeting, or by the
chairperson of the Board, the president of the Trust, in the
absence of the chairperson of the Board, or any vice president
or other authorized officer of the Trust, in the absence of
the president.  Any adjournment may be made with respect to
any business which might have been transacted at such meeting
and any adjournment will not delay or otherwise affect the
effectiveness and validity of any business transacted at
the Shareholders' meeting prior to adjournment.
When any Shareholders' meeting is adjourned to another time or place,
written notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the
time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which
the adjournment is taken, unless after the adjournment, a new record
date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, or unless the adjournment is
for more than one hundred and eighty (180) days from the record date
set for the original meeting, in which case, the Board of Trustees
shall set a new record date as provided in Article V of the
Declaration of Trust and give written notice to each Shareholder
of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance
with the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this Article II.
At any postponed or adjourned meeting, any business may
be transacted that might have been transacted at the original
meeting.
Section 6.	VOTING.
(a)	The Shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of
Shareholders and the Shareholder vote required to take action
shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the
Declaration of Trust.  Unless determined by the inspector of
the meeting to be advisable, the vote on any question need not
be by written ballot.
(b)	Unless otherwise determined by the Board at the time
it approves an action to be submitted to the Shareholders for approval,
Shareholder approval of an action shall remain in effect until
such time as the approved action is implemented or the Shareholders
vote to the contrary.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an agreement
of merger, consolidation, conversion or reorganization may be
terminated or amended notwithstanding prior approval if
so authorized by such agreement of merger, consolidation,
conversion or reorganization pursuant to Section 3815 of the
DSTA and/or pursuant to the Declaration of Trust, these
By-Laws and Section 3806 of the DSTA.
Section 7.	WAIVER OF NOTICE BY CONSENT OF ABSENT SHAREHOLDERS.
Attendance by a Shareholder, in person or by proxy, at a meeting
shall constitute a waiver of notice of that meeting with respect
to that Shareholder, except when the Shareholder attends the meeting
for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the
meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting
is not lawfully called or convened.  Whenever notice of a Shareholders'
meeting is required to be given to a Shareholder under the Declaration
of Trust or these By-Laws, a written waiver thereof, executed
before or after the time notice is required to be given, by
such Shareholder or his or her attorney thereunto authorized,
shall be deemed equivalent to such notice.  The waiver of notice
need not specify the purpose of, or the business to be
transacted at, the meeting.
Section 8.	PROXIES.  Every Shareholder entitled to vote for
Trustees or on any other matter that may properly come before
the meeting shall have the right to do so either in person or by
one or more agents authorized by a written proxy executed by the
Shareholder and filed with the secretary of the Trust before being
voted; provided, that an alternative to the execution of a
written proxy may be permitted as described in the next paragraph
of this Section 8.  A proxy shall be deemed executed if the
Shareholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual
signature, typewriting, telegraphic or electronic transmission
(as defined in Section 3806 of the DSTA) or otherwise) by
the Shareholder or the Shareholder's attorney-in-fact.
A valid proxy that does not state that it is irrevocable shall
continue in full force and effect unless (i) revoked by the person
executing it before the vote pursuant to that proxy is taken (a)
by a writing delivered to the Trust stating that the proxy is
revoked, (b) by a subsequent proxy executed by such person,
(c) attendance at the meeting and voting in person by the
person executing that proxy, or (d) revocation by such person
using any electronic, telephonic, computerized or other
alternative means authorized by the Trustees for authorizing
the proxy to act; or (ii) written notice of the death or incapacity
of the maker of that proxy is received by the Trust before the
vote pursuant to that proxy is counted; provided, however,
that no proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven
(11) months from the date of the proxy unless otherwise expressly
provided in the proxy.  The revocability of a proxy that states
on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the
provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
Unless revoked, any proxy given in connection with a postponed or
adjourned meeting for which a new record date is fixed shall
continue to be valid so long as the Shareholder giving such
proxy is a Shareholder of record on such new such record date.
With respect to any Shareholders' meeting, the Board, or, in
case the Board does not act, the president, any vice president or
the secretary, may permit proxies by electronic transmission
(as defined in Section 3806 of the DSTA), telephonic, computerized,
telecommunications or other reasonable alternative to the
execution of a written instrument authorizing the holder
of the proxy to act.  A proxy with respect to Shares held in
the name of two or more Persons shall be valid if executed, or a
permitted alternative to execution is used, by any one of them unless,
at or prior to the exercise of the proxy, the secretary of the
Trust receives a specific written notice to the contrary from any
one of them.  A proxy purporting to be by or on behalf of a Shareholder
shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise
and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest with the challenger.
Unless otherwise specifically limited by their terms, proxies shall
entitle the Shareholder to vote at any adjournment or postponement
of a Shareholder meeting.
Subject to the provisions of the DSTA, the Declaration of Trust or
these By-Laws, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
relating to proxies, and judicial interpretations thereunder,
shall govern all matters concerning the giving, voting or validity
of proxies, as if the Trust were a Delaware corporation and the
Shareholders were stockholders of a Delaware corporation.
Section 9.	INSPECTORS.  Before any meeting of Shareholders,
the chairperson of the Board, or in the absence of the chairperson
of the Board, the president of the Trust, or in the absence of the
president, any vice president or other authorized officer of the Trust,
may appoint any person other than nominees for office to act as
inspector at the meeting or any adjournment.  If any person appointed
as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act,
the chairperson of the Board, or in the absence of the chairperson of
the Board, the president of the Trust, or in the absence of the
president, any vice president or other authorized officer of the
Trust, shall appoint a person to fill the vacancy.  Such
appointments may be made by such officers in person or by telephone.
The inspector shall:
(a)	determine the number of Shares and the voting power
of each, the Shares represented at the meeting, the existence
of a quorum and the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies;
(b)	receive votes or ballots;
(c)	hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising
in connection with the right to vote;
(d)	count and tabulate all votes;
(e)	determine when the polls shall close;
(f)	determine the result of voting; and
(g)	do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the
election or vote with fairness to all Shareholders.
ARTICLE III
TRUSTEES
Section 1.	VACANCIES.
(a)	Whenever a vacancy in the Board shall occur (by reason of death,
resignation, removal, retirement, an increase in the authorized number
of Trustees or other cause), until such vacancy is filled as provided
herein or the number of authorized Trustees constituting the
Board of Trustees is decreased pursuant to Article IV, Section
1 of the Declaration of Trust, the Trustee(s) then in office,
regardless of the number and even if less than a quorum,
shall have all the powers granted to the Board and shall
discharge all the duties imposed upon the Board by the
Declaration of Trust and these By-Laws as though such number
constitutes the entire Board.
(b)	Vacancies in the Board of Trustees may be filled by not
less than a majority vote of the Trustee(s) then in office, regardless
of the number and even if less than a quorum and a meeting of
Shareholders shall be called for the purpose of electing
Trustees if required by the 1940 Act.  Notwithstanding the above,
whenever and for so long as the Trust is a participant in or
otherwise has in effect a plan under which the Trust may be
deemed to bear expenses of distributing its Shares as that
practice is described in Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, then
the selection and nomination of each of the Trustees who is not an
interested person (as that term is defined in the 1940 Act ) of
the Trust, any Adviser or the principal underwriter of the Trust
(such Trustees are referred to herein as disinterested Trustees),
shall be, and is, committed to the discretion of the disinterested
Trustees remaining in office.  In the event that all Trustee offices
become vacant, an authorized officer of the Investment Adviser shall
serve as the sole remaining Trustee effective upon the vacancy in the
office of the last Trustee.  In such case, an authorized officer
of the Investment Adviser, as the sole remaining Trustee, shall, as soon as
practicable, fill all of the vacancies on the Board; provided,
however, that the percentage of Trustees who are disinterested
Trustees shall be no less than that permitted by the 1940 Act.
Upon the qualification of such Trustees, the authorized officer
of the Investment Adviser shall resign as Trustee and a meeting
of the Shareholders shall be called, as required by the 1940 Act,
for the election of Trustees.  An appointment of a Trustee may be
made by the Trustees then in office in anticipation of a vacancy to
occur by reason of retirement, resignation, or removal of a
Trustee, or an increase in number of Trustees effective at a
later date, provided that said appointment shall become effective
only at the time or after the expected vacancy occurs.

regular meetings shall be held at the offices of the Trust.
Any meeting, regular or special, may be held, with respect to
one or more participating Trustees, by conference telephone or
similar communication equipment, so long as all Trustees
participating in the meeting can hear one another, and all such
Trustees shall be deemed to be present in person at such meeting.
At all meetings of the Trustees, every Trustee shall be entitled
to vote by proxy, provided that such proxy shall, before or
after such meeting, be delivered to the secretary or other
person responsible for recording the proceedings of such meeting.

any proxy through written, electronic, telephonic, computerized,
facsimile, telecommunications, telex or by any other form of communication.

given) shall be given personally, sent by first-class mail, courier,
cablegram or telegram, charges prepaid, or by facsimile or electronic
mail, addressed to each Trustee at that Trustee's address as has
been provided to the Trust for purposes of notice; PROVIDED,
that, in case of a national, regional or local emergency or
disaster, which prevents such notice, such notice may be given by any
means available or need not be given if no means are
available.  In case the notice is mailed, it shall be deemed to
be duly given if deposited in the United States mail at least seven
(7) days before the time the meeting is to be held.  In case the
notice is given personally or is given by courier, cablegram,
telegram, facsimile or electronic mail, it shall be deemed to
be duly given if delivered at least twenty-four (24) hours
before the time of the holding of the meeting.  The notice
need not specify the place of the meeting if the meeting
is to be held at the offices of the Trust.
Section 5.	WAIVER OF NOTICE.  Whenever notice is required to
be given to a Trustee under this Article, a written waiver of notice
signed by the Trustee, whether before or after the time notice is required
to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.  The waiver of notice
need not specify the purpose of, or the business to be transacted
at, the meeting.  All such waivers shall be filed with the records
of the Trust or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
Attendance of a Trustee at a meeting shall constitute a waiver
of notice of such meeting, except when the Trustee attends
the meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of

is not lawfully called or convened.
Section 6.	ADJOURNMENT.  A majority of the Trustees present at a

adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and place thereof are
announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  If the
adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days after the date of the
original meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to
each Trustee.
Section 8.	COMPENSATION OF TRUSTEES.  Trustees may receive
from the Trust reasonable compensation for their services and reimbursement
of reasonable expenses as may be determined by the Board.  This Section
8 shall not be construed to preclude any Trustee from serving the Trust
in any other capacity as an officer, agent, employee, or otherwise
and receiving compensation and reimbursement of expenses for those services.
Section 9.	CHAIRPERSON OF THE BOARD.  The Board of Trustees may elect
a Chairperson for the purpose of presiding at meetings of the Board of

The foregoing clauses shall each be construed as purposes, objects and

held to limit or restrict in any manner the powers of the Trust,

nor shall the enumeration of one thing be deemed to exclude another,
although it be of like nature, not expressed.

ARTICLE III SHARES
Section 1.	Division of Beneficial Interest.

(a)	The beneficial interest in the Trust shall be divided into Shares,
each Share without a par value.  The number of Shares in the Trust
authorized hereunder, and of each Series and Class as may be established
from time to time, is unlimited.  The Board of Trustees may authorize the
division of Shares into separate Classes of Shares and into separate and
distinct Series of Shares and the division of any Series into separate
Classes of Shares in accordance with the 1940 Act.  The different Series
and Classes shall be established and designated pursuant to Article III,
Section 6 hereof.  If no separate Series or Classes of Series shall be
established, the Shares shall have the rights, powers and duties
provided for herein and in Article III, Section 6 hereof to the
extent relevant and not otherwise provided for herein, and all
references to Series and Classes shall be construed (as the context
may require) to refer to the Trust.

(i)	The fact that the Trust shall have one or more established
and designated Classes of the Trust, shall not limit the authority of the
Board of Trustees to establish and designate additional Classes of the
Trust.  The fact that one or more Classes of the Trust shall have
initially been established and designated without any specific
establishment or designation of a Series (i.e., that all Shares
of the Trust are initially Shares of one or more Classes) shall
not limit the authority of the Board of Trustees to later establish
and designate a Series and establish and designate the Class or Classes
of the Trust as Class or Classes, respectively, of such Series.

(ii)	The fact that a Series shall have initially been established and
designated without any specific establishment or designation of Classes
(i.e., that all Shares of such Series are initially of a single Class)
shall not limit the authority of the Board of Trustees to establish and
designate separate Classes of said Series.  The fact that a Series shall
have more than one established and designated Class, shall not limit the
authority of the Board of Trustees to establish and designate additional
Classes of said Series.

(b)	The Board of Trustees shall have the power to issue authorized,
but unissued Shares of the Trust, or any Series and Class thereof, from
time to time for such consideration paid wholly or partly in cash,
securities or other property, as may be determined from time to time
by the Board of Trustees, subject to any requirements or limitations
of the
1940 Act.  The Board of Trustees, on behalf of the Trust, may acquire
and hold as treasury shares, reissue for such consideration and on such
terms as it may determine, or cancel, at its discretion from time to time,
any Shares reacquired by the Trust.  The Board of Trustees may classify,
reclassify or convert any unissued Shares or any Shares of the Trust or
any Series or Class thereof, that were previously issued and are
reacquired, into one or more Series or Classes that may be established
and designated from time to time and, in connection therewith, cause

some or all of the Shareholders of the Trust, such Series or Class to
become Shareholders of such other Series or Class.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Trust and any Series thereof may acquire, hold, sell and
otherwise deal in, for purposes of investment or otherwise, the Shares
of any other Series of the Trust or Shares of the Trust, and such Shares
shall not be deemed treasury shares or cancelled.

(c)	Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Article III, each
Share shall entitle the holder to voting rights as provided in Article V
hereof.  Shareholders shall have no preemptive or other right to subscribe
for new or additional authorized, but unissued Shares or other securities
issued by the Trust or any Series thereof.  The Board of Trustees may from
time to time divide or combine the Shares of the Trust or any particular
Series thereof into a greater or lesser number of Shares of the Trust or
that Series, respectively.  Such division or combination shall not
materially change the proportionate beneficial interests of the
holders of Shares of the Trust or that Series, as the case may be,
in the Trust Property at the time of such division or combination
that is held with respect to the Trust or that Series, as the case may be.

(d)	Any Trustee, officer or other agent of the Trust, and any organization
in which any such Person has an economic or other interest, may acquire, own,
hold and dispose of Shares in the Trust or any Series and Class thereof,
whether such Shares are authorized but unissued, or already outstanding,
to the same extent as if such Person were not a Trustee, officer or other
agent of the Trust: and the Trust or any Series may issue and sell and may
purchase such Shares from any such Person or any such organization, subject
to the limitations, restrictions or other provisions applicable to the sale
or purchase of such Shares herein and the 1940 Act.

Section 2.	Ownership of Shares.  The ownership of Shares shall be recorded
on the books of the Trust kept by the Trust or by a transfer or similar agent
for the Trust, which books shall be maintained separately for the Shares of
the Trust and each Series and each Class thereof that has been established
and designated.  No certificates certifying the ownership of Shares shall
be issued except as the Board of Trustees may otherwise determine from time
to time.  The
Board of Trustees may make such rules not inconsistent with the provisions
of the 1940 Act as it considers appropriate for the issuance of Share
certificates, the transfer of Shares of the Trust and each Series and
Class thereof, if any, and similar matters.  The record books of the
Trust as kept by the Trust or any transfer or similar agent, as the
case may be, shall be conclusive as to who
are the Shareholders of the Trust and each Series and Class thereof and
as to the number of Shares of the Trust and each Series and Class thereof
held from time to time by each such Shareholder.

Section 3.	Sale of Shares.  Subject to the 1940 Act and applicable law,
the Trust may sell its authorized but unissued Shares to such Persons, at
such times, on such terms, and for such consideration as the Board of
Trustees may from time to time authorize.  Each sale shall be credited
to the individual purchaser's account in the form of full or fractional
Shares of the Trust or such Series thereof (and Class thereof, if any),
as the purchaser may select, at the net asset value per Share, subject
to Section 22 of the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations adopted
thereunder: provided, however, that the Board of Trustees may, in its
sole discretion, permit the Principal Underwriter to impose a sales
charge upon any such sale.  Every Shareholder by virtue of having
become a Shareholder shall be bound by the terms of this Declaration of Trust.

Ownership of Shares shall not make any Shareholder a third-party beneficiary
of any contract entered into by the Trust or any Series.

Section 4.	Status of Shares and Limitation of Personal Liability.
Shares shall be deemed to be personal property giving to Shareholders only
the rights provided in this Declaration of Trust, the By-Laws, and under
applicable law.  Ownership of Shares shall not entitle the Shareholder to
any title in or to the whole or any part of the Trust Property or right to
call for a partition or division of the same or for an accounting, nor shall
the ownership of Shares constitute the Shareholders as partners.  Subject to
Article VIII, Section 1 hereof, the death, incapacity, dissolution,
termination, or bankruptcy of a Shareholder during the existence of
the Trust and any Series thereof shall not operate to dissolve the
Trust or any such Series, nor entitle the representative of any
deceased, incapacitated, dissolved, terminated or bankrupt Shareholder
to an accounting or to take any action in court or elsewhere against the
Trust, the Trustees or any such Series, but entitles such representative
only to the rights of said deceased, incapacitated, dissolved, terminated
or bankrupt Shareholder under this Declaration of Trust.  Neither the Trust
nor the Trustees, nor any officer, employee or agent of the Trust, shall
have any power to bind personally any Shareholder, nor, except as specifically
provided herein, to call upon any Shareholder for the payment of any sum of
money other than such as the Shareholder may at any time personally agree
to pay.  Each Share, when issued on the terms determined by the Board of
Trustees, shall be fully paid and nonassessable.  As provided in the DSTA,
Shareholders shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability
as that extended to stockholders of a private corporation organized for
profit under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

Section 5.	Power of Board of Trustees to Make Tax Status Election.
The Board of Trustees shall have the power, in its discretion, to make
such elections as to the tax status of the Trust and any Series as may
be permitted or required under the Code, without the vote of any Shareholder.

Section 6.	Establishment and Designation of Series and Classes.  The
establishment and designation of any Series or Class shall be effective,
without the requirement of Shareholder approval, upon the adoption of a
resolution by not less than a majority of the then Board of Trustees,
which resolution shall set forth such establishment and designation
whether directly in such resolutions or by reference to, or approval
of, another document that sets forth the designation or otherwise
identifies such Series or Class, including any registration statement
of the Trust and any amendment of this Declaration of Trust, and may
provide, to the extent permitted by the DSTA, for rights, powers and
duties of such Series or Class (including variations in the relative
rights and preferences as between the different Series and Classes)
otherwise than as provided herein.  Any action that may be taken by
the Board of Trustees with respect to any Series or Class, including
any addition, modification, division, combination, classification,
reclassification, change of name or termination, may be made in the
same manner as the establishment of such Series or Class.

Each Series shall be separate and distinct from any other Series,
separate and distinct records on the books of the Trust shall be
maintained for each Series, and the assets and
liabilities belonging to any such Series shall be held and accounted
for separately from the assets and liabilities of the Trust or any other
Series.  Each Class of the Trust shall be separate and distinct from any
other Class of the Trust.  Each Class of a Series shall be separate and
distinct

from any other Class of the Series.  As appropriate, in a manner determined
by the Board of Trustees, the liabilities belonging to any such Class shall
be held and accounted for separately from the liabilities of the Trust, the
Series or any other Class and separate and distinct records on the books of
the Trust for the Class shall be maintained for this purpose.  Subject to
Article II hereof, each such Series shall operate as a separate and
distinct investment medium, with separately defined investment
objectives and policies.

Shares of each Series (and Class where applicable) established and designated
pursuant to this Section 6, unless otherwise provided to the extent permitted
by the DSTA, in the resolution establishing and designating such Series or
Class, shall have the following rights, powers and duties:

(a)	Assets Held with Respect to a Particular Series.  All consideration
received by the Trust for the issue or sale of Shares of a particular Series,
together with all assets in which such consideration is invested or
reinvested, all income, earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof from
whatever source derived, including, without limitation, any proceeds
derived from the sale, exchange or liquidation of such assets, and
any funds or payments derived from any reinvestment of such proceeds
in whatever form the same may be, shall irrevocably be held with
respect to that Series for all purposes, subject only to the
rights of creditors with respect to that Series, and shall be
so recorded upon the books of account of the Trust.  Such
consideration, assets, income, earnings, profits and proceeds
thereof, from whatever source derived, including, without limitation,
any proceeds derived from the sale, exchange or liquidation of such assets,
and any funds or payments derived from any reinvestment of such proceeds, in
whatever form the same may be, are herein referred to as assets held with"
"1564","respect to that Series.  In the event that there are any assets, income,
earnings, profits and proceeds thereof, funds or payments
which are not readily identifiable as assets held with respect to
any particular Series (collectively General Assets), the Board of
Trustees, or an appropriate officer as determined by the Board of Trustees,
shall allocate such General Assets to, between or among any one or more of the
Series in such manner and on such basis as the Board of Trustees, in its sole
discretion, deems fair and equitable, and any General Asset so allocated to a
particular Series shall be held with respect to that Series.  Each such
allocation by or under the direction of the Board of Trustees shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders of all Series for all purposes.

(b)	Liabilities Held with Respect to a Particular Series or Class.
The assets of the Trust held with respect to a particular Series shall be
charged with the liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges, reserves
and expenses of the Trust incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing
with respect to such Series.  Such liabilities, debts, obligations, costs,
charges, reserves and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing
with respect to a particular Series are herein referred to as liabilities"
"1565","held with respect to that Series.  Any liabilities, debts, obligations,
costs, charges, reserves and expenses of the Trust which are not readily
identifiable as being liabilities held with respect to any particular
Series (collectively General Liabilities) shall be allocated by the
Board of Trustees, or an appropriate officer as determined by the
Board of Trustees, to and among any one or more of the Series in
such manner and on such basis as the Board of Trustees in its sole
discretion deems fair and equitable.  Each allocation of liabilities,
debts, obligations, costs, charges, reserves and expenses by or under
the direction of the Board of
Trustees shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders
of all Series for all purposes.  All
Persons who have extended credit that has been allocated
to a particular Series, or who have a

claim or contract that has been allocated to any particular
Series, shall look exclusively to the assets of that
particular Series for payment of such credit, claim, or
contract.  In the absence of
an express contractual agreement so limiting the claims of such
creditors, claimants and contract providers, each creditor,
claimant and contract provider shall be deemed nevertheless
to have impliedly agreed to such limitation.

Subject to the right of the Board of Trustees in its discretion to
allocate General
Liabilities as provided herein, the debts, liabilities, obligations
and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with
respect to a particular Series, whether such Series is now authorized
and existing pursuant to this Declaration of Trust or is hereafter
authorized and existing pursuant to this Declaration of Trust,
shall be enforceable against the assets held with respect to
that Series only, and not against the assets of any other
Series or the Trust generally and none of the debts, liabilities,
obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise
existing with respect to the Trust generally or any other
Series thereof shall be enforceable
against the assets held with respect to such Series.  Notice of this
limitation on liabilities between and among Series shall be set forth
in the Certificate of Trust pursuant to the DSTA, and upon
the giving of such notice in the Certificate of Trust, the
statutory provisions of Section 3804 of the DSTA relating to
limitations on liabilities between and among Series (and the
statutory effect under Section 3804 of setting forth such
notice in the Certificate of Trust) shall become applicable
to the Trust and each Series.

Liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges, reserves and
expenses related to the distribution of, and other identified
expenses that should or may properly be allocated to, the Shares
of a particular Class may be charged to and borne solely by such
Class.  The bearing of expenses solely by a particular Class of
Shares may be appropriately reflected (in a manner determined by
the Board of Trustees) and may affect the net asset value attributable
to, and the dividend, redemption and liquidation rights of, such Class.
Each allocation of liabilities, debts, obligations, costs, charges,
reserves and expenses by or under the direction of the Board of Trustees
shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders of all Classes for
all purposes. All Persons who have extended credit that has been allocated
to a particular Class, or who have a claim or contract that has been
allocated to any particular Class, shall look, and may be required by
contract to look, exclusively to that particular Class for payment of
such credit, claim, or contract.

(c)	Dividends, Distributions and Redemptions.  Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Declaration of Trust, including, without
limitation, Article VI hereof, no dividend or distribution including,
without limitation, any distribution paid upon dissolution of the Trust
or of any Series with respect to, nor any redemption of, the Shares of
any Series or Class of such Series shall be effected by the Trust other
than from the assets held with respect to such Series, nor, except as
specifically provided in Section 7 of this Article III, shall any
Shareholder of any particular Series otherwise have any right or
claim against the assets held with respect to any other Series or
the Trust generally except, in the case of a right or claim against
the assets held with respect to any other Series, to the extent that
such Shareholder has such a right or claim hereunder as a Shareholder
of such other Series.  The Board of Trustees shall have full discretion,
to the extent not inconsistent with the 1940 Act, to determine which items
shall be treated as income and which items as capital: and each such
determination and allocation shall be conclusive and binding upon
the Shareholders.

(d)	Voting.  All Shares of the Trust entitled to vote on a matter
shall vote in the aggregate without differentiation between the Shares
of the separate Series, if any, or
separate Classes, if any: provided that (i) with respect to any
matter that affects only the interests of some but not all Series,
then only the Shares of such affected Series, voting separately, shall
be entitled to vote on the matter, (ii) with respect to any matter that
affects only the interests of some but not all Classes, then only the
Shares of such affected Classes, voting separately, shall be entitled
to vote on the matter: and (iii) notwithstanding the foregoing, with
respect to any matter as to which the 1940 Act or other applicable
law or regulation requires voting, by Series or by Class, then the
Shares of the Trust shall vote as prescribed in such law or regulation.

(e)	Equality.  Each Share of any particular Series shall be equal
to each other Share of such Series (subject to the rights and preferences
with respect to separate Classes of such Series).

(f)	Fractions.  A fractional Share of the Trust or a Series shall carry
proportionately all the rights and obligations of a whole Share of the Trust
or such Series, including rights with respect to voting, receipt of
dividends and distributions, redemption of Shares and dissolution
of the Trust or that Series.

(g)	Exchange Privilege.  The Board of Trustees shall have the
authority to provide that the holders of Shares of any Series shall
have the right to exchange said Shares for Shares of one or more
other Series in accordance with such requirements and procedures
as may be established by the Board of Trustees, and in accordance
with the 1940 Act.

(h)	Combination of Series or Classes.

(i)	The Board of Trustees shall have the authority, without the
approval, vote or consent of the Shareholders of any Series, unless
otherwise required by applicable law, to combine the assets and
liabilities held with respect to any two or more Series into assets
and liabilities held with respect to a single Series: provided that
upon completion of such combination of Series, the interest of
each Shareholder, in the combined assets and liabilities held
with respect to the combined Series shall equal the interest of
each such Shareholder in the aggregate of the assets and liabilities
held with respect to the Series that were combined.

(ii)	The Board of Trustees shall have the authority, without
the approval, vote or consent of the Shareholders of any Series
or Class, unless otherwise required by applicable law, to combine,
merge or otherwise consolidate the Shares of two or more Classes of
Shares of a Series with and/or into a single Class of Shares of such
Series, with such designation, preference, conversion or other rights,
voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications,
terms and conditions of redemption and other characteristics as the
Trustees may determine: provided, however,

that the Trustees shall provide written notice to the affected
Shareholders of any such transaction.

(iii)	The transactions in (i) and (ii) above may be effected through
share-for-share exchanges, transfers or sales of assets, Shareholder
in-kind redemptions and purchases, exchange offers, or any other
method approved by the Trustees.

(i)	Dissolution or Termination.  Any particular Series shall be
dissolved and terminated upon the occurrence of the applicable
dissolution events set forth in Article VIII, Section 1 hereof.
Upon dissolution of a particular Series, the Trustees shall wind
up the affairs of such Series in accordance with Article VIII,
Section 1 hereof.  The Board of Trustees shall terminate any
particular Class: (i) upon approval by a majority of votes
cast at a meeting of the Shareholders of such Class, provided a
quorum of Shareholders of such Class are present, or by
action of the Shareholders of such Class by written consent
without a meeting pursuant to Article V, Section 3: or (ii)
at the discretion of the Board of Trustees either (A) at any
time there are no Shares outstanding of such Class, or (B)
upon prior written notice to the Shareholders of such Class:
provided, however, that upon the termination of any particular
Series, every Class of such Series shall thereby be terminated.

Section 7.	Indemnification of Shareholders.  No Shareholder as such
shall be subject to any personal liability whatsoever to any Person in
connection with Trust Property or the acts, obligations or affairs of
the Trust.  If any Shareholder or former Shareholder shall be exposed
to liability, charged with liability, or held personally liable, for
any obligations or liability of the Trust, by reason of a claim or
demand relating exclusively to his or her being or having been a
Shareholder of the Trust or a Shareholder of a particular Series
thereof, and not because of such Shareholder's actions or
omissions, such Shareholder or former Shareholder (or, in
the case of a natural person, his or her heirs, executors,
administrators, or other legal representatives or, in the
case of a corporation or other entity, its corporate or other
general successor) shall be entitled to be held harmless from
and indemnified out of the assets of the Trust or out of the
assets of such Series thereof, as the case may be, against
all loss and expense, including without limitation, attorneys'
fees, arising from such claim or demand: provided, however, such
indemnity shall not cover (i) any taxes due or paid by reason of
such Shareholder's ownership of any Shares and (ii) expenses charged
to a Shareholder pursuant to Article IV, Section 5 hereof.

ARTICLE IV

THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES

Section 1.	Number, Election, Term, Removal and Resignation.

(a)	The Board of Trustees shall be comprised of the Trustees
entering into this Declaration of Trust on the date first written
above, who shall hold office in accordance with paragraph (c) of
this Section 1 and as otherwise provided herein.  In accordance with Section
3801 of the DSTA, each Trustee shall become a Trustee and be bound by this
Declaration of Trust and the By-Laws when such Person signs this
Declaration of Trust as a trustee and/or is duly elected or
appointed, qualified and serving on the Board of Trustees in
accordance with the

provisions hereof and the By-Laws, so long as such signatory or
other Person continues in office in accordance with the terms hereof.

(b)	The number of Trustees constituting the entire Board of
Trustees may be fixed from time to time by the vote of a majority
of the then Board of Trustees: provided, however, that the number
of Trustees shall in no event be less than one (1) nor more than
fifteen (15).  The number of Trustees shall not be reduced so as
to shorten the term of any Trustee then in office.

(c)	Each Trustee shall hold office for the lifetime of the Trust
or until such Trustee's earlier death, resignation, removal, retirement
or inability otherwise to serve, or, if sooner than any of such events,
until the next meeting of Shareholders called for the purpose of electing
Trustees or consent of Shareholders in lieu thereof for the election of
Trustees, and until the election and qualification of his or her successor.
Shareholders shall not be entitled to elect Trustees except as required by
the 1940 Act.  To the extent required by the 1940 Act, the Shareholders
shall elect the Trustees on such dates as the Trustees may fix from time
to time. The Shareholders may elect Trustees at any meeting of Shareholders
called for that purpose pursuant to the By-Laws.  In the event that after
the proxy material approved by the Trustees has been printed for a meeting
of Shareholders at which Trustees are to be elected any one or more nominees
approved by the Trustees named in such proxy material dies or become
incapacitated or is otherwise unable or unwilling to serve, the authorized
number of Trustees shall be
automatically reduced by the number of such nominees, unless the
Board of Trustees prior to the meeting shall otherwise determine.
A meeting of Shareholders for the purpose of electing or removing
one or more Trustees shall be called as provided in the By-Laws.

(d)	Any Trustee may be removed, with or without cause, by the Board
of Trustees, by action of a majority of the Trustees then in office,
or by vote of the Shareholders at any meeting called for that purpose.

(e)       Any Trustee may resign at any time by giving written notice
to the secretary of the Trust or to a meeting of the Board of
Trustees.  Such resignation shall be effective upon receipt,
unless specified to be effective at some later time.

(f)	The declination to serve, death, resignation, retirement,
removal, incapacity, or inability of the Trustees, or any one of
them, shall not operate to dissolve or terminate the Trust or to
revoke any existing agency created pursuant to the terms of this
Declaration of Trust.

Section 2.	Trustee Action by Written Consent Without a Meeting.
To the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of the 1940 Act,
any action that may be taken at any meeting of the Board of Trustees
or any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting and without
prior written notice if a consent or consents in writing setting
forth the action so taken is signed by the Trustees having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize
or take that action at a meeting at which all Trustees on the Board of
Trustees or any committee thereof, as the case may be, were present and
voted.  Written consents of the Trustees may be executed in one or more
counterparts.  A consent transmitted by electronic transmission (as
defined in Section 3806 of the DSTA) by a Trustee shall be deemed to
be written and signed

for purposes of this Section.  All such consents shall be filed with
the secretary of the Trust and shall be maintained in the Trust's records.

Section 3.	Powers: Other Business Interests: Quorum and Required Vote.

(a)	Powers.  Subject to the provisions of this Declaration of Trust,
the business of the Trust (including every Series thereof) shall be managed
by or under the direction of the Board of Trustees, and such Board of
Trustees shall have all powers necessary or convenient to carry out
that responsibility.  The Board of Trustees shall have full power and
authority to do any and all acts and to make and execute any and all
contracts and instruments that it may consider necessary or appropriate
in connection with the operation and administration of the Trust
(including every Series thereof).  The Board of Trustees shall not be bound
or
limited by present or future laws or customs with regard to investments by
trustees or fiduciaries, but, subject to the other provisions of this
Declaration of Trust and the By-Laws, shall have full authority and
absolute power and control over the assets and the business of the
Trust (including every Series thereof) to the same extent as if the
Board of Trustees was the sole owner of such assets and business in
its own right, including such authority, power and control to do all acts
and things as it, in its sole discretion, shall deem proper to accomplish
the purposes of this Trust. Without limiting the foregoing, the Board of
Trustees may, subject to the requisite vote for such actions as set forth
in this Declaration of Trust and the By-Laws: (1) adopt By-Laws not
inconsistent with applicable law or this Declaration of Trust: (2)
amend, restate and repeal such By-Laws, subject to and in accordance
with the provisions of such By-Laws: (3) fill vacancies on the Board
of Trustees in accordance with this Declaration of Trust and the
By-Laws: (4) elect
and remove such officers and appoint and terminate such agents as
it considers appropriate, in accordance with this Declaration of
Trust and the By-Laws: (5) establish and terminate one or more
committees of the Board of Trustees pursuant to the By-Laws: (6)
place Trust Property in custody as required by the 1940 Act,
employ one or more custodians of the Trust Property and authorize
such custodians to employ sub-custodians and to place all or any
part of such Trust Property with a custodian or a custodial
system meeting the requirements of the 1940 Act: (7) retain a
transfer agent, dividend disbursing agent, a shareholder servicing
agent or administrative services agent, or any number thereof or
any other service provider as deemed appropriate: (8) provide for
the issuance and distribution of Shares in the Trust or other
securities or financial instruments directly or through one or
more Principal Underwriters or otherwise: (9) retain one
or more Investment Adviser(s): (10) re-acquire and redeem Shares on
behalf of the Trust and transfer Shares pursuant to applicable law:
(11) set record dates for the determination of Shareholders with respect
to various matters, in the manner provided in Article V, Section 4 of
this Declaration of Trust: (12) declare and pay dividends and distributions
to Shareholders from the Trust Property, in accordance with this
Declaration of Trust and the By-Laws: (13) establish, designate
and redesignate from time to time, in accordance with the
provisions of Article III, Section 6 hereof, any Series or
Class of the Trust or of a Series: (14) hire personnel as
staff for the Board of Trustees or, for those Trustees who are not
Interested Persons of the Trust, the Investment Adviser, or the Principal
Underwriter, set the compensation to be paid by the Trust to such
personnel, exercise exclusive supervision of such personnel, and
remove one or more of such personnel, at the discretion of the Board
of Trustees: (15) retain special counsel, other experts and/or
consultants for the Board of Trustees, for those Trustees who
are not Interested Persons of the Trust, the Investment Adviser,
or the Principal Underwriter, and/or for one or
more of the committees of the Board of Trustees, set the
compensation to be paid by the Trust to

such special counsel, other experts and/or consultants, and remove one or
more of such special counsel, other experts and/or consultants, at the
discretion of the Board of Trustees: (16) engage in and prosecute,
defend, compromise, abandon, or adjust, by arbitration, or otherwise,
any actions, suits, proceedings, disputes, claims, and demands relating
to the Trust, and out of the assets of the Trust to pay or to satisfy
any debts, claims or expenses incurred in connection therewith,
including those of litigation, and such power shall include, without
limitation, the power of the Trustees, or any appropriate committee
thereof, in the exercise of their or its good faith business judgment,
to dismiss any action, suit, proceeding, dispute, claim or demand,
derivative or otherwise, brought by any person, including a shareholder
in its own name or in the name of the Trust, whether or not the Trust or
any of the Trustees may be named individually therein or the subject
matter arises by reason of business for or on behalf of the Trust: and (17)
in general delegate such authority as it considers desirable to any Trustee
or officer of the Trust, to any committee of the Trust, to any agent or
employee of the Trust or to any custodian, transfer, dividend disbursing,
shareholder servicing agent, Principal Underwriter, Investment Adviser,
or other service provider.

The powers of the Board of Trustees set forth in this Section 3(a) are
without prejudice to any other powers of the Board of Trustees set forth
in this Declaration of Trust and the By-Laws. Any determination as to
what is in the best interests of the Trust or any Series or Class
thereof and its Shareholders made by the Board of Trustees in
good faith shall be conclusive.  In construing the provisions
of this Declaration of Trust, the presumption shall be in favor of a
grant of power to the Board of Trustees.

The Trustees shall be subject to the same fiduciary duties to which the
directors of a Delaware corporation would be subject if the Trust were
a Delaware corporation, the Shareholders were shareholders of such
Delaware corporation and the Trustees were directors of such Delaware
corporation, and such modified duties shall replace any fiduciary
duties to which the Trustees would otherwise be subject.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, all actions and omissions
of the Trustees shall be evaluated under the doctrine commonly
referred to as the business judgment rule, as defined and
developed under Delaware law, to the same
extent that the same actions or omissions of directors of a
Delaware corporation in a substantially similar circumstance
would be evaluated under such doctrine.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the provisions of this Declaration of Trust and the By-Laws, to the
extent that they restrict or eliminate the duties (including fiduciary
duties) and liabilities relating thereto of a Trustee otherwise applicable
under the foregoing standard or otherwise existing at law or in equity, are
agreed by each Shareholder and the Trust to replace such other duties and
liabilities of such Trustee.

(b)	Other Business Interests.  The Trustees shall devote to the
affairs of the Trust (including every Series thereof) such time as may
be necessary for the proper performance of their duties hereunder, but
neither the Trustees nor the officers, directors, shareholders, partners
or employees of the Trustees, if any, shall be expected to devote their
full time to the performance of such duties.  The Trustees, or any Affiliate,
shareholder, officer, director, partner or employee thereof, or any Person
owning a legal or beneficial interest therein, may engage in, or possess an
interest in, any business or venture other than the Trust or any Series
thereof, of
any nature and description, independently or with or for the account
of others.  None of the

Trust, any Series thereof or any Shareholder shall have the right to
participate or share in such other business or venture or any profit
or compensation derived therefrom.

(c)	Quorum and Required Vote.  At all meetings of the Board of Trustees,
a majority of the Board of Trustees then in office shall be present in person
in order to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  A meeting
at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business
notwithstanding the departure of Trustees from the meeting, if any action
taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that
meeting.  Subject to Article III, Sections 1 and 6 of the By-Laws and
except as otherwise provided herein or required by applicable law, the
vote of not less than a majority of the Trustees present at a meeting
at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Trustees.

Section 4.	Payment of Expenses by the Trust.  Subject to the provisions of
Article III, Section 6 hereof, the Trustees or an authorized officer of the
Trust shall pay or cause to be paid out of the principal or income of the
Trust or any particular Series or Class thereof, or partly out of the
principal and partly out of the income of the Trust or any particular
Series or Class thereof, and charge or allocate the same to, between
or among such one or more of the Series or Classes that may be
established or designated pursuant to Article III, Section 6
hereof, as the Trustees or such officer deems fair, all
expenses, fees, charges, taxes and liabilities incurred by or arising in
connection with the maintenance or operation of the Trust or a particular
Series or Class thereof, or in connection with the management thereof,
including, but not limited to, the Trustees' compensation and such
expenses, fees, charges, taxes and liabilities associated with the
services of the Trust's officers, employees, Investment Adviser(s),
Principal Underwriter, auditors, counsel, custodian, sub-custodian,
transfer agent, dividend disbursing agent, shareholder
servicing agent, and such other agents or independent contractors
and such other expenses, fees, charges, taxes and liabilities as
the Board of Trustees may deem necessary or proper to incur.

Section 5.	Payment of Expenses by Shareholders.  The Board of Trustees
shall have the power, as frequently as it may determine, to cause any
Shareholder to pay directly, in advance or arrears, an amount fixed
from time to time by the Board of Trustees or an officer of the Trust
for charges of the Trust's custodian or transfer, dividend disbursing,
shareholder servicing or similar agent-which are not customarily charged
generally to the Trust, a Series or a Class, where such services are
provided to such Shareholder individually, rather than to all Shareholders
collectively, by setting off such amount due from such Shareholder from
the amount of (i) declared but unpaid dividends or distributions owed
such Shareholder, or (ii) proceeds from the redemption by the Trust
of Shares from such Shareholder pursuant to Article VI hereof.

Section 6.	Ownership of Trust Property.  Legal title to all of
the Trust Property shall
at all times be vested in the Trust, except that the Board of Trustees
shall have the power to cause legal title to any Trust Property to be
held by or in the name of any Person as nominee, on such terms as the
Board of Trustees may determine, in accordance with applicable law.
No creditor of any Trustee shall have any right to obtain possession,
or otherwise exercise legal or equitable remedies with respect to, any
Trust Property with respect to any claim against, or obligation of,
such Trustee in its individual capacity and not related to the Trust
or any Series or Class of the Trust.  No Shareholder shall be deemed
to have a severable ownership in any individual asset of the Trust,
or belonging to any Series, or allocable to any Class thereof, or
any right of partition or

possession thereof, but each Shareholder shall have, except as otherwise
provided for herein, a proportionate undivided beneficial interest in
the Trust or in assets belonging to the Series (or allocable to the
Class) in which the Shareholder holds Shares.  The Shares shall be
personal property giving only the rights specifically set forth in
this Declaration of Trust or the DSTA.

Section 7.	Service Contracts.

(a)	Subject to this Declaration of Trust, the By-Laws and the 1940 Act,
the Board of Trustees may, at any time and from time to time, contract for
exclusive or nonexclusive investment advisory or investment management
services for the Trust or for any Series thereof with any corporation,
trust, association or other organization, including any Affiliate: and
any such contract may contain such other terms as the Board of Trustees
may determine, including without limitation, delegation of authority to
the Investment Adviser to determine from time to time without prior
consultation with the Board of Trustees what securities and other
instruments or property shall be purchased or otherwise acquired,
owned, held, invested or reinvested in,
sold, exchanged, transferred, mortgaged, pledged, assigned, negotiated, or
otherwise dealt with or disposed of, and what portion, if any, of the
Trust Property shall be held uninvested and to make changes in the
Trust's or a particular Series' investments, or to engage in such
other activities, including administrative services, as may specifically be
delegated to such party.

(b)	The Board of Trustees may also, at any time and from time to time,
contract with any Person, including any Affiliate, appointing it or them
as the exclusive or nonexclusive placement agent, distributor or Principal
Underwriter for the Shares of the Trust or one or more of the Series or
Classes thereof, or for other securities or financial instruments to be
issued by the Trust, or appointing it or them to act as the administrator,
fund accountant or accounting agent, custodian, transfer agent, dividend
disbursing agent and/or shareholder servicing agent for the Trust or one
or more of the Series or Classes thereof.

(c)	The Board of Trustees is further empowered, at any time and from
time to time, to contract with any Persons, including any Affiliates, to
provide such other services to the Trust or one or more of its Series,
as the Board of Trustees determines to be in the best interests of the
Trust, such Series and its Shareholders.

(d)	None of the following facts or circumstances shall affect the
validity of any of the contracts provided for in this Article IV, Section 7,
or disqualify any Shareholder, Trustee, employee or officer of the Trust
from voting upon or executing the same, or create any liability or
accountability to the Trust, any Series thereof or the Shareholders,
provided that the establishment of and performance of each such
contract is permissible under the 1940 Act, and provided further
that such Person is authorized to vote upon such contract under
the 1940 Act:

(i)	the fact that any of the Shareholders, Trustees, employees or officers
of the Trust is a shareholder, director, officer, partner, trustee, employee,
manager, Adviser, placement agent, Principal Underwriter, distributor, or
Affiliate or agent of or for any Person, or for any parent or Affiliate of
any Person, with which any type of service contract provided for in this
Article IV, Section 7 may have been or may hereafter be made, or that
any such Person, or any

parent or Affiliate thereof, is a Shareholder or has an interest in the
Trust, or

(ii)	the fact that any Person with which any type of service contract
provided for in this Article IV, Section 7 may have been or may hereafter
be made also has such a service contract with one or more other Persons,
or has other business or interests.

(e)	Every contract referred to in this Section 7 is required to comply
with this Declaration of Trust, the By-Laws, the 1940 Act, other applicable
law and any stipulation by resolution of the Board of Trustees.

ARTICLE V

SHAREHOLDERS' VOTING POWERS AND MEETINGS

Section 1.	Voting Powers.  Subject to the provisions of Article III,
Section 6 hereof, the Shareholders shall
have the power to vote only (i) on such matters
required by this Declaration of Trust, the By-Laws, the 1940 Act, other
applicable law and any registration statement of the Trust filed with
the Commission, the registration of which is effective: and (ii) on such
other matters as the Board of Trustees may consider necessary or
desirable.  Subject to Article III hereof, the Shareholder of
record (as of the record date established pursuant to Section
4 of this Article V) of each Share shall be entitled to one
vote for each full Share, and a fractional vote for each fractional
Share.  Shareholders shall not be entitled to cumulative voting in
the election of Trustees or on any other matter.

Section 2.	Quorum and Required Vote.

(a)	Forty percent (40%) of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote
at a Shareholders' meeting, which are present in person or represented
by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at the Shareholders' meeting,
except when a larger quorum is required by this Declaration of Trust,
the By-Laws, applicable law or the requirements of any securities
exchange on which Shares are listed for trading, in which case such
quorum shall comply with such requirements.  When a separate vote by
one or more Series or Classes is required, forty percent (40%) of the
outstanding Shares of each such Series or Class entitled to vote at a
Shareholders' meeting of such Series or Class, which are present in
person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at the
Shareholders' meeting of such Series or Class, except when a larger
quorum is required by this Declaration of Trust, the By-Laws, applicable
law or the requirements of any securities exchange on which Shares of
such Series or Class are listed for trading, in
which case such quorum shall comply with such requirements.

(b)	Subject to the provisions of Article III, Section 6(d), when
a quorum is present at any meeting, a majority of the votes cast
shall decide any questions and a plurality
shall elect a Trustee, except when a larger vote is required by any
provision of this Declaration of Trust or the By-Laws or by applicable
law.  Pursuant to Article III, Section 6(d) hereof, where a separate
vote by Series and, if applicable, by Class is required, the preceding
sentence shall apply to such separate votes by Series and Classes.

(c)	Abstentions and broker non-votes will be treated as votes
present at a Shareholders' meeting: abstentions and broker non-votes
will not be treated as votes cast at such meeting.  Abstentions and
broker non-votes, therefore (i) will be included for purposes of
-determining whether a quorum is present: and (ii) will have no effect
on proposals that require a plurality for approval, or on proposals
requiring an affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast for approval.

Section 3.	Shareholder Action by Written Consent Without a Meeting.
Any action which may be taken at any meeting of Shareholders may be taken
without a meeting if a consent or consents in writing setting forth the
action so taken is or are signed by the holders of a majority of the Shares
entitled to vote on such action (or such different proportion thereof as
shall be required by law, the Declaration of Trust or the By-Laws for
approval of such action) and is or are received by the secretary of the
Trust either: (i) by the date set by resolution of the
Board of Trustees for the shareholder vote on such action: or
(ii) if no date is set by resolution of the Board, within 30
days after the record date for such action as determined by
reference to Article V, Section 4(b) hereof.  The written consent
for any such action may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which when
taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.  A
consent transmitted by electronic transmission (as defined in the
DSTA) by a Shareholder or by a Person or Persons authorized to act
for a Shareholder shall be deemed to be written and signed for
purposes of this Section.  All such consents shall be filed with
the secretary of the Trust and shall be maintained in the Trust's
records.  Any Shareholder that has given a written consent or the
Shareholder's proxyholder or a personal representative of the
Shareholder or its respective proxyholder may revoke the consent
by a writing received by the secretary of the Trust either: (i)
before the date set by resolution of the Board of Trustees for
the shareholder vote on such action: or (ii) if no date is set by
resolution of the Board, within 30 days after the record date for
such action as determined by reference to Article V, Section 4(b) hereof.

Section 4.	Record Dates.

(a)	For purposes of determining the Shareholders entitled to notice
of, and to vote at, any meeting of Shareholders, the Board of Trustees
may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Trustees, and which record date shall not be more than one hundred and
twenty (120) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any
such meeting.  A determination of Shareholders of record entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of Shareholders shall apply to any
adjournment of the meeting: provided, however, that the Board of Trustees
may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting and shall fix a new
record date for any meeting that is adjourned for more than one hundred
and eighty (180) days from the record date set for the original meeting.
For purposes of determining the Shareholders entitled to vote on any action
without a meeting, the Board of Trustees may fix a record date, which record
date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record
date is adopted by the Board of Trustees, and which record date shall not be
more than thirty (30) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing
the record date is adopted by the Board of Trustees.

(b)	If the Board of Trustees does not so fix a record date:

(i)	the record date for determining Shareholders entitled to notice
of, and to vote at, a meeting of Shareholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given or,
if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding
the day on which the meeting is held.

(ii)	the record date for determining Shareholders entitled to vote on
any action by consent in writing without a meeting of Shareholders, (1)
when no prior action by the Board of Trustees has been taken, shall be
the day on which the first signed written consent setting forth the
action taken is delivered to the Trust, or
(2) when prior action of the Board of Trustees has been taken, shall
be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Trustees
adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

(c)	For the purpose of determining the Shareholders of the Trust or
any Series or Class thereof who are entitled to receive payment of any
dividend or of any other distribution of assets of the Trust or any
Series or Class thereof (other than in connection with a dissolution
of the Trust or a Series, a merger, consolidation, conversion,
reorganization, or any other transactions, in each case that is
governed by Article VIII of the Declaration of Trust), the Board of
Trustees may:

(i)	from time to time fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date
is adopted, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) days
before the date for the payment of such dividend and/or such other
distribution:

(ii)       adopt standing resolutions fixing record dates and related
payment dates at periodic intervals of any duration for the payment of
such dividend and/or such other distribution: and/or

(iii)	delegate to an appropriate officer or officers of the Trust the
determination of such periodic record and/or payments dates with respect
to such dividend and/or such other distribution.

Nothing in this Section shall be construed as precluding the Board of
Trustees from setting different record dates for different Series or Classes.

Section 5.	Additional Provisions.  The By-Laws may include further
provisions for
Shareholders' votes, meetings and related matters.

ARTICLE VI

NET ASSET VALUE: DISTRIBUTIONS: REDEMPTIONS: TRANSFERS

Section 1.	Determination of Net Asset Value, Net Income and Distributions.

(a)	Subject to Article III, Section 6 hereof, the Board of Trustees shall
have the power to determine from time to time the offering price for
authorized, but unissued, Shares of the Trust or any Series or Class
thereof, respectively, that shall yield to the Trust or such Series
or Class not less than the net asset value thereof, in addition to any
amount of applicable sales charge to be paid to the Principal
Underwriter or the selling broker or dealer in connection with the
sale of such Shares, at which price the Shares of the Trust or such
Series or Class, respectively, shall be offered for sale, subject
to any other requirements or limitations of the
1940 Act.

(b)	Subject to Article III, Section 6 hereof, the Board of Trustees
may, subject to the 1940 Act, prescribe (or delegate to any officer of
the Trust or any other Person the right to prescribe) such bases and
time (including any methodology or plan) for determining the net asset
value per Share of the Trust or any Series or Class thereof, or net
income attributable to the Shares of the Trust or any Series or Class
thereof or the declaration and payment of dividends
and distributions on the Shares of the Trust or any Series or
Class thereof, and the method of determining the Shareholders
to whom dividends and distributions are payable, as it may deem
necessary or desirable, and such dividends and distributions may
vary between the Classes to reflect differing allocations of the
expenses of the Trust between such Classes to such extent and for
such purposes as the Trustees may deem appropriate.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to
applicable federal law, including the 1940 Act, any dividend or
distribution may be paid in cash and/or securities or other property,
and the composition of any such distribution shall be determined by the
Trustees (or by any officer of the Trust or any other Person to whom
such authority has been delegated by the Trustees) and may be different
among Shareholders including differences among Shareholders of the same
Series or Class.

(c)	The Shareholders of the Trust or any Series or Class, if any,
shall be entitled to receive dividends and distributions, when, if and
as declared by the Board of Trustees with respect thereto, provided that
with respect to Classes, such dividends and distributions shall comply
with the 1940 Act.  The right of Shareholders to receive dividends or
other distributions on Shares of any Class may be set forth in a plan
adopted by the Board of Trustees and amended from time to time pursuant
to the 1940 Act.  No Share shall have any priority or preference over
any other Share of the Trust with respect to dividends or distributions
paid in the ordinary course of business or distributions upon dissolution
of the Trust made pursuant to Article VIII, Section 1 hereof: provided
however, that

(i)	if the Shares of the Trust are divided into Series thereof, no
Share of a particular Series shall have any priority or preference over
any other Share of the same Series with respect to dividends or
distributions paid in the ordinary course of business or

distributions upon dissolution of the Trust or of such Series made
pursuant to Article VIII, Section 1 hereof:

(ii)	if the Shares of the Trust are divided into Classes thereof,
no Share of a particular Class shall have any priority or preference
over any other Share of the same Class with respect to dividends or
distributions paid in the ordinary course of business or
distributions upon dissolution of the Trust made pursuant to Article
VIII, Section 1 hereof: and

(iii)	if the Shares of a Series are divided into Classes thereof,
no Share of a particular Class of such Series shall have any priority
or preference over any other Share of the same Class of such Series
with respect to dividends or distributions paid in the ordinary
course of business or distributions upon dissolution of such Series
made pursuant to Article VIII, Section 1 hereof.

All dividends and distributions shall be made ratably among all
Shareholders of the Trust, a particular Class of the Trust, a
particular Series, or a particular Class of a Series from the
Trust Property held with respect to the Trust, such Series or
such Class, respectively, according to the number of Shares
of the Trust, such Series or such Class held of record by
such Shareholders on the record date for any dividend or
distribution: provided however, that

(iv)	if the Shares of the Trust are divided into Series thereof,
all dividends and distributions from the Trust Property and, if
applicable, held with respect to such Series, shall be distributed
to each Series thereof according to the net asset value computed
for such Series and within such particular Series, shall be distributed
ratably to the Shareholders of such Series according to the number of
Shares of such Series held of record by such Shareholders on the record
date for any dividend or distribution: and

(v)	if the Shares of the Trust or of a Series are divided into
Classes thereof, all dividends and distributions from the Trust Property
and, if applicable, held with respect to the Trust or such Series, shall
be distributed to each Class thereof according to the net asset value
computed for such Class and within such particular Class, shall be
distributed ratably to the Shareholders of such Class according to
the number of Shares of such Class held of record by such Shareholders
on the record date for any dividend or distribution.

Dividends and distributions may be paid in cash, in kind or in Shares.

(d)       Before payment of any dividend there may be set aside out of any
funds of the Trust, or the applicable Series thereof, available for
dividends such sum or sums as the Board of Trustees may from time to
time, in its absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve fund to

meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or
maintaining any property of the Trust, or any Series thereof, or for
such other lawful purpose as the Board of Trustees shall deem to be
in the best interests of the Trust, or the applicable Series, as the
case may be, and the Board of Trustees may abolish any such reserve
in the manner in which the reserve was created.

Section 2.	Redemptions at the Option of a Shareholder.  Unless
otherwise provided in the prospectus of the Trust relating to the
Shares, as such prospectus may be amended from time to time:

(a)	The Trust shall purchase such Shares as are offered by any
Shareholder for redemption upon the presentation of a proper
instrument of transfer together with a request directed to the
Trust or a Person designated by the Trust that the Trust purchase
such Shares and/or in accordance with such other procedures for
redemption as the Board of Trustees may from time to time authorize.
If certificates have been issued to a Shareholder, any request for
redemption by such Shareholder must be accompanied by surrender of
any outstanding
certificate or certificates for such Shares in form for transfer,
together with such proof of the authenticity of signatures as may
reasonably be required on such Shares and accompanied by proper
stock transfer stamps, if applicable.

(b)	The Trust shall pay for such Shares the net asset value thereof as
determined by the Trustees (or by such Person to whom such determination
has been delegated) (excluding any applicable redemption fee or sales load),
in accordance with this Declaration of Trust, the By-Laws, the 1940 Act and
other applicable law.  Payments for Shares so redeemed by the Trust shall be
made in cash, except payment for such Shares may, at the option of the Board
of Trustees, or such officer or officers as it may duly authorize in its
complete discretion, be made in kind or partially in cash and partially in
kind.  In case of any payment in kind, the Board of Trustees, or its
authorized officers, shall have absolute discretion as to what security
or securities of the Trust or the applicable Series shall be distributed
in kind and the amount of the same: and the securities shall be valued
for purposes of distribution at the value at which they were appraised
in computing the then current net asset value of the Shares, provided
that any Shareholder who cannot legally acquire securities so distributed
in kind shall receive cash to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.
Shareholders shall bear the expenses of in-kind transactions, including,
but not limited to, transfer agency fees, custodian fees and costs of
disposition of such securities.

(c)	Payment by the Trust for such redemption of Shares shall be made by
the Trust to the Shareholder within seven days after the date on which the
redemption request is received in proper form and/or such other procedures
authorized by the Board of Trustees are complied with: provided, however,
that if payment shall be made other than exclusively in cash, any securities
to be delivered as part of such payment shall be delivered as promptly as
any necessary transfers of such securities on the books of the several
corporations or other Person whose securities are to be delivered
practicably can be made, which may not necessarily occur within such
seven-day period.  In no case shall the Trust be liable for any delay
of any corporation or other Person in transferring securities selected
for delivery as all or part of any payment in kind.

(d)	The obligations of the Trust set forth in this Section 2 are subject
to the provision that such obligations may be suspended or postponed by the
Board of Trustees (1) during any time the New York Stock Exchange (the
Exchange) is closed for other than weekends or holidays: (2) if
permitted by the rules of the Commission, during periods when trading
on the Exchange is restricted: or (3) during any National Financial
Emergency.  The Board of Trustees may, in its discretion, declare
that the suspension relating to a National Financial Emergency
shall terminate, as the case may be, on the first business day
on which the Exchange shall have reopened or the period specified
above shall have expired (as to which, in the absence of an official
ruling by the Commission, the determination of the Board of Trustees
shall be conclusive).  In the case of a suspension of the right of
redemption as provided herein, a Shareholder may either withdraw
the request for redemption or receive payment based on the net
asset value per Share next determined after the termination of
such suspension, less any fees imposed on such redemption.

(e)	The right of any Shareholder of the Trust or any Series or Class
thereof to receive dividends or other distributions on Shares redeemed and
all other rights of such Shareholder with respect to the Shares so redeemed,
except the right of such Shareholder to receive payment for such Shares,
shall cease at the time the purchase price of such Shares shall have been
fixed, as provided above.

Section 3.	Redemptions at the Option of the Trust.  At the option
of the Board of
Trustees the Trust may, from time to time, without the vote
of the Shareholders, but subject to
the 1940 Act, redeem Shares or authorize the closing of any
Shareholder account, subject to such conditions and for such
reasons as may be established from time to time by the Board of
Trustees, including, without limitation, (i) the determination of the
Trustees that direct or indirect ownership of Shares of the Trust or
any Series has or may become concentrated in such Shareholder to an
extent that would disqualify any Series as a regulated investment
company under the Code (or any successor statute thereto), (ii) the
failure of a Shareholder to supply a tax identification number if
required to do so, or to have the minimum investment required (which
may vary by Series or Class), (iii) if the Share activity of the account
or ownership of Shares by a particular Shareholder is deemed by the
Trustees either to affect adversely the management of
the Trust or any Series or Class or not to be in the best interests of
the remaining Shareholders of the Trust or any Series or Class or (iv)
the failure of a Shareholder to pay when due for the purchase of Shares
issued to him.  Any such redemption shall be effected at the redemption
price and in the manner provided in this Article VI.

Section 4.	Transfer of Shares.  Shares shall be transferable in
accordance with the provisions of the By-Laws.

ARTICLE VII

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION OF AGENT

Section 1.	Limitation of Liability.

(a)	For the purpose of this Article, Agent means any Person who is or
was a Trustee, officer, employee or other agent of the Trust or is or was
serving at the request of the Trust as a trustee, director, officer,
employee or other agent of another foreign or domestic corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise: Proceeding
means any threatened, pending or completed action or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative: and Expenses include
without limitation attorneys' fees and any expenses of establishing a
right to indemnification under this Article.

(b)	An Agent shall be liable to the Trust and to any Shareholder for any
act or omission that constitutes a bad faith violation of the implied
contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing, for such Agent's
own willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless
disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such Agent (such
conduct referred to herein as Disqualifying Conduct), and for nothing else.

(c)	Subject to subsection (b) of this Section 1 and to the fullest
extent that limitations on the liability of Agents are permitted by the
DSTA, the Agents shall not be responsible or liable in any event for
any act or omission of any other Agent of the Trust or any Investment
Adviser or Principal Underwriter of the Trust.

(d)	No Agent, when acting in its respective capacity as such, shall be
personally liable to any Person, other than the Trust or a Shareholder to
the extent provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 1, for any
act, omission or obligation of the Trust or any Trustee thereof.

(e)	Each Trustee, officer and employee of the Trust shall, in the
performance of his or her duties, be fully and completely justified
and protected with regard to any act or any failure to act resulting
from reliance in good faith upon the books of account or other records
of the Trust, upon an opinion of counsel, or upon reports made to the
Trust by any of its officers or employees or by the Investment Adviser,
the Principal Underwriter, any other Agent, selected dealers,
accountants, appraisers or other experts or consultants, regardless
of whether such counsel or expert may also be a Trustee, as to matters
the Trustee, officer or employee of the Trust reasonably believes are
within such Person's professional or expert competence.  The officers
and Trustees may obtain the advice of counsel or other experts with
respect to the meaning and operation of this Declaration of Trust,
the By-Laws, applicable law and their respective duties as officers
or Trustees.  No such officer or Trustee shall be liable for any act
or omission in accordance with such advice, records and/or reports
and no inference concerning liability shall arise from a failure to
follow such advice, records and/or reports.  The officers and Trustees
shall not be required to give any bond hereunder, nor any surety if a
bond is required by applicable law.

(f)	The failure to make timely collection of dividends or interest,
or to take timely action with respect to entitlements, on the Trust's
securities issued in emerging countries, shall not be deemed to be
negligence or other fault on the part of any Agent, and no Agent
shall have any liability for such failure or for any loss or damage
resulting from the imposition by any government of exchange control
restrictions which might affect the liquidity of the Trust's assets
or from any war or political act of any foreign government to which
such assets might be exposed, except, in the case of a Trustee or
officer, for liability resulting from such Trustee's or officer's
Disqualifying Conduct.

(g)	The limitation on liability contained in this Article applies to
events occurring at the time a Person serves as an Agent whether or not
such Person is an Agent at the time of any Proceeding in which liability
is asserted.

(h)	No amendment or repeal of this Article shall adversely affect any
right or protection of an Agent that exists at the time of such amendment
or repeal.

Section 2.	Indemnification.

(a)	Indemnification by Trust.  The Trust shall indemnify, out of Trust
Property, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any Person
who was or is a party, potential party or non-party witness or is threatened
to be made a party, potential party or non- party witness to any Proceeding
by reason of the fact that such Person is or was an Agent of the Trust,
against Expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually
and reasonably incurred in connection with such Proceeding if such Person
acted in good faith or in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe the conduct of such Person was
unlawful.  The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, conviction or plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent
shall not of itself create a presumption that the Person did not act
in good faith or that the Person had reasonable cause to believe that
the Person's conduct was unlawful.

(b)	Exclusion of Indemnification.  Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained herein, there shall be no right to indemnification for
any liability arising by reason of the Agent's Disqualifying Conduct.  In
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which that Person shall have
been adjudged to be liable in the performance of that Person's duty
to the Trust or the Shareholders, indemnification shall be made only
to the extent that the court in which that action was brought shall
determine, upon application or otherwise, that in view of all the
circumstances of the case, that Person was not liable by reason
of that Person's Disqualifying Conduct.

(c)	Required Approval.  Any indemnification under this Article shall
be made by the Trust if authorized in the specific case on a determination
that indemnification of the Agent is proper in the circumstances by (i)
a final decision on the merits by a court or other body before whom the
proceeding was brought that the Agent was not liable by reason of
Disqualifying Conduct (including, but not limited to, dismissal
of either a court action or an administrative proceeding against
the Agent for insufficiency of evidence of any Disqualifying Conduct)
or, (ii) in the absence of such a decision, a reasonable determination,
based upon a review of the facts, that the Agent was not liable by
reason of Disqualifying Conduct, by (1) the

vote of a majority of a quorum of the Trustees who are not (x)
interested persons of the Trust as defined in Section 2(a)(19)
of the 1940 Act, (y) parties to the proceeding, or (z) parties who
have any economic or other interest in connection with such specific
case (the disinterested, non-party Trustees): or (2) by independent
legal counsel in a written opinion.

(d)	Advancement of Expenses.  Expenses incurred by an Agent in defending
any Proceeding may be advanced by the Trust before the final disposition of
the Proceeding on receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Agent to
repay the amount of the advance if it shall be determined ultimately that the
Agent is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Article:
provided, that at least one of the following conditions for the advancement
of expenses is met: (i) the Agent shall provide a security for his
undertaking, (ii) the Trust shall be insured against losses arising
by reason of any lawful advances, or (iii) a majority of a quorum of
the disinterested, non-party Trustees of the Trust, or an independent
legal counsel in a written opinion, shall determine, based on a review
of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial- type inquiry),
that there is reason to believe that the Agent ultimately will be found
entitled to indemnification.

(e)	Other Contractual Rights.  Nothing contained in this Article
shall affect
any right to indemnification to which Persons other than Trustees and
officers of the Trust or any subsidiary thereof may be entitled by
contract or otherwise.

(f)	Fiduciaries of Employee Benefit Plan.  This Article does not
apply to any Proceeding against any trustee, investment manager or other
fiduciary of an employee benefit plan in that Person's capacity as such,
even though that Person may also be an Agent of the Trust as defined in
Section 1 of this Article.  Nothing contained in this Article shall
limit any right to indemnification to which such a trustee,
investment manager, or other fiduciary may be entitled by
contract or otherwise which shall be enforceable to the extent
permitted by applicable law other than this Article.

(g)	Joint and Several Obligations. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Declaration of Trust to the contrary, any amount
of indemnification and any advancement of expenses that any Agent is
entitled to be paid under Section 2 shall be deemed to be joint and
several obligations of the Trust and each Series, and the assets of
the Trust and each Series shall be subject to the claims of any Agent
therefor under this Article VII: provided that any such liability,
expense or obligation may be allocated and charged by the Board of
Trustees between
or among the Trust and/or any one or more Series (and Classes) in
such manner as the Board of
Trustees in its sole discretion deem fair and equitable.

Section 3.	Insurance.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
the Board of Trustees shall have the authority to purchase with Trust
Property, insurance for liability and for all Expenses reasonably
incurred or paid or expected to be paid by an Agent in connection
with any Proceeding in which such Agent becomes involved by virtue
of such Agent's actions, or omissions to act, in its capacity or
former capacity with the Trust, whether or not the Trust would
have the power to indemnify such Agent against such liability.

Section 4.	Derivative Actions.  In addition to the requirements set
forth in Section
3816 of the DSTA, a Shareholder or Shareholders may bring a derivative
action on behalf of the
Trust only if the following conditions are met:

(a)	The Shareholder or Shareholders must make a pre-suit demand upon
the Board of Trustees to bring the subject action unless an effort to
cause the Board of Trustees to bring such an action is not likely to
succeed.  For purposes of this Section 4, a demand on the Board of
Trustees shall only be deemed not likely to succeed and therefore
excused if a majority of the Board of Trustees, or a majority of
any committee established to consider the merits of such action,
is composed of Trustees who are not independent trustees (as
such term is defined in the DSTA).

(b)	Unless a demand is not required under paragraph (a) of
this Section 4, Shareholders eligible to bring such derivative
action under the DSTA who hold at least 10% of the outstanding
Shares of the Trust, or 10% of the outstanding Shares of the
Series or Class to which such action relates, shall join in
the request for the Board of Trustees to commence such action: and

(c)	Unless a demand is not required under paragraph (a) of this
Section 4, the Board of Trustees must be afforded a reasonable amount
of time to consider such Shareholder request and to investigate the
basis of such claim.  The Board of Trustees shall be entitled to retain
counsel or other advisors in considering the merits of the request and
shall require an undertaking by the Shareholders making such request to
reimburse the Trust for the expense of any such advisors in the event
that the Board of Trustees determine not to bring such action.

For purposes of this Section 4, the Board of Trustees may designate a
committee of one Trustee to consider a Shareholder demand if necessary
to create a committee with a majority of Trustees who are independent"
"1566","trustees (as such term is defined in the DSTA).

In addition to all suits, claims or other actions (collectively, claims)
that under applicable law must be brought as derivative claims, each
Shareholder of the Trust or any Series or Class thereof agrees that
any claim that affects all Shareholders of a Series or Class equally,
that is, proportionately based on their number of Shares in such Series
or Class, must be brought as a derivative claim subject to this Section
4 irrespective of whether such claim involves a violation of the
Shareholders' rights under this Declaration of Trust or any other
alleged violation of contractual or individual rights that might
otherwise give rise to a direct claim.

Section 5.	Jurisdiction and Waiver of Jury Trial.  In accordance with
Section 3804(e) of the DSTA any suit, action or proceeding brought by or

Board of Trustees shall distribute such cash, shares or other
securities ratably among the Shareholders of such Series (giving
due effect to the differences among the various Classes within

the Trust have been so sold, conveyed and transferred, the Trust

master funds in which other funds are feeders.
