"847","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"848","To the Shareholders of MFS Strategic Income Fund and"
"849","Board of Trustees of MFS Series Trust VIII"
"850","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of MFS"
"851","Strategic Income Fund (the Fund) (one of the portfolios comprising the"
"852","MFS Series Trust VIII (the Trust)) as of and for the year ended October"
"853","31, 2018, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"854","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust's"
"855","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"856","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"857","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"858","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the"
"859","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's"
"860","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"861","such opinion."
"862","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"863","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"864","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"865","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"866","controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"867","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"868","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"869","statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally"
"870","accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over"
"871","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"872","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"873","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"874","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"875","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"876","financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted"

"925","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of MFS"
"926","Global Growth Fund (one of the series of MFS Series Trust VIII) (the"
"927","Fund) as of and for the year ended October 31, 2018, in accordance with"
"928","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"929","(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"930","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"931","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"932","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"933","of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"934","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"935","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"936","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"937","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"938","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"939","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"940","fund's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"941","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"942","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"943","purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"944","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"945","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"946","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"

"957","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
