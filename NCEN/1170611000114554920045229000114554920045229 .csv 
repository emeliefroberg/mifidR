"449","<TEXT>"
"450","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED"
"451","PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"452","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"453","of"
"454","Bragg Capital Trust"
"455","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"456","financial statements of Bragg Capital Trust"
"457","comprising Queens Road Value Fund and"
"458","Queens Road Small Cap Value Fund (the"
"459","Funds) as of and for the year ended May 31,"
"460","2020, in accordance with the standards of"
"461","the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"462","Board (United States), we considered the"
"463","Funds internal control over financial"
"464","reporting, including controls over"
"465","safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"466","designing our auditing procedures for the"
"467","purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"468","financial statements and to comply with the"
"469","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for"
"470","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"471","effectiveness of the Funds internal control"
"472","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"473","express no such opinion."
"474","The management of the Funds is"
"475","responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"476","effective internal control over financial"
"477","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"478","estimates and judgments by management"
"479","are required to assess the expected benefits"
"480","and related costs of controls.  A funds"
"481","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"482","process designed to provide reasonable"
"483","assurance regarding the reliability of"
"484","financial reporting and the preparation of"
"485","financial statements for external purposes"
"486","in accordance with generally accepted"
"487","accounting principles (GAAP).  A funds"
"488","internal control over financial reporting"
"489","includes those policies and procedures that"
"490","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"491","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"492","fairly reflect the transactions and"
"493","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"494","provide reasonable assurance that"
"495","transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"496","permit preparation of financial statements"
"497","in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"498","and expenditures of the fund are being"
"499","made only in accordance with"
"500","authorizations of management and trustees"
"501","of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"502","assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"503","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"504","or disposition of a funds assets that could"
"505","have a material effect on the financial"
"506","statements."
"507","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"508","control over financial reporting may not"
"509","prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"510","projections of any evaluation of"
"511","effectiveness to future periods are subject"
"512","to the risk that controls may become"
"513","inadequate because of changes in"
"514","conditions, or that the degree of"
"515","compliance with the policies or procedures"
"516","may deteriorate."
"517","A deficiency in internal control over"
"518","financial reporting exists when the design"
"519","or operation of a control does not allow"
"520","management or employees, in the normal"
"521","course of performing their assigned"
"522","functions, to prevent or detect"
"523","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"524","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"525","deficiencies, in internal control over"
"526","financial reporting, such that there is a"
"527","reasonable possibility that a material"
"528","misstatement of the Funds annual or"
"529","interim financial statements will not be"
"530","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"531","Our consideration of the Funds internal"
"532","control over financial reporting was for the"
"533","limited purpose described in the first"
"534","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"535","disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"536","that might be material weaknesses under"
"537","standards established by the Public"
"538","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"539","(United States).  However, we noted no"
"540","deficiencies in the Funds internal control"
"541","over financial reporting and its operation,"
"542","including controls over safeguarding"
"543","securities, that we consider to be a material"
"544","weakness as defined above as of May 31,"
"545","2020."
"546","This report is intended solely for the"
"547","information and use of management and"
"548","the Board of trustees of the Funds and the"
"549","Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"550","not intended to be and should not be used"
