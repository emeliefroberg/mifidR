"5842","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"5843","Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we"
"5844","considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"5845","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"5846","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"5847","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"

"5849","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"5850","Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"5851","we express no such opinion."
"5852","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"

"5854","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"

"5859","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"5860","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"

"5863","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"5864","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"

"5872","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a"

"5875","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"5876","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"5877","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"5878","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"5879","inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree"
"5880","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"5881","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"

"5883","management or employees, in the normal course of"
