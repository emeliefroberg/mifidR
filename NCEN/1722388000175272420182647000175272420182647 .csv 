"821","Management and the Audit Committee of the Board of"
"822","Trustees"
"823","Impact Shares Trust I"
"824","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"825","financial statements of Impact Shares Trust I"
"826","(comprising Impact Shares NAACP Minority Empowerment"
"827","ETF (NACP), Impact Shares Sustainable Development"
"828","Goals Global Equity ETF (SDGG), and Impact Shares"
"829","YWCA Womens Empowerment ETF (YWCA) (individually a"
"830","Fund or collectively referred to as the Funds)) for"
"831","the year ended June 30, 2020, we considered the"
"832","Funds internal control to determine our auditing"
"833","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"834","on the Funds financial statements and not to provide"
"835","assurance on internal control."
"836","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"837","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"838","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"839","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"840","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"841","timely basis.  A significant deficiency is a"
"842","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"843","internal control over financial reporting that is"
"844","less severe than a material weakness, yet important"
"845","enough to merit attention by those responsible for"
"846","the oversight of the Funds financial reporting. A"
"847","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"848","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"849","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"850","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"851","Funds annual financial statements will not be"
"852","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"853","During our audit, we noted the following"
"854","deficiencies as defined above and other matters that"
"855","we believe merit your consideration:"
"856","The Funds did not initially record trustee fee"
"857","expense within the Funds financial statements.  As"
"858","denoted within each Funds prospectus, Trustee fees"
"859","are the responsibility of the Fund and may be"
"860","voluntarily reimbursed by the Advisor.  The trustee"
"861","fees should have been recorded as a payable and"
"862","expense to the Funds, with a corresponding"
"863","reimbursement from the Advisor.  An adjusting entry"
"864","was recorded by each Fund as part of the annual"
"865","audit process.  We recommend that the financial"
"866","statement close process be enhanced to consider such"
"867","entries."
"868","During the year, SDGG was charged a custodian fee."
"869","The Fund did not initially record the custodian fee"
"870","as the fee was to be voluntarily reimbursed by the"
"871","Advisor; however, the custodian fee was charged to"
"872","the Fund and should have been recorded as a payable"
"873","and expense to the Fund with a corresponding"
"874","reimbursement from the Advisor. An adjusting entry"
"875","was recorded by the Fund as part of the annual audit"
"876","process."
"877","SDGG held foreign cash accounts with a negative"
"878","balance at June 30, 2020. The balances were"
"879","initially presented net with positive foreign"
"880","account cash balances as an asset on the financial"
"881","statements. The negative cash balances were"
"882","subsequently adjusted as part of the annual audit"
"883","processes to be shown gross within the Funds"
"884","financial statements resulting in a reclassification"
"885","entry between the Funds assets and liability"
"886","accounts."
"887","SDGG swept $1,955 in cash to a short-term investment"
"888","account on the last day of the fiscal year ended"
"889","June 30, 2019.  This was reflected in custodys"
"890","balances, but was not processed on the accounting"
"891","books until the next business day and the financial"
"892","statements were not initially update for this change"
"893","in cash and investment balances.  A reclassification"
"894","between cash and investments was recorded as part of"
"895","the annual audit process."
"896","None of the above adjustments impacted net assets of"
"897","the corresponding Funds.  We recommend that"
"898","Management enhance its review processes of cash and"
"899","expense activity as part of the financial statement"
"900","close review process to consider such timing and"
"901","presentation entries."
"902","This letter is intended solely for the information"
"903","and use of management and the audit committee and is"
