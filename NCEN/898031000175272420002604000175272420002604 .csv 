"9902","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED"
"9903","PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"9904","To the shareholders and the Board of Trustees of Lord"
"9905","Abbett Securities Trust"
"9906","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"9907","statements of Lord Abbett Securities Trust (the Trust),"
"9908","including the Lord Abbett Micro-Cap Growth Fund, Lord"
"9909","Abbett Alpha Strategy Fund, Lord Abbett Focused Growth"
"9910","Fund, Lord Abbett Focused Large Cap Value Fund, Lord"
"9911","Abbett Focused Small Cap Value Fund (formerly Lord"
"9912","Abbett Micro-Cap Value Fund), Lord Abbett Fundamental"
"9913","Equity Fund, Lord Abbett Global Equity Research Fund,"
"9914","Lord Abbett Global Select Equity Fund, Lord Abbett"
"9915","Growth Leaders Fund, Lord Abbett Health Care Fund, Lord"
"9916","Abbett International Equity Fund, Lord Abbett"
"9917","International Opportunities Fund, Lord Abbett International"
"9918","Value Fund, and Lord Abbett Value Opportunities Fund, as"
"9919","of and for the year ended October 31, 2019, in accordance"
"9920","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"9921","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered"
"9922","the Trust's internal control over financial reporting,"
"9923","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"9924","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"9925","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"9926","comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for"
"9927","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"9928","of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"9929","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"9930","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing"
"9931","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"9932","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"9933","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"9934","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A trust's"
"9935","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"9936","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"9937","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"9938","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"9939","with generally accepted accounting principles. A trust's"
"9940","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"9941","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"9942","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"9943","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"9944","trust; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"9945","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"9946","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"9947","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"9948","the trust are being made only in accordance with"
"9949","authorizations of management and directors of the trust;"
"9950","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"9951","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"9952","disposition of a trust's assets that could have a material"
"9953","effect on the financial statements."
"9954","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"9955","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"9956","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"9957","future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"9958","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"9959","that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"9960","procedures may deteriorate."
"9961","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"9962","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"9963","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"9964","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"9965","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"9966","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"9967","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"9968","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"9969","trust's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"9970","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"9971","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over"
"9972","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"9973","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"9974","deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"9975","weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB."
"9976","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trust's internal"
"9977","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"9978","controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be"
"9979","a material weakness, as defined above, as of October 31,"
"9980","2019."
"9981","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"9982","management and the Board of Trustees of the Trust and the"
"9983","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to"
"9984","be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"9985","specified parties."
