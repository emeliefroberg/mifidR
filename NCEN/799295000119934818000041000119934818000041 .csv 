"6311","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"6312","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"6313","principles (GAAP). A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting"

"6315","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"6316","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"6317","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"6318","preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"6319","and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"6320","of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"6321","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"6322","use, or disposition of a company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on"
"6323","the financial statements.</font></p>"
