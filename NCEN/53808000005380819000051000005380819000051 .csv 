"1291","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"1292","and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and"

"1295","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"1296","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1297","principles (GAAP). A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting"
"1298","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1299","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1300","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"1301","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1302","preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"1303","and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"1304","authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"1305","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1306","acquisition, use, or disposition of a company&#8217;s assets that could have a"
"1307","material effect on the financial statements.</font></p>"

"1312","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1313","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
