"1280","Item G.1.a.i - Deutsche DWS Investment Trust"
"1281","(formerly DWS Investment Trust)"
"1282","On December 7, 2010, Deutsche DWS Investment"
"1283","Trust (formerly DWS Investment Trust) (the Trust)"
"1284","was named as a defendant in the First Amended"
"1285","Complaint filed by the Official Committee of"
"1286","Unsecured Creditors in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for"
"1287","the District of Delaware in the lawsuit styled Official"
"1288","Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Tribune"
"1289","Company, et al., v. Fitzsimons et al. (the Lawsuit)."
"1290","The Lawsuit arises out of a leveraged buyout"
"1291","transaction (LBO) in 2007 by which loans were"
"1292","made to the Tribune Company to fund the LBO and"
"1293","shares of the Tribune Company held by shareholders"
"1294","were tendered for or were converted to a right to"
"1295","receive cash. Following the completion of the LBO in"
"1296","2007, the Tribune Company filed for bankruptcy. The"
"1297","Lawsuit seeks to recover all payments made to the"
"1298","shareholders in the LBO. The Lawsuit has been"
"1299","consolidated in a multi-district litigation (the Tribune
MDL) in the United States District Court for the"
"1300","Southern District of New York, case no. 12-MC-2296"
"1301","(the District Court). At the outset of the Lawsuit, the"
"1302","District Court issued a scheduling order which stayed"
"1303","all substantive proceedings in the Lawsuit until after"
"1304","the decision on motions to dismiss based on certain"
"1305","defenses common to the defendants filed in related"
"1306","cases."
"1307","On September 23, 2013, the District Court entered an"
"1308","order granting the defendants' motion to dismiss in"
"1309","certain of those related cases (the Bondholder
Actions) due to the pendency of the Lawsuit seeking"
"1310","recoveries on similar grounds, and the plaintiffs in"
"1311","Bondholder Actions appealed that order to the United"
"1312","States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On"
"1313","April 25, 2014, the District Court entered an order"
"1314","governing the upcoming stage of the Lawsuit, which"
"1315","directed Ropes & Gray, as Liaison Counsel to the"
"1316","Shareholder Defendants, to file a global motion to"
"1317","dismiss (the Global Motion to Dismiss) the Lawsuit"
"1318","on behalf of all shareholder defendants named in"
"1319","Exhibit A to the current Fifth Amended Complaint"
"1320","(including the Trust). The Global Motion to Dismiss"
"1321","was filed on May 23, 2014."
"1322","On March 29, 2016, the Second Circuit, in a"
"1323","unanimous opinion, affirmed the District Court's"
"1324","dismissal of the Bondholder Actions. The Bondholder"
"1325","Actions plaintiffs subsequently filed a petition for"
"1326","rehearing, which the Second Circuit denied on July 22,"
"1327","2016. On September 9, 2016, the Bondholder Actions"
"1328","plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari of the"
"1329","Second Circuit's decision in the U.S. Supreme Court."
"1330","On January 6, 2017, the District Court granted the"
"1331","Global Motion to Dismiss, dismissing the only claim"
"1332","asserted against the shareholder defendants named in"
"1333","the Lawsuit, and denied the plaintiff's request for"
"1334","leave to amend the Complaint."
"1335","On April 3, 2018, Supreme Court Justices Kennedy"
"1336","and Thomas issued a Statement indicating that"
"1337","consideration of the petition for certiorari in the"
"1338","Bondholder Actions will be deferred for an
additional period of time because of the possibility"
"1339","that there might not be a quorum of Justices"
"1340","available to consider those cases. The Statement also"
"1341","said that this deferral would allow the Second Circuit"
"1342","or the District Court to consider whether to recall the"
"1343","mandate, entertain a motion to vacate the earlier"
"1344","judgment, or provide any other available relief in light"

"1384","Investment Trust and Shareholders of DWS"
"1385","Large Cap Focus Growth Fund:"

"1392","accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1393","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1394","(United States), we considered the Trust's"
"1395","internal control over financial reporting,"
"1396","including controls over safeguarding"
"1397","securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1398","auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1399","expressing our opinion on the consolidated"
"1400","financial statements and to comply with the"
"1401","requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for"
"1402","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1403","effectiveness of the Trust's internal control"
"1404","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"1405","express no such opinion."
"1406","The management of the Trust is responsible"
"1407","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"1408","internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1409","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1410","judgments by management are required to"
"1411","assess the expected benefits and related"
"1412","costs of controls. A company's internal"
"1413","control over financial reporting is a process"
"1414","designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1415","regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"1416","and the preparation of financial statements"
"1417","for external purposes in accordance with"
"1418","U.S. generally accepted accounting"
"1419","principles. A company's internal control over"
"1420","financial reporting includes those policies"
"1421","and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1422","maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1423","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1424","transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"1425","of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1426","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1427","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1428","statements in accordance with U.S."
"1429","generally accepted accounting principles,"
"1430","and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1431","company are being made only in"
"1432","accordance with authorizations of"
"1433","management and directors of the company;"
"1434","and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1435","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1436","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1437","of a company's assets that could have a"
"1438","material effect on the financial statements."
"1439","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1440","control over financial reporting may not"

"1442","projections of any evaluation of"
"1443","effectiveness to future periods are subject to"

"1445","inadequate because of changes in"
"1446","conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"1447","with the policies or procedures may"
"1448","deteriorate."
"1449","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1450","reporting exists when the design or"

"1452","management or employees, in the normal"
"1453","course of performing their assigned"
"1454","functions, to prevent or detect"
"1455","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"1456","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"1457","of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"1458","financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1459","reasonable possibility that a material"
"1460","misstatement of the company's annual or"

"1463","Our consideration of the Trust's internal"
"1464","control over financial reporting was for the"

"1468","that might be material weaknesses under"

"1470","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
