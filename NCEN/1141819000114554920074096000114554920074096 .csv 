Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2020, by correspondence with the custodian, agent banks, and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from agent banks or brokers were not received. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
