"333","<p style=text-align: justify;padding-right: 96px;margin-top: 11px;margin-bottom: 0px;font: normal 15px/17px 'Arial';>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Colorado BondShares - A Tax- Exempt Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year ended September 30, 2020 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</p>"
"334","<p style=text-align: justify;padding-right: 96px;margin-top: 11px;margin-bottom: 0px;font: normal 15px/17px 'Arial';>Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the Fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</p>"
"335","<p style=text-align: justify;padding-right: 96px;margin-top: 11px;margin-bottom: 0px;font: normal 15px/17px 'Arial';>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</p>"
"336","<p style=text-align: justify;padding-right: 96px;margin-top: 11px;margin-bottom: 0px;font: normal 15px/17px 'Arial';>A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.</p>"
"337","<p style=text-align: justify;padding-right: 96px;margin-top: 15px;margin-bottom: 0px;font: normal 15px/17px 'Arial';>Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB. However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above, as of September 30, 2020.</p> </div>"
