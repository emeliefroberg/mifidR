"1791","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the"

"1793","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"

"1802","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"

"1808","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1809","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1810","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1811","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal"
"1812","control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"1813","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1814","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1815","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"1816","of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"

"1826","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
