"573","To the Board of Trustees"
"574","of Northern Lights Fund"
"575","Trust III"
"576","and the Shareholders of"
"577","ACM Dynamic Opportunity Fund"
"578","and ACM Tactical Income Fund"
"579","In planning and performing our"
"580","audits of the financial"
"581","statements of ACM Dynamic"
"582","Opportunity Fund and ACM"
"583","Tactical Income Fund, each a"
"584","series of shares of beneficial"
"585","interest in Northern Lights"
"586","Fund Trust III (the Funds), as"
"587","of December 31, 2019, and for the"
"588","year then ended, in accordance"
"589","with the standards of the Public"
"590","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"591","(United States) (PCAOB), we"
"592","considered the Funds internal"
"593","control over financial reporting,"
"594","including controls over"
"595","safeguarding securities, as a"
"596","basis for designing our auditing"
"597","procedures for the purpose of"
"598","expressing our opinion on the"
"599","financial statements and to comply"
"600","with the requirements of Form"
"601","N-CEN, but not for the purpose of"
"602","expressing an opinion on the"
"603","effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"604","control over financial reporting."
"605","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"606","The management of the Funds is"
"607","responsible for establishing and"
"608","maintaining effective internal"
"609","control over financial reporting."
"610","In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"611","estimates and judgments by management"
"612","are required to assess the expected"
"613","benefits and related costs of controls."
"614","A funds internal control over financial"
"615","reporting is a process designed to"
"616","provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"617","the reliability of financial reporting"
"618","and the preparation of financial"
"619","statements for external purposes in"
"620","accordance with accounting principles"
"621","generally accepted in the United States"
"622","of America (GAAP).  A funds internal"
"623","control over financial reporting"
"624","includes those policies and procedures"
"625","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"626","records that, in reasonable detail,"
"627","accurately and fairly reflect the"
"628","transactions and dispositions of the"
"629","assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"630","reasonable assurance that transactions"
"631","are recorded as necessary to permit"
"632","preparation of the financial"
"633","statements in accordance with GAAP, and"
"634","that receipts and expenditures of the"
"635","fund are being made only in accordance"
"636","with authorizations of management and"
"637","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"638","reasonable assurance regarding"
"639","prevention or timely detection of"
"640","unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"641","disposition of a funds assets that"
"642","could have a material effect on the"
"643","financial statements."
"644","Because of inherent limitations,"
"645","internal control over financial"
"646","reporting may not prevent or detect"
"647","misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"648","any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"649","future periods are subject to the risk"
"650","that controls may become inadequate"
"651","because of changes in conditions or"
"652","that the degree of compliance with the"
"653","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"654","A deficiency in internal control over"
"655","financial reporting exists when the"
