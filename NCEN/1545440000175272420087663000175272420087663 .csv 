"836","A fund&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"837","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"838","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"839","with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
