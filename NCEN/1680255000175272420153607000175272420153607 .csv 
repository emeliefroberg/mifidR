"422","as of and for the year ended May 31, 2020, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"

"429","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"

"431","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"432","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A fund&rsquo;s internal control over"
"433","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"434","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"435","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"436","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"437","and directors of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"438","use, or disposition of the fund&rsquo;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
