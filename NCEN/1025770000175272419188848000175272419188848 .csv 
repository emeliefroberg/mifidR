"4417","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"4418","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A fund's internal"

"4422","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and Trustees of"

"4428","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"4429","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"4430","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in"
