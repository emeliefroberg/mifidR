"1205","<P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of, including the investment portfolios, of the American Funds Retirement Income Portfolio"
"1206","Series comprising the American Funds Conservative Portfolio, American Funds Moderate Portfolio, and American Funds Enhanced Portfolio (the &#147;Series&#148;), as of and for the year ended October&nbsp;31, 2019, in accordance with the standards of"
"1207","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Series&#146; internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"1208","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-CEN, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Series&#146; internal control over financial reporting."
"1209","Accordingly, we express no such opinion. </P> <P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>The management of the Series is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over"
"1210","financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A Series&#146; internal control over financial reporting is a process designed"
"1211","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Series&#146; internal control over"
"1212","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Series; (2)&nbsp;provide"
"1213","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Series are being made only in"
"1214","accordance with authorizations of management and Trustees of the Series; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a Series&#146; assets that could have a"
"1215","material effect on the financial statements. </P> <P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1216","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1217","deteriorate. </P> <P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1218","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1219","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Series&#146; annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. </P>"
