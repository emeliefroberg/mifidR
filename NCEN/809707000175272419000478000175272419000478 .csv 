"6011","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control"
"6012","over financial reporting. Accordingly we do not express an opinion"
"6013","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"6014","financial reporting. The management of the Fund is responsible for"

"6016","financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility estimates and"
"6017","judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits"
"6018","and related costs of controls. A companys internal control over"
"6019","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"6020","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"6021","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"6022","generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over"
"6023"," financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain"
"6024","to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and"
"6025","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"

"6031","3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"6032","of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of a companys assets that"
"6033"," could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"6034","Because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial"
"6035"," reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also projections"
"6036","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"6037","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or"
"6038","that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures"
"6039","may deteriorate."
"6040","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"6041","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees"
"6042","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to"
"6043","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is"
"6044","a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over"

"6486","ARTICLE III"
"6487","SHARES"
"6488","Section 1.	Division of Beneficial Interest."
"6489","(a)	The beneficial interest in the Trust shall be divided"
"6490","into Shares, each Share without a par value.  The number of"
"6491","Shares in the Trust authorized hereunder, and of each Series"
"6492","and Class as may be established from time to time, is unlimited."
"6493","The Board of Trustees may authorize the division of Shares into"
"6494","separate Classes of Shares and into separate and distinct"
"6495","Series of Shares and the division of any Series into separate"
"6496","Classes of Shares in accordance with the 1940 Act.  The"
"6497","different Series and Classes shall be established and"
"6498","designated pursuant to Article III, Section 6 hereof."
"6499","If no separate Series or Classes of Series shall be established,"
"6500","the Shares shall have the rights, powers and duties provided for"
"6501","herein and in Article III, Section 6 hereof to the extent"
"6502","relevant and not otherwise provided for herein, and all references"
"6503","to Series and Classes shall be construed (as the context may require)"
"6504","to refer to the Trust."
"6505","	The fact that the Trust shall have one or more established"
"6506","and designated Classes of the Trust, shall not limit the authority"
"6507","of the Board of Trustees to establish and designate additional"
"6508","Classes of the Trust.  The fact that one or more Classes of"
"6509","the Trust shall have initially been established and"
"6510","designated without any specific establishment or designation"
"6511","of a Series (i.e., that all Shares of the Trust are initially"
"6512","Shares of one or more Classes) shall not limit the authority"
"6513","of the Board of Trustees to later establish and designate a"
"6514","Series and establish and designate the Class or Classes of the"
"6515","Trust as Class or Classes, respectively, of such Series."
"6516","	The fact that a Series shall have initially been"
"6517","established and designated without any specific establishment"
"6518","or designation of Classes (i.e., that all Shares of such"
"6519","Series are initially of a single Class) shall not limit the"
"6520","authority of the Board of Trustees to establish and designate"
"6521","separate Classes of said Series.  The fact that a Series"
"6522","shall have more than one established and designated Class,"
"6523","shall not limit the authority of the Board of Trustees to"
"6524","establish and designate additional Classes of said Series."
"6525","(b)	The Board of Trustees shall have the power to issue"
"6526","authorized, but unissued Shares of the Trust, or any Series"
"6527","and Class thereof, from time to time for such consideration"
"6528","paid wholly or partly in cash, securities or other property,"
"6529","as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Trustees,"
"6530","subject to any requirements or limitations of the 1940 Act."
"6531","The Board of Trustees, on behalf of the Trust, may acquire and"
"6532","hold as treasury shares, reissue for such consideration and"
"6533","on such terms as it may determine, or cancel, at its"
"6534","discretion from time to time, any Shares reacquired by"
"6535","the Trust.  The Board of Trustees may classify, reclassify"
"6536","or convert any unissued Shares or any Shares of the Trust"
"6537","or any Series or Class thereof, that were previously"
"6538","issued and are reacquired, into one or more Series or"
"6539","Classes that may be established and designated from time to time"
"6540","and, in connection therewith, cause some or all of the Shareholders"
"6541","of the Trust, such Series or Class to become Shareholders of such"
"6542","other Series or Class.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust"
"6543","and any Series thereof may acquire, hold, sell and otherwise deal"
"6544","in, for purposes of investment or otherwise, the Shares of any"
"6545","other Series of the Trust or Shares of the Trust, and such"
"6546","Shares shall not be deemed treasury shares or cancelled."
"6547","(c)	Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this"
"6548","rticle III, each Share shall entitle the holder to voting"
"6549","rights as provided in Article V hereof.  Shareholders shall"
"6550","have no preemptive or other right to subscribe for new or"
"6551","additional authorized, but unissued Shares or other securities"
"6552","issued by the Trust or any Series thereof.  The Board of"
"6553","Trustees may from time to time divide or combine the Shares"
"6554","of the Trust or any particular Series thereof into a greater"
"6555","or lesser number of Shares of the Trust or that Series,"
"6556","respectively.  Such division or combination shall not"
"6557","materially change the proportionate beneficial interests"
"6558","of the holders of Shares of the Trust or that Series, as the"
"6559","case may be, in the Trust Property at the time of such division"
"6560","or combination that is held with respect to the Trust or that"
"6561","Series, as the case may be."
"6562","(d)	Any Trustee, officer or other agent of the Trust, and any"
"6563","organization in which any such Person has an economic or other"
"6564","interest, may acquire, own, hold and dispose of Shares in the"
"6565","Trust or any Series and Class thereof, whether such Shares are"
"6566","authorized but unissued, or already outstanding, to the same extent"
"6567","as if such Person were not a Trustee, officer or other agent of the"
"6568","Trust; and the Trust or any Series may issue and sell and may purchase"
"6569","such Shares from any such Person or any such organization, subject"
"6570","to the limitations, restrictions or other provisions applicable"
"6571","to the sale or purchase of such Shares herein and the 1940 Act."
"6572","Section 2.	Ownership of Shares.  The ownership of Shares"
"6573","hall be recorded on the books of the Trust kept by the Trust or"
"6574","by a transfer or similar agent for the Trust, which books shall be"
"6575","maintained separately for the Shares of the Trust and each Series"
"6576","and each Class thereof that has been established and designated."
"6577","No certificates certifying the ownership of Shares shall be issued"
"6578","except as the Board of Trustees may otherwise determine from time"
"6579","to time.  The Board of Trustees may make such rules not inconsistent"
"6580","with the provisions of the 1940 Act as it considers appropriate"
"6581","for the issuance of Share certificates, the transfer of Shares"
"6582","of the Trust and each Series and Class thereof, if any, and"
"6583","similar matters.  The record books of the Trust as kept by the"

"7093"," such doctrine.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the"
"7094","provisions of this Declaration of Trust and the By-Laws,"
"7095"," to the extent that they restrict or eliminate the duties"
"7096","(including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto"
"7097","of a Trustee otherwise applicable under the foregoing standard"

"7105","officers, directors, shareholders, partners or employees"
"7106","of the Trustees, if any, shall be expected to devote their"

"8301","Notice of Automatic Conversion of Class C Shares to Class A Shares after"
"8302","10Year Holding Period"
"8303","At Board meetings held on February 26 and 27 2018 the Board of Trustees"
"8304","approved an automatic conversion feature for the Funds Class C shares"
"8305","which includes Class C1 shares as applicable that will automatically"
"8306","convert shareholders Class C shares into Class A shares of the same"
"8307","Fund after they have been held for 10 years. After conversion your new"
"8308","shares will be subject to Class A shares lower Rule 12b1 fees.  The"
"8309"," conversion feature will become effective on or about October 5 2018."
"8310"," Later that month Class C shares of the Fund that have been outstanding"
"8311"," for 10 years or more will automatically convert to Class A shares of"
"8312"," such Fund on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two"
"8313"," classes. Thereafter Class C shares of the Fund will convert"
"8314"," automatically to Class A shares of such Fund on a monthly basis in"
"8315"," the month of or the month following the 10year anniversary of the"
"8316"," Class C shares purchase date. Class C shares of the Fund acquired"
"8317"," through automatic reinvestment of dividends or distributions will"
"8318"," convert to Class A shares of the Fund on the conversion date pro"
"8319"," rata with the converting Class C shares of the Fund that were not"
"8320"," acquired through reinvestment of dividends or distributions."
"8321","Shareholders will not pay a sales charge including a contingent"
"8322","deferred sales charge upon the conversion of their Class C shares"
"8323"," to Class A shares pursuant to this conversion feature. The automatic"
"8324"," conversion of the Funds Class C shares into Class A shares after the"
"8325"," 10year holding period is not expected to be a taxable event for federal"
"8326"," income tax purposes. Shareholders should consult with their tax advisor"
"8327"," regarding the state and local tax consequences of such conversions."
"8328"," Class C shares held through a financial intermediary in an omnibus"
"8329"," account will be converted into Class A shares only if the intermediary"
"8330"," can document that the shareholder has met the required holding period."
"8331"," In certain circumstances when shares are invested through retirement"
"8332"," plans omnibus accounts and in certain other instances the Fund and its"
"8333"," agents may not have transparency into how long a shareholder has held"
"8334"," Class C shares for purposes of determining whether such Class C shares"
"8335"," are eligible for automatic conversion into Class A shares and the"
"8336"," financial intermediary may not have the ability to track purchases to"
"8337"," credit individual shareholders holding periods.  This primarily occurs"
"8338"," when shares are invested through certain record keepers for group"
"8339"," retirement plans where the intermediary cannot track share aging at the"
"8340"," participant level.  In these circumstances the Fund will not be able to"
"8341"," automatically convert Class C shares into Class A shares as described"
"8342"," above. In order to determine eligibility for conversion in these"
"8343"," circumstances it is the responsibility of the shareholder or their"
"8344"," financial intermediary to notify the Fund that the shareholder is"
"8345"," eligible for the conversion of Class C shares to Class A shares and"
"8346"," the shareholder or their financial intermediary may be required to"
"8347"," maintain and provide the Fund with records that substantiate the holding"
"8348"," period of Class C shares. It is the financial intermediarys and not the"
"8349"," Funds responsibility to keep records and to ensure that the shareholder"
"8350"," is credited with the proper holding period. Please consult with your"
"8351"," financial intermediary about your shares eligibility for this conversion"
"8352"," feature."
"8353","Also effective October 5 2018 new accounts or plans may not be eligible to"
"8354"," purchase Class C shares of the Fund if it is determined that the"
"8355"," intermediary cannot track shareholder holding periods to determine"
"8356"," whether a shareholders Class C shares are eligible for conversion to"
"8357"," Class A shares.  Accounts or plans and their successor related and"
"8358"," affiliated plans that have Class C shares of the Fund available to"
"8359"," participants on or before October 5 2018 may continue to open accounts"
"8360"," for new participants in such share class and purchase additional shares"
"8361"," in existing participant accounts.  The Fund has no responsibility for"
"8362"," overseeing monitoring or implementing a financial intermediarys process"
"8363"," for determining whether a shareholder meets the required holding period"
"8364"," for conversion."
"8365","A financial intermediary may sponsor andor control accounts programs or"
"8366"," platforms that impose a different conversion schedule or different"
"8367"," eligibility requirements for the conversion of Class C shares into Class"
"8368"," A shares. In these cases Class C shareholders may convert to Class A"
"8369"," shares under the policies of the financial intermediary and the"
"8370"," conversion may be structured as an exchange of Class C shares for"
"8371"," Class A shares of the same Fund. Financial intermediaries will be"
"8372"," responsible for making such exchanges in those circumstances. Please"
"8373"," consult with your financial intermediary if you have any questions"
"8374"," regarding your shares conversion from Class C shares to Class A shares."
