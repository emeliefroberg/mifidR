"625","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"626","To the Trustees of Putnam Investment Funds and Shareholders of"
"627","Putnam International Capital Opportunities Fund"
"628","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"629","of Putnam International Capital Opportunities Fund (the Fund) as"
"630","of and for the year ended August 31, 2014, in accordance with the"
"631","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"632","(United States), we considered the Funds internal control over"
"633","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"634","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"635","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"636","and to comply with the requirements of Form NSAR, but not for the"
"637","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"638","Funds internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"639","do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds"
"640","internal control over financial reporting."
"641","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"642","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"643","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"644","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"645","related costs of controls.  A funds internal control over"
"646","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"647","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"648","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"649","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"650","funds internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"651","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"652","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"653","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund  (2)"
"654","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"655","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"656","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"657","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"658","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"659","fund  and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"660","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"661","disposition of a funds assets that could have a material effect"
"662","on the financial statements."
"663","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"664","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"665","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"666","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"667","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"668","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"669","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"670","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"671","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"672","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"673","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"674","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"675","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"676","material misstatement of the Funds annual or interim financial"
"677","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"678","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"679","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"680","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"681","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"682","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"683","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"684","deficiencies in the Funds internal control over financial"
"685","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"686","securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"687","above as of August 31, 2014."
"688","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"689","management and the Board of Trustees of Putnam International"
"690","Capital Opportunities Fund and the Securities and Exchange"
"691","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"692","anyone other than these specified parties."

"769","two or more Trustees, sufficient notice thereof being given to"
"770","each Trustee by the Clerk or an Assistant Clerk or by the officer"
"771","or the Trustees calling the meeting."
"772","      2.3  Notice of Special Meetings.  It shall be sufficient"
"773","notice to a Trustee of a special meeting  (a) to send notice (i)"
"774","by mail at least forty-eight hours before the meeting, (ii) by"

"779","business or residence address (or e-mail address, facsimile"
"780","number or other appropriate address)  or (b) to give notice to"
"781","him or her in person or by telephone at least twenty-four hours"
"782","before the meeting.  Notice of a special meeting need not be"
"783","given to any Trustee if a written waiver of notice, executed by"
"784","him or her before or after the meeting, is filed with the records"
"785","of the meeting, or to any Trustee who attends the meeting without"
"786","protesting before or at its commencement the lack of notice to"
"787","him or her.  Any written waiver of notice may be provided and"
"788","delivered to the Trust by mail, courier, e-mail, facsimile or"

"795","broken by Trustees withdrawing from the meeting.  Any meeting may"
"796","be adjourned from time to time by a majority of the votes cast"
"797","upon the question, whether or not a quorum is present, and the"
"798","meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice."
"799","      2.5  Telephone Meeting  Action Without a Meeting.  Except as"
"800","otherwise provided in the Declaration of Trust and these Bylaws,"

"803","being present), including any meeting held by means of a"
"804","conference telephone or other communications equipment by means"
"805","of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each"
"806","other at the same time and participation by such means shall"
"807","constitute presence in person at a meeting. Any action to be"
"808","taken by the Trustees may also be taken without a meeting if one"
"809","or more written consents thereto are signed by a majority of the"
"810","Trustees.  Any written consent may be given by mail, courier, e-"
"811","mail, facsimile or other electronic means.  Copies of such"
"812","written consents shall be filed with the minutes of the"
"813","proceedings of the Trustees.  Such consents shall be treated for"
"814","all purposes as a vote taken at a meeting of the Trustees.  If in"
"815","accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Trust and"
"816","these Bylaws any action is taken by the Trustees by written"
"817","consents of less than all of the Trustees, then prompt notice of"
"818","any such action shall be furnished to each Trustee who did not"
"819","execute such written consent, provided that the effectiveness of"
"820","such action shall not be impaired by any delay or failure to"
"821","furnish such notice."

"965","      7.1  General.  The seal of the Trust, if any, shall consist"
"966","of a flat-faced die with the word  Massachusetts , together with"
"967","the name of the Trust and the year of its organization cut or"

"1028","Shares transferred as collateral security shall be entitled to a"
"1029","new certificate if the instrument of transfer substantially"
"1030","describes the debt or duty that is intended to be secured"
"1031","thereby.  Such new certificate shall express on its face that it"
"1032","is held as collateral security, and the name of the pledgor shall"
"1033","be stated thereon, who alone shall be liable as a Shareholder and"
