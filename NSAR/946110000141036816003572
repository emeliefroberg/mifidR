"2992","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"2993","Accounting Firm"
"2994","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"2995","Credit Suisse Opportunity Funds:"
"2996","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"2997","financial statements of Credit Suisse Floating"
"2998","Rate High Income Fund, Credit Suisse"
"2999","Multialternative Strategy Fund, Credit Suisse"
"3000","Strategic Income Fund, Credit Suisse Managed"
"3001","Futures Strategy Fund, Credit Suisse Emerging"
"3002","Markets Equity Fund and Credit Suisse Global"
"3003","Sustainable Dividend Equity Fund (the"
"3004","Funds), each a series of Credit Suisse"
"3005","Opportunity Funds, as of and for the year ended"
"3006","October 31, 2016, in accordance with the"
"3007","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"3008","Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"3009","the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3010","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"3011","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"3012","procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"3013","opinion on the financial statements and to"
"3014","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"3015","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"3016","on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"3017","control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"3018","we express no such opinion."
"3019","Management of the Funds is responsible for"
"3020","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"3021","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"3022","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"3023","management are required to assess the expected"
"3024","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's"
"3025","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"3026","process designed to provide reasonable"
"3027","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"3028","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"3029","statements for external purposes in accordance"
"3030","with generally accepted accounting principles."
"3031","A fund's internal control over financial"
"3032","reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"3033","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"3034","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"3035","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"3036","assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"3037","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"3038","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"3039","statements in accordance with generally"
"3040","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"3041","and expenditures of the fund are being made"
"3042","only in accordance with authorizations of"
"3043","management and trustees of the fund; and (3)"
"3044","provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"3045","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"3046","acquisition, use, or disposition of the fund's"
"3047","assets that could have a material effect on the"
"3048","financial statements."
"3049","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"3050","control over financial reporting may not prevent"
"3051","or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"3052","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"3053","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3054","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"3055","that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"3056","or procedures may deteriorate."
"3057","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"3058","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"3059","a control does not allow management or"
"3060","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"3061","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3062","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"3063","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"3064","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"3065","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"3066","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"3067","Funds' annual or interim financial statements"
"3068","will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"3069","basis."
"3070","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control"
"3071","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"3072","purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"3073","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"3074","internal control that might be material"
"3075","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"3076","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"3077","(United States).  However, we noted no"
"3078","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over"
"3079","financial reporting and their operation, including"
"3080","controls over safeguarding securities that we"
"3081","consider to be a material weakness as defined"
"3082","above as of October 31, 2016."
"3083","This report is intended solely for the"
"3084","information and use of management and the"
"3085","Board of Trustees of Credit Suisse Opportunity"
"3086","Funds and the Securities and Exchange"
"3087","Commission and is not intended to be and"

"3357","to, breadth of the market in the security, the price of the"
"3358","security, the financial condition and execution capability of"
"3359","the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of any commission"
"3360","for the specific transaction and for transactions executed"
"3361","through the broker or dealer in the aggregate.  In selecting"

"3364","consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms"
"3365","are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of"
"3366","1934, as the same may from time to time be amended)"

"3378","The Manager shall not be liable for any error of judgment or"
"3379","mistake of law or for any loss suffered by any Fund in"
"3380","connection with the matters to which this agreement"
"3381","(Agreement) relates, provided that nothing herein shall be"

"3454","appropriate for each will be allocated in accordance with a"
"3455","formula believed to be equitable to each entity.  Each Trust"
"3456","recognizes that in some cases this procedure may adversely"

"3459","the Manager to assist in the performance of the Manager's"
"3460","duties hereunder will not devote their full time to such service"
"3461","and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit or"

"3465","provided that doing so does not adversely affect the ability of"
