"1129","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1130","To the Trustees of DWS Portfolio Trust and Shareholders of DWS Floating"
"1131","Rate Fund: In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1132","statements of DWS Floating Rate Fund (the Fund), as of and for the year"
"1133"," ended May 31, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1134","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1135","Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including control"
"1136","activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1137","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1138","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1139","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"1140","of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"1141","we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"1142","internal control over financial reporting. The management of the Fund"
"1143","is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1144","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1145","estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"1146","benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"1147","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1148","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1149","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1150","accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"1151","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1152","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1153","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"1154","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"1155","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1156","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1157","fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1158","and directors of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1159","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"1160","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1161","financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1162","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"1163","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1164","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes"
"1165","in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1166","procedures may deteriorate. A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1167","reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1168","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1169","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"1170","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1171","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1172","possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim"
"1173","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1174","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"1175","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1176","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"1177","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established"
"1178","by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"1179","we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1180","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1181","securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above"
"1182","as of May 31, 2012. This report is intended solely for the information and"
"1183","use of the Trustees, management, and the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"1184","and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"1185","specified parties."

"1198","Item 77E - DWS Floating Rate Fund (a series of DWS Portfolio Trust)"
"1199","On December 7, 2010, DWS Floating Rate Fund was named as a defendant"
"1200","in the First Amended Complaint and Objection to Claims filed by the"
"1201","Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the U.S. Bankruptcy"
"1202","Court for the District of Delaware in the lawsuit Tribune Company,"
"1203","et al., Debtors, Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors v."
"1204","JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. et al. (the Lawsuit).  The Lawsuit"
"1205","arises out of a leveraged buyout transaction (LBO) in 2007 by which"
"1206","loans were made to the Tribune Company to fund the LBO (LBO Debt)"
"1207","and shares of the Tribune Company held by shareholders were tendered"
"1208","for or were converted to a right to receive cash.  Following the"
"1209","completion of the LBO in 2007, the Tribune Company filed for"
"1210","bankruptcy. The Lawsuit seeks to avoid the obligations on the LBO"
"1211","Debt and to recover payments of principal and interest made by the"
"1212","Tribune Company on the LBO Debt.  The Fund currently holds LBO Debt"
"1213","securities and has received approximately $82,463 in interest"
"1214","payments and $12,500 in principal payments as of May 31, 2012."
"1215","All proceedings on the Lawsuit were stayed pending a decision by"
"1216","the Bankruptcy Court on which of two proposed plans of"
"1217","reorganization would be confirmed.  One of the plans proposed to"
"1218","settle the litigation, while the other plan proposed to proceed"
"1219","with the litigation.  The Bankruptcy Court has confirmed the plan of"
"1220","reorganization that provides for settlement of the litigation; this"
"1221","confirmation order has been appealed by the creditors that proposed"
"1222","the competing plan.  Management is currently assessing the Lawsuit"
"1223","and has not yet determined the effect, if any, on the Fund."
