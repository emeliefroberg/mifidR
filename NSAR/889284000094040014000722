"6361","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"6362","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"6363","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"6364","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"6365","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"6366","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"6367","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"6368","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"6369","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"6370","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"6371","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"6372","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's"
"6373","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"6374","statements."
"6375","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"6376","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"6377","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"6378","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"6379","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"6380","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"6381","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"6382","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"6383","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"6384","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"6385","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"6386","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"6387","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"6388","material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial"
"6389","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"6390","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"6391","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"6392","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"6393","internal control that might be material weakness under standards"
"6394","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"6395","(Unites States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"6396","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"6397","including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider"
"6398","to be a material weakness as defined above as of September 30,"

"6416","POLICIES WITH RESPECT TO SECURITY INVESTMENTS"
"6417","Effective May 7, 2014, the principal strategy of the Sterling"
"6418","Capital Corporate Fund was modified and is stated as follows:"
"6419","Principal Strategy"
"6420","To pursue its investment objective, the Fund will invest, under"
"6421","normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets plus"
"6422","borrowings for investment purposes in a diversified portfolio of"
"6423","corporate debt securities, including corporate bonds, notes and"
"6424","debentures. The Fund may invest in (i) bonds issued or"
"6425","guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies and"
"6426","instrumentalities; (ii) preferred stock; (iii) debt securities"
"6427","that are sold in private placement transactions between their"
"6428","issuers and their purchasers and that are neither listed on an"
"6429","exchange or traded over the counter; and (iv) Yankee bonds,"
"6430","which are U.S.-dollar denominated bonds and notes issued by"
"6431","foreign corporations or governments. The Fund may invest up to"
"6432","20% of its total assets in bonds that are below investment"
"6433","grade, which are commonly referred to as high yield or junk"
"6434","bonds. The Fund may invest up to 10% of its total assets in"
"6435","securities denominated in foreign currencies. The remainder of"
"6436","the Fund's corporate debt securities will typically be"
"6437","denominated in U.S. dollars and be investment grade (i.e., rated"
"6438","at the time of purchase in one of the four highest rating"
"6439","categories by a nationally recognized statistical rating"
"6440","organization, or determined by the portfolio manager to be of"
"6441","comparable quality)."
"6442","In managing the portfolio, the portfolio manager uses a top
down investment management approach focusing on interest rate"
"6443","risk, allocation among sectors, credit risk, and individual"
"6444","securities selection. The portfolio manager focuses on macro"
"6445","trends in the economy to establish a duration target that"
"6446","reflects the outlook for the future direction of interest rates."
"6447","For yield curve management, in addition to the trend in interest"
"6448","rates, other factors such as future inflation expectations,"
"6449","supply factors, and future interest rate expectations are"
"6450","considered. Sector weightings are driven by a combination of the"
"6451","portfolio manager's macro view on interest rates and volatility"
"6452","as well as relative spread analysis. Utilizing fundamental"
"6453","analysis the portfolio manager then selects individual"
"6454","securities consistent with the target by looking for the best"
"6455","relative values within particular sectors. The analysis includes"
"6456","an attempt to understand the structure and embedded features of"
"6457","potential securities. Features that are analyzed include puts,"
"6458","calls, sinking fund requirements, prepayment and extension risk,"
"6459","and individual company financial data for potential corporate"
"6460","holdings. Scenario analysis is the primary tool employed for"
"6461","these assessments.  The Fund's average duration is expected to"
"6462","be between 3 and 7 years."
"6463","The portfolio manager may consider selling a security owned by"
"6464","the Fund to reduce exposure to a particular sector, if the"
"6465","portfolio manager sees a deterioration in the underlying"
"6466","fundamentals of an issuer or if the actions of the issuer"
"6467","violate the investment thesis of owning the security, when the"
"6468","portfolio managers finds other attractive securities that the"
"6469","portfolio manager believes are less expensive and offer"
"6470","relatively greater income or growth potential, and in response"
"6471","to macro level adjustments to duration and yield curve"
"6472","contributions."
"6473","The Fund may invest in certain types of derivative instruments"
"6474","for hedging and investment purposes.  Although the Fund may"
"6475","invest in derivatives of any kind, the Fund currently expects to"
"6476","invest in futures contracts and forward foreign currency"
"6477","contracts to gain efficient investment exposures as an"
"6478","alternative to cash investments or to hedge against portfolio"
"6479","exposures, and credit default swaps and interest rate swaps to"
"6480","gain indirect exposure to interest rates, issuers, or"
"6481","currencies, or to hedge against portfolio exposures."

"6943","their fair value as determined by or pursuant to the direction"
"6944","of the Trustees, which in the case of short-term debt"

"6946","need not, be on the basis of quoted yields for securities of"
"6947","comparable maturity, quality and type, or on the basis of"
"6948","amortized cost.  Expenses and liabilities of the Trust shall be"
"6949","accrued each day.  Liabilities may include such reserves for"
"6950","taxes, estimated accrued expenses and contingencies as the"
"6951","Trustees or their designates may in their sole discretion deem"
"6952","fair and reasonable under the circumstances.  No accruals shall"
"6953","be made in respect of taxes on unrealized appreciation of"
"6954","securities owned unless the Trustees shall otherwise determine."

"6961","vote only (i) for the election of Trustees as provided in"
"6962","Article IV, Section 1 of the Declaration of Trust, provided,"
"6963","however, that no meeting of Shareholders is required to be"
"6964","called for the purpose of electing Trustees unless and until"
"6965","such time as less than a majority of the Trustees have been"
"6966","elected by the Shareholders, (ii) with respect to any Manager or"
"6967","Sub-Adviser as provided in Article IV, Section 6 of the"
"6968","Declaration of Trust to the extent required by the 1940 Act,"
"6969","(iii) with respect to any termination of this Trust to the"
"6970","extent and as provided in Article IX, Section 4 of the"

"6973","IX, Section 7 of the Declaration of Trust, (v) to the same"
"6974","extent as the stockholders of a Massachusetts business"
"6975","corporation as to whether or not a court action, proceeding or"

"6977","or as a class action on behalf of the Trust or the Shareholders,"
"6978","and (vi) with respect to such additional matters relating to the"
"6979","Trust as may be required by law, the Declaration of Trust, these"
"6980","Bylaws or any registration of the Trust with the Commission (or"
"6981","any successor agency) or any state, or as the Trustees may"
"6982","consider necessary or desirable. Each whole Share shall be"
"6983","entitled to one vote as to any matter on which it is entitled to"
"6984","vote and each fractional Share shall be entitled to a"
"6985","proportionate fractional vote.  The Shareholders of any"
"6986","particular series or class shall not be entitled to vote on any"
"6987","matters as to which such series or class is not affected."
"6988","Except with respect to matters as to which the Trustees have"
"6989","determined that only the interests of one or more particular"
"6990","series are affected or as required by law, all of the Shares of"
"6991","each series or class shall, on matters as to which it is"
"6992","entitled to vote, vote with other series so entitled as a single"
"6993","class.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to matters"
"6994","which would otherwise be voted on by two or more series as a"
"6995","single class, the Trustees may, in their sole discretion, submit"
"6996","such matters to the Shareholders of any or all such series,"
"6997","separately.  There shall be no cumulative voting in the election"
"6998","of Trustees.  Shares may be voted in person or by proxy.  A"
"6999","proxy with respect to Shares held in the name of two or more"
"7000","persons shall be valid if executed by any one of them unless at"
"7001","or prior to exercise of the proxy the Trust receives a specific"
"7002","written notice to the contrary from any one of them.  A proxy"
"7003","purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Shareholder shall"
"7004","be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise"
"7005","and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the"
"7006","challenger.  Until Shares are issued, the Trustees may exercise"
"7007","all rights of Shareholders and may take any action required by"
"7008","law, the Declaration of Trust or these Bylaws to be taken by"
"7009","shareholders."
"7010","      11.2  Voting Power and Meetings.  Meetings of the"
"7011","Shareholders may be called by the Trustees for the purpose of"
"7012","electing Trustees as provided in Article IV, Section 1 of the"
"7013","Declaration of Trust and for such other purposes as may be"
"7014","prescribed by law, by the Declaration of Trust or by these"
"7015","Bylaws.  Meetings of the Shareholders may also be called by the"
"7016","Trustees from time to time for the purpose of taking action upon"
"7017","any other matter deemed by the Trustees to be necessary or"
"7018","desirable.  A meeting of Shareholders may be held at any place"
"7019","designated by the Trustees.  Written notice of any meeting of"
"7020","Shareholders shall be given or caused to be given by the"
"7021","Trustees by mailing such notice at least seven days before such"
"7022","meeting, postage prepaid, stating the time and place of the"
"7023","meeting, to each Shareholder at the Shareholder's address as it"
"7024","appears on the records of the Trust.  Whenever notice of a"
"7025","meeting is required to be given to a Shareholder under the"
"7026","Declaration of Trust or these Bylaws, a written waiver thereof,"
"7027","executed before or after the meeting by such Shareholder or his"
"7028","attorney thereunto authorized and filed with the records of the"
"7029","meeting, shall be deemed equivalent to such notice."

"7031","entitled to vote shall be a quorum for the transaction of"
"7032","business at a Shareholders' meeting, except that where any"
"7033","provision of law or of the Declaration of Trust or these Bylaws"
"7034","permits or requires that holders of any series shall vote as a"
"7035","series, then a majority of the aggregate number of Shares of"
"7036","that series entitled to vote shall be necessary to constitute a"
"7037","quorum for the transaction of business by that series.  Any"
"7038","lesser number shall be sufficient for adjournments.  Any"
"7039","adjourned session or sessions may be held, within a reasonable"
"7040","time after the date set for the original meeting, without the"
"7041","necessity of further notice.  Except when a larger vote is"

"7044","questions and a plurality shall elect a Trustee, provided that"
"7045","where any provision of law or of the Declaration of Trust or"

"7049","election of a Trustee) shall decide that matter insofar as that"
"7050","series is concerned."

"7052","shareholders who are entitled to vote or act at any meeting or"
"7053","any adjournment thereof, or who are entitled to receive payment"
"7054","of any dividend or of any other distribution, the Trustees may"
"7055","from time to time fix a time, which shall be not more than 90"
"7056","days before the date of any meeting of shareholders or the date"
"7057","for the payment of any dividend or of any other distribution, as"
"7058","the record date for determining the shareholders having the"
"7059","right to notice of and to vote at such meeting and any"
"7060","adjournment thereof or the right to receive such dividend or"
"7061","distribution, and in such case only shareholders of record on"
"7062","such record date shall have such right notwithstanding any"
"7063","transfer of shares on the books of the Trust after the record"
"7064","date; or without fixing such record date the Trustees may for"
"7065","any of such purposes close the register or transfer books for"
"7066","all or any part of such period."

"7154","with the instructions and directions of the Adviser and of"
"7155","the Board of Trustees of the Trust and will conform to and"
"7156","comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Code,"
"7157","and all other applicable federal and state laws and"
"7158","regulations, as each may be amended from time to time."
"7159","In addition, the Sub-Adviser agrees that with respect to"
"7160","the Assets, the Sub-Adviser shall at all times ensure that"
"7161","its trading of commodity interests, as defined in the"
"7162","Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, satisfies the trading"
"7163","tests set forth in the Commodity Futures Trading"
"7164","Commission Rule 4.5(c)(2)(iii)(A) or (B). The Sub-Adviser"
"7165","shall promptly notify the Adviser if the Sub-Adviser fails"
"7166","to comply with this requirement."
"7167","b.   The Sub-Adviser shall determine the Assets to be"
"7168","purchased, retained or sold by the Fund and what portion"
"7169","of the Assets will be invested or held uninvested in cash."
"7170","The Sub-Adviser will place orders with or through such"
"7171","persons, brokers or dealers to carry out the policy with"
"7172","respect to brokerage set forth in the Trust's registration"
"7173","statement and the Fund's Prospectus or as the Board of"
"7174","Trustees or the Adviser may direct in writing from time to"
"7175","time, in conformity with federal securities laws. In"
"7176","executing portfolio transactions and selecting brokers or"
"7177","dealers, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek"
"7178","on behalf of the Fund best execution. In evaluating best"
"7179","execution for any transaction, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"7180","consider all factors that it deems relevant, including the"
"7181","breadth of the market in the security, the price of the"
"7182","security, the financial condition and execution capability"
"7183","of the broker or dealer, and the reasonableness of the"
"7184","commission, if any, both for the specific transaction and"
"7185","on a continuing basis. In evaluating best execution, and"
"7186","in selecting the broker-dealer to execute a particular"
"7187","transaction, subject to any written instructions and"
"7188","directions of the Adviser or the Board of Trustees, the"
"7189","Sub-Adviser may also consider the brokerage and research"
"7190","services provided (as those terms are defined in Section"
"7191","28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Provided"
"7192","the Sub-Adviser is acting in accordance with any such"
"7193","instructions and directions of the Adviser or the Board of"
"7194","Trustees, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay to a broker"
"7195","or dealer who provides such brokerage and research"
"7196","services a commission for executing a portfolio"
"7197","transaction for the Fund which is in excess of the amount"
"7198","of commission another broker or dealer would have charged"
"7199","for effecting that transaction if, but only if, the Sub-"
"7200","Adviser determines in good faith that such commission was"
"7201","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"7202","research services provided by such broker or dealer -"
"7203","viewed in terms of that particular transaction or in terms"
"7204","of the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the"
"7205","Fund. In no instance, however, will the Fund's Assets"
"7206","knowingly be purchased from or sold to the Adviser, the"
"7207","Sub-Adviser, any other sub-adviser of the Trust or other"
"7208","registered investment companies (or series or portions"
"7209","thereof) that may be deemed to be under common control"
"7210","with the Trust, the Trust's principal underwriter, or any"
"7211","affiliated person of either the Trust, the Adviser, the"
"7212","Sub-Adviser or any other sub-adviser of the Trust or other"
"7213","registered investment companies (or series or portions"
"7214","thereof) that may be deemed to be under common control"
"7215","with the Trust, or the Trust's principal underwriter,"
"7216","acting as principal in the transaction, except to the"
"7217","extent permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"7218","(SEC) and the 1940 Act and approved by the Adviser and"
"7219","the Board of Trustees. The Adviser or its affiliates may,"
"7220","from time to time,  engage other sub-advisers to advise"
"7221","series of the Trust (or portions thereof) or other"
"7222","registered investment companies (or series or portions"
"7223","thereof) that may be deemed to be under common control"
"7224","with the Trust (each a Sub-Advised Fund). The Sub-"
"7225","Adviser agrees that it will not consult with any other"
"7226","sub- adviser engaged by the Adviser or its affiliates with"
"7227","respect to transactions in securities or other assets"
"7228","concerning the Fund or another Sub-Advised Fund, except to"
"7229","the extent permitted by rules under the 1940 Act that"
"7230","permit certain transactions with a sub-adviser or its"
"7231","affiliates."
"7232","On occasions when the Sub-Adviser deems the purchase or"
"7233","sale of a security to be in the best interests of the Fund"
"7234","as well as other clients of the Sub-Adviser, the Sub-"
"7235","Adviser, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and"
"7236","regulations, may, but shall be under no obligation to,"
"7237","aggregate the securities to be sold or purchased in order"
"7238","to obtain the most favorable price or lower brokerage="
"7239","commissions and efficient execution. In such event,"
"7240","allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as"
"7241","the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by"
"7242","the Sub-Adviser in the manner the Sub-Adviser considers to"
"7243","be the most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary"
"7244","obligations to the Fund and to such other clients."
"7245","The Sub-Adviser may buy securities for the Fund at the"
"7246","same time it is selling such securities for another"
"7247","client account and may sell securities for the Fund at"
"7248","the time it is buying such securities for another client"
"7249","account. In such cases, subject to applicable legal and"
"7250","regulatory requirements, and in compliance with such"
"7251","procedures of the Trust as may be in effect from time to"
"7252","time of which the Sub-Adviser is advised in writing, the"
"7253","Sub-Adviser may effectuate cross transactions between the"
"7254","Fund and such other account if it deems this to be"
"7255","advantageous to both of the accounts involved."
"7256","Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sub-Adviser agrees"
"7257","that the Adviser shall have the right by written notice"
"7258","to identify securities that may not be purchased on"
"7259","behalf of the Fund and/or broker-dealers through or with"
"7260","which portfolio transactions on behalf of the Fund may"
"7261","not be effected. The Sub-Adviser shall refrain from"
"7262","purchasing such securities for the Fund or directing any"
"7263","portfolio transaction to any such broker-dealer on behalf"
"7264","of the Fund, unless and until the written approval of the"
"7265","Adviser or the Board of Trustees, as the case may be, is"
"7266","so obtained."
"7267","c.   The Sub-Adviser shall maintain and keep all books and"
"7268","records required to be maintained by registered investment"
"7269","advisers, and shall provide the Fund with all records and"
"7270","other information relating to the Assets as may be needed"
"7271","for the Fund to comply with subparagraphs (b)(5)"
"7272","[brokerage orders] , (6) [non-brokerage portfolio"
"7273","purchases] , (7) [option transactions] , (9) [brokerage"

"7276","materials] and paragraph (f) [books and records required"
"7277","to maintained by registered investment advisers] of Rule 3"
"7278","la-1 under the 1940 Act. The Sub-Adviser shall keep the"
"7279","Adviser informed of developments materially affecting the"
"7280","Fund or the Trust. The Sub-Adviser shall provide to the"
"7281","Adviser or the Board of Trustees such periodic and special"
"7282","reports, financial information, and such other information"
"7283","with regard to its affairs as the Adviser or Board of"
"7284","Trustees may reasonably request."
"7285","The Sub-Adviser shall maintain and keep the books and"

"7289","the Sub-Adviser's services under this Agreement needed by"
"7290","the Adviser to keep the other books and records of the"

"7292","Adviser shall also furnish to the Adviser any other"
"7293","information relating to the Assets that is required to be"
"7294","filed by the Adviser or the Trust with the SEC or sent to"
"7295","shareholders under the 1940 Act (including the rules"
"7296","adopted thereunder) or any exemptive or other relief that"
"7297","the Adviser or the Corporation obtains from the SEC. The"
"7298","Sub-Adviser agrees that all records that it maintains on"
"7299","behalf of the Fund are the property of the Fund and the"
"7300","Sub-Adviser will surrender promptly to the Fund any of"
"7301","such records upon the Fund's request; provided, however,"
"7302","that the Sub-Adviser may retain a copy of such records."
"7303","The Sub-Adviser agrees to permit the Adviser, the Trust's"
"7304","officers and the Fund's independent registered public"
"7305","accounting firm to inspect and audit such records"
"7306","pertaining to the Fund at reasonable times during regular"
"7307","business hours upon due notice. In addition, for the"
"7308","duration of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall preserve"

"7310","Act, and Rule 204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act of"
"7311","1940, as amended (the Advisers Act), any such records as"

"7314","transfer said records to the Adviser. The Sub-Adviser"
"7315","shall maintain and enforce industry standard security"
"7316","procedures with respect to all materials, records,"
"7317","documents and data relating to any of its responsibilities"
"7318","under this Agreement including all means for the effecting"
"7319","of securities transactions."
"7320","d.   The Sub-Adviser will be available to meet (which"
"7321","meetings may be held telephonically at the option of the"
"7322","Adviser) with the officers of the Adviser and the Trust's"
"7323","officers and Trustees on reasonable due notice to review"
"7324","the investments and investment program of the Fund in the"
"7325","light of current and prospective economic and market"
"7326","conditions. In addition, the Sub-Adviser shall, as"
"7327","reasonably requested by the Adviser, for itself and on"
"7328","behalf of the Trust, furnish to the Adviser from time to"
"7329","time such information that the Adviser reasonably believes"

"7551","promptly cooperate with the Trust and the Adviser and"
"7552","their representatives in connection with requests for"
"7553","such records or other documents. In connection with such"
"7554","cooperation as it relates to records relating to trading"

"7562","confidentiality with respect to its clients and"
"7563","employees and nothing in this Agreement shall require"
"7564","the Sub-Adviser to act in violation or contravention"
"7565","thereof."
"7566","6.   Compensation to the Sub-Adviser."
"7567","      a.   For the services to be provided by the Sub-"

"7609","Adviser will not be liable for any loss sustained by reason of"
"7610","a mistake of law or error of judgment by the Sub-Adviser, but"
"7611","nothing herein contained will be construed to protect the Sub-"
"7612","Adviser against any liability to the Adviser, the Fund or its"
"7613","shareholders by reason of: (a) the Sub-Adviser's causing the"
"7614","Fund to be in violation of any applicable federal or state law,"
"7615","rule or regulation or any investment policy or restriction set"
"7616","forth in the Fund's Prospectus or any written guidelines,"

"7626","any investment strategy recommended by the Sub-Adviser."
"7627","8.   Disclosure Regarding the Sub-Adviser."
"7628","      a.   The Sub-Adviser has reviewed the disclosure"
"7629","about the Sub-Adviser contained in the Trust's"
"7630","registration statement, prospectus and supplements thereto"

"7661","annually and in the manner required by the 1940 Act."
"7662","      b.   This Agreement shall automatically terminate in"

"7666","immediately upon notice if the Sub-Adviser becomes"
"7667","statutorily disqualified from performing its duties under"
"7668","this Agreement or otherwise is legally prohibited from"
"7669","operating as an investment adviser."
"7670","      c.   If a party breaches this Agreement in any"
"7671","material respect which is not cured within sixty (60) days"
"7672","of the other party giving it written notice of such"
"7673","breach, the other party may effect termination of this"
"7674","Agreement on written notice to the defaulting party."

"7692","11.   Confidentiality."
"7693","      a.   Each party agrees that it shall hold in strict"
"7694","confidence all data and information obtained from the"
"7695","other party hereto or the Fund (unless such information is"
"7696","or becomes readily ascertainable from public or published"
"7697","information or trade sources other than through a breach"
"7698","of this confidentiality clause) other than in relation to"
"7699","its affiliates and any other party performing functions"
"7700","for the Fund and such party shall ensure that its"
"7701","officers, employees and authorized representatives do not"
"7702","disclose such information to others without the prior"
"7703","written consent of the party from whom it was obtained,"
"7704","unless such disclosure is required by a court with"
"7705","competent jurisdiction, the SEC, other regulatory or"
"7706","official body with applicable jurisdiction, or the Fund's"
"7707","independent registered public accounting firm, or in the"
"7708","opinion of such party's counsel, applicable law, and then"
"7709","only with as much prior written notice to the other party"
"7710","as is practicable under the circumstances."
"7711","      b.   The Adviser, on behalf of the Fund, has"
"7712","legitimate business reasons to disclose to the Sub-Adviser"
"7713","certain non-public portfolio holdings information of the"
"7714","Fund (Holdings Information) from time to time. The Sub-"
"7715","Adviser agrees that it:"
"7716","   i.   Will use the Holdings Information exclusively"
"7717","for the purposes of providing services pursuant to this"
"7718","Agreement that may benefit the Fund;"
"7719","   ii.   Will not engage in any fraudulent, competitive"
"7720","or improper behavior based on the Holdings Information"
"7721","that may disadvantage the Fund, including disclosing,"
"7722","trading or making investment recommendations based on"
"7723","the Holdings Information to or for any party other than"
"7724","the Fund as provided in this Agreement;"
"7725","   iii.   Will treat the Holdings Information as"
"7726","confidential and will not disclose such information to"
"7727","any party other than as required to perform the services"
"7728","under this Agreement. This clause shall not apply to the"
"7729","extent that: (1) the Holdings Information is publicly"
"7730","known, (2) the Holdings Information is or becomes"
"7731","legally known to the Sub-Adviser other than through"
"7732","disclosure by the Fund, the Adviser, an affiliated"
"7733","person of the Fund or the Adviser or by another party"
"7734","bound by an obligation of confidentiality to the Fund,"
"7735","or (3) the disclosure is required by law or requested by"
"7736","any regulatory authority or required by statute, rule,"
"7737","regulation, subpoena, regulatory examination request or"
"7738","court order, provided, however, that the Sub-Adviser"
"7739","will not make any such disclosure without first"
"7740","notifying the Adviser and the Fund and allowing the"
"7741","Adviser or the Fund a reasonable opportunity to seek"
"7742","injunctive relief (or a protective order) with respect"
"7743","to the obligation to make such disclosure; and"
"7744","   iv.   Will notify the Adviser if the Sub-Adviser has"
"7745","any knowledge of the Holdings Information having been"
"7746","misused, including in violation of this Agreement."
"7747","12.   Non-Exclusivity. The services of the Sub-Adviser to the"
"7748","Fund are not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Sub-Adviser"
"7749","and its affiliates shall be free to render investment advisory"
"7750","or other services to others (including other investment"
"7751","companies) and to engage in other activities, so long as its"
"7752","services under this Agreement are not impaired thereby. Adviser"
"7753","acknowledges that Sub-Adviser or its affiliates may give advice"
"7754","and take actions in the performance of its duties to clients"
"7755","which differ from the advice, or the timing and nature of"

"7757","(including the Assets). In addition, advice provided by the"
"7758","Sub-Adviser may differ from advice given by its affiliates."
"7759","13.   Use of Names."
"7760","      a.   The Sub-Adviser acknowledges and agrees that the name"
"7761","Sterling Capital (whether used by itself or in combination with"
"7762","other words), and abbreviations or logos associated with that"
"7763","name, are the valuable property of the Adviser and its"
"7764","affiliates; that the Trust, the Adviser and their affiliates"
"7765","have the right to use such name, abbreviations and logos; and"
"7766","that the Sub-Adviser shall use the name Sterling Capital, and"
"7767","associated abbreviations and logos, only in connection with the"
"7768","Sub-Adviser's performance of its duties hereunder. Further, in"

"7770","communications of any sort, the Sub-Adviser agrees to obtain"
"7771","prior written approval from the Adviser before using or"
"7772","referring to Sterling Capital, the Fund or the Trust name, or"
"7773","any abbreviations or logos associated with those names;"
"7774","provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the"
"7775","Sub-Adviser from referring to the performance of the Fund in"
"7776","the Sub-Adviser's marketing material as long as such marketing"
"7777","material does not constitute sales literature or"
"7778","advertising for the Fund, as those terms are used in the"
"7779","rules, regulations and guidelines of the SEC and the Financial"
"7780","Industry Regulatory Authority. The Adviser, for itself and on"
"7781","behalf of the Trust, acknowledges and agrees that the names"
"7782","Emancipation Capital, and all related names, marks, and trade"
"7783","dress (collectively, the Sub-Adviser Marks), and"
"7784","abbreviations or logos associated with such names, are the"
"7785","valuable property of the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates; that"
"7786","the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates have the right to use such"
"7787","name, abbreviations and logos; and that the Adviser and Trust"
"7788","shall use the Sub-Adviser Marks, and associated abbreviations"
"7789","and logos, only in connection with the conduct of the business"
"7790","of the Fund for so long as this Agreement is in effect and not"
"7791","thereafter. The Adviser and the Trust shall not modify the Sub-"
"7792","Adviser Marks."
"7793","14.   Indemnification."
"7794","      a.   The Sub-Adviser agrees to indemnify and hold"
"7795","harmless the Adviser and the Trust against any losses,"
"7796","expenses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or"
"7797","proceedings in respect thereof) to which the Adviser or"
"7798","the Trust may become subject arising out of or based on"
"7799","the breach by the Sub-Adviser of any provisions of this"
"7800","Agreement or any breach by the Sub-Adviser of the standard"
"7801","of care, as set out in Section 8 of the Agreement;"
"7802","provided, however, that the Sub-Adviser shall not be"
"7803","liable under this Section 15(a) in respect of any loss,"
"7804","expense, claim, damage or liability to the extent that a"
"7805","court having jurisdiction shall have determined by a final"
"7806","judgment, or independent counsel agreed upon by the Sub-"
"7807","Adviser and the Adviser or the Trust, as the case may be,"
"7808","shall have concluded in a written opinion, that such loss,"
"7809","expense, claim, damage or liability resulted primarily"
"7810","from the Adviser's or the Trust's willful misfeasance, bad"
"7811","faith or gross negligence or by reason of the reckless"
"7812","disregard by the Adviser or the Trust of its duties. The"
"7813","foregoing indemnification shall be in addition to any"
"7814","rights that the Adviser or the Trust may have at common"
"7815","law or otherwise. The Sub-Adviser's agreements in this"
"7816","Section 15(a) shall, upon the same terms and conditions,"
"7817","extend to and inure to the benefit of each person who may"
"7818","be deemed to control the Adviser or the Trust, be"
"7819","controlled by the Adviser or the Trust, or be under common"
"7820","control with the Adviser or the Trust and their"
"7821","affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents. The"
"7822","Sub-Adviser's agreement in this Section 15(a) shall also"
"7823","extend to any of the Trust's, Fund's, and Adviser's"
"7824","successors or the successors of the aforementioned"
"7825","affiliates, trustees/directors, officers, employees or"
"7826","agents."
"7827","      b.   The Adviser agrees to indemnify and hold"
"7828","harmless the Sub-Adviser against any losses, expenses,"
"7829","claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings"
"7830","in respect thereof) to which the Sub-Adviser may become"
"7831","subject arising out of or based on the breach by the"
"7832","Adviser of any provisions of this Agreement or the"
"7833","Advisory Agreement, or any wrongful action by the Adviser"
"7834","or its affiliates in the distribution of the Trust's"
"7835","shares, or any wrongful action by the Trust other than"
"7836","wrongful action that was caused by the breach by the Sub-"
"7837","Adviser of the provisions of this Agreement; provided,"
"7838","however, that the Adviser shall not be liable under this"
"7839","Section 15(b) in respect of any loss, expense, claim,"
"7840","damage or liability to the extent that a court having"
"7841","jurisdiction shall have determined by a final judgment, or"
"7842","independent counsel agreed upon by the Adviser and the"
"7843","Sub-Adviser shall have concluded in a written opinion,"
"7844","that such loss, expense, claim, damage or liability"
"7845","resulted primarily from the Sub-Adviser's Disqualifying"
"7846","Conduct. The foregoing indemnification shall be in"
"7847","addition to any rights that the Sub-Adviser may have at"
"7848","common law or otherwise. The Adviser's agreements in this"
"7849","Section 15(b) shall, upon the same terms and conditions,"
"7850","extend to and inure to the benefit of each person who may"
"7851","be deemed to control the Sub-Adviser, be controlled by the"
"7852","Sub-Adviser or be under common control with the Sub-"
"7853","Adviser and to each of the Sub-Adviser's and each such"
"7854","person's respective affiliates, trustees/directors,"
"7855","officers, employees and agents. The Adviser's agreements"
"7856","in this Section 15(b) shall also extend to any of the Sub-"
"7857","Adviser's successors or the successors of the"
"7858","aforementioned affiliates, trustees/directors, officers,"
"7859","employees or agents."
"7860","      c.   Promptly after receipt by a party indemnified"

"7862","of any action, proceeding, or investigation for which"
"7863","indemnification will be sought (a Proceeding), such"
"7864","indemnified party shall promptly notify the indemnifying"
"7865","party in writing; but the omission so to notify the"
"7866","indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability"
"7867","which it may otherwise have to any indemnified party"
"7868","unless such omission results in actual material prejudice"
"7869","to the indemnifying party. In case any Proceeding shall be"
"7870","brought against any indemnified party, and it shall notify"
"7871","the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the"
"7872","indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in"
"7873","and, individually or jointly with any other indemnifying"
"7874","party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel"
"7875","reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After"
"7876","notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified"
"7877","party of its election to assume the defense of any"
"7878","Proceeding, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to"
"7879","the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses"
"7880","subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in"
"7881","connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable"
"7882","costs of investigation. Notwithstanding the indemnifying"
"7883","party's election to appoint counsel to represent the"
"7884","indemnified party in any Proceeding, the indemnified party"
"7885","shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including"
"7886","local counsel) and the indemnifying party shall bear the"
"7887","reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate"
"7888","counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the"
"7889","indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party"
"7890","would present such counsel with a conflict of interest,"
"7891","(ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or target of,"
"7892","any such Proceeding include both the indemnified party and"
"7893","the indemnifying party and the indemnifying party and the"
"7894","indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that"
"7895","there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other"
"7896","indemnified parties which are different from or additional"
"7897","to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the"
"7898","indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel"
"7899","reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party within a"
"7900","reasonable time after notice of the institution of such"
"7901","Proceeding or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize"
"7902","the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the"
"7903","expense of the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying"
"7904","party does not elect to assume the defense of any action"
"7905","or proceeding, the indemnifying party on a monthly basis"
"7906","shall reimburse the indemnified party for the reasonable"
"7907","legal fees and other costs of defense thereof. Regardless"
"7908","of whether or not the indemnifying party shall have"
"7909","assumed the defense of any Proceeding, the indemnified"
"7910","party shall not settle or compromise the Proceeding"
"7911","without the prior written consent of the indemnifying"
"7912","party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and the"
"7913","indemnifying party shall not settle or compromise any"
"7914","Proceeding without the prior written consent of the"
"7915","indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably"
"7916","withheld."
"7917","15.   Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the"
"7918","internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without"
"7919","regard to conflict of law principles; provided, however, that"
