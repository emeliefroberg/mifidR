"1895","Federal Court Market Timing Litigation:"
"1896","A number of private lawsuits have been filed including"
"1897","purported class and derivative lawsuits, making various"
"1898","allegations and naming as defendants various persons,"
"1899","including certain Scudder and Deutsche (now DWS) funds"
"1900","(singularly, a Fund and collectively, the Funds), the Funds'"
"1901","investment advisors and their affiliates, certain individuals"

"1906","filed making allegations similar to these lawsuits regarding"
"1907","market timing, revenue sharing, fund valuation or other"

"1923","(DIMA) and Deutsche Asset Management, Inc. as well as"
"1924","approximately 85 Funds in the Scudder and Deutsche family of"

"1930","Management Americas Inc., Deutsche Asset Management,"
"1931","Inc., and John Doe defendants."

"1939","action pursuant to a tolling agreement with Plaintiffs."
"1940","Deutsche Bank AG has been dismissed from the derivative"
"1941","action.  On March 16, 2007, the Court issued an opinion in the"
"1942","MDL granting in part and denying in part the Deutsche"
"1943","Defendants' motion to dismiss the Second Consolidated"
"1944","Amended Class Action Complaint."
"1945","Plaintiffs filed a Third Consolidated Amended Class Action"
"1946","Complaint (Third Amended Complaint) on December 10,"
"1947","2007 in the MDL.  In the Third Amended Complaint, the"
"1948","Plaintiffs added the names of Funds that they allegedly"
"1949","purchased or held during the class period.  In addition, as"
"1950","contemplated in the Court's scheduling order, the Third"
"1951","Amended Complaint added a new Plaintiff in an attempt to"
"1952","address standing challenges raised by the Defendants.  On"
"1953","January 16, 2008, the Court granted in part and denied in part"
"1954","the Defendants' motion to dismiss certain claims on standing"
"1955","grounds.  The parties conducted extensive discovery.  The"
"1956","Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment and various"
"1957","related motions, and Class Plaintiffs contemporaneously filed a"
"1958","motion for class certification. The Court heard oral argument"
"1959","on these motions on December 10-11, 2008."
"1960","On February 12, 2010, the parties agreed to a stipulation and"
"1961","agreement of settlement, which is subject to approval by the"
"1962","Court.  Plaintiffs filed their motions for preliminary approval of"
"1963","the settlement with the Court on April 21, 2010.  The Court"
"1964","conducted a hearing on May 7, 2010 on those motions and"
"1965","granted preliminary approval of the settlements on May 19,"
"1966","2010.  The Court has set the hearing for final settlement"
"1967","approval for October 21-22, 2010."
"1968","State Court Market Timing Litigation:"
"1969","On September 16, 2003, an action was commenced in the"
"1970","Circuit Court for Madison County, Illinois, entitled Potter v."
"1971","Janus Investment Fund, et al.  Defendants include, among"
"1972","others, DIMA and the Scudder International Fund. On October"
"1973","23, 2003, Defendants removed the action to the United States"
"1974","District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. On February"
"1975","9, 2004 the District Court remanded the case back to the"
"1976","Circuit Court for Madison County.  Defendants appealed this"
"1977","decision.  On April 5, 2005 the Seventh Circuit Court of"
"1978","Appeals reversed the District Court's decision and instructed"
"1979","the District Court to undo the remand order and dismiss the"
"1980","complaint.  On May 27, 2005, the District Court, in accord"
"1981","with the Seventh Circuit's mandate, dismissed the action with"
"1982","prejudice.  On September 29, 2005, Plaintiffs filed a petition"
"1983","for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United"
"1984","States.  On January 6, 2006, the Supreme Court granted the"
"1985","petition to address jurisdictional questions.  On June 15, 2006,"
"1986","the Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Seventh Circuit"
"1987","and held that the Court of Appeals did not have jurisdiction to"
"1988","address the District Court's remand order.  The case was"
"1989","remanded to and reopened in the Circuit Court for Madison"
"1990","County.  On November 13, 2006, Defendants removed the case"
"1991","to Federal District Court for a second time.  On April 6, 2007,"
"1992","the District Court remanded the case back to the Circuit Court"
"1993","for Madison County.  Defendants appealed this decision to the"
"1994","Seventh Circuit, which dismissed the appeal for lack of"
"1995","jurisdiction on July 13, 2007.  The case is now back in the"
"1996","Circuit Court for Madison County.  Argument on Defendants'"
"1997","motion to dismiss occurred in August 2007, and the parties are"
"1998","awaiting the Circuit Court's decision.  The Circuit Court issued"
"1999","an Order dated July 16, 2008 stating that the issues raised by"
"2000","the motion to dismiss are nearly identical to those in a pending"
"2001","appeal in an action involving the Putnam funds, and that the"
"2002","Court would therefore wait for the decision of the Illinois"
"2003","Appellate Court in that case before ruling on the motion to"
"2004","dismiss."
"2005","On January 6, 2010, the Illinois Appellate Court ruled in favor"
"2006","of the Putnam fund defendants and against Plaintiffs in that"
"2007","action, holding that Plaintiffs' claims are precluded by the"
"2008","Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act.  Plaintiffs filed a"
"2009","motion for rehearing in the Illinois Appellate Court, which was"
"2010","denied on February 16, 2010.  The Illinois Appellate Court"
"2011","issued its mandate on March 30, 2010, and on April 5, 2010,"
"2012","the Circuit Court dismissed the Putnam action with prejudice."
"2013","On April 15, 2010, Defendants in the Scudder action filed a"
"2014","supplemental memorandum in support of their pending motion"
"2015","to dismiss.  On April 15, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a motion in the"
"2016","Putnam case to modify the order dismissing that action and for"
"2017","leave to file an amended complaint.  On April 20, 2010,"
"2018","Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a Second Amended"
"2019","Complaint in the Scudder action, which Defendants opposed."
"2020","On July 22, 2010, the Court denied Plaintiffs' motion but"
"2021","granted leave for Plaintiffs to file an amended complaint within"
"2022","twenty-one days that does not include any class-action-based"
"2023","allegations or prayers for relief.  Subsequently, Plaintiffs filed a"
"2024","motion for reconsideration of the Court's July 22, 2010 Order"
"2025","or, in the alternative, for certification of an interlocutory"
"2026","appeal.  Defendants filed their opposition to that motion on"
"2027","August 25, 2010.  The Court has set a hearing on this motion"
"2028","for September 28, 2010."

"2051","Item 77D - DWS Enhanced Commodity Strategy Fund"
"2052","(formerly DWS Commodity Securities Fund) (a series"
"2053","of DWS Institutional Funds)"
"2054","In January 2010, the Board of Trustees (the Board)"
"2055","of DWS Enhanced Commodity Strategy Fund (the Fund)"
"2056","approved a change in the Fund's investment strategy,"
"2057","from a blended approach involving investments in"
"2058","companies in commodities-related industries and direct"
"2059","commodity investments, to an actively-managed direct"
"2060","commodity strategy. In connection with implementation"
"2061","of the Fund's new strategy, the Fund's investment"
"2062","objective was changed to total return and the Fund's"
"2063","name changed to DWS Enhanced Commodity Strategy Fund."
"2064","In connection with the strategy change, the Fund's"
"2065","revised investment objective and investment policies"
"2066","are as described in detail below. The change to the"
"2067","Fund's name became effective on March 31, 2010 and"
"2068","all other changes became effective on April 1, 2010."
"2069","The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective"
"2070","by investing under normal circumstances in"
"2071","commodity-linked derivative instruments backed by a"
"2072","portfolio of fixed income instruments. The Fund invests"
"2073","in commodity-linked derivative instruments such as"
"2074","commodity-linked swaps, structured notes and futures"
"2075","contracts that are designed to provide exposure to the"
"2076","investment return of assets that trade in the commodity"
"2077","markets, without investing directly in physical"
"2078","commodities."
"2079","The Fund may gain exposure to the commodity markets"
"2080","by investing a portion of its assets in a wholly-owned"
"2081","subsidiary (the Subsidiary) which shares the same"
"2082","portfolio management team as the Fund and is expected"
"2083","to invest mainly in commodity-linked derivative"
"2084","instruments and fixed income instruments some of"
"2085","which may serve as margin or collateral for the"
"2086","Subsidiary's derivatives positions."
"2087","The Fund invests in fixed income securities,"
"2088","including inflation-indexed securities, of varying"
"2089","maturities issued by the US government, non-US"
"2090","governments, their agencies or instrumentalities, and"
"2091","US and non-US corporations and derivatives related to"
"2092","each of these types of securities. The Fund may invest"
"2093","in mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities,"
"2094","adjustable rate loans that have a senior right to"
"2095","payment and other floating rate debt  securities,"
"2096","taxable municipal bonds and tax-exempt municipal bonds."
"2097","The Fund may invest up to 10% of its total assets"
"2098","in below investment grade bonds (also referred to as"
"2099","junk bonds)."
"2100","Portfolio management generally will allocate the"
"2101","Fund's commodity-linked investments among a variety"
"2102","of different commodity sectors. Portfolio management"
"2103","will use a proprietary quantitative, rules-based"
"2104","methodology in determining the Fund's commodity sector"
"2105","weightings relative to the Fund's benchmark index, the"
"2106","Dow Jones UBS Commodity Index (the DJ-USBC Index)."
"2107","Portfolio management normally will rebalance commodity"
"2108","sector positions when a sectorundergoes a trigger event,"
"2109","reducing the Fund's exposure to commodity sectors that"
"2110","are expensive and increasing its exposure to sectors"
"2111","that are cheap. Portfolio management may reduce the"
"2112","Fund's exposure to all commodity sectors when"
"2113","commodities in general appear overvalued."
"2114","Defensive Position. When in the Advisor's opinion it"
"2115","is advisable to adopt a temporary defensive position"
"2116","because of unusual and adverse or other market"
"2117","conditions, up to 100% of the Fund's assets may be held"
"2118","in cash or invested in money market securities or"
"2119","other short-term investments. Short-term investments"
"2120","consist of (1) foreign and domestic obligations of"
"2121","sovereign governments and their agencies and"
"2122","instrumentalities, authorities and political subdivisions;"
"2123","(2) other short-term high quality rated debt securities"
"2124","or, if unrated, determined to be of comparable quality"
"2125","in the opinion of the Advisor; (3) commercial paper;"
"2126","(4) bank obligations, including negotiable certificates"
"2127","of deposit, time deposits and bankers' acceptances; and"
"2128","(5) repurchase agreements. Short-term investments may"
"2129","also include shares of money market mutual funds."
"2130","This could prevent losses, but, while engaged in a"
"2131","temporary defensive position, the Fund will not be"
"2132","pursuing its investment objective. However, portfolio"
"2133","management may choose not to use these strategies for"
"2134","various reasons, even in volatile market conditions."
"2135","In connection with the implementation of the Fund's"
"2136","strategy changes, certain non-fundamental investment"
"2137","policies were eliminated, as explained below."
"2138","The Fund will no longer be bound by any policies to"
"2139","invest any minimum amount in equity securities,"
"2140","including its former policy to invest, under normal"
"2141","market conditions, substantially all but not less than"
"2142","80% of its net assets, plus any borrowings for"
"2143","investment purposes, in equity and other securities"
"2144","of companies in commodity-related industries or other"
"2145","investments where the value of the investment is"
"2146","linked to changes in commodity prices or a"
"2147","commodity-related index, such as commodity-linked"
"2148","structured notes and future contracts."
"2149","The Fund is no longer subject to any policies to"
"2150","invest any minimum or maximum amount in derivative"
"2151","instruments linked to the performance of"
"2152","commodity-related indexes."
"2153","The Fund eliminated its policies to invest in"
"2154","securities of companies domiciled primarily in"
"2155","developed countries and to invest no more that 30%"
"2156","of its net assets in securities of companies"
"2157","domiciled in emerging-markets countries."
"2158","The percentage limits on the Fund's investments"
"2159","in preferred securities of companies in"
"2160","commodities-related industries and preferred stock"
"2161","rated below investment grade were eliminated."
"2162","The percentage limits on the Fund's investments"
"2163","in certain hybrid instruments (i.e.,"
"2164","commodity-linked derivative investments that"
"2165","are hybrid instruments excluded from regulation under"
"2166","the Commodity Exchange Act and the rules thereunder)"
"2167","were eliminated."
"2168","The Fund is no longer subject to restrictions on"
"2169","the purpose for which it may enter into derivatives"
"2170","(e.g., solely for hedging purposes)."
"2171","The percentage limits on the Fund's investments in"
"2172","structured notes were eliminated."
"2173","The restrictions on the leverage of the Fund's"
"2174","investments relative to an index were eliminated."

"2195","by new investors or existing shareholders, including"
"2196","purchases under an automatic investment plan. The"
"2197","Effective Date is subject to change."
"2198","The closing of the Class B shares will not affect:"
"2199","(a) the right of shareholders of Class B shares to"
"2200","continue to sell (redeem) their shares as provided"
"2201","in the prospectus, subject to any applicable"
"2202","contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC); or (b)"

"2206","shares with all Class B attributes, including Rule"
"2207","12b-1 fees, until sold or until their automatic"
"2208","conversion to Class A shares."
"2209","Class A and Class C shares will continue to be offered"
"2210","as provided in the Fund prospectus. Investors should note"
"2211","the differences among the classes as described in the"

"2216","plans (AIPs) established on or prior to December 1,"

"2218","Such shareholders will then be permitted to purchase"
"2219","Class A shares at net asset value, without a sales charge,"
"2220","whether as part of their AIP or otherwise. The foregoing"
"2221","applies only to purchases under (i) AIPs established"

"2227","credit union (non-DWS AIP). Shareholders with a non-DWS"
"2228","AIP should contact DWS Investments prior to the Effective"

"2230","For any AIP established after December 1, 2009, this"
