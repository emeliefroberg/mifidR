"1812","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1813","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1814","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1815","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"

"1826","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"1827","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1828","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal"
"1829","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1830","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"1831","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
