"4505","Virginia Municipal Bond Fund and MFS Municipal Income Fund (each a series of MFS"
"4506","Municipal Series Trust) (the Funds) as of and for the year ended March 31,"
"4507","2014, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"4508","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"4509","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"4510","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinions"
"4511","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"4512","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"4513","Funds' internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no"
"4514","such opinion."
"4515","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"4516","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"4517","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"4518","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"4519","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"4520","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"4521","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"4522","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"4523","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"4524","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"4525","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"4526","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"4527","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"4528","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"4529","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and"
"4530","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"4531","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"4532","a material effect on the financial statements."
"4533","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"4534","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"4535","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"4536","inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance"
"4537","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"4538","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"4539","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"4540","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"4541","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"4542","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"4543","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"4544","funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"4545","on a timely basis."
"4546","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"4547","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"4548","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"4549","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"4550","Oversight Board (placecountry-regionUnited States).  However, we noted no"
"4551","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and their"
"4552","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"4553","be a material weakness, as defined above, as of March 31, 2014."
"4554","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"

"4628","        SECTION 1. MEETINGS. Meetings of the  Shareholders  may be called at any"
"4629","time by a majority of the Trustees. Meetings of the Shareholders for the purpose"
"4630","of considering the removal of a person serving as Trustee shall be called by the"
"4631","Trustees  if they are requested in writing to do so by Shareholders  holding  in"
"4632","the aggregate  Shares representing not less than ten percent (10%) of the voting"
"4633","power of the outstanding  Shares  of  the  Trust  having voting rights. Any such"

"4636","        SECTION  2.  NOTICE OF MEETINGS. Notice of all meetings of Shareholders,"
"4637","stating the time, place  and  purposes  of  the  meeting,  shall be given by the"
"4638","Trustees in accordance with the Declaration, mailed or sent  at  least  (ten) 10"
"4639","days  and  not  more than ninety (90) days before the meeting. Only the business"
"4640","stated in the notice  of  the  meeting  shall be considered at such meeting. Any"
"4641","adjourned meeting may be held as adjourned  without  further notice, even if the"
"4642","date  of such adjourned meeting is more than 90 days after  the  notice  of  the"
"4643","meeting  was  mailed  or  sent.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if either the"
"4644","President  or  Clerk  of the Trust, or in the absence or unavailability  of  the"
"4645","President and the Clerk,  any  officer of the Trust, determines that as a result"
"4646","of force majeure or an act of God or war, the date, time or place designated for"
"4647","a meeting or adjourned meeting of  Shareholders is not reasonably practicable or"
"4648","available, such officer may, without  further  notice to Shareholders, designate"
"4649","such other date, time or place for such meeting  or  adjourned  meeting  as such"
"4650","officer shall, in his or her sole discretion, determine. No notice need be given"
"4651","to  any  Shareholder  who  shall  have failed to inform the Trust of his current"
"4652","address or if a written waiver of notice,  executed  before or after the meeting"
"4653","by  the  Shareholder or his attorney thereunto authorized,  is  filed  with  the"
"4654","records of the meeting."
"4655","      SECTION  3.  RECORD  DATE FOR MEETINGS. For the purpose of determining the"
"4656","Shareholders who are entitled  to  notice  of  and to vote at any meeting, or to"
"4657","participate in any distribution, or for the purpose  of  any  other  action, the"
"4658","Trustees  may  from  time to time close the transfer books for such period,  not"
"4659","exceeding thirty (30)  days,  as  the Trustees may determine; or without closing"
"4660","the transfer books the Trustees may  fix  a  date not more than ninety (90) days"
"4661","prior to the date of any meeting of Shareholders or distribution or other action"
"4662","as  a  record  date  for  the determination of the  persons  to  be  treated  as"
"4663","Shareholders of record for  such  purpose. The Trustees also may select the time"
"4664","of  day  as  of which the calculations  for  determining  how  many  votes  each"
"4665","Shareholder is entitled to pursuant to the Declaration shall be performed."
"4666","      SECTION  4.  PROXIES. At any meeting of Shareholders, any holder of Shares"
"4667","entitled to vote thereat  may  vote  by  proxy,  provided that no proxy shall be"
"4668","voted at any meeting unless it shall have been placed on file with the Clerk, or"
"4669","with  such  other officer or agent of the Trust as the  Clerk  may  direct,  for"
"4670","verification  prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken. Pursuant to a"
"4671","vote of a majority  of the Trustees, proxies may be solicited in the name of one"
"4672","or more Trustees or one  or more of the officers of the Trust. When any Share is"
"4673","held jointly by several persons,  any  one  of  them  may vote at any meeting in"
"4674","person  or  by proxy in respect of such Share (and a proxy  shall  be  valid  if"
"4675","executed by any  one  of them), but if more than one of them shall be present at"
"4676","such meeting in person  or  by  proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so"
"4677","present disagree as to any vote to  be  cast, such vote shall not be received in"
"4678","respect of such Share. A proxy purporting  to  be  executed by or on behalf of a"
"4679","Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise,"
"4680","and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the  challenger.  The placing"
"4681","of  a  Shareholder's  name  on  a proxy pursuant to telephonic or electronically"
"4682","transmitted instructions obtained  pursuant to procedures reasonably designed to"
"4683","verify that such instructions have been  authorized  by  such  Shareholder shall"
"4684","constitute execution of such proxy by or on behalf of such Shareholder.  If  the"
"4685","holder  of any such Share is a minor or a person of unsound mind, and subject to"

"4979","to as treasury  shares),  may  not  be sold at a price less than the net asset"

"4999","such   series   or  class  outstanding,  in  each  case  at  the  time  of  such"
"5000","determination, all  as determine by or under the direction of the Trustees. Such"
"5001","value shall be determined  on  such  days  and  at such time as the Trustees may"
"5002","determine. Such determination shall be made with respect to securities for which"
"5003","market quotations are readily available, at the market value of such securities;"
"5004","and with respect to other securities and assets, at the fair value as determined"
"5005","in good faith by or pursuant to the direction of  the  Trustees  or  a Committee"
"5006","thereof, provided, however, that the Trustees, without shareholder approval, may"
"5007","alter  the method of appraising portfolio securities insofar as permitted  under"

"5009","delegate any powers and duties under this  Article  XI with respect to appraisal"
"5010","of  assets and liabilities. At any time the Trustees may  cause  the  value  per"
"5011","share last determined to be determined again in a similar manner and may fix the"
"5012","time when such predetermined value shall become effective. Determinations of net"
"5013","asset  value  made  by  the  Trustees  or their delegates in good faith shall be"

"5019","year, subject to the exceptions noted below, shall, when and as declared by  the"
"5020","Trustees, be approximately equal to the sum of:"

"5026","                  included as such accrued net income in the price of Shares  of"

"5032","                  fiscal year; and"
"5033","(ii)        in the discretion  of the Trustees, an additional amount which shall"

"5035","                  sales of securities  or  other property allocated or belonging"
"5036","                  to such series or class for such fiscal year; and"

"5039","The decision of the Trustees as to what, in  accordance  with generally accepted"
"5040","accounting  principles,  is  income and what is principal shall  be  final,  and"
"5041","except as specifically provided  herein  the decision of the Trustees as to what"
"5042","expenses and charges of the Trust shall be  charged  against  principal and what"
"5043","against income shall be final, all subject to any applicable provisions  of  the"
"5044","1940  Act.  For the purposes of the limitation imposed by this Section 1, Shares"

"5046","of cash which the Shareholders  would  have  received  if  they  had  elected to"
"5047","receive cash in lieu of such Shares."
"5048","      Inasmuch as the computation of net income and gains for federal income tax"
"5049","purposes  may  vary from the computation thereof on the books of the Trust,  the"
"5050","above provisions shall be interpreted to give to the Trustees the power in their"
"5051","discretion to distribute  for  any  fiscal  year  as  ordinary  dividends and as"
"5052","capital  gains  distributions,  respectively,  additional amounts sufficient  to"
"5053","enable the Trust to avoid or reduce liability for  taxes.  Any  payment  made to"
"5054","Shareholders pursuant to clause (ii) and/or clause (iii) of this Section 1 shall"
"5055","be  accompanied  by  a  written  statement showing the source or sources of such"
"5056","payment, and the basis of computation thereof."
"5057","      SECTION 2. DISTRIBUTIONS PAYABLE  IN  CASH  OR  SHARES. The Trustees shall"
"5058","have power, to the fullest extent permitted by the laws  of  The Commonwealth of"
"5059","Massachusetts but subject to the limitation as to cash distributions  imposed by"
"5060","Section  1 of this Article XII, at any time or from time to time to declare  and"

"5062","series or  class  (whether  exercised  before  or  after  the declaration of the"
"5063","distribution) either in cash or in Shares of such series, provided  that the sum"
"5064","of:"
"5065","            (i)   the cash distribution actually paid to any Shareholder, and"
"5066","            (ii)  the  net  asset  value  of  the  Shares which that Shareholder"
"5067","                  elects to receive, in effect at such  time  at  or  after  the"
"5068","                  election  as  the  Trustees  may specify, shall not exceed the"
"5069","                  full  amount  of  cash  to  which that  Shareholder  would  be"
"5070","                  entitled if he elected to receive only cash."
"5071","In the case of a distribution payable in cash or  Shares  at  the  election of a"
"5072","Shareholder,  the  Trustees  may  prescribe  whether  a Shareholder, failing  to"
"5073","express his election before a given time shall be deemed to have elected to take"
"5074","Shares rather than cash, or to take cash rather then Shares,  or  to take Shares"
"5075","with cash adjustment of fractions."
"5076","      The  Trustees,  in  their sole discretion, may cause the Trust to  require"
"5077","that all distributions payable to a shareholder in amounts less than such amount"
"5078","or amounts determined from  time  to  time  by  the  Trustees  be  reinvested in"
"5079","additional  shares  of  the Trust rather than paid in cash, unless a shareholder"
"5080","who, after notification that  his distributions will be reinvested in additional"
"5081","shares  in  accordance  with  the  preceding  phrase,  elects  to  receive  such"
"5082","distributions in cash. Where a shareholder  has elected to receive distributions"
"5083","in cash and the postal or other delivery service  is unable to deliver checks to"
"5084","the shareholder's address of record, the Trustees, in their sole discretion, may"
"5085","cause  the  Trust  to  require that such Shareholder's  distribution  option  be"
"5086","converted to having all distributions reinvested in additional shares."
"5087","      SECTION 3. STOCK DIVIDENDS.  Anything  in  these  By-Laws  to the contrary"
"5088","notwithstanding,  the Trustees may at any time declare and distribute  pro  rata"
