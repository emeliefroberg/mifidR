"1102","Columbia Real Estate Equity Fund"
"1103","(the Fund)"
"1104","77B Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1105","To the Trustees and Shareholders of Columbia Funds Series Trust I:"
"1106","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"1107","of Columbia Real Estate Fund (a series of Columbia Funds Series"
"1108","Trust I and hereafter referred to as the Fund) as of and for the"
"1109","period ended December 31, 2009, in accordance with the standards of"
"1110","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1111","considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"1112","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1113","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1114","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1115","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"1116","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"1117","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"1118","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1119","reporting."
"1120","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1121","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"1122","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"1123","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1124","controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1125","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1126","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1127","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1128","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"1129","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"1130","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1131","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"1132","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"1133","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1134","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"1135","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance"
"1136","with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3)"
"1137","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"1138","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that"
"1139","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1140","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1141","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"1142","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1143","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1144","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1145","procedures may deteriorate."
"1146","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1147","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1148","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"1149","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"1150","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1151","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1152","possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's annual or"
"1153","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"1154","timely basis."
"1155","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1156","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"1157","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"1158","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"1159","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1160","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"1161","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"1162","controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material"
"1163","weaknesses as defined above as of December 31, 2009."

"1170","Item 77E - Legal Proceedings:"
"1171","Columbia Atlantic Funds"
"1172","As of February 2010"
"1173","Columbia Management Advisors, LLC and Columbia Management"
"1174","Distributors, Inc. (collectively, the Columbia Group) are"
"1175","subject to a settlement agreement with the New York Attorney"
"1176","General (NYAG) (the NYAG Settlement) and a settlement order"
"1177","with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (the SEC
Order) on matters relating to mutual fund trading, each dated"
"1178","February 9, 2005. Under the terms of the SEC Order, the Columbia"
"1179","Group (or predecessor entities) agreed, among other things, to:"
"1180","pay disgorgement and civil money penalties collectively totaling"
"1181","$140 million; cease and desist from violations of the antifraud"
"1182","provisions and certain other provisions of the federal securities"
"1183","laws; maintain certain compliance and ethics oversight structures;"
"1184","and retain an independent consultant to review the Columbia Group's"
"1185","applicable supervisory, compliance, control and other policies and"
"1186","procedures. The NYAG Settlement, among other things, requires"
"1187","Columbia Management Advisors, LLC and its affiliates to make certain"
"1188","disclosures to investors relating to expenses.  In connection with"
"1189","the Columbia Group providing services to the Columbia Funds, the"
"1190","Columbia Funds have voluntarily undertaken to implement certain"
"1191","governance measures designed to maintain the independence of their"
"1192","boards of trustees and certain special consulting and compliance"
"1193","measures."
"1194","Pursuant to the SEC Order and related procedures, the $140 million"
"1195","in settlement amounts described above has been substantially"
"1196","distributed in accordance with a distribution plan that was developed"
"1197","by an independent distribution consultant and approved by the SEC on"
"1198","April 6, 2007."
"1199","In connection with the events described above, various parties have"
"1200","filed suit against certain funds, the Trustees of the Columbia Funds,"
"1201","FleetBoston Financial Corporation and its affiliated entities and/or"
"1202","Bank of America and its affiliated entities."
"1203","On February 20, 2004, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation"
"1204","transferred these cases and cases against other mutual fund companies"
"1205","based on similar allegations to the United States District Court in"
"1206","Maryland for consolidated or coordinated pretrial proceedings (the"
"1207","''MDL''). Subsequently, additional related cases were transferred to"
"1208","the MDL."
"1209","On September 29, 2004, the plaintiffs in the MDL filed amended and"
"1210","consolidated complaints. One of these amended complaints is a putative"
"1211","class action that includes claims under the federal securities laws and"
"1212","state common law, and that names Columbia Management Advisors, Inc."
"1213","(which has since merged into Banc of America Capital Management,"
"1214","LLC (now named Columbia Management Advisors, LLC))  (Columbia),"
"1215","Columbia Funds Distributor, Inc. (now named Columbia Management"
"1216","Distributors, Inc.) (the Distributor), the Trustees of the Columbia"
"1217","Funds, Bank of America Corporation and others as defendants. Another of"
"1218","the amended complaints is a derivative action purportedly on behalf of"
"1219","the Columbia Funds that asserts claims under federal securities laws"
"1220","and state common law."
"1221","On February 25, 2005, Columbia and other defendants filed motions to"
"1222","dismiss the claims in the pending cases.  On March 1, 2006, for reasons"
"1223","stated in the court's memoranda dated November 3, 2005, the United"
"1224","States District Court for the District of Maryland granted in part and"
"1225","denied in part the defendants' motions to dismiss.  The court dismissed"
"1226","all of the class action claims pending against the Columbia Funds Trusts."
"1227","As to Columbia and the Distributor, the claims under the Securities Act"
"1228","of 1933, the claims under Sections 34(b) and 36(a) of the Investment"
"1229","Company Act of 1940 (ICA) and the state law claims were dismissed."
"1230","The claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act"
"1231","of 1934 and claims under Section 36(b) of the ICA were not dismissed."
"1232","On March 21, 2005, a purported class action was filed in Massachusetts"
"1233","state court alleging that certain conduct, including market timing,"
"1234","entitled Class B shareholders in certain Columbia Funds to an exemption"
"1235","from contingent deferred sales charges upon early redemption (the CDSC
Lawsuit). The CDSC Lawsuit was removed to federal court in Massachusetts"
"1236","and transferred to the MDL."
"1237","On September 14, 2007, the plaintiffs and the Columbia defendants named"
"1238","in the MDL, including the Columbia Funds, entered into a stipulation of"
"1239","settlement with respect to all Columbia-related claims in the MDL"
"1240","described above, including the CDSC Lawsuit.  The settlement is subject"
"1241","to court approval."
