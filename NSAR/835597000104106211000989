"1446","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"1447","Firm"
"1448","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"1449","SEI Institutional International Trust:"
"1450","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"1451","financial statements of SEI Institutional"
"1452","International Trust, comprising the International"
"1453","Equity Fund, Emerging Markets Equity Fund,"
"1454","International Fixed Income Fund and Emerging Markets"
"1455","Debt Fund  (collectively the Funds), as of and for"
"1456","the year ended September 30, 2011, in accordance"
"1457","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1458","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1459","Funds internal control over financial reporting,"
"1460","including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"1461","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"1462","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1463","financial statements and to comply with the"
"1464","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"1465","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1466","Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"1467","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1468","Management of the Funds is responsible for"
"1469","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1470","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1471","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1472","management are required to assess the expected"
"1473","benefits and related costs of controls. A companys"
"1474","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1475","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1476","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1477","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"1478","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1479","accounting principles. A companys internal control"
"1480","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1481","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1482","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1483","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"1484","the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1485","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1486","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1487","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"1488","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1489","expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"1490","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1491","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1492","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"1493","of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of"
"1494","the companys assets that could have a material"
"1495","effect on the financial statements."
"1496","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1497","control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"1498","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"1499","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1500","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1501","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"1502","the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1503","procedures may deteriorate."
"1504","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1505","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1506","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1507","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1508","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1509","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1510","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1511","control over financial reporting, such that there is"
"1512","a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1513","misstatement of the Funds annual or interim"
"1514","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1515","detected on a timely basis."
"1516","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"1517","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1518","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1519","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"1520","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1521","standards established by the Public Company"
"1522","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However,"
"1523","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal"
"1524","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1525","including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"1526","that we consider to be a material weakness as"
"1527","defined above as of September 30, 2011."
"1528","This report is intended solely for the information"
"1529","and use of management and the Board"
"1530","of Trustees of SEI Institutional International Trust"
"1531","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"1532","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone"

"2560","any security or other procedures established"
"2561","in writing between the Custodian and the"

"2566","under the circumstances (unless such method is"

"2595","4.3.	Completeness and Contents of"

"2626","transaction."
"2627","If the Custodian shall determine that an"
"2628","Instruction is either unclear, inconsistent or"
"2629","incomplete, the Custodian will give prompt"
"2630","notice of such determination to the Trust, and"
"2631","the Trust shall thereupon amend or otherwise"
"2632","reform such Instruction. In such event, the"
"2633","Custodian shall have no obligation to take any"
"2634","action in response to the Instruction"

"2665","case through no fault or neglect of the Custodian"
"2666","or ant of its Subcustodians; or (b) pre-existing"
"2667","faults or defects in Investments that arc"
"2668","delivered to the Custodian or its Subcustodians."
"2669","The Custodian is hereby authorized to hold with"
"2670","itself or its Subcustodian, and to record in one"

"2686","Subcustodians do not, commingle any assets held"
"2687","for the account of one Fund with those held for"

"2694","either directly or through one or more"
"2695","Subcustodians appointed by the Custodian in"

"2723","through one or more Subcustodians appointed by"
"2724","the Custodian, shall be held separately from"
"2725","Investments of any other Fund."

"2732","Subcustodian or agent at a Securities"
"2733","Depository; all in accordance with customary"
"2734","market practice in the jurisdiction in which"

"4348","1.	Transmission of Payment Orders.  Each FT"

"4350","or authenticated means and subject to such"
"4351","security procedures as the Custodian shall make"
"4352","available to the Fund from time to time (such"
"4353","transmission method and security procedures, a"
"4354","Custodian Designated Security Procedure), unless"
"4355","the Fund shall elect to transmit such FT"
"4356","Instruction in accordance with a Fund Designated"

"4361","authenticate a FT Instruction, as set forth"
"4362","herein, and not to detect any errors or omissions"

"4364","2.	Custodian Designated Security Procedure.  The"
"4365","Custodian will make the following Custodian"
"4366","Designated Security Procedures available to the"
"4367","Fund for use in communicating FT Instructions to"
"4368","the Custodian:"
"4369","*	BBH Worldview Payment Products.  The"
"4370","Custodian offers to the Fund use of its BBH"
"4371","Worldview Payment Products (BBH Worldview),"
"4372","which are Custodian proprietary on-line"
"4373","payment order authorization facilities with"

"4375","Custodian and the Fund shall each be"
"4376","responsible for maintaining the"
"4377","confidentiality of passwords or other codes"
"4378","used by them in connection with BBH Worldview."
"4379","The Custodian will act on FT Instructions"
"4380","received through BBH Worldview without duty of"
"4381","further confirmation unless the Fund notifies"
"4382","the Custodian that its password is not secure."
"4383","The Fund agrees that access to, and use of,"
"4384","BBH Worldview shall be governed by an"
"4385","Electronic and On-line Services Schedule,"
"4386","which the Fund will execute prior to access to"
"4387","BBH Worldview."
"4388","*	SWIFT Transmission. The Custodian and the Fund"
"4389","shall comply with SWIFTs authentication"
"4390","procedures. The Custodian will act on FT"
"4391","Instructions received via SWIFT provided the"
"4392","instruction is authenticated by the SWIFT"
"4393","system."
"4394","*	Written Instructions.  Instructions may be"
"4395","transmitted in an original writing that bears"
"4396","the manual signature of an Authorized"
"4397","Person(s)."
"4398","3.	Fund Designated Security Procedure.  FT"
"4399","Instructions may be transmitted through such"
"4400","other means, and subject to such additional"
"4401","security procedures, as may be elected by the"
"4402","Fund (or by an Authorized Person entitled to give"
"4403","Instructions) and acknowledged and accepted by"
"4404","the Custodian (the transmission methods and"
"4405","security procedures referenced below, as may be"
"4406","supplemented by such additional security"
"4407","procedures, each a Fund Designated Security"

"4410","accept such means of delivery but shall not"
"4411","represent a judgment by the Custodian as to the"
"4412","reasonableness or security of the means utilized"
"4413","by the Fund."
"4414","*	Computer Transmission.  The Custodian is able"
"4415","to accept transmissions sent from the Funds"
"4416","computer facilities to the Custodians computer"
"4417","facilities.  If the Fund determines to use its"
"4418","proprietary transmission or other electronic"
"4419","transmission method, it must provide Custodian"
"4420","sufficient notice and information to allow"
"4421","testing or other confirmation that FT"
"4422","Instructions received via the Fund Designated"
"4423","Security Procedure can be processed in good"
"4424","time and order.  The Custodian may require the"
"4425","Fund to execute additional documentation prior"
"4426","to the use of such transmission method."
"4427","*	Facsimile Transmission."
"4428","A FT Instruction transmitted to the Custodian by"
"4429","facsimile transmission must be transmitted by the"
"4430","Fund to a telephone number specified from time to"
"4431","time by the Custodian for such purposes.  The"
"4432","Custodian will then follow one of the procedures"
"4433","below:"
"4434","1.	If the facsimile requests a non-repetitive"
"4435","order, the Custodian will call the Fund and"
"4436","request to speak to an Authorized Person ,"
"4437","and confirm the authorization and details"
"4438","of the payment order (a Callback);"
"4439","2.	If the facsimile FT Instruction pertains to"
"4440","a repetitive payment order (see Section 7"
"4441","below), the Custodian may (at its sole"
"4442","discretion) perform a Callback.  The Fund"
"4443","acknowledges that prior to its issuance of"
"4444","any repetitive payment order, it must (a)"
"4445","request that the appropriate repetitive"
"4446","payment order process be approved and set"
"4447","up at the Custodian, and (b) complete such"
"4448","documentation as may be required by the"
"4449","Custodian, including a PPO (as defined in"
"4450","Section 7)."
"4451","The Custodian shall rely on the purported"
"4452","identity of the originator but due to the lack of"
"4453","reliability of a facsimile signature, it will not"
"4454","perform signature verification on facsimiles."
"4455","*	Telephonic. The Fund may call a telephonic"
"4456","payment order into the Custodian at the"
"4457","telephone number designated from time-to-time"
"4458","by the Custodian for that purpose.  The caller"
"4459","shall identify herself/himself as an"
"4460","Authorized Person.  The Custodian shall obtain"
"4461","the FT Instruction details from the caller."
"4462","The Custodian shall then follow one of the"
"4463","procedures below:"
"4464","i.	If the telephonic FT Instruction"
"4465","pertains to a non-repetitive payment"
"4466","order, the Custodian will perform a"
"4467","Callback; or"
"4468","ii.	If the telephonic FT Instruction"
"4469","pertains to a repetitive payment order"
"4470","(see Section 7 below), the Custodian may"
"4471","(at its sole discretion) perform a"
"4472","Callback.  The Fund acknowledges that"
"4473","prior to its issuance of any repetitive"
"4474","payment order, it must (a) request that"
"4475","the appropriate repetitive payment order"
"4476","process be approved and set up at the"
"4477","Custodian, and (b) complete such"
"4478","documentation as may be required by the"
"4479","Custodian, including a PPO."
"4480","In electing to transmit a FT Instruction via a"
"4481","Fund Designated Security Procedure, the Fund (i)"
"4482","agrees to be bound by the transaction(s) or"
"4483","payment order(s) specified on said FT"
"4484","Instruction, whether or not authorized, and"
"4485","accepted by the Custodian in compliance with such"
"4486","Fund Designated Security Procedure, and"
"4487","(ii) accepts the risk associated with such Fund"
"4488","Designated Security Procedure and confirms it is"
"4489","commercially reasonable for the transmission and"
"4490","authentication of the FT Instruction."
"4491","The parties agree that the Funds transmission of"
"4492","a FT Instruction by means of any of the above"
"4493","Fund Designated Security Procedures and the"
"4494","Custodians acceptance and execution of such FT"
"4495","Instruction shall constitute a FT Instruction"
"4496","sent via a Fund Designated Security Procedure and"
"4497","governed by the terms of this FTSA."
"4498","4.	Rejection of Payment Orders; Rescission of"
"4499","Designated Security Procedure.  The Custodian"
"4500","shall give the Fund timely notice of the"
"4501","Custodians rejection of a FT Instruction. Such"
"4502","notice may be given in writing, via a Custodian"
"4503","Designated Security Procedure or any Fund"
"4504","Designated Security Procedure used by the Fund,"
"4505","or orally by telephone, each of which is hereby"
"4506","deemed commercially reasonable.  In the event the"
"4507","Custodian fails to execute a properly executable"
"4508","FT Instruction and fails to give the Fund notice"
"4509","of the Custodians non-execution, the Custodian"
"4510","shall be liable only for the Funds actual damages"
"4511","and only to the extent that such damages are"
"4512","recoverable under UCC 4A.  The Custodian, after"
"4513","providing prior written notice, may decide to no"
"4514","longer accept a particular Fund or Custodian"
"4515","Designated Security Procedure, or to do so only"
"4516","on revised terms, in the event that it determines"
"4517","that such agreed or established method of"
"4518","transmission represents a security risk or is"
"4519","attendant to any general change in the Custodians"
"4520","policy regarding FT Instructions."
"4521","Notwithstanding anything in this FTSA and the"
"4522","Agreement to the contrary, the Custodian shall in"
"4523","no event be liable for any consequential,"
"4524","indirect, special or punitive damages under this"
"4525","FTSA, whether or not such damages relate to"
"4526","services covered by UCC 4A, even if the Custodian"
"4527","was advised of the possibility of such damages."
"4528","5.	Cancellation of Payment Orders.   The Fund may"
"4529","cancel a FT Instruction but the Custodian shall"
"4530","have no liability for the Custodians failure to"
"4531","act on a cancellation FT Instruction unless the"
"4532","Custodian has received such cancellation FT"
"4533","Instruction at a time and in a manner affording"
"4534","the Custodian reasonable opportunity to act prior"
"4535","to the Custodians execution of the original FT"
"4536","Instruction.  Any cancellation FT Instruction"
"4537","shall be sent and confirmed by such means as is"
"4538","set forth in Section 3 or 4 above."
"4539","6.	Preauthorized Repetitive Payment Orders.  The"
"4540","Fund may establish with the Custodian a process"
"4541","to preauthorize certain repetitive payments or"
"4542","transfers.  The Fund will execute all"
"4543","documentation required by the Custodian,"
"4544","including a separate Preauthorized Repetitive"
"4545","Payment Order (PPO) form.  The PPO shall be"
"4546","delivered to the Custodian in writing or by"
"4547","another Custodian Designated Security Procedure"
"4548","or Fund Designated Security Procedure, and will"
"4549","become effective after the Custodian shall have"
"4550","had a reasonable opportunity to act thereon (or"
"4551","if later, two (2) banking days after receipt by"
"4552","the Custodian).  The PPO may take the form of"
"4553","either:"
"4554","i.	A standing instruction in which the Fund"
"4555","provides in the PPO all required"
"4556","information for a FT Instruction (except"
"4557","for the transfer date and amount) on a"
"4558","standing instructions basis.    The Fund"
"4559","may from time-to-time instruct the"
"4560","Custodian to make a payment under the"
"4561","PPO, in writing or another Custodian"
"4562","Designated Security Procedure or Fund"
"4563","Designated Security Procedure, which"
"4564","instruction shall reference the"
"4565","repetitive line number (a number"
"4566","assigned to it by the Custodian after"
"4567","execution of the PPO), details of the"
"4568","payment, the transfer date and the"
"4569","amount of the transfer; or"
"4570","ii.	A recurring instruction in which the"
"4571","Fund supplies all required information"
"4572","for a FT Instruction with an instruction"
"4573","to process such payments with a specific"
"4574","frequency."
"4575","7.	Responsibility for the Detection of Errors in"
"4576","Payment Orders; Liability of the Parties.   The"
"4577","purpose of any Fund Designated Security Procedure"
"4578","or Custodian Designated Security Procedure is to"
"4579","confirm the authenticity of any FT Instruction"
"4580","and is not designed to detect errors or omissions"
"4581","in such FT Instructions.  Therefore, the"
"4582","Custodian is not responsible for detecting any"
"4583","Fund error or omission contained in any FT"
"4584","Instruction received by the Custodian.  In the"
"4585","event that the FT Instruction either (i)"
"4586","identifies the beneficiary by both a name and an"
"4587","identifying or Fund account number and the name"
"4588","and number identify different persons or"
"4589","entities, or (ii) identifies any Fund by both a"
"4590","name and an identifying number and the number"
"4591","identifies a person or entity different from the"
"4592","Fund identified by name, execution of the"
"4593","relevant payment order, payment to the"
"4594","beneficiary, cancellation of the payment order or"
"4595","actions taken by the Custodian or any Fund in"
"4596","respect of such payment order may be made solely"
"4597","on the basis of the number."
"4598","The Custodian shall not be liable for interest on"
"4599","the amount of any FT Instruction that was not"
"4600","authorized or was erroneously executed unless the"
"4601","Fund so notifies the Custodian within thirty (30)"
"4602","days following the Funds receipt of notice that"
"4603","such FT Instruction was processed.  Any"
"4604","compensation payable in the form of interest"
"4605","shall be payable in accordance with UCC 4A.  If a"
"4606","FT Instruction in the name of the Fund and"
"4607","accepted by the Custodian was not authorized by"
"4608","the Fund, the liability of the parties will be"

"5110","Trust, desires to retain the Sub-Adviser to provide"
"5111","investment advisory services to the Adviser in"
"5112","connection with the management of a Fund, and the"
"5113","Sub-Adviser is willing to render such investment"
"5114","advisory services."
"5115","       NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as"
"5116","follows:"
"5117","1.                                       Duties of"
"5118","the Sub-Adviser.  Subject to supervision by"
"5119","the Adviser and the Trusts Board of Trustees,"
"5120","the Sub-Adviser shall manage all of the"
"5121","securities and other assets of each Fund"
"5122","entrusted to it hereunder (the Assets),"
"5123","including the purchase, retention and"
"5124","disposition of the Assets, in accordance with"
"5125","the Funds investment objectives, policies and"
"5126","restrictions as stated in each Funds"
"5127","prospectus and statement of additional"
"5128","information, as currently in effect and as"
"5129","amended or supplemented from time to time"
"5130","(referred to collectively as the Prospectus),"
"5131","and subject to the following:"
"5132","(a)         The Sub-Adviser shall, in"
"5133","consultation with and subject to the"
"5134","direction of the Adviser, determine from"
"5135","time to time what Assets will be"
"5136","purchased, retained or sold by a Fund,"
"5137","and what portion of the Assets will be"
"5138","invested or held uninvested in cash."
"5139","(b)         In the performance of its duties"
"5140","and obligations under this Agreement,"
"5141","the Sub-Adviser shall act in conformity"
"5142","with the Trusts Declaration of Trust (as"
"5143","defined herein), Prospectus, Compliance"
"5144","Policies and Procedures and with the"
"5145","instructions and directions of the"
"5146","Adviser and of the Board of Trustees of"
"5147","the Trust and will conform to and comply"
"5148","with the requirements of the 1940 Act,"
"5149","the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the"
"5150","Code), and all other applicable federal"
"5151","and state laws and regulations, as each"
"5152","is amended from time to time."
"5153","(c)         The Sub-Adviser shall determine"
"5154","the Assets to be purchased or sold by a"
"5155","Fund as provided in subparagraph (a) and"
"5156","will place orders with or through such"
"5157","persons, brokers or dealers to carry out"
"5158","the policy with respect to brokerage set"
"5159","forth in a Funds Prospectus or as the"
"5160","Board of Trustees or the Adviser may"
"5161","direct from time to time, in conformity"
"5162","with all federal securities laws.  In"
"5163","executing Fund transactions and"
"5164","selecting brokers or dealers, the Sub-"
"5165","Adviser will use its best efforts to"
"5166","seek on behalf of each Fund the best"
"5167","overall terms available.  In assessing"
"5168","the best overall terms available for any"
"5169","transaction, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"5170","consider all factors that it deems"
"5171","relevant, including the breadth of the"
"5172","market in the security, the price of the"
"5173","security, the financial condition and"
"5174","execution capability of the broker or"
"5175","dealer, and the reasonableness of the"
"5176","commission, if any, both for the"
"5177","specific transaction and on a continuing"
"5178","basis.  In evaluating the best overall"
"5179","terms available, and in selecting the"
"5180","broker-dealer to execute a particular"
"5181","transaction, the Sub-Adviser may also"
"5182","consider the brokerage and research"
"5183","services provided (as those terms are"
"5184","defined in Section 28(e) of the"
"5185","Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the"
"5186","Exchange Act)).  Consistent with any"
"5187","guidelines established by the Board of"
"5188","Trustees of the Trust and"
"5189","Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act, the"
"5190","Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay to a"
"5191","broker or dealer who provides such"
"5192","brokerage and research services a"
"5193","commission for executing a portfolio"
"5194","transaction for a Fund which is in"
"5195","excess of the amount of commission"
"5196","another broker or dealer would have"
"5197","charged for effecting that transaction"
"5198","if, but only if, the Sub-Adviser"
"5199","determines in good faith that such"
"5200","commission was reasonable in relation to"
"5201","the value of the brokerage and research"
"5202","services provided by such broker or"
"5203","dealer viewed in terms of that"
"5204","particular transaction or in terms of"
"5205","the overall responsibilities of the Sub-"
"5206","Adviser to its discretionary clients,"
"5207","including a Fund.  In addition, the Sub-"
"5208","Adviser is authorized to allocate"
"5209","purchase and sale orders for securities"
"5210","to brokers or dealers (including brokers"
"5211","and dealers that are affiliated with the"
"5212","Adviser, Sub-Adviser or the Trusts"
"5213","principal underwriter) if the Sub-"
"5214","Adviser believes that the quality of the"
"5215","transaction and the commission are"
"5216","comparable to what they would be with"
"5217","other qualified firms.  In no instance,"
"5218","however, will a Funds Assets be"
"5219","purchased from or sold to the Adviser,"
"5220","Sub-Adviser, the Trusts principal"
"5221","underwriter, or any affiliated person of"
"5222","either the Trust, Adviser, the Sub-"
"5223","Adviser or the principal underwriter,"
"5224","acting as principal in the transaction,"
"5225","except to the extent permitted by the"

"5232","(7), (9), (10) and (11) and paragraph"
"5233","(f) of Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act."

"5243","under the 1940 Act.  The Sub-Adviser"
"5244","agrees that all records that it"
"5245","maintains on behalf of a Fund are"
"5246","property of the Fund and the Sub-Adviser"
"5247","will surrender promptly to a Fund any of"
"5248","such records upon the Funds request;"
"5249","provided, however, that the Sub-Adviser"
"5250","may retain a copy of such records.  In"

"5252","Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"5253","preserve for the periods prescribed by"

"5272","the Fund with information and advice"
"5273","regarding Assets to assist the Fund in"
"5274","determining the appropriate valuation of"
"5275","such Assets."
"5276","(g)         The investment management services"
"5277","provided by the Sub-Adviser under this"
"5278","Agreement are not to be deemed exclusive"
"5279","and the Sub-Adviser shall be free to"
"5280","render similar services to others, as"
"5281","long as such services do not impair the"
"5282","services rendered to the Adviser or the"
"5283","Trust."
"5284","(h)         The Sub-Adviser shall promptly"
"5285","notify the Adviser of any financial"

"5289","Agreement."
"5290","             (i)         Except under the"
"5291","circumstances set forth in"
"5292","subsection (ii), the Sub-Adviser"
