"2560","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"2561","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM International Mutual Funds"
"2562","(Invesco International Mutual Funds):"
"2563","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Invesco"
"2564","Asia Pacific Growth Fund, Invesco European Growth Fund, Invesco Global Small &"
"2565","Mid Cap Growth Fund, Invesco International Core Equity Fund, Invesco"
"2566","International Growth Fund, Invesco Global Growth Fund, Invesco Select"
"2567","Opportunities Fund and Invesco Global Opportunities Fund (hereafter referred to"
"2568","as the Funds) as of and for the year ended October 31, 2013 in accordance"
"2569","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"2570","States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"2571","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"2572","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"2573","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"2574","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"2575","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"2576","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"2577","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"2578","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"2579","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"2580","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"2581","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2582","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"2583","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"2584","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"2585","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2586","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2587","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"2588","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"2589","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"2590","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"2591","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"2592","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"2593","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"2594","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2595","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2596","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2597","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"2598","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"2599","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2600","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"2601","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"2602","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2603","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2604","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"2605","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2606","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"2607","on a timely basis."
"2608","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"2609","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"2610","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"2611","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"2612","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"2613","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"2614","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"2615","be material weaknesses as defined above as of October 31, 2013."
"2616","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"2617","the Board of Trustees of AIM International Mutual Funds (Invesco International"
"2618","Mutual Funds) and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to"
"2619","be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"2648","Inc. (Invesco). Invesco shall and hereby agrees to waive fees or reimburse"
"2649","expenses of each Fund, on behalf of its respective classes as applicable,"
"2650","severally and not jointly, as indicated in the attached Exhibits."
"2651","   For and in consideration of the mutual terms and agreements set forth herein"
"2652","and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which"
"2653","is hereby acknowledged, the Trusts and Invesco agree as follows:"
"2654","   For the Contractual Limits (listed in Exhibits A - D), Invesco agrees until"
"2655","at least the expiration date set forth on the attached Exhibits A - D (the"
"2656","Expiration Date) that Invesco will waive its fees or reimburse expenses to"
"2657","the extent that expenses of a class of a Fund (excluding (i) interest;"
"2658","(ii) taxes; (iii) dividend expense on short sales; (iv) extraordinary or"
"2659","non-routine items, including litigation expenses; and (v) expenses that each"
"2660","Fund has incurred but did not actually pay because of an expense offset"
"2661","arrangement, if applicable) exceed the rate, on an annualized basis, set forth"
"2662","on the Exhibits of the average daily net assets allocable to such class."
"2663","Acquired fund fees and expenses are not fees or expenses incurred by a fund"
"2664","directly but are expenses of the investment companies in which a fund invests."
"2665","These fees and expenses are incurred indirectly through the valuation of a"
"2666","fund's investment in these investment companies. Acquired fund fees and"
"2667","expenses are required to be disclosed and included in the total annual fund"
"2668","operating expenses in the prospectus fee table. As a result, the net total"
"2669","annual fund operating expenses shown in the prospectus fee table may exceed the"
"2670","expense limits reflected in Exhibits A - D. With regard to the Contractual"
"2671","Limits, the Board of Trustees of the Trust and Invesco may terminate or modify"
"2672","this Memorandum of Agreement prior to the Expiration Date only by mutual"
"2673","written consent. Invesco will not have any right to reimbursement of any amount"
"2674","so waived or reimbursed."
"2675","   For the Contractual Limits, Invesco agrees to review the then-current"
"2676","expense limitations for each class of each Fund listed on the Exhibits on a"
"2677","date prior to the Expiration Date to determine whether such limitations should"
"2678","be amended, continued or terminated. The expense limitations will expire upon"
"2679","the Expiration Date unless the Trusts and Invesco have agreed to continue them."
"2680","The Exhibits will be amended to reflect any such agreement."
"2681","   For the Voluntary Limits (listed in Exhibits A - D), Invesco agrees that"
"2682","these are not contractual in nature and that Invesco may establish, amend"
"2683","and/or terminate such expense limitations at any time in its sole discretion"
"2684","after consultation with the Funds' Boards of Trustees. Any delay or failure by"
"2685","Invesco to update this Memorandum of Agreement with regards to the"
"2686","terminations, extensions, or expirations of the Voluntary Limits shall have no"
"2687","effect on the term of such Voluntary Limitations; the Voluntary Limitations are"
"2688","listed herein for informational purposes only."
"2689","   It is expressly agreed that the obligations of each Trust hereunder shall"
"2690","not be binding upon any of the Trustees, shareholders, nominees, officers,"
"2691","agents or employees of the Trusts personally, but shall only bind the assets"
"2692","and property of each Fund, as provided in each Trust's Agreement and"
