"572","<P style=margin:0px; font-family:Arial>On December 18, 2009, a Special Meeting of Shareholders (the &#147;Meeting&#148;) of the Fund was held at the offices of C&amp;O Funds Advisor, Inc.

The Proposal was approved by the affirmative vote of a &#147;majority of the outstanding voting securities&#148; (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended) of the Fund, meaning the lessor of (i) 67% or more of the shares represented at the Meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares were represented, or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund.</P>"
