"1362","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1363","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Nuveen Funds:"
"1364","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"1365","each of the Nuveen Funds listed in Exhibit A attached (the"
"1366"," Funds ), as of and for the year or period ended September 30,"
"1367","2016, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1368","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1369","Funds internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"1370","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1371","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1372","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"1373","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1374","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"1375","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1376","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"1377","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"1378","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1379","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1380","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"1381","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1382","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1383","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1384","accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles"
"1385","(GAAP). A companys internal control over financial reporting"
"1386","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1387","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1388","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"1389","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1390","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1391","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"1392","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"1393","with authorizations of management and directors of the company;"
"1394","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"

"1456","Investment Funds, Inc.:"
"1457","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"

"1459","year ended September 30, 2016, in accordance with the standards"
"1460","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1461","States), we considered the Funds internal control over financial"
"1462","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"1463","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1464","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"1465","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1466","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"1467","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express"
"1468","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"1469","financial reporting."
"1470","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"

"1472","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1473","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1474","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"1475","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1476","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1477","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1478","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1479","companys internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1480","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1481","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1482","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"1483","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1484","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1485","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1486","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"1487","only in accordance with authorizations of management and the"
"1488","Board of Trustees/Directors of the company; and (3)  provide"
"1489","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1490","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a companys assets"
"1491","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1492","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
