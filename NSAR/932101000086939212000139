"1067","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"1068","of the Putnam Growth Opportunities Fund (the Fund), a series of"
"1069","Putnam Investment Funds, as of and for the year ended July 31,"
"1070","2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1071","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1072","Funds internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1073","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"1074","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"1075","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"1076","of Form NSAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1077","the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"1078","reporting.   Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1079","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1080","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1081","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1082","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1083","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"1084","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1085","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1086","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1087","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"1088","companys internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1089","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1090","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"1091","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"1092","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"1093","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1094","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1095","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only"
"1096","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of"
"1097","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1098","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,"
"1099","or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material"
"1100","effect on the financial statements."
"1101","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1102","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."

"1219","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1220","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"

"1223","reporting.   Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1224","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"

"1240","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only"
"1241","in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"1242","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1243","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,"
"1244","or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material"
"1245","effect on the financial statements."
