"883","Accounting Firm"
"884","To the Shareholders and"
"885","Board of Trustees of"
"886","Federated Income"
"887","Securities Trust:"
"888","In planning and"
"889","performing our audits"
"890","of the financial"
"891","statements of Federated"
"892","Intermediate"
"893","Corporate Bond Fund and"
"894","Federated Short-Term"
"895","Income Fund (two of the"
"896","portfolios constituting"
"897","Federated Income Securities"
"898","Trust) (collectively the"
"899","Funds) as of and for the"
"900","year ended April"
"901","30, 2011, in accordance"
"902","with the standards of the"
"903","Public Company Accounting"
"904","Oversight Board"
"905","(United States), we"
"906","considered the Funds'"
"907","internal control over"
"908","financial reporting, including"
"909","controls over safeguarding"
"910","securities, as a basis for"
"911","designing our auditing"
"912","procedures for the"
"913","purpose of expressing our"
"914","opinion on the financial"
"915","statements and to comply"
"916","with the"
"917","requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"918","but not for the purpose of"
"919","expressing an opinion on the"
"920","effectiveness of the Funds'"
"921","internal control over"
"922","financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"923","we express no"
"924","such opinion."
"925","The management of the Funds"
"926","is responsible for establishing"
"927","and maintaining effective"
"928","internal"
"929","control over financial reporting."
"930","In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"931","estimates and judgments by"
"932","management are required to"
"933","assess the expected benefits"
"934","and related costs of controls. The"
"935","company's internal control over"
"936","financial reporting is a process"
"937","designed to provide reasonable"
"938","assurance regarding the"
"939","reliability of financial"
"940","reporting and the preparation"
"941","of financial"
"942","statements for external purposes"
"943","in accordance with generally"
"944","accepted accounting principles. A"
"945","company's internal control over"
"946","financial reporting includes those"
"947","policies and procedures that"
"948","(1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"949","records that, in reasonable detail,"
"950","accurately and fairly reflect"
"951","the transactions and dispositions"
"952","of the assets of the company; (2)"
"953","provide reasonable assurance"
"954","that transactions are recorded as"
"955","necessary to permit preparation"
"956","of financial statements in"
"957","accordance with generally accepted"
"958","accounting principles, and that"
"959","receipts and expenditures of"
"960","the company are being made only"
"961","in accordance with authorizations"
"962","of management and"
"963","directors of the company; and (3)"
"964","provide reasonable assurance"
"965","regarding prevention or timely"
"966","detection of unauthorized"
"967","acquisition, use or disposition"
"968","of a company's assets that could"
"969","have a"
"970","material effect on the financial"
"971","statements."
"972","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"973","internal control over financial"
"974","reporting may not prevent or"
"975","detect misstatements. Also,"
"976","projections of any evaluation of"
"977","effectiveness to future periods are"
"978","subject to the risk that controls"
"979","may become inadequate because of"
"980","changes in conditions, or that"
"981","the degree of compliance with the"
"982","policies or procedures may"
"983","deteriorate."
"984","A deficiency in internal control"
"985","over financial reporting exists"
"986","when the design or operation of a"
"987","control does not allow management"
"988","or employees, in the normal course"
"989","of performing their"
"990","assigned functions, to prevent or"
"991","detect misstatements on a timely"
"992","basis. A material weakness is"
"993","a deficiency, or a combination of"
"994","deficiencies, in internal control"
"995","over financial reporting, such"
"996","that there is a reasonable"
"997","possibility that a material"
"998","misstatement of the company's"
"999","annual or"
"1000","interim financial statements"
"1001","will not be prevented or detected"
"1002","on a timely basis."
"1003","Our consideration of the Funds'"
"1004","internal control over financial"
"1005","reporting was for the limited"
"1006","purpose described in the first"
"1007","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"1008","disclose all deficiencies in"
"1009","internal control that might be"
"1010","material weaknesses under"
"1011","standards established by the Public"
"1012","Fund Accounting Oversight Board"
"1013","(United States). However, we"
"1014","noted no deficiencies in the"
"1015","Funds' internal control over"
"1016","financial reporting and its"
"1017","operation, including controls over"
"1018","safeguarding securities, that"
"1019","we consider to be a material"
"1020","weakness as defined above as of April"
"1021","30, 2011."
"1022","This report is intended solely"
"1023","for the information and use of"
"1024","management and the Board of"
"1025","Trustees of the Funds and the"
"1026","Securities and Exchange Commission"
"1027","and is not intended to be,"
"1028","and should not be, used by anyone"
"1029","other than these specified parties."
