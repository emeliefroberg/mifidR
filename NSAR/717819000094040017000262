"923","as of and for the year ended February 28, 2017, in accordance"

"925","Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal control"

"929","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"

"934","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"935","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"

"937","related costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"938","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"939","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"940","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"941","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"942","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"943","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"944","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"945","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"946","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"947","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"948","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"949","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"950","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"

"953","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's"

"960","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"961","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"962","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"963","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"964","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
