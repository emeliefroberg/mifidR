"14821","of and for the period ended August 31, 2016, in accordance with"
"14822","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"14823","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"14824","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"14825","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"14826","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"14827","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"14828","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"14829","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"14830","opinion."
"14831","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"14832","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"14833","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"14834","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"14835","related costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"14836","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"14837","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"14838","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"14839","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"14840","company's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"14841","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"14842","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"14843","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"14844","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"14845","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"14846","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that"
"14847","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"14848","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"14849","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"14850","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"14851","disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect"
"14852","on the financial statements."
"14853","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"14854","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"14855","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"14856","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"14857","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"14858","deteriorate."
"14859","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"14860","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"14861","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"14862","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"14863","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"14864","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"14865","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"14866","the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"14867","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"14868","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"14869","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"14870","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"14871","internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"14872","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"14873","(United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"14874","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"14875","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"14876","be a material weakness as defined above as of August 31, 2016."

"15115","products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent"
"15116","consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor"

"15119","excess of the amount of commission or dealer"
"15120","spread another broker or dealer would have"
"15121","charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-"
"15122","Advisor determines in good faith that such amount"
"15123","of commission is reasonable in relation to the value"
"15124","of the brokerage and research products and/or"
"15125","services provided by such broker or dealer. This"
"15126","determination, with respect to brokerage and"
"15127","research products and/or services, may be viewed"

"15135","repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized"
"15136","by the Series except to the extent permitted under"

Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the"
"15145","Fund and the Manager with such periodic and"

"16142","broker or dealer. This determination, with respect to"
"16143","brokerage and research products and/or services,"

"16344","Accounts for several reasons, including different investment"
"16345","strategies and fees.   The portfolio strategies employed by"

"16697","allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as"
"16698","well as the expenses incurred in the transaction,"
"16699","will be made by the Sub-Advisor in the manner the"
"16700","Sub-Advisor considers to be the most equitable and"
"16701","consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund"
"16702","and to other clients. The Sub-Advisor will report on"

"16723","transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good"
"16724","faith that such amount of commission is reasonable"
"16725","in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"16726","research products and/or services provided by such"
"16727","broker or dealer. This determination, with respect to"
"16728","brokerage and research products and/or services,"
"16729","may be viewed in terms of either that particular"
"16730","transaction or the overall responsibilities which the"
"16731","Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to"

"16737","not be utilized by the Series except to the extent"

"17212","determination of the fair value of certain securities when reliable"
"17213","market quotations are not readily available for purposes of"
"17214","calculating net asset value in accordance with procedures and"
"17215","methods established by the Fund's Board of Directors."
"17216","(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and"
"17217","management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other"
"17218","personnel required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii)"
"17219","administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical"
"17220","personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of"
"17221","the investment advisory affairs of each Series."
"17222","(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers, swap dealers,"
"17223","clearinghouses and futures commission merchants (broker-
dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all transactions for"
"17224","each Series, place all necessary orders with broker-dealers or"
"17225","issuers (including affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate"
"17226","commissions, if applicable. To the extent consistent with"
"17227","applicable law, purchase or sell orders for each Series may be"
"17228","aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of"
"17229","other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation of"
"17230","securities or swaps so sold or purchased, as well as the"
"17231","expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the"
"17232","Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the"
"17233","most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to"
"17234","the Fund and to other clients.  The Sub-Advisor will report on"
"17235","such allocations at the request of the Manager, the Fund or the"
"17236","Fund's Board of Directors providing such information as the"
"17237","number of aggregated trades to which each Series was a party,"
"17238","the broker-dealers to whom such trades were directed and the"
"17239","basis for the allocation for the aggregated trades.  The Sub-"
"17240","Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain execution of"
"17241","transactions for each Series at prices which are advantageous"
"17242","to the Series and at commission rates that are reasonable in"
"17243","relation to the benefits received. However, the Sub-Advisor may"
"17244","select brokers or dealers on the basis that they provide"
"17245","brokerage, research or other services or products to the Sub-"
"17246","Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-"
"17247","Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission"
"17248","for effecting a securities or derivatives transaction in excess of"
"17249","the amount of commission or dealer spread another broker or"
"17250","dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the"
"17251","Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that such amount of"
"17252","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"17253","brokerage and research products and/or services provided by"
"17254","such broker or dealer. This determination, with respect to"
"17255","brokerage and research products and/or services, may be"
"17256","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the"
"17257","overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates"
"17258","have with respect to each Series as well as to accounts over"
"17259","which they exercise investment discretion. Not all such services"
"17260","or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the"
"17261","Series.  In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not"
"17262","be utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under"
"17263","any exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that"
"17264","all conditions of such order are complied with."
"17265","(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to each"
"17266","Series as are required of an investment advisor of a registered"
"17267","investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment"
"17268","Advisers Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisers Act), and the"
"17269","rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with"

"18013","excess of the amount of commission or dealer"
"18014","spread another broker or dealer would have"
"18015","charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-"
"18016","Advisor determines in good faith that such amount"
"18017","of commission is reasonable in relation to the value"
"18018","of the brokerage and research products and/or"
"18019","services provided by such broker or dealer. This"
"18020","determination, with respect to brokerage and"
"18021","research products and/or services, may be viewed"
"18022","in terms of either that particular transaction or the"
"18023","overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and"
"18024","its affiliates have with respect to each Series as"
"18025","well as to accounts over which they exercise"
"18026","investment discretion. Not all such services or"
"18027","products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in"
"18028","managing the Allocated Assets. In addition, joint"
"18029","repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized"
"18030","by the Series except to the extent permitted under"
"18031","any exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor"

"18064","of Ethics along with certification that the Sub-"

"18522","consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor"
"18523","may pay a broker or dealer an amount of"
"18524","commission for effecting a securities transaction in"
"18525","excess of the amount of commission or dealer"

"18527","charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-"
"18528","Advisor determines in good faith that such amount"
"18529","of commission is reasonable in relation to the value"
"18530","of the brokerage and research products and/or"
"18531","services provided by such broker or dealer. This"
"18532","determination, with respect to brokerage and"
"18533","research products and/or services, may be viewed"

"18535","overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and"

"18537","well as to accounts over which they exercise"
"18538","investment discretion. Not all such services or"

Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to
furnish it with portfolio selection in connection with the investment
advisory services for each series of the Fund identified in
Appendix A (hereinafter called the Series), which the Manager
has agreed to provide to the Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to
furnish such services on the terms and conditions set forth herein; and

WHEREAS, the Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies
properly certified or authenticated of each of the following:

(a)	The Amended and Restated Management Agreement dated
March 31, 2016, between the Fund and the Manager (the
Management Agreement) with the Fund;

(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements
as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by
the Board of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and
services provided by the Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as
follows :

1.	Appointment  of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management
Agreement, the Manager hereby appoints the Sub-
Advisor to perform the services described in Section 2 below
for investment and reinvestment of the securities and other
assets of the Series, subject to the supervision and direction
of the Manager and the Fund's Board of Directors, for the
period and on the terms hereinafter set forth. The Sub-
Advisor accepts such appointment and agrees to furnish
the services hereinafter set forth for the compensation
herein provided. The Sub-Advisor shall provide such
services with respect to the portion of the assets of the
Series allocated to it for management from time to time by
the Manager. The Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes
herein be deemed to be an independent contractor and
shall, except as expressly provided or authorized herein,
have no authority to act for or represent the Fund or the
Manager in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of
the Fund or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

(a)	The Sub-Advisor will:
(i)	Provide investment advisory services, including but
not limited to research, advice and supervision for the
Series.

(ii)	Furnish to the Board of Directors for approval (or
any appropriate committee of such Board of
Directors), and revise from time to time as economic
conditions require, a recommended investment
program for the Series consistent with the Series'
written investment objective and policies.


(iii)	Implement the approved investment program by placing
orders for the purchase, sale and exchange of securities,
commodity interests (as defined in the Commodity
Exchange Act, as amended) and other financial instruments
without prior consultation with the Manager and without regard
to the length of time the securities and other financial
instruments have been held, the resulting rate of portfolio
turnover or any tax considerations, subject always to (i) the
provisions of the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
and (ii) the requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same
shall be from time to time in effect.

(iv)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as reasonably
requested by the officers, in taking such steps as are
reasonably necessary or appropriate  to carry out the
decisions of its Board of Directors, and any appropriate
committees of such Board, regarding the general conduct of
the investment business of the Series.

(v)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment
advisory services provided to the Series, its compliance with
the 1940 Act and the regulations adopted by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) thereunder and the
Series' investment strategies and restrictions as stated in the
Fund's prospectus and statement of additional information
(together , the Registration Statement), subject to receipt of
such additional information as may be required from the
Manager and provided in accordance with Section 11(d) of
this Agreement. The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility for
the maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is
directly related to the services it provides to the Series.

(vi)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times
and in such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably
deem appropriate in order to enable it to determine that the
investment policies, procedures and approved investment
program of the Series are being observed.

(vii)	Upon request, provide reasonable assistance in the
determination of the fair value of certain securities when
reliable market quotations are not readily available for
purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance with
procedures and methods established by the Board of
Directors.

(viii)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment
and management facilities, including salaries of clerical and
other personnel required for it to execute its duties
faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including
bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment necessary for
the efficient conduct of its duties under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the cost of the securities or
other investment instruments purchased or sold or held by the
Fund (including taxes, brokerage commissions and other
applicable transaction and custodial costs, interest payable on
any margin loans and other Fund borrowings, and dividend
and  interest expenses on short positions, if any), shall be
solely borne by the Fund.

(ix)	Open accounts with broker-dealers, futures commission
merchants, banks and other financial institutions (collectively
broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all
transactions for the Series, place all necessary orders with
broker-dealers or  issuers (including affiliated  broker-
dealers), and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the
extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders
for the Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous
purchase or sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor.
In such event allocation of securities so sold or purchased,
as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be
made by the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor
considers to be the most equitable and consistent with its
fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients of the
Sub-Advisor and its affiliates over time. The Manager
recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure may limit the
size of the position that may be acquired or sold for the Series
and that aggregation of orders may not result in more
favorable pricing or lower brokerage commissions in all
instances. At the Manager's request, the Sub-Advisor will
provide the Manager with the information required pursuant to
Rule 31a-1(b)(9) of the 1940 Act. The Sub-Advisor will effect
transactions with those broker-dealers which it believes
provide favorable net prices and are capable of providing
efficient executions, taking into consideration, among other
things, order size, difficulty of execution, the operational
capabilities, facilities and financial condition of the broker-
dealer involved, whether that broker-dealer has risked its
own capital in positioning a block of securities or other
assets, and the prior experience of the broker- dealer in
effecting transactions of the relevant types. The Sub-Advisor's
primary objective will be to


obtain best execution with respect to all transactions for the
Series However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers-dealers
on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or other
services or products to the Sub-Advisor or its affiliates. To
the extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub- Advisor
may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission for
effecting a securities transaction in excess  of the amount of
commission or dealer spread another broker- dealer would
have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor
determines in good faith that such amount of commission is
reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and
research products and/or services provided by such broker-
dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and
research products and/or services, may be viewed in terms
of either that particular transaction or the overall
responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have
with respect to the Series and other accounts over which
they exercise investment discretion. Not all such services or
products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the
Series. In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may
not be utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted
under any exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor
provided that all conditions of such order are complied with.

(x)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the
Series as are required of an investment adviser of a
registered investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act
and the Investment Advisers  Act of 1940, as amended (the
Investment Advisers Act), and the rules thereunder, and
furnish the Fund and the Manager with such periodic and
special reports as the Fund or Manager may reasonably
request. In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all
records that it maintains for the Series are the property of the
Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule
31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains for the
Fund and that are required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1
under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to surrender promptly
to the Fund any records that it maintains for the Series upon
request by the Fund or the Manager. The Sub-Advisor may
retain copies of any such records.

(xi)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and
the Sub-Advisor's code of ethics (the Code of Ethics)
adopted pursuant to Rule 17j-1 as the same may be amended
from time to time. The Manager acknowledges receipt of a
copy of Sub-Advisor's current Code of Ethics. Sub- Advisor
shall promptly forward to the Manager a copy of any
material amendment to the Sub- Advisor's Code of Ethics.

(xii)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request,
furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio transactions
and reports on investments held by the Series, all in such
detail as the Manager or the Fund may reasonably request.
The Sub-Advisor will make available its personnel to meet
with the Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's principal
place of business on reasonable prior notice to review the
investments of the Series.

of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and any state
securities laws, and any rule or regulation thereunder. Sub-
Advisor will advise Manager of any changes in Sub-Advisor's
Senior Management (i.e. Chief Investment Officer and/or Chief
Executive Officer) within a reasonable time after any such
change. Manager acknowledges receipt of Sub-Advisor's
Form ADV more than 48 hours prior to the execution of this
Agreement.

by, or with respect to, the issuers of securities held in the
Series in accordance with the Sub-Advisor's proxy voting
policy as most recently provided to the Manager. The Sub-
Advisor's obligations in the previous sentence are
contingent upon its timely receipt of such proxy solicitation
materials from the Manager. The Manager shall cause to be
forwarded to Sub-Advisor all proxy solicitation materials that it
receives and shall assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to conduct
the proxy voting process.


(b) The Sub-Advisor is hereby authorized to prepare and file all
documentation in connection with its management of the Series,
including proofs of claim, evidence of indebtedness, related
bankruptcy and insolvency filings and other similar filings on
behalf of the Fund.

Sub-Advisor will not consult with any other investment advisory
firm that provides investment advisory services to any investment
company sponsored by Principal Life Insurance Company
regarding transactions for the Fund in securities or other assets.

advisory firms to the Sub-Advisor, such list to be promptly
updated by the Manager upon any changes thereto.
