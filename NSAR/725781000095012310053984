"2021","             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"2022","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"2023","of Invesco Sector Funds:"
"2024","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Invesco"
"2025","Sector Funds (the Funds) as of and for the year ended March 31, 2010, in"
"2026","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"2027","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2028","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"2029","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"2030","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"2031","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"2032","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an"
"2033","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2034","reporting."
"2035","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"2036","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"2037","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"2038","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"2039","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2040","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"2041","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2042","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"2043","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"2044","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"2045","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"2046","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2047","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"2048","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"2049","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of"
"2050","the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"2051","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"2052","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2053","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2054","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2055","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2056","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"2057","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2058","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"2059","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"2060","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2061","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2062","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"2063","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2064","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"2065","on a timely basis."
"2066","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"2067","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"2068","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"2069","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"2070","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"2071","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"2072","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to"
"2073","be material weaknesses as defined above as of March 31, 2010."
"2074","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"2075","Board of Trustees of the Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"2076","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"2077","parties."

"2092","                                LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"2093","SETTLED ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO MARKET TIMING"
"2094","          On October 8, 2004, INVESCO Funds Group, Inc. (IFG), (former"
"2095","investment adviser to certain AIM Funds), Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco),"
"2096","successor by merger to Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc. and Invesco Aim Distributors,"
"2097","Inc. (Invesco Aim Distributors) reached final settlements with certain"
"2098","regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York"
"2099","Attorney General and the Colorado Attorney General, to resolve civil enforcement"
"2100","actions and/or investigations related to market timing and related activity in"
"2101","the AIM Funds, including those formerly advised by IFG. As part of the"
"2102","settlements, a $325 million fair fund ($110 million of which is civil penalties)"
"2103","was created to compensate shareholders harmed by market timing and related"
"2104","activity in funds formerly advised by IFG. Additionally, Invesco and Invesco Aim"
"2105","Distributors created a $50 million fair fund ($30 million of which is civil"
"2106","penalties) to compensate shareholders harmed by market timing and related"
"2107","activity in funds advised by Invesco, which was done pursuant to the terms of"
"2108","the settlement. The methodology of the fair funds distributions was determined"
"2109","by Invesco's independent distribution consultant (IDC Plan), in consultation"
"2110","with Invesco and the independent trustees of the AIM Funds, and approved by the"
"2111","SEC on May 23, 2008."
"2112","          The IDC Plan provides for distribution to all eligible investors, for"
"2113","the periods spanning January 1, 2000 through July 31, 2003 (for the IFG Fair"
"2114","Fund) and January 1, 2001 through September 30, 2003 (for the AIM Fair Fund),"
"2115","their proportionate share of the applicable Fair Fund to compensate such"
"2116","investors for injury they may have suffered as a result of market timing in the"
"2117","affected funds. The IDC Plan includes a provision for any residual amounts in"
"2118","the Fair Funds to be distributed in the future to the affected funds. Further"
"2119","details regarding the IDC Plan and distributions thereunder are available on"
"2120","Invesco's Web site, available at http://www.invescoaim.com."
"2121","At the present time, management of Invesco and the AIM Funds are unable to"
"2122","estimate the impact, if any, that the outcome of the Pending Litigation and"
"2123","Regulatory Inquiries described herein may have on Invesco, Invesco Aim"
"2124","Distributors or the AIM Funds."
"2125","Pending Regulatory Action Alleging Market Timing"
"2126","          On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Office of the State Auditor -"
"2127","Securities Commission (WVASC) issued a Summary Order to Cease and Desist and"
"2128","Notice of Right to Hearing to Invesco and Invesco Aim Distributors (Order No."
"2129","05-1318). The WVASC makes findings of fact that Invesco and Invesco Aim"
"2130","Distributors entered into certain arrangements permitting market timing of the"
"2131","AIM Funds and failed to disclose these arrangements in the prospectuses for such"
"2132","Funds, and conclusions of law to the effect that Invesco and Invesco Aim"
"2133","Distributors violated the West Virginia securities laws. The WVASC orders"
"2134","Invesco and Invesco Aim Distributors to cease any further violations and seeks"
"2135","to impose monetary sanctions, including restitution to affected investors,"
"2136","disgorgement of fees, reimbursement of investigatory, administrative and legal"
"2137","costs and an administrative assessment, to be determined by the Commissioner."
"2138","Initial research indicates that these damages could be limited or capped by"
"2139","statute. By agreement with the Commissioner of Securities, Invesco's time to"
"2140","respond to that Order has been indefinitely suspended."
"2141","Private Civil Actions Alleging Market Timing"
"2142","          Multiple civil lawsuits, including purported class action and"
"2143","shareholder derivative suits, have been filed against various parties"
"2144","(including, depending on the lawsuit, certain AIM Funds, IFG, Invesco, Invesco"
"2145","Aim Management Group, Inc. and certain related entities, certain of their"
"2146","current and former"

"2149","officers and/or certain unrelated third parties) based on allegations of"
"2150","improper market timing and related activity in the AIM Funds. These lawsuits"
"2151","allege a variety of theories of recovery, including but not limited to: (i)"
"2152","violation of various provisions of the Federal and state securities laws; (ii)"
"2153","violation of various provisions of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of"
"2154","1974, as amended (ERISA); (iii) breach of fiduciary duty; and/or (iv) breach of"
"2155","contract. These lawsuits were initiated in both Federal and state courts and"
"2156","seek such remedies as compensatory damages; restitution; injunctive relief;"
"2157","disgorgement of management fees; imposition of a constructive trust; removal of"
"2158","certain directors and/or employees; various corrective measures under ERISA;"
"2159","rescission of certain Funds' advisory agreements; interest; and attorneys' and"
"2160","experts' fees. All lawsuits based on allegations of market timing, late trading,"
"2161","and related issues have been transferred to the United States District Court for"
"2162","the District of Maryland (the MDL Court) for consolidated or coordinated"
"2163","pre-trial proceedings."
"2164","          Pursuant to an Order of the MDL Court, plaintiffs in these lawsuits"
"2165","consolidated their claims for pre-trial purposes into three amended complaints"
"2166","against various Invesco - and IFG-related parties. The parties in the amended"
"2167","complaints have agreed in principle to settle the actions. A list identifying"
"2168","the amended complaints in the MDL Court and details of the settlements are"
"2169","discussed below."

"2175","          2004."
"2176","     -    CYNTHIA ESSENMACHER, ET AL., Derivatively on Behalf of the Mutual"
"2177","          Funds, Trusts and Corporations Comprising the Invesco and AIM Family"
"2178","          of Mutual Funds v. AMVESCAP, PLC, ET AL., in the MDL Court (Case No."
"2179","          04-MD-15864-FPS; No. 04-819), filed on September 29, 2004."
"2180","     -    MIRIAM CALDERON, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY"

"2182","          1:04-MD-15864-FPS), filed on September 29, 2004."
"2183","          On March 1, 2006, the MDL Court dismissed all derivative causes of"
"2184","action in the Essenmacher lawsuit but two: (i) the excessive fee claim under"
"2185","Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act); and (ii) the"
"2186","control person liability claim under Section 48 of the 1940 Act, and all"
"2187","claims asserted in the Lepera class action lawsuit but three: (i) the securities"
"2188","fraud claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (ii)"
"2189","the excessive fee claim under Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act (which survived only"
"2190","insofar as plaintiffs seek recovery of fees associated with the assets involved"
"2191","in market timing); and (iii) the control person liability claim under Section"
"2192","48 of the 1940 Act. On June 14, 2006, the MDL Court entered an order dismissing"
"2193","the Section 48 claim in the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuit. Based on the MDL"
"2194","Court's March 1, 2006 and June 14, 2006 orders, all claims asserted against the"
"2195","Funds that were transferred to the MDL Court were dismissed, although certain"
"2196","Funds remain nominal defendants in the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuit. On"
"2197","January 5, 2008, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle both"
"2198","the class action (Lepera) and the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuits, subject to"
"2199","the MDL Court approval. Individual class members have the right to object."
"2200","          On September 15, 2006, Judge Motz for the MDL Court granted the"
"2201","Defendants' motion to dismiss the ERISA (Calderon) lawsuit and dismissed such"
"2202","lawsuit. The Plaintiff appealed this decision. On June 16, 2008, the Fourth"
"2203","Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal and remanded this lawsuit back"
"2204","to the MDL Court for further proceedings. On December 15, 2008, the parties"
"2205","reached an agreement in principle to settle this lawsuit, subject to the MDL"
"2206","Court approval. Individual class members have the right to object. No payments"
"2207","are required under the settlement; however, the parties agreed that certain"
"2208","limited changes to benefit plans and participants' accounts would be made."

"2383","listed on the Exhibits to this Memorandum of Agreement (the Funds), and"
"2384","Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco), successor by merger to Invesco Aim Advisors,"
"2385","Inc. Invesco shall and hereby agrees to waive fees or reimburse expenses of each"
"2386","Fund, on behalf of its respective classes as applicable, severally and not"
"2387","jointly, as indicated in the attached Exhibits."
"2388","     For and in consideration of the mutual terms and agreements set forth"
"2389","herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of"
"2390","which is hereby acknowledged, the Trusts and Invesco agree as follows:"
"2391","     For the Contractual Limits (listed in Exhibits A - C), the Trusts and"
"2392","Invesco agree until at least the expiration date set forth on the attached"
"2393","Exhibits A - C (the Expiration Date) that Invesco will waive its fees or"
"2394","reimburse expenses to the extent that expenses of a class of a Fund (excluding"
"2395","(i) interest; (ii) taxes; (iii) dividend expense on short sales; (iv)"
"2396","extraordinary or non-routine items; (v) expenses related to a merger or"
"2397","reorganization, as approved by the Funds' Boards of Trustees; (vi) expenses of"
"2398","the underlying funds that are paid indirectly as a result of share ownership of"
"2399","the underlying funds; and (vii) expenses that each Fund has incurred but did not"
"2400","actually pay because of an expense offset arrangement, if applicable) exceed the"
"2401","rate, on an annualized basis, set forth on the Exhibits of the average daily net"
"2402","assets allocable to such class. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Funds"
"2403","indicated on Exhibits A - C with an asterisk, Invesco will waive its fees or"

"2409","rate, on an annualized basis, set forth on the Exhibits of the average daily net"
"2410","assets allocable to such class. Acquired fund fees and expenses are not fees or"
"2411","expenses incurred by a fund directly but are expenses of the investment"
"2412","companies in which a fund invests. These fees and expenses are incurred"
"2413","indirectly through the valuation of a fund's investment in these investment"
"2414","companies. Acquired fund fees and expenses are required to be disclosed and"
"2415","included in the total annual fund operating expenses in the prospectus fee"
"2416","table. As a result, the net total annual fund operating expenses shown in the"
"2417","prospectus fee table may exceed the expense limits reflected in Exhibits A-C."
"2418","With regard to the Contractual Limits, the Board of Trustees of the Trust and"
"2419","Invesco may terminate or modify this Memorandum of Agreement prior to the"
"2420","Expiration Date only by mutual written consent. Invesco will not have any right"
"2421","to reimbursement of any amount so waived or reimbursed."
"2422","     For the Contractual Limits, each of the Trusts and Invesco agree to review"
"2423","the then-current expense limitations for each class of each Fund listed on the"
"2424","Exhibits on a date prior to the Expiration Date to determine whether such"
"2425","limitations should be amended, continued or terminated. The expense limitations"
"2426","will expire upon the Expiration Date unless the Trusts and Invesco have agreed"
"2427","to continue them. The Exhibits will be amended to reflect any such agreement."
"2428","     For the Voluntary Limits (listed in Exhibits A - C), the Trusts and Invesco"
"2429","agree that these are not contractual in nature and that Invesco may establish,"
"2430","amend and/or terminate such expense limitations at any time in its sole"
"2431","discretion after consultation with the Funds' Boards of Trustees. Any delay or"
"2432","failure by Invesco to update this Memorandum of Agreement with regards to the"
"2433","terminations, extensions, or expirations of the Voluntary Limits shall have no"
"2434","effect on the term of such Voluntary Limitations; the Voluntary Limitations are"

"2436","     It is expressly agreed that the obligations of each Trust hereunder shall"
"2437","not be binding upon any of the Trustees, shareholders, nominees, officers,"
