"1198","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1199","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"1200","Steward Funds, Inc. and Capstone Series Fund, Inc."
"1201","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Steward"
"1202","Funds, Inc. comprising Steward Large Cap Enhanced Index Fund, Steward Select"
"1203","Bond Fund, Steward International Enhanced Index Fund, and Steward Global"
"1204","Equity Income Fund, and Capstone Series Fund, Inc. comprising Steward"
"1205","Small-Mid Cap Enhanced Index Fund (collectively referred to as the Funds),"
"1206","as of and for the year ended April 30, 2016, in accordance with the standards"
"1207","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1208","considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1209","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1210","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1211","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1212","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"1213","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1214","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1215","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1216","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1217","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"1218","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1219","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1220","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1221","accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A fund's internal control over financial"
"1222","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1223","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1224","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"1225","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1226","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that"
"1227","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"1228","authorizations of management and directors of the fund; and (3) provide"
"1229","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1230","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"1231","effect on the financial statements."
"1232","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1233","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1234","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1235","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1236","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1237","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1238","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"1239","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1240","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"1241","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1242","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1243","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"1244","on a timely basis."
"1245","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"1246","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1247","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1248","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"1249","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"1250","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"1251","over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as"
"1252","defined above as of April 30, 2016."
"1253","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"1254","the Board of Directors of the Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"1255","and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"1256","specified parties."

"1267","The Steward Funds have been named as defendants and as putative members of a"
"1268","proposed defendant class in Kirschner v. FitzSimons (In re Tribune Co.), No."
"1269","12-2652 (S.D.N.Y.) (the FitzSimons action) and Deutsche Bank Trust Co."
"1270","Americas v. Employees Retirement Fund of the City of Dallas, Texas, No."
"1271","11-9568 (S.D.N.Y.) (the Deutsche Bank action) as a result of the sale by"
"1272","Steward Large Cap Enhanced Index Fund (then known as Steward Domestic All-Cap"
"1273","Equity Fund) and Steward Multi- Manager Equity Fund (a fund that is no longer"
"1274","in existence) of their shares in the Tribune Company (Tribune) in a 2007"
"1275","leveraged buyout transaction (LBO) by which Tribune converted to a"
"1276","privately-held company. Both lawsuits have been consolidated with the majority"
"1277","of the other Tribune-related lawsuits in the multidistrict litigation proceeding"
"1278","In re Tribune Co. Fraudulent Conveyance Litig., No. 11-2296 (S.D.N.Y.) (the"
"1279","MDL Proceeding). None of these lawsuits alleges any wrongdoing on the part"
"1280","of the Steward Funds. On September 23, 2013, the Court granted the defendants'"
"1281","motion to dismiss the Deutsche Bank action on the basis that the plaintiffs"
"1282","lacked standing. Both sides appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals"
"1283","for the Second Circuit. On March 29, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the"
"1284","Second Circuit issued its opinion on the appeal of the Deutsche Bank action and"
"1285","other similar Tribune-related lawsuits. The appeals court affirmed the district"
"1286","court's dismissal of those lawsuits, but on different grounds than the district"
"1287","court. The appeals court held that while the plaintiffs have standing under the"
"1288","U.S. Bankruptcy Code (which was the basis for the district court's dismissal),"
"1289","their claims were preempted by Section 546(e) of the Bankruptcy Code-the"
"1290","statutory safe harbor for settlement payments.On April 12, 2016, the plaintiffs"
"1291","in those actions filed a motion seeking an en banc hearing before the appeals"
"1292","court. The court has not yet issued a decision on that motion."
"1293","On May 23, 2014, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the Fifth Amended"
"1294","Complaint in the FitzSimons action, including a global motion to dismiss Count"
"1295","I, which is the claim brought against former Tribune shareholders for"
"1296","intentional fraudulent conveyance under U.S. federal law. The Court has not yet"
"1297","issued a decision on any of these motions. At this state of the proceedings, the"
"1298","Steward Funds are not able to make a reliable prediction as to these lawsuits or"
"1299","the effect, if any, on the net asset value of the Funds."
