"2138","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2139","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"2140","of SunAmerica Income Funds"
"2141","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"2142","SunAmerica Income Funds (the Funds) as of and for the year ended"
"2143","March 31, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"2144","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"2145","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"2146","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"2147","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"2148","to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2149","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control"
"2150","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"2151","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"2152","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"2153","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"2154","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required"
"2155","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's"
"2156","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"2157","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"2158","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"2159","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control"
"2160","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"2161","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"2162","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"2163","funds; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2164","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"2165","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"2166","expenditures of the funds are being made only in accordance with"
"2167","authorizations of management and trustees of the funds; and (3)  provide"
"2168","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"2169","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could"
"2170","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2171","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2172","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any"
"2173","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"2174","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"2175","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2176","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"2177","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"2178","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"2179","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"2180","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"2181","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"2182","material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial statements"
"2183","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2184","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"2185","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"2186","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"2187","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established"
"2188","by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"2189","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over"
"2190","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"2191","securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as"
"2192","of March 31, 2010."
"2193","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"2194","and the Board of Trustees of SunAmerica Income Funds and the"
"2195","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should"
"2196","not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"2278","        1.	Duties of the Subadviser.  The Adviser hereby"
"2279","engages the services of the Subadviser in furtherance of its"
"2280","Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with the Trust."
"2281","Pursuant to this Subadvisory Agreement and subject to the"
"2282","oversight and review of the Adviser, the Subadviser will manage"
"2283","the investment and reinvestment of a portion of the assets of each"
"2284","Fund listed on Schedule A attached hereto.  The Subadviser will"
"2285","determine in its discretion, and subject to the oversight and review"

"2287","the Adviser with records concerning its activities which the"

"2289","reports to the Adviser and to officers and Trustees of the Trust"
"2290","concerning its discharge of the foregoing responsibilities.  The"
"2291","Subadviser shall discharge the foregoing responsibilities subject to"

"2293","compliance with such policies as the Trustees of the Trust may"
"2294","from time to time establish and communicate to the Subadviser,"
"2295","and in compliance with (a) the objectives, policies, and limitations"
"2296","for the Fund set forth in the Trust's current prospectus and"
"2297","statement of additional information as provided to the Subadviser,"
"2298","and (b) applicable laws and regulations."
"2299","               The Subadviser represents and warrants to the"
"2300","Adviser that the assets of each Fund set forth in Schedule A, or"
"2301","portion of each Fund's assets, managed by it will at all times be"
"2302","operated and managed in compliance with all applicable federal"
"2303","and state laws governing its operations and investments.  Without"
"2304","limiting the foregoing and subject to Section 9(c) hereof, the"
"2305","Subadviser represents and warrants (1) that the Subadviser's"
"2306","management of the assets of a Fund will be designed to achieve"
"2307","qualification by each Fund to be treated as a regulated investment
company under subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue"
"2308","Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), and (2) compliance with"
"2309","(a) the provisions of the Act and rules adopted thereunder that"
"2310","relate to the investment of Fund assets, including depositing those"
"2311","assets in custody with institutions designated by the Trust; and (b)"
"2312","applicable federal and state securities and commodities laws (other"
"2313","than state securities laws relating to the amount of Fund shares that"
"2314","may be sold in a particular state); provided that for purposes of"
"2315","Section 17(a), (d) and (e), the Subadviser shall effect compliance"
"2316","only in relation to its own affiliates and to affiliated persons"
"2317","identified to it by the Adviser.  The Subadviser further represents"
"2318","and warrants that only with respect to any statements or omissions"
"2319","made in any Registration Statement for shares of the Trust, or any"
"2320","amendment or supplement thereto, made in reliance upon and in"
"2321","conformity with information furnished by the Subadviser expressly"
"2322","for use therein, such Registration Statement and any amendments"
"2323","or supplements thereto will, when they become effective, conform"
"2324","in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act of"
"2325","1933 and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder"
"2326","(the 1933 Act) and the Act and will not contain any untrue"
"2327","statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact"
"2328","required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements"
"2329","therein not misleading."
"2330","               The Subadviser accepts such employment and"
"2331","agrees, at its own expense, to render the services set forth herein"
"2332","and to provide the office space, furnishings, equipment and"
"2333","personnel required by it to perform such services on the terms and"
"2334","for the compensation provided in this Agreement."
"2335","               The Adviser and Subadviser each agree that, to the"
"2336","extent the Subadviser is responsible for managing only a portion of"
"2337","a Fund, the Subadviser shall manage the portion of the assets of a"
"2338","Fund allocated to it as if it was a separate operating Fund and shall"
"2339","comply with this Section l (including, but not limited to, the"
"2340","investment objectives, policies and restrictions applicable to a"
"2341","Fund and qualifications of a Fund as a regulated investment"
"2342","company under the Code) only with respect to the portion of assets"
"2343","of a Fund allocated to Subadviser."
"2344","               The Subadviser agrees: (i) to maintain a level of"
"2345","errors and omissions or professional liability insurance coverage"
"2346","that, at all times during the course of this Agreement, is acceptable"
"2347","to the Adviser; and (ii) from time to time and upon reasonable"
"2348","request, to supply evidence of such coverage to the Adviser."
"2349","        2.	Fund Transactions.  (a) The Subadviser is"
"2350","responsible for decisions, and is hereby authorized, to buy or sell"
"2351","securities and other investments for each Fund, or portion of the"
"2352","Fund's assets allocated to it, broker-dealers and futures"
"2353","commission merchants' selection, and negotiation of brokerage"
"2354","commission and futures commission merchants' rates.  As a"
"2355","general matter, in executing Fund transactions, the Subadviser may"
"2356","employ or deal with such broker-dealers or futures commission"
"2357","merchants as may, in the Subadviser's best judgment, provide"
"2358","prompt and reliable execution of the transactions at favorable"
"2359","prices and reasonable commission rates.  In selecting such broker-"
"2360","dealers or futures commission merchants, the Subadviser shall"
"2361","consider all relevant factors including price (including the"
"2362","applicable brokerage commission, dealer spread or futures"
"2363","commission merchant rate), the size of the order, the nature of the"
"2364","market for the security or other investment, the timing of the"
"2365","transaction, the reputation, experience and financial stability of the"
"2366","broker-dealer or futures commission merchant involved, the"
"2367","quality of the service, the difficulty of execution, the execution"
"2368","capabilities and operational facilities of the firm involved, and, in"
"2369","the case of securities, the firm's risk in positioning a block of"
"2370","securities.  Subject to such policies as the Trustees may determine"
"2371","and consistent with Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act"
"2372","of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act), the Subadviser shall not be"
"2373","deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty"
"2374","created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of the"
"2375","Subadviser's having caused a Fund to pay a member of an"
"2376","exchange, broker or dealer an amount of commission for effecting"
"2377","a securities transaction in excess of the amount of commission"
"2378","another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have"
"2379","charged for effecting that transaction, if the Subadviser determines"
"2380","in good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in"
"2381","relation to the value of the brokerage and research services"
"2382","provided by such member of an exchange, broker or dealer viewed"
"2383","in terms of either that particular transaction or the Subadviser's"
"2384","overall responsibilities with respect to such Fund and to other"
"2385","clients as to which the Subadviser exercises investment discretion."
"2386","In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-"
"2387","2(T) thereunder, and subject to any other applicable laws and"
"2388","regulations including Section 17(e) of the Act and Rule 17e-1"
"2389","thereunder, the Subadviser may engage its affiliates, the Adviser"
"2390","and its affiliates or any other subadviser to the Trust and its"
"2391","respective affiliates, as broker-dealers or futures commission"
"2392","merchants to effect Fund transactions in securities and other"
"2393","investments for a Fund.  The Subadviser will promptly"
"2394","communicate to the Adviser and to the officers and the Trustees of"
"2395","the Trust such information relating to Fund transactions as they"
"2396","may reasonably request.  To the extent consistent with applicable"
"2397","law, the Subadviser may aggregate purchase or sell orders for the"
"2398","Fund with contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of other clients"
"2399","of the Subadviser or its affiliated persons.  In such event, allocation"
"2400","of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the expenses"
"2401","incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Subadviser in the"
"2402","manner the Subadviser determines to be equitable and consistent"
"2403","with its and its affiliates' fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to"
"2404","such other clients.  The Adviser hereby acknowledges that such"
"2405","aggregation of orders may not result in more favorable pricing or"
"2406","lower brokerage commissions in all instances."
"2407","               (b)	Notwithstanding Section 2(a) above, for"
"2408","such purposes as obtaining investment research products and"
"2409","services, covering fees and expenses, and rewarding sales or"
"2410","distribution, the Adviser may direct the Subadviser to effect a"
"2411","specific percentage of a Fund's transactions in securities and other"
"2412","investments to certain broker-dealers and futures commission"
"2413","merchants.  In designating the use of a particular broker-dealer or"
"2414","futures commission merchant, the Adviser and Subadviser"
"2415","acknowledge:  1) all brokerage transactions are subject to best"
"2416","execution.  As such, Subadviser will use its best efforts to direct"
"2417","non-risk commission transactions to a particular broker-dealer or"
"2418","futures commission merchant designated by the Adviser provided"
"2419","that the Subadviser seek to obtain best execution; 2) such direction"
"2420","may result in the Trust paying a higher commission, depending"
"2421","upon the Subadviser's arrangements with the particular broker-"
"2422","dealer or futures commission merchant, etc; 3) if the Subadviser"
"2423","directs payments of an excessive amount of commissions, the"
"2424","executions may not be accomplished as rapidly.  In addition, the"
"2425","Subadviser may forfeit the possible advantage derived from the"
"2426","aggregation of multiple orders as a single bunched transaction"
"2427","where the Subadviser would, in some instances, be in a better"
"2428","position to negotiate commissions; and 4) the Subadviser does not"
"2429","make commitments to allocate fixed or definite amounts of"
"2430","commissions to brokers.  As such, the Subadviser may be unable to"
"2431","fulfill the Adviser's request for direction due to the reasons stated"
"2432","above."
"2433","        3.	Compensation of the Subadviser.  The Subadviser"
"2434","shall not be entitled to receive any payment from the Trust and"
"2435","shall look solely and exclusively to the Adviser for payment of all"
"2436","fees for the services rendered, facilities furnished and expenses"
"2437","paid by it hereunder.  As full compensation for the Subadviser"
"2438","under this Agreement, the Adviser agrees to pay to the Subadviser"
"2439","a fee at the annual rates set forth in Schedule A hereto with respect"
"2440","to the portion of the assets managed by the Subadviser for each"
"2441","Fund listed thereon.  Such fee shall be accrued daily and paid"
"2442","monthly as soon as practicable after the end of each month (i.e.,"
"2443","the applicable annual fee rate divided by 365 applied to each prior"
"2444","days' net assets in order to calculate the daily accrual).  If the"
"2445","Subadviser shall provide its services under this Agreement for less"
"2446","than the whole of any month, the foregoing compensation shall be"
"2447","prorated.  The Adviser and Subadviser acknowledge that the Fund"
"2448","will be ultimately responsible for all brokerage commissions,"
"2449","taxes, custodian fees and any other transaction-related fees, but"
"2450","that, for the purposes of this Agreement, as between the Adviser"
"2451","and the Subadviser, the Adviser will be responsible for such"
"2452","expenses, and the Adviser authorizes the Subadviser to incur and"
"2453","pay such expenses for the Fund, as deemed appropriate by the"
"2454","Subadviser."
"2455","        4.	Other Services.  At the request of the Trust or the"
"2456","Adviser, the Subadviser in its discretion may make available to the"
"2457","Trust office facilities, equipment, personnel and other services."
"2458","Such office facilities, equipment, personnel and services shall be"
"2459","provided for or rendered by the Subadviser and billed to the Trust"
"2460","or the Adviser at the Subadviser's cost."
"2461","        5.	Reports.  The Trust, the Adviser and the"
"2462","Subadviser agree to furnish to each other, if applicable, current"
"2463","prospectuses, statements of additional information, proxy"
"2464","statements, reports of shareholders, certified copies of their"
"2465","financial statements, and such other information with regard to"
"2466","their affairs and that of the Trust as each may reasonably request."
"2467","        6.	Status of the Subadviser.  The services of the"
"2468","Subadviser to the Adviser and the Trust are not to be deemed"
"2469","exclusive, and the Subadviser shall be free to render similar"
"2470","services to others so long as its services to the Trust are not"
"2471","impaired thereby.  The Subadviser shall be deemed to be an"
"2472","independent contractor and shall, unless otherwise expressly"
"2473","provided or authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the"
"2474","Trust in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Trust."
"2475","        7.	Certain Records.  The Subadviser hereby"
"2476","undertakes and agrees to maintain, in the form and for the period"
"2477","required by Rule 31a-2 under the Act, all records relating to the"
"2478","investments of the Fund that are required to be maintained by the"
"2479","Trust pursuant to the requirements of Rule 31a-1 of that Act.  Any"
"2480","records required to be maintained and preserved pursuant to the"
"2481","provisions of Rule 31a-1 and Rule 31a-2 promulgated under the"
"2482","Act which are prepared or maintained by the Subadviser on behalf"
"2483","of the Trust are the property of the Trust and will be surrendered"
"2484","promptly to the Trust or the Adviser on request."
"2485","               The Subadviser agrees that all accounts, books and"
"2486","other records maintained and preserved by it as required hereby"
"2487","shall be subject at any time, and from time to time, to such"
"2488","reasonable periodic, special and other examinations by the"
"2489","Securities and Exchange Commission, the Trust's auditors, the"
"2490","Trust or any representative of the Trust, the Adviser, or any"
"2491","governmental agency or other instrumentality having regulatory"
"2492","authority over the Trust."
"2493","        8.	Reference to the Subadviser.  Neither the Trust"
"2494","nor the Adviser or any affiliate or agent thereof shall make"
"2495","reference to or use the name or logo of the Subadviser or any of its"
"2496","affiliates in any advertising or promotional materials without the"
"2497","prior approval of the Subadviser, which approval shall not be"
"2498","unreasonably withheld."
"2499","        9.	Liability of the Subadviser.  1)a.In the absence of"
"2500","willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless"
"2501","disregard of obligations or duties (disabling conduct) hereunder"
"2502","on the part of the Subadviser (and its officers, directors, agents,"
"2503","employees, controlling persons, shareholders and any other person"
"2504","or entity affiliated with the Subadviser) the Subadviser shall not be"
"2505","subject to liability to the Trust or to any shareholder of the Trust"

"2509","of them in connection with the matters to which this Agreement"
"2510","relates, except to the extent specified in Section 36(b) of the Act"
"2511","concerning loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty with"
"2512","respect to the receipt of compensation for services. Except for such"
"2513","disabling conduct, the Adviser shall indemnify the Subadviser (and"
"2514","its officers, directors, partners, agents, employees, controlling"
"2515","persons, shareholders and any other person or entity affiliated with"
"2516","the Subadviser) (collectively, the Indemnified Parties) from any"

"2520","hold harmless the Adviser, its officers, directors, partners, agents,"

"2525","(including legal and other expenses), to which the Adviser, its"

"2527","persons, shareholders and any other person or entity affiliated with"
"2528","the Adviser may become subject under the 1933 Act, under other"
"2529","statutes, at common law or otherwise, which may be based upon (i)"
"2530","any wrongful act or breach of this Agreement by the Subadviser, or"
"2531","(ii) any failure by the Subadviser to comply with the"
"2532","representations and warranties set forth in Section 1 of this"
"2533","Agreement; provided, however, that in no case is the Subadviser's"
"2534","indemnity in favor of any person deemed to protect such other"
"2535","persons against any liability to which such person would otherwise"
"2536","be subject by reasons of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross"
"2537","negligence in the performance of his, her or its duties or by reason"
"2538","of his, her or its reckless disregard of obligation and duties under"
"2539","this Agreement."
"2540","               (c)	The Subadviser shall not be liable to the"
"2541","Adviser, its officers, directors, agents, employees, controlling"

"2551","assets managed by the Subadviser, otherwise available to the"
"2552","Subadviser upon reasonable request.  The Adviser shall indemnify"
"2553","the Indemnified Parties from any and all losses, claims, damages,"
"2554","liabilities or litigation (including reasonable legal and other"

"2556","any other subadviser with respect to the portion of a Fund's assets"
"2557","not allocated to the Subadviser and with respect to any other Fund"
"2558","of the Trust."
