"2044","Mason BW Absolute Return Opportunities Fund (five of the funds"

"2046","Company) as of and for the year ended October 31, 2015, in"
"2047","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"2048","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Company's internal"
"2049","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"2050","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"2051","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"2052","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2053","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal"
"2054","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"

"2057","The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and"
"2058","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"2059","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"2060","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A"

"2062","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"2063","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"2064","purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"2065","A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"2066","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"2067","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"2068","and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"2069","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2070","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"2071","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"2072","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"

"2115","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2116","To the Board of Trustees of Legg Mason Global Asset Management Trust"
"2117","and Shareholders of Legg Mason BW Alternative Credit Fund:"
"2118","In planning and performing our audit of the  financial statements of Legg"
"2119","Mason BW Alternative Credit Fund (one of the funds comprising Legg"
"2120","Mason Global Asset Management Trust, the Company) as of and for the"
"2121","year ended October 31, 2015, in accordance with the standards of the"
"2122","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"2123","considered the Company's internal control over financial reporting,"
"2124","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"2125","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"2126","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"2127","SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"2128","effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting."
"2129","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"2130","Company's internal control over financial reporting."
"2131","The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and"
"2132","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"2133","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"2134","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"2135","A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"2136","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"2137","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"2138","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2139","principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"2140","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2141","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2142","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"2143","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"2144","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"2145","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"2146","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"2147","authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3)"
"2148","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"2149","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"2150","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2151","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2152","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"

"2154","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"2155","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"2156","deteriorate."
"2157","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"2158","design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"2159","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"2160","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
