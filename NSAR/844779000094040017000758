"3848","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"3849","Oversight Board (United States)(PCAOB), we considered the Funds'"

"3856","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3857","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"

"3859","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"3860","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"

"3862","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"3863","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"3864","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"3865","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over"
"3866","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"3867","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"3868","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"3869","the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"

"3881","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"3882","conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"3883","procedures may deteriorate."
"3884","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"3885","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"3886","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"3887","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"

"3893","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"

"4078","Attached please find as an exhibit to Sub-Item 77D of Form N-"

"4080","strategies approved by the Registrant's Board of Trustees on"

"4082","BlackRock FundsSM:  BlackRock Advantage International Fund 77D"
"4083","Policies with respect to security investments"
"4084","On March 23, 2017, the Board of Trustees (the Board) of"
"4085","BlackRock FundsSM (the Trust) approved certain changes to the"
"4086","investment strategies of BlackRock Global Opportunities"
"4087","Portfolio, a series of the Trust.  The Board also approved a"
"4088","change in the name of BlackRock Global Opportunities Portfolio"
"4089","to BlackRock Advantage International Fund (the Fund).  In"
"4090","addition, Fund management determined to make certain changes to"
"4091","the benchmark index against which the Fund measures its"
"4092","performance."
"4093","The MSCI EAFE Index(r) (the MSCI EAFE Index) is the new benchmark"
"4094","against which the Fund measures its performance."
"4095","Under the new investment strategies, under normal circumstances,"
"4096","the Fund seeks to invest at least 80% of its net assets plus the"
"4097","amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in non-U.S."
"4098","equity securities and equity-like instruments of companies that"
"4099","are components of, or have characteristics similar to, the"
"4100","companies included in the MSCI EAFE Index and derivatives that"
"4101","are tied economically to securities of the MSCI EAFE Index. The"
"4102","MSCI EAFE Index is a capitalization-weighted index from a broad"
"4103","range of industries chosen for market size, liquidity and"
"4104","industry group representation. Equity securities include common"
"4105","stock, preferred stock and convertible securities. The Fund"
"4106","primarily seeks to buy common stock and may also invest in"
"4107","preferred stock and convertible securities."
"4108","From time to time, the Fund may invest in shares of companies"
"4109","through new issues or initial public offerings (IPOs). The"
"4110","Fund will invest in securities of non-U.S. issuers that can be"
"4111","U.S. dollar based or non-U.S. dollar based on a hedged or"
"4112","unhedged basis. The Fund may enter into currency transactions on"
"4113","a hedged or unhedged basis in order to seek total return."
"4114","The Fund may use derivatives, including options, futures, swaps,"
"4115","forward contracts and contracts for difference, both to seek to"
"4116","increase the return of the Fund and to hedge (or protect) the"
"4117","value of its assets against adverse movements in currency"
"4118","exchange rates, interest rates and movements in the securities"
"4119","markets. In order to manage cash flows into or out of the Fund"
"4120","effectively, the Fund may buy and sell financial futures"
"4121","contracts or options on such contracts. Derivatives are"
"4122","financial instruments whose value is derived from another"
"4123","security, a currency or an index, including but not limited to"
"4124","the MSCI EAFE Index. The use of options, futures, swaps, forward"
"4125","contracts and contracts for difference can be effective in"
"4126","protecting or enhancing the value of the Fund's assets."
"4127","The Fund may seek to provide exposure to the investment returns"
"4128","of real assets that trade in the commodity markets through"
"4129","investment in commodity-linked derivative instruments and"
"4130","investment vehicles such as exchange-traded funds that invest"
"4131","exclusively in commodities and are designed to provide this"
"4132","exposure without direct investment in physical commodities"
"4133","These changes to the investment strategies of the Fund and the"
"4134","name change and benchmark change became effective June 12, 2017."

"4151","Policies with respect to security investments"
"4152","On March 23, 2017, the Board of Trustees (the Board) of"
"4153","BlackRock FundsSM (the Trust) approved certain changes to the"
"4154","investment objective and investment strategies of BlackRock"
"4155","International Opportunities Portfolio, a series of the Trust."
"4156","The Board also approved a change in the name of BlackRock"
"4157","International Opportunities Portfolio to BlackRock
International Dividend Fund (the Fund)."
"4158","The new investment objective of the Fund is to seek long-term"
"4159","total return and current income."
"4160","Under the new investment strategies, under normal circumstances,"
"4161","the Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets plus the"
"4162","amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in dividend-"
"4163","paying equity securities issued by foreign companies of any"
"4164","market capitalization and derivatives that have similar economic"
"4165","characteristics to such securities. Foreign securities may"
"4166","include securities (i) of foreign government issuers, (ii) of"
"4167","issuers organized or located outside the United States, (iii) of"
"4168","issuers which primarily trade in a market located outside the"
"4169","United States, or (iv) of issuers doing a substantial amount of"
"4170","business outside the United States, which the Fund considers to"
"4171","be companies that derive at least 50% of their revenue or"
"4172","profits from business outside the United States or have at least"
"4173","50% of their sales or assets outside the United States. The Fund"
"4174","will allocate its assets among various regions and countries"
"4175","(but in no less than three different countries). For temporary"
"4176","defensive purposes the Fund may deviate very substantially from"
"4177","this allocation."
"4178","The Fund will primarily invest in equity securities, which"
"4179","include common stock, preferred stock, securities convertible"
"4180","into common and preferred stock and non-convertible preferred"
"4181","stock. The Fund may invest in securities of non-U.S. issuers"
"4182","that can be U.S. dollar based or non-U.S. dollar based. The Fund"
"4183","may invest in securities of companies of any market"
"4184","capitalization, but intends to invest primarily in securities of"
"4185","large capitalization companies. The combination of equity"
"4186","securities will be varied from time to time both with respect to"
"4187","types of securities and markets in response to changing market"
"4188","and economic trends. The Fund may invest in shares of companies"
"4189","through initial public offerings (IPOs) or new issues."
"4190","The Fund may invest up to 20% of its net assets in global fixed-"
"4191","income securities, including corporate bonds, U.S. Government"
"4192","debt securities, non-U.S. Government and supranational debt"
"4193","securities (an example of such an entity is the International"
"4194","Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the World Bank)),"
"4195","asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate"
"4196","loans, emerging market debt securities and non-investment grade"
"4197","debt securities (high yield or junk bonds). Investment in fixed-"
"4198","income securities will be made on an opportunistic basis. The"
"4199","Fund may invest in fixed-income securities of any duration or"
"4200","maturity."
"4201","The Fund has no geographic limits in where it may invest outside"
"4202","of the United States and has no specific policy on the number of"
"4203","different countries in which it will invest. The Fund may invest"
"4204","in both developed and emerging markets."
"4205","The Fund may use derivatives, including options, futures,"
"4206","indexed securities, inverse securities, swaps and forward"
"4207","contracts, both to seek to increase the return of the Fund or to"
"4208","hedge (or protect) the value of its assets against adverse"
"4209","movements in currency exchange rates, interest rates and"
"4210","movements in the securities markets. The Fund may enter into"
"4211","currency transactions on a hedged or unhedged basis in order to"
"4212","seek total return. The Fund may, when consistent with its"
"4213","investment objective, buy or sell options or futures on a"
"4214","security or an index of securities and may buy options on a"
"4215","currency or a basket of currencies, or enter into foreign"
"4216","currency transactions, including swaps. The Fund may also use"
"4217","forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which are"
"4218","obligations to buy or sell a currency at a pre-determined rate"
"4219","in the future. Derivatives are financial instruments whose value"
"4220","is derived from another security, a currency or an index. The"
"4221","use of options, futures, indexed securities, inverse securities,"
"4222","swaps and forward contracts can be effective in protecting or"
"4223","enhancing the value of the Fund's assets. The Fund may, but"
"4224","under normal market conditions generally does not intend to, use"
"4225","derivatives for speculation to increase returns."
"4226","The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of portfolio"
"4227","securities to achieve its principal investment strategies."
"4228","The Fund is classified as diversified under the Investment"
"4229","Company Act of 1940, as amended."
"4230","These changes to the investment objective and investment"
"4231","strategies of the Fund and the name change became effective June"

"4251","On March 23, 2017, the Board of Trustees (the Board) of"
"4252","BlackRock FundsSM (the Trust) approved certain changes to the"
"4253","investment objective and investment strategies of BlackRock U.S."
"4254","Opportunities Portfolio, a series of the Trust.  The Board also"
"4255","approved a change in the name of BlackRock U.S. Opportunities"
"4256","Portfolio to BlackRock High Equity Income Fund (the Fund)."
"4257","In addition, Fund management determined to make certain changes"
"4258","to the benchmark index against which the Fund measures its"
"4259","performance."
"4260","The new investment objective of the Fund is to seek high current"
"4261","income with consideration for capital appreciation, and the"
"4262","Russell 1000 Value(r) Index is the new benchmark against which the"
"4263","Fund measures its performance."
"4264","Under the new investment strategies, the Fund seeks to achieve"
"4265","its investment objective by investing primarily in a diversified"
"4266","portfolio of equity securities. Under normal circumstances, the"
"4267","Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets plus the amount"
"4268","of any borrowings for investment purposes in equity securities"
"4269","and equity-related instruments, including equity-linked notes."
"4270","The Fund may invest in securities of companies with any market"
"4271","capitalization, but will generally focus on large cap"
"4272","securities. The Fund may invest up to 50% of its assets in"
"4273","equity-linked notes that provide exposure to equity securities"
"4274","and covered call options or other types of financial"
"4275","instruments."
"4276","With respect to the Fund's equity investments, the Fund may"
"4277","invest in common stock, preferred stock, securities convertible"
"4278","into common and preferred stock and non-convertible preferred"
"4279","stock. The Fund generally intends to invest in dividend paying"
"4280","stocks. From time to time, the Fund may invest in shares of"
"4281","companies through initial public offerings (IPOs). The Fund"
"4282","may invest up to 25% of its total assets in securities of"
"4283","foreign issuers. The Fund may invest in securities from any"
"4284","country, including emerging markets. The Fund may invest in"
"4285","securities denominated in both U.S. dollars and non-U.S. dollar"
"4286","currencies. BlackRock chooses investments for the Fund that it"
"4287","believes will both provide current income and current gains as"
"4288","well as increase in value over the long term."
"4289","The Fund's portfolio, in the aggregate, will be structured in a"
"4290","manner designed to deliver high current income with"
"4291","consideration for capital appreciation."
"4292","The Fund intends to employ a strategy of writing (selling)"
"4293","covered call and put options on common stocks, indices of"
"4294","securities, sectors of securities and baskets of securities,"
"4295","primarily through structured notes. This option strategy is"
"4296","intended to generate current gains from option premiums as a"
"4297","means to enhance distributions payable to the Fund's"
"4298","shareholders. As the Fund writes more covered call options, its"
"4299","ability to benefit from capital appreciation becomes more"
"4300","limited and the Fund's total return may deviate more from the"
"4301","returns of the Russell 1000(r) Value Index, an all equity"
"4302","benchmark. The Fund seeks to produce a high level of current"
"4303","income from dividends, and, to a lesser extent, from option"
"4304","writing premiums."
"4305","The Fund may invest in master limited partnerships (MLPs) that"
"4306","are generally in energy- and financial-related industries and in"
"4307","U.S. and non-U.S. real estate investment trusts (REITs), as"
"4308","well as structured products, including equity-linked notes, to"
"4309","maximize the Fund's current income."
"4310","The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of portfolio"
"4311","securities to achieve its primary investment strategies."

"4345","Under the new investment strategies, under normal circumstances,"
"4346","the Fund seeks to invest at least 80% of its net assets plus the"
"4347","amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in large cap"
"4348","equity securities of U.S. issuers and derivatives that have"
"4349","similar economic characteristics to such securities. For"

"4351","are equity securities that at the time of purchase have a market"
"4352","capitalization within the range of companies included in the"
"4353","Russell 1000 Growth Index. The Fund is a growth fund and"

"4356","other financial instruments that are components of, or have"
"4357","characteristics similar to, the securities included in the"

"4360","chosen for market size, liquidity and industry group"

"4362","may also invest in preferred stock and convertible securities."
"4363","From time to time, the Fund may invest in shares of companies"
"4364","through new issues or initial public offerings (IPOs). The"
"4365","Fund may use derivatives, including options, futures, swaps,"

"4367","increase the return of the Fund and to hedge (or protect) the"

"4369","and movements in the securities markets. In order to manage cash"

"4372","Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived"
