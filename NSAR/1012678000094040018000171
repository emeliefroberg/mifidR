"534","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"535","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of T. Rowe Price Mid-"
"536","Cap Value Fund, Inc."
"537","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"538","of T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Value Fund, Inc. (the Company) as of"
"539","and for the year ended December 31, 2017, in accordance with the"
"540","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"541","(United States), we considered the Company's internal control"
"542","over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"543","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"544","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"545","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"546","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"547","effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial"
"548","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"549","effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial"
"550","reporting."
"551","The management of the Company is responsible for establishing"
"552","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"553","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"554","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"555","benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"556","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"557","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"558","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"559","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"560","accounting principles.  A company's internal control over"
"561","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"562","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"563","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"564","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"565","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"566","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"567","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"568","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"569","with authorizations of management and directors of the company;"
"570","and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"571","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"572","of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"573","financial statements."
"574","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"575","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"576","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"577","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"578","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"579","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"580","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"581","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"582","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"583","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"584","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"585","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"586","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"587","material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim"
"588","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"589","timely basis."
"590","Our consideration of the Company's internal control over"
"591","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the"
"592","first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"593","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that"
"594","might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"595","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"596","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Company's internal"
"597","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"598","controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be"
"599","material weaknesses as defined above as of December 31, 2017."
"600","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"601","management and the Board of Directors of T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap"
"602","Value Fund, Inc. and the Securities and Exchange Commission and"
"603","is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"604","than these specified parties."

"615","T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Value Fund, Inc. (the fund) is registered"
"616","under the"
"617","Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act) as a diversified,"
"618","open-end"
"619","management investment company. The fund seeks to provide long-"
"620","term capital"
"621","appreciation by investing primarily in mid-sized companies that"
"622","appear to be"
"623","undervalued. The fund has four classes of shares: the Mid-Cap"
"624","Value Fund"
"625","(Investor Class), the Mid-Cap Value Fund-Advisor Class (Advisor"
"626","Class), the"
"627","Mid-Cap Value Fund-R Class (R Class), and the Mid-Cap Value"
"628","Fund-I Class"
"629","(I Class). Advisor Class shares are sold only through"
"630","unaffiliated brokers and"
"631","other unaffiliated financial intermediaries, and R Class shares"
"632","are available"
"633","to retirement plans serviced by intermediaries. I Class shares"
"634","generally are"
"635","available only to investors meeting a $1,000,000 minimum"
"636","investment or"
"637","certain other criteria. The Advisor Class and R Class each"
"638","operate under"
"639","separate Board-approved Rule 12b-1 plans, pursuant to which each"
"640","class"
"641","compensates financial intermediaries for distribution,"
"642","shareholder servicing,"
"643","and/or certain administrative services; the Investor and I"
"644","Classes do not pay"
"645","Rule 12b-1 fees. Each class has exclusive voting rights on"
"646","matters related solely"
"647","to that class; separate voting rights on matters that relate to"
"648","all classes; and, in"
"649","all other respects, the same rights and obligations as the other"
"650","classes."
"651","The fund is a named defendant or in a class of defendants in a"
"652","lawsuit that the"
"653","Unsecured Creditors Committee (the Committee) of the Tribune"
"654","Company has"
"655","filed in Delaware bankruptcy court. The Committee is seeking to"
"656","recover all"
"657","payments made to beneficial owners of common stock in connection"
"658","with a"
"659","leveraged buyout (LBO) of Tribune, including those made in"
"660","connection with"
"661","a 2007 tender offer in which the fund participated. A motion to"
"662","dismiss was"
"663","filed in this case and the district court granted the motion on"
"664","January 9, 2017."
"665","The fund was named, also, as a defendant or included in a class"
"666","of defendants"
"667","in parallel litigation, which was dismissed by the district"
"668","court and affirmed on"
"669","appeal by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. This second"
"670","action asserted"
"671","state law constructive fraudulent transfer claims in an attempt"
"672","to recover"
"673","stock redemption payments made to shareholders at the time of"
"674","the LBO. The"
"675","plaintiffs in this second action filed a petition for a writ of"
"676","certiorari with the"
"677","U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court removed the petition"
"678","from its"
"679","December 9, 2016 calendar and the matter has not yet been"
"680","rescheduled. The"
"681","complaints allege no misconduct by the fund, and management has"
"682","vigorously"
"683","defended the lawsuits. The value of the proceeds received by the"
"684","fund is"
"685","$70,070,000 (0.50% of net assets), and the fund will incur legal"
"686","expenses."
"687","Management continues to assess the case and has not yet"
"688","determined the"
"689","effect, if any, on the fund's net assets and results of"
"690","operations."
