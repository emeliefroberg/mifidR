"706","opinion on the  effectiveness  of  the Funds'  internal  control over  financial"
"707","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"708","The  management of the Funds is responsible  for establishing   and  maintaining"
"709","effective   internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  In  fulfilling  this"
"710","responsibility, estimates and  judgments  by management  are  required to assess"
"711","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's  internal  control"
"712","over financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance"
"713","regarding  the   reliability  of  financial  reporting  and the  preparation  of"
"714","financial  statements  for  external  purposes in  accordance  with   accounting"
"715","principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). A fund's"
"716","Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"717","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,accur-"
"718","ately and fairly  reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"719","fund; (2) provide reasonable  assurance that transactions are recorded as neces-"
"720","sary to  permit  preparation  of financial statements in  accordance  with GAAP,"
"721","and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance"
"722","with authorizations of  management and  trustees / directors  of the  fund;  and"
"723","(3) provide reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection  of"
"724","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that  could have"
"725","a material effect on the financial statements."
"726","Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting"
"727","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"728","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"729","inadequate  because of  changes in  conditions  or that the degree of compliance"
"730","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"731","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"732","or  operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"733","course of performing  their assigned functions,  to prevent or detect  misstate-"
"734","ments on a timely  basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"735","of deficiencies, in internal control over  financial  reporting, such that there"
"736","is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's annual or"
"737","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis"
"738","Our  consideration of the Funds' internal  control over financial  reporting was"
"739","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in the  first  paragraph  and  would  not"
"740","necessarily  disclose  all  deficiencies  in  internal  control  that  might  be"
"741","material weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB. However, we  noted"
"742","no  deficiencies  in the Fund's internal  control  over  financial reporting and"
"743","its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider"
"744","to be material weaknesses as defined above as of September 30, 2010."
