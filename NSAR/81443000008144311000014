"1684","July 31, 2011, in accordance with the standards of"

"1689","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"1690","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"1691","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"1692","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"1693","of the Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"1694","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1695","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"1696","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1697","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1698","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"

"1701","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"1702","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability"
"1703","of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1704","statements for external purposes in accordance"
"1705","with generally accepted accounting principles. A funds"
"1706","internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1707","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"1708","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1709","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"1710","and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"1711","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"1712","as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1713","statements in accordance with generally accepted"

"1715","of the fund are being made only in"

"1720","funds assets that could have a material effect on"
"1721","the financial statements."
"1722","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1723","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1724","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1725","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"1726","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"1727","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"1728","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1729","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1730","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1731","control does not allow management or employees,"
"1732","in the normal course of performing their assigned"

"1741","Our consideration of the Funds internal control"
