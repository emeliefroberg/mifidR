"1293","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1294","To the Board of Trustees of MFS Series Trust V and the Shareholders of MFS"
"1295","Research Fund and MFS Total Return Fund:"
"1296","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of MFS"
"1297","Research Fund and MFS Total Return Fund (each a series of MFS Series Trust V)"
"1298","(the Funds) as of and for the year ended September 30, 2016, in accordance"
"1299","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1300","States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"1301","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1302","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial"
"1303","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1304","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"1305","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1306","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1307","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1308","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1309","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"1310","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1311","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1312","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1313","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"1314","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1315","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1316","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"1317","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1318","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1319","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"1320","in accordance with authorizations of management of the fund and trustees of the"
"1321","trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1322","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets"
"1323","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1324","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1325","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1326","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1327","inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance"
"1328","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1329","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"1330","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"1331","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1332","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1333","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1334","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a fund's"
"1335","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"1336","timely basis."
"1337","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"1338","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1339","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1340","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"1341","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"1342","internal control over financial reporting and their operation, including"
"1343","controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material"
"1344","weakness, as defined above, as of September 30, 2016."
"1345","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management, the"
"1346","Board of Trustees of MFS Series Trust V and the Securities and Exchange"
"1347","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"1348","these specified parties."

"1384","                           TO THE DECLARATION OF TRUST"
"1385","      Pursuant  to  Section 9.3 of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust"
"1386","dated December 16, 2004,  as amended (the Declaration), of MFS Series Trust V,"
"1387","a business trust organized  under  the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts"
"1388","(the Trust), the undersigned, constituting  a  majority of the Trustees of the"
"1389","Trust, do hereby amend the following Sections of the Declaration to be effective"
"1390","on May 2, 2016."
"1391","      Pursuant to Section 9.3 of the Declaration,  the  undersigned  Trustees of"
"1392","the Trust, being a majority of the Trustees of the Trust, hereby replace Article"
"1393","V, Section 5.7 of the Declaration to read in its entirety as follows:"
"1394","      Section 5.7.  Claims. As used herein, a direct Shareholder claim  shall
      refer  to  (i)  a  claim  based upon alleged violations of a Shareholder's
      individual rights independent  of  any  harm  to  the  Trust,  including a
      Shareholder's voting rights under Section 6.8 hereof, rights to  receive a
      dividend  payment  as may be declared from time to time, rights to inspect
      books and records, or other similar rights personal to the Shareholder and
      independent of any harm  to the Trust; and (ii) a claim for which a direct
      shareholder action is expressly provided under the U.S. federal securities
      laws. Any claim asserted by a Shareholder that is not a direct Shareholder
      claim, including without limitation any claims purporting to be brought on
      behalf of the Trust or involving  any  alleged harm to the Trust, shall be
      considered a derivative claim as used herein.

            a. Derivative Claims. No Shareholder  shall  have the right to bring
            or  maintain  any  court  action  or  other proceeding  asserting  a
            derivative claim or any claim asserted  on  behalf  of  the Trust or
            involving any alleged harm to the Trust without first making  demand
            on  the  Trustees  requesting the Trustees to bring or maintain such
            action, proceeding or  claim. Such demand shall be excused only when
            the plaintiff makes a specific  showing that irreparable nonmonetary
            injury to the Trust or any series  or  class thereof would otherwise
            result, or if a majority of the Board of  Trustees, or a majority of
            any committee established to consider the merits of such action, has
            a material personal financial interest in the  action  at  issue.  A
            Trustee shall not be deemed to have a personal financial interest in
            an  action or otherwise be disqualified from ruling on a Shareholder
            demand by virtue of the fact that such Trustee receives remuneration
            from  his or her service on the Board of Trustees of the Trust or on
            the boards  of  one or more investment companies with the same or an
            affiliated investment  adviser or underwriter, or the amount of such
            remuneration. Such demand  shall  be  mailed to the Secretary of the
            Trust  at  the Trust's principal office and  shall  set  forth  with
            particularity the nature of the proposed court action, proceeding or
            claim and the  essential  facts  relied  upon  by the shareholder to
            support  the  allegations  made  in the demand. The  Trustees  shall
            consider such demand within 90 days  of its receipt by the Trust. In
            their sole discretion, the Trustees may  submit the matter to a vote
            of  shareholders  of  the Trust or series or  class  of  Shares,  as
            appropriate. Any decision  by  the  Trustees  to  bring, maintain or
            settle  (or  not  to  bring, maintain or settle) such court  action,
            proceeding  or  claim,  or  to  submit  the  matter  to  a  vote  of
            Shareholders, shall be binding upon the Shareholders."
"1395","      Pursuant to Section 9.3 of the  Declaration,  the  undersigned Trustees of"
"1396","the Trust, being a majority of the Trustees of the Trust,  hereby  amend Article"
"1397","VI, Section 6.2 of the Declaration to add the following language before the last"
"1398","sentence of Section 6.2:"
"1399","      The  Trust  may  enter  into  contractual arrangements with an Investment
      Adviser, Distributor, Transfer Agent,  and  other parties who each provide
      services to the Trust. Unless expressly stated otherwise, shareholders are
      not   parties   to,  or  intended  beneficiaries  of   these   contractual
      arrangements, and  these  contractual  arrangements  are  not  intended to
      create any shareholder right to enforce them against the service providers
      or  to  seek  any remedy under them against the service providers,  either
      directly or on  behalf of any series of the Trust. The summary prospectus,
      prospectus and the  Statement  of  Additional  Information  describing any
      series  of  the  Trust  are  not  contracts  between  the  Trust  and  the
      shareholders  of  any  series  of  the  Trust  and do not give rise to any
      shareholder rights other than any rights conferred  explicitly  by federal
      or state securities laws that may not be waived."
"1400","      Pursuant  to  Section 9.3 of the Declaration, the undersigned Trustees  of"
"1401","the Trust, being a majority  of  the  Trustees  of the Trust, hereby add Section"
"1402","10.7 to Article X of the Declaration to read in its entirety as follows:"
"1403","      Section  10.7.   Forum for Adjudication of Disputes.   Unless  the  Trust
      consents in writing  to  the  selection  of  an alternative forum, (i) any
      action or proceeding brought by or on behalf of  the  Trust  or any of the
      Trust's  Shareholders, (ii) any action asserting a claim against  any  the
      Trust (or  any  series  thereof), or against any trustee, officer or other
      employee of the Trust, whether  arising  under federal law, the law of any
      state, or the law of a non-U.S. jurisdiction, (iii) any action asserting a
      claim  arising  pursuant to any provision of  the  Massachusetts  Business
      Corporation Act,  the  statutory  or  common  law  of  the Commonwealth of
      Massachusetts,  the  Declaration  or  these  By-Laws, (iv) any  action  to
      interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity  of  this Declaration,
      the  Trust's  by-laws, or any agreement on behalf of the Trust  authorized
      thereunder, or  (v)  any action asserting a claim governed by the internal
      affairs doctrine (each,  a Covered Action) shall be brought in the state
      or federal courts located  within  the  Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Any
      person purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares
      of beneficial interest of the Trust shall  be (i) deemed to have notice of
      and consented to the provisions of this Section,  and  (ii) deemed to have
      waived any argument relating to the inconvenience of the forums referenced
      above  in  connection  with  any  action or proceeding described  in  this
      Section.

      If any Covered Action is filed in a  court other than the state or federal
      courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  (a  Foreign  Action) in the
      name  of  any  shareholder,  such  shareholder  shall  be  deemed to  have
      consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts
      located  within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in connection  with  any
      action brought  in  any such courts to enforce the first paragraph of this
      Section (an Enforcement  Action) and (ii) having service of process made
      upon such shareholder in any  such Enforcement Action by service upon such
      shareholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such shareholder.

      If any provision or provisions  of  this  Section  shall  be  held  to  be
      invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or circumstance
      for  any  reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
      the validity,  legality  and  enforceability  of  such provision(s) in any
      other  circumstance  and  of  the  remaining provisions  of  this  Section
      (including, without limitation, each  portion  of  any  sentence  of  this
      Section  containing  any  such  provision  held  to be invalid, illegal or
      unenforceable  that  is  not  itself  held  to  be  invalid,   illegal  or
      unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other persons  and
      circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby."
"1404","      Pursuant  to  Section  9.3 of the Declaration, the undersigned Trustees of"

"1458","             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1459","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1460","MFS Series Trust V"
"1461","In  planning  and  performing  our  audit  of  the  financial  statements of MFS"
"1462","International New Discovery Fund (the Fund) (one of the portfolios  comprising"
"1463","the  MFS  Series  Trust  V) as of and for the year ended September 30, 2016,  in"
"1464","accordance with the standards  of  the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1465","(United  States),  we  considered the Fund's  internal  control  over  financial"
"1466","reporting, including controls  over  safeguarding  securities,  as  a  basis for"
"1467","designing  our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion  on"
"1468","the financial  statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"1469","not for the purpose  of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"1470","internal control over  financial  reporting.  Accordingly,  we  express  no such"
"1471","opinion."
"1472","The  management  of  the  Fund  is  responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1473","effective  internal  control  over  financial   reporting.  In  fulfilling  this"
"1474","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1475","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A  company's  internal control"
"1476","over  financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance"
"1477","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"1478","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1479","accounting  principles.  A  company's  internal control over financial reporting"
"1480","includes those policies and procedures that  (1)  pertain  to the maintenance of"
"1481","records   that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect   the"
"1482","transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2) provide"
"1483","reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as necessary to permit"
"1484","preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with generally  accepted"
"1485","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures  of  the  company  are"
"1486","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"1487","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1488","detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"1489","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1490","Because of its  inherent  limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1491","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1492","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1493","inadequate because of changes in conditions,  or  that  the degree of compliance"
"1494","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1495","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"1496","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,  in the normal"
"1497","course   of   performing   their   assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"1498","misstatements on a timely basis. A material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or  a"
"1499","combination  of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1500","that there is  a  reasonable  possibility  that  a  material misstatement of the"
"1501","company's  annual  or  interim financial statements will  not  be  prevented  or"
"1502","detected on a timely basis."
"1503","Our consideration of the  Fund's  internal  control over financial reporting was"
"1504","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in  the first  paragraph  and  would  not"
"1505","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that"
"1506","might be material weaknesses under standards  established  by the Public Company"
"1507","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"1508","the  Fund's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  its  operation,"
"1509","including  controls  over  safeguarding  securities  that  we consider to  be  a"
"1510","material weakness as defined above as of September 30, 2016."
