"480","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT"
"481","REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"482","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"483","To the Board of Trustees of"
"484","Northern Lights Fund Trust"
"485","II"
"486","and the Shareholders of"
"487","Orchard Small Cap Value"
"488","Fund"
"489","In planning and performing our"
"490","audit of the financial"
"491","statements of Orchard Small"
"492","Cap Value Fund, a series of"
"493","shares of beneficial interest in"
"494","Northern Lights Fund Trust II"
"495","(the Fund), as of November"
"496","30, 2017, and for the year then"
"497","ended, in accordance with the"
"498","standards of the Public"
"499","Company Accounting"
"500","Oversight Board (United"
"501","States) (PCAOB), we"
"502","considered the Fund's internal"
"503","control over financial reporting,"
"504","including controls over"
"505","safeguarding securities, as a"
"506","basis for designing our"
"507","auditing procedures for the"
"508","purpose of expressing our"
"509","opinion on the financial"
"510","statements and to comply with"
"511","the requirements of Form N-"
"512","SAR, but not for the purpose"
"513","of expressing an opinion on"
"514","the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"515","internal control over financial"
"516","reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"517","express no such opinion."
"518","The management of the Fund"
"519","is responsible for establishing"
"520","and maintaining effective"
"521","internal control over financial"
"522","reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"523","responsibility, estimates and"
"524","judgments by management"
"525","are required to assess the"
"526","expected benefits and related"
"527","costs of controls.  A"
"528","company's internal control"
"529","over financial reporting is a"
"530","process designed to provide"
"531","reasonable assurance"
"532","regarding the reliability of"
"533","financial reporting and the"
"534","preparation of financial"
"535","statements for external"
"536","purposes in accordance with"
"537","accounting principles generally"
"538","accepted in the United States"
"539","of America (GAAP).  A"
"540","company's internal control"
"541","over financial reporting"
"542","includes those policies and"
"543","procedures that (1) pertain to"
"544","the maintenance of records"
"545","that, in reasonable detail,"
"546","accurately and fairly reflect the"
"547","transactions and dispositions"
"548","of the assets of the company;"
"549","(2) provide reasonable"
"550","assurance that transactions"
"551","are recorded as necessary to"
"552","permit preparation of the"
"553","financial statements in"
"554","accordance with GAAP, and"
"555","that receipts and expenditures"
"556","of the company are being"
"557","made only in accordance with"
"558","authorizations of management"
"559","and trustees of the company;"
"560","and (3) provide reasonable"
"561","assurance regarding"
"562","prevention or timely detection"
"563","of unauthorized acquisition,"
"564","use or disposition of a"
"565","company's assets that could"
"566","have a material effect on the"
"567","financial statements."
"568","Because of inherent"
"569","limitations, internal control"
"570","over financial reporting may"
"571","not prevent or detect"
"572","misstatements.  Also,"
"573","projections of any evaluation"
"574","of effectiveness to future"
"575","periods are subject to the risk"
"576","that controls may become"
"577","inadequate because of"
"578","changes in conditions or that"
"579","the degree of compliance with"
"580","the policies or procedures may"
"581","deteriorate."
"582","A deficiency in internal control"
"583","over financial reporting exists"
"584","when the design or operation"
"585","of a control does not allow"
"586","management or employees, in"
"587","the normal course of"
"588","performing their assigned"
"589","functions, to prevent or detect"
"590","misstatements on a timely"
"591","basis.  A material weakness is"
"592","a deficiency, or combination of"
"593","deficiencies, in internal control"
"594","over financial reporting, such"
"595","that there is a reasonable"
"596","possibility that a material"
"597","misstatement of the Fund's"
"598","annual or interim financial"
"599","statements will not be"
"600","prevented or detected on a"
"601","timely basis."
"602","Our consideration of the"
"603","Fund's internal control over"
"604","financial reporting was for the"
"605","limited purpose described in"
"606","the first paragraph and would"
"607","not necessarily disclose all"
"608","deficiencies in internal control"
"609","that might be material"
"610","weaknesses under standards"
"611","established by the PCAOB."
"612","However, we noted no"
"613","deficiencies in the Fund's"
"614","internal control over financial"
"615","reporting and its operation,"
"616","including controls over"
"617","safeguarding securities that"
"618","we consider to be a material"
"619","weakness, as defined above,"
"620","as of November 30, 2017."
"621","This report is intended solely"
"622","for the information and use of"
"623","management, the"
"624","shareholders of Orchard Small"
"625","Cap Value Fund, the Board of"
"626","Trustees of Northern Lights"
"627","Fund Trust II and the"
"628","Securities and Exchange"
"629","Commission and is not"
"630","intended to be and should not"
"631","be used by anyone other than"
"632","these specified parties."
