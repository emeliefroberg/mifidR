"192","<TEXT>"
"193","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"194","To the Board of Directors and"
"195","   Shareholders of"
"196","   Bullfinch Fund, Inc.:"
"197","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"198","of Bullfinch Fund, Inc."
"199","- Unrestricted Series and Bullfinch Fund, Inc - Greater Wester New"
"200","York Series (both"
"201","series constituting the Bullfinch Fund, Inc. [the Company]) as of"
"202","and for the year ended"
"203","October 31, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"204","Company Accounting"
"205","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Company's"
"206","internal control over financial"
"207","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"208","basis for designing our auditing"
"209","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"210","financial statements and to comply"
"211","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"212","expressing an opinion on the"
"213","effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial"
"214","reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"215","express no such opinion."
"216","The management of the Company is responsible for establishing"
"217","and maintaining effective"
"218","internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"219","responsibility, estimates and judgments"
"220","by management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"221","related costs of controls."
"222","A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"223","process designed to provide reasonable"
"224","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"225","preparation of financial statements"
"226","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"227","accounting principles.  A company's"
"228","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"229","and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"230"," maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"231","fairly reflect the transactions and"
"232","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"233","assurance that transactions are"
"234","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"235","in accordance with GAAP, and"
"236","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only"
"237","in accordance with authorizations"
"238","of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"239","reasonable assurance regarding"
"240","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"241","disposition of a company's assets"
"242","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"243","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"244","reporting may not prevent or"
"245","detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"246","effectiveness to future periods are"
"247","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"248","changes in conditions, or that"
"249"," the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"250","deteriorate."
"251","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"252","when the design or operation of a"
"253","control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"254","course of performing their assigned"
"255","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"256","A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"257"," or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"258","financial reporting, such that there is a"
"259","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"260","Company's annual or interim financial"
"261","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"262","Our consideration of the Company's internal control over financial"
"263","reporting was for the limited"
"264","purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily"
"265","disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"266","control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"267","established by the Public Company"
"268","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"269","deficiencies in the Company's"
"270","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"271","including controls over safeguarding"
"272","securities that we consider to be a material weakness as defined"
"273","above as of October 31, 2016."
"274","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"275","management and the Board of"
"276","Directors of Bullfinch Fund, Inc. and the Securities and Exchange"
"277","Commission and is not intended to"
"278","be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"279","parties."

"292","The Board of Directors (Board), with the approval and"
"293","recommendation of the Audit Committee, selected"
"294","DeJoy, Knauf & Blood, LLP (DKB) to replace EFP Rotenberg, LLP"
"295","(EFP) as the independent registered public accounting"
"296","firm of Bullfinch Fund, Inc. (the Fund) for the Fund's fiscal"
"297","year ending October 31, 2017.  Throughout the past two fiscal"
"298","periods through the date of EFP's dismissal as auditor of"
"299","the Funds, the Funds had no disagreements with EFP on any"
"300","matter of accounting principles or practices, financial"
"301","statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures, which, if"
"302","not resolved to the satisfaction of EFP would have caused"
"303","EFP to make reference to the disagreement in a report,  and"
"304","there were no reportable events of the kind described in Item"
"305","304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act"
"306","of 1934. With respect to the Funds, EFP's audit opinions,"
"307","including the past two fiscal periods, have not contained either"
"308","an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they"
"309","qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or"
"310","accounting principles. During the last two fiscal years of the"
"311","Funds, neither the Funds nor anyone on their behalf has"
"312","consulted EFP on items concerning the application of"
"313","accounting principles to a specified transaction (either"
"314","completed or proposed) or the type of audit opinion that might"
"315","be rendered on the Funds' financial statements, or concerning"
"316","the subject of a disagreement of the kind described in Item"
"317","304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K or reportable events of the kind"
"318","described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K."
"319","Registrant has provided a copy of the disclosures contained in"
"320","this Exhibit 77K to PwC, prior to the date of filing of this"
"321","Form N-SAR with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as"
"322","required by Item 304(a)(3) of Form S-K.  In addition, the"
"323","registrant has requested that EFP confirm in a letter"
"324","provided to registrant and addressed to the Commission that it"
"325","agrees with the representations contained in this Exhibit 77K,"
"326","and EFP's response addressed to the Commission is also"
"327","included as Exhibit 77(Q)(1)(f) in this Form N-SAR."
