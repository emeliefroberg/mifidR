"1005","       Section 1.  Declaration of Trust.  These By-Laws shall be subject to the Declaration of"
"1006","Trust, as from time to time in effect (Declaration of Trust), of JPMorgan Trust II, a Delaware"
"1007","statutory trust (Trust). In the event of any inconsistency between the terms hereof and the terms"
"1008","of the Declaration of Trust, the terms of the Declaration of Trust shall control."
"1009","       Section 2.  Definitions.  Capitalized terms used herein and not herein defined are used as"
"1010","defined in the Declaration of Trust."
"1011","ARTICLE II - OFFICES"
"1012","       Section 1.  Principal Office.  The principal executive office of the Trust shall be 270 Park"
"1013","Avenue, New York, New York until such time as the Trustees may change the location of the"
"1014","principal executive office of the Trust to any other place within or outside the State of Delaware."
"1015","       Section 2.  Delaware Office.  The Trustees shall establish a registered office in the State of"
"1016","Delaware and shall appoint as the Trust's registered agent for service of process in the State of"
"1017","Delaware an individual who is a resident of the State of Delaware or a Delaware corporation or a"
"1018","corporation authorized to transact business in the State of Delaware; in each case the business"
"1019","office of such registered agent for service of process shall be identical with the registered Delaware"
"1020","office of the Trust. The Trustees may designate a successor resident agent, provided, however, that"
"1021","such appointment shall not become effective until written notice thereof is delivered to the Office"
"1022","of the Secretary of the State of Delaware."
"1023","       Section 3. Other Offices. The Trustees may at any time establish branch or subordinate"
"1024","offices at any place or places within or outside the State of Delaware as the Trustees may from time"
"1025","to time determine."
"1026","ARTICLE III - MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS"
"1027","       Section 1.  Place of Meetings.  Meetings of Shareholders shall be held at any place"
"1028","designated by the Trustees. In the absence of any such designation, Shareholders' meetings shall be"
"1029","held at the principal executive office of the Trust."
"1030","       Section 2.  Call of Meetings.  There shall be no annual Shareholders' meetings except as"
"1031","required by law. Special meetings of the Shareholders of the Trust or of any Series or. Class may be"
"1032","called at any time by the Trustees or by the President or the Secretary for the purpose of taking"
"1033","action upon any matter requiring the vote or authority of the Shareholders of the Trust or of any"
"1034","Series or Class as herein provided or provided in the Declaration of Trust or upon any other matter"
"1035","as to which such vote or authority is deemed by the Trustees or the President to be necessary or"
"1036","desirable.  Meetings of the Shareholders of the Trust or of any Series or Class may be called for"
"1037","any purpose deemed necessary or desirable upon the written request of the Shareholders holding at"
"1038","least ten percent (10%) of the Outstanding Shares of the Trust entitled to vote at such meeting,"
"1039","provided that (1) such request shall state the purposes of such meeting and the matters proposed to"
"1040","be acted on, and (2) the Shareholders requesting such meeting shall have paid to the Trust the"
"1041","reasonably estimated cost of preparing and mailing the notice thereof, which the Secretary shall"
"1042","determine and specify to such Shareholders. If the Secretary fails for more than thirty (30) days to"
"1043","call a special meeting, the Trustees or the Shareholders requesting such a meeting may, in the name"
"1044","of the Secretary, call the meeting by giving the required notice.)  If the meeting is a meeting of"
"1045","Shareholders of any Series or Class, but not a meeting of all Shareholders of the Trust, then only a"
"1046","special meeting of Shareholders of such Series or Class need be called and, in such case, only"
"1047","Shareholders of such Series or Class shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting."
"1048","       Section 3.  Notice of Meetings of Shareholders.  All notices of meetings of Shareholders"
"1049","shall be sent or otherwise given to Shareholders in accordance with Section 4 of this Article III not"
"1050","less than ten (10) nor more than ninety (90) days before the date of the meeting.  The notice shall"
"1051","specify (i) the place, date and hour of the meeting, and (ii) the general nature of the business to be"
"1052","transacted."
"1053","       Section 4.  Manner of Giving Notice; Affidavit of Notice.  Notice of any meeting of"
"1054","Shareholders shall be (i) given either by hand delivery, first-class mail, telegraphic or other written"
"1055","or electronic communication, charges prepaid, and (ii) addressed to the Shareholder at the address"
"1056","of that Shareholder appearing on the books of the Trust or its transfer agent or given by the"
"1057","Shareholder to the Trust for the purpose of notice. If no such address appears on the Trust's books"
"1058","or is not given to the Trust, notice shall be deemed to have been given if sent to that Shareholder by"
"1059","first-class mail or telegraphic or other written or electronic communication to the Trust's principal"
"1060","executive office, or if published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county"
"1061","where that office is located. Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered"
"1062","personally or deposited in the mail or sent by telegram or other means of written or electronic"
"1063","communication or, where notice is given by publication, on the date of publication. Without"
"1064","limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to Shareholders, any notice"
"1065","to Shareholders given by the Trust shall be effective if given by a single written notice to"
"1066","Shareholders who share an address if consented to by the Shareholders at that address."
"1067","       If any notice addressed to a Shareholder at the address of that Shareholder appearing on the"
"1068","books of the Trust is returned to the Trust by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate"
"1069","that the Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice to the Shareholder at that address, all future"
"1070","notices or reports shall be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if such future"
"1071","notices or reports shall be kept available to the Shareholder, upon written demand of the"
"1072","Shareholder, at the principal executive office of the Trust for a period of one year from the date of"
"1073","the giving of the notice."
"1074","       An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any meeting of"
"1075","Shareholders shall be filed and maintained in the minute book of the Trust."
"1076","       Section 5. Conduct of Meetings of Shareholders. The meetings of Shareholders shall be"
"1077","presided over by the Chairman, or if he or she is not present, by the Vice Chairman, or if he or she"
"1078","is not present, by the President, or if he or she is not present, by any Vice President, unless there is"
"1079","an Executive Vice President, or if none of them is present, then any officer of the Trust appointed"
"1080","by the President to act on his or her behalf shall preside over such meetings. The Secretary, if"
"1081","present, shall act as a Secretary of such meetings, or if he or she is not present or is otherwise"
"1082","presiding over the meeting in another capacity, an Assistant Secretary, if any, shall so act. If neither"
"1083","the Secretary nor the Assistant Secretary is present or, if present, the Secretary is otherwise"
"1084","presiding over the meeting in another capacity, then any such person appointed by the Secretary to"
"1085","act on his or her behalf shall act as Secretary of such meetings."
"1086","       Section 6. Adjourned Meeting; Notice. Any meeting of Shareholders, whether or not a"
"1087","quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the Shares"
"1088","represented at the meeting, either in person or by proxy. Notwithstanding the above, broker non-"
"1089","votes will be excluded from the denominator of the calculation of the number of votes required to"
"1090","approve any proposal to adjourn a meeting. Notice of adjournment of a Shareholders' meeting to"
"1091","another tip1e or place need not be given, if such time and place are announced at the meeting at"
"1092","which adjournment is taken and the adjourned meeting is held within a reasonable time after the"
"1093","date set for the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than sixty (60) days from the date"
"1094","set for the original meeting or a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of any"
"1095","such adjourned meeting shall be given to each Shareholder of record entitled to vote at the"
"1096","adjourned meeting in accordance with the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this Article III. At any"
"1097","adjourned meeting, the Trust may transact any business which might have been transacted at the"
"1098","original meeting."
"1099","       Section 7. Voting. The Shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of Shareholders shall be"
"1100","determined in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as in effect"
"1101","as of such time. The Shareholders' vote may be by voice vote or by ballot, provided, however, that"
"1102","any election for Trustees must be by ballot if demanded by any Shareholder before the voting has"
"1103","begun. On any matter other than election of Trustees, any Shareholder may cast part of the votes"
"1104","that such Shareholder is entitled to cast in favor of the proposal and refrain from casting and/or cast"
"1105","the remaining part of such votes against the proposal, but if such Shareholder fails to specify the"
"1106","number of votes that such Shareholder is casting in favor of the proposal, it will be conclusively"
"1107","presumed that such Shareholder is casting all of the votes that such Shareholder is entitled to cast in"
"1108","favor of such proposal."
"1109","       Section 8. Waiver of Notice: Consent of Absent Shareholders. The transaction of business"
"1110","and any actions taken at a meeting of Shareholders, however called and noticed and wherever held,"
"1111","shall be as valid as though taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice provided a"
"1112","quorum is present either in person or by proxy at the meeting of Shareholders and if either before"
"1113","or after the meeting, each Shareholder entitled to vote who was not present in person or by proxy at"
"1114","the meeting of the Shareholders signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to a holding of the"

"1149","between the earliest date on which a record date for such meeting could be set in accordance"

"1152","Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Shareholders shall be the close of"
"1153","business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is"

"1158","which the first written consent is given, or (b) when prior action of the Trustees has been taken,"
"1159","shall be (i) such date as determined for that purpose by the Trustees, which record date shall not"
"1160","precede the date upon which the resolution fixing it is adopted by the Trustees and shall not be"
"1161","more than twenty (20) days after the date of such resolution, or (ii) if no record date is fixed by the"
"1162","Trustees, the record date shall be the close of business on the day on which the Trustees adopt the"
"1163","resolution relating to that action."
"1164","       (c) Nothing in this Section shall be construed as precluding the Trustees from setting"
"1165","different record dates for different Series or Classes. Only Shareholders of record on the record"
"1166","date, as herein determined, shall have any right to vote or to act at any meeting or give consent to"
"1167","any action relating to such record date, notwithstanding any transfer of Shares on the books of the"

"1176","eleven (11) months before the meeting.  A proxy shall be deemed executed by a Shareholder if the"
"1177","Shareholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic"
"1178","transmission or otherwise) by the Shareholder or the Shareholder's attorney-in-fact. A valid proxy"
"1179","which does not state that it is irrevocable shall continue in full force and effect unless (i) revoked"
"1180","by the Person executing it before the vote pursuant to that proxy is taken, (a) by a writing delivered"
"1181","to the Trust stating that the proxy is revoked, or (b) by a subsequent proxy executed by such"
"1182","Person, or (c) attendance at the meeting and voting in person by the Person executing that proxy, or"
"1183","(d) revocation by such Person using any electronic, telephonic, computerized or other alternative"

"1185","or incapacity of the ,maker of that proxy is received by the Trust before the vote pursuant to that"
"1186","proxy is counted. A proxy with respect to Shares held in the name of two or more Persons shall be"
"1187","valid if executed by any one of them unless at or prior to exercise of the proxy the Trust receives a"
"1188","specific written notice to the contrary from anyone of the two or more Persons. A proxy purporting"
"1189","to be executed by or on behalf of a Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior"
"1190","to its exercise and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger. Unless otherwise"
"1191","specifically limited by their terms, proxies shall entitle the Shareholder to vote at any adjournment"
"1192","or postponement of a Shareholders' meeting. At every meeting of Shareholders, unless the voting is"
"1193","conducted by inspectors, all questions concerning the qualifications of voters, the validity of"
"1194","proxies, and the acceptance or rejection of votes, shall be decided by the chairman of the meeting."
"1195","Subject to the provisions of the Declaration of Trust or these By-Laws, all matters concerning the"
"1196","giving, voting or validity of proxies shall be governed by the General Corporation Law of the State"

"1204","vacancy."
"1205","       These inspectors shall:"
"1206","(a)	Determine the number of Shares outstanding and the voting power of each (and, to the"

"1209","Share), the Shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum and the"
"1210","authenticity, validity and effect of proxies;"

"1418","extent consistent with law, indemnify each Person who is serving or has served at the request of the"
"1419","Trust as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, agent or fiduciary of another domestic or"
"1420","foreign corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or employee benefit plan"

"1425","consistent with state law and the 1940 Act. The indemnification and other rights provided by this"

"1451","settlement, pursuant to a consent decree or otherwise) without an adjudication by the court or other"

"1457","majority of those Trustees who are neither Interested Persons of the Trust nor parties to the"
"1458","proceeding."
"1459","       Section 5. Insurance, Rights Not Exclusive. The Trust's financial obligations arising from"

"1461","maintained by the Trust on behalf of any Trustee, officer or agent; (ii) shall be severable; (iii) shall"

"1566","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1567","To the Trustees of JPMorgan Trust II and the Shareholders of JPMorgan U.S. Real Estate Fund:"
"1568","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of JPMorgan U.S. Real Estate Fund"
"1569","(a separate Fund of JPMorgan Trust II) (hereafter referred to as the Trust) as of and for the year"
"1570","ended December 31, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1571","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust's internal control over financial reporting,"
"1572","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"1573","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1574","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"1575","of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"1576","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"1577","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1578","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"1579","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"1580","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1581","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1582","generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1583","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1584","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1585","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1586","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1587","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1588","trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1589","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1590","financial statements."
"1591","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1592","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"1593","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1594","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1595","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control"
"1596","does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1597","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1598","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1599","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Trust's annual or interim financial statements"
"1600","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1601","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1602","described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"1603","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"1604","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"1605","Trust's internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1606","securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of December 31, 2012."
"1607","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the Board of Trustees of"
"1608","JPMorgan Trust II and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should"
"1609","not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."
