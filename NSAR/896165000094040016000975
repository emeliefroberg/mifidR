"672","year. The Fund agrees to assume and pay, or reimburse the"
"673","Adviser or such other entity for, the Fund's operating expenses,"

"678","reports and proxy materials. The Fund will also pay brokerage"
"679","commissions on its portfolio transactions."

"685","fee shall be prorated for any portion of a month during which"
"686","the fee is payable."

"688","total assets of the Fund, less its liabilities, and shall be"
"689","determined in accordance with instructions of the Board."
