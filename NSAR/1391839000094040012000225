"542","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"543","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of"
"544","Gabelli SRI Green Fund, Inc.:"
"545","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"546","statements"
"547"," of Gabelli SRI Green Fund, Inc. (the"
"548","Fund) as of and for the year ended March 31, 2012, in"
"549"," accordance with the standards of the Public"
"550","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"551","considered the Fund's internal control over"
"552","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"553","securities, as a basis for designing our"
"554","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"555","on"
"556","the financial statements and to"
"557","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"558","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"559","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"560","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express"
"561","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"562","control"
"563","over financial reporting."
"564","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"565","and"
"566","maintaining effective internal"
"567","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"568","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"569","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"570","related costs of controls.  A fund's"
"571","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"572","designed"
"573","to provide reasonable assurance"
"574","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"575","preparation of financial statements for external"
"576","purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"577","principles.  A fund's internal control over"
"578","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"579","that"
"580","(1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"581","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"582","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"583","assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"584","transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"585","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"586","generally accepted accounting"
"587","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"588","are"
"589","being made only in accordance with"
"590","authorizations of management and directors of the fund; and"
"591","(3)"
"592","  provide reasonable assurance"
"593","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"594","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"595","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"596","statements."
"597","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"598","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"599","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"600","effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"601","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"602","changes"
"603","in conditions, or that the degree of"
"604","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"605","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"606","exists"
"607","when the design or operation of a"
"608","control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"609","course of performing their assigned"
"610","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
"611","basis."
"612"," A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"613","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"614","financial reporting, such that there is a"
"615","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"616","Fund's annual or interim financial"
"617","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"618","basis."
"619","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"620","financial"
"621","reporting was for the limited purpose"
"622","described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily"
"623","disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"624","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses"
"625","under"
"626","standards established by the"
"627","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"628","However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"629","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"630","operations, including controls over"
"631","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material"
"632","weaknesses as defined above as of March 31,"
"633","2012."
"634","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"635","management and the Board of Directors"
"636","of Gabelli SRI Green Fund, Inc., and the Securities and"
"637","Exchange"
"638","Commission and is not intended to"
"639","be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"640","specified"
