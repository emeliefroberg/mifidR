"1070","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1071","To the Shareholders and"
"1072","Board of Trustees of"
"1073","Trust for Credit Unions"
"1074","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"1075","of Ultra-Short Duration Government Portfolio and Short Duration"
"1076","Portfolio (the Trust), as of and for the year ended August 31,"
"1077","2017, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1078","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered its"
"1079","internal control over financial reporting, including control"
"1080","activities for safeguarding securities, in order to determine our"
"1081","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1082","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"1083","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1084","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial"
"1085","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1086","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"1087","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1088","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1089","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1090","related costs of controls.   A company's internal control over"
"1091","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1092","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1093","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1094","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.   A"
"1095","company's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1096","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1097","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"1098","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"1099","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1100","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1101","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"1102","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"1103","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"1104","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1105","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"1106","disposition of a company's assets that could have a material"
"1107","effect on the financial statements."
"1108","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1109","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.   Also,"
"1110","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"1111","are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"1112","because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"1113","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1114","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1115","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1116","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"1117","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
"1118","basis.   A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"1119","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1120","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1121","misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial"
"1122","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1123","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial"
"1124","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1125","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1126","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1127","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1128","Board (United States).   However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"1129","the Trust's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1130","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, which"
"1131","we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above, as of"
"1132","August 31, 2017."
"1133","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1134","management, Shareholders and Board of Trustees of Trust for"
"1135","Credit Unions and the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is"
"1136","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"1137","these specified parties."

"1280","permitted by applicable laws and"
"1281","regulations, the securities to be sold or"

"1311","thereby."
"1312","(f)  In performing its obligations under this"
"1313","Agreement, the Adviser may, at its own"
"1314","discretion, delegate any or all of its"
"1315","discretionary investment, advisory and other"
"1316","rights, powers and obligations hereunder to any"
"1317","advisory affiliate of the Adviser, without"

"1367","assets in excess of $500 million."

"1369","compensation payable to the Adviser shall be held"
"1370","in an interest-bearing escrow account on behalf"
"1371","of the Portfolios.  If, during the term of this"
"1372","Agreement, a new advisory agreement with the"
"1373","Adviser is approved by a majority of a"
"1374","Portfolio's outstanding voting securities, then"
"1375","the amount held in the escrow account (plus"
"1376","interest and income earned thereon and proceeds"
"1377","thereof) shall be paid to the Adviser.  If,"
"1378","however, a new advisory agreement is not approved"
"1379","by a majority of a Portfolio's outstanding voting"
"1380","securities (as defined in the 1940 Act), then the"
"1381","Adviser shall be entitled to the less of (i) any"
"1382","costs incurred in performing this Agreement (plus"
"1383","interest and income earned thereon and proceeds"
"1384","thereof) or (ii) the total amount held in the"
"1385","escrow account (plus interest and income earned"
"1386","thereon and proceeds thereof)."
"1387","(d)  The fees set forth in paragraph 5(a) hereof will"
"1388","be computed on the Government Money Market"
"1389","Portfolio's average net assets on each day and"
"1390","will be paid to the Adviser monthly."

"1396","requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Adviser"
"1397","agrees that all records which it maintains for the Portfolios"
"1398","are the property of the Fund and it will surrender promptly to"
"1399","the Fund any of such records upon the Fund's request.  The"

"1401","Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the records required to be"
"1402","maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act."

"1462","investigating or defending any such loss, claim,"
"1463","damage, liability or action."
"1464","(c)  If the indemnification provided for in paragraph"
"1465","7(b) is available in accordance with the terms of"
"1466","such paragraph but is for any reason held by a"
"1467","court to be unavailable from the Fund, then the"
"1468","Fund shall contribute to the aggregate amount"
"1469","paid or payable by the Fund and the Indemnified"
"1470","Parties as a result of such losses, claims,"
"1471","damages or liabilities (or actions in respect"
"1472","thereof) in such  proportion as is appropriate to"
"1473","reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the"
"1474","Fund and such Indemnified Parties in connection"
"1475","with the operations of the Fund, (ii) the"
"1476","relative fault of the Fund and such Indemnified"
"1477","Parties, and (iii) any other relevant equitable"
"1478","considerations.  The Fund and the Adviser agree"
"1479","that it would not be just and equitable if"
"1480","contribution pursuant to this subparagraph (c)"
"1481","were determined by pro rata allocation or any"
"1482","other method of allocation which does not take"
"1483","into account the equitable considerations"
"1484","referred to above in this subparagraph (c).  The"
"1485","aggregate amount paid or payable as a result of"
"1486","the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or"
"1487","actions in respect thereof) referred to above in"
"1488","this subparagraph (c) shall be deemed to include"
"1489","any legal or other expenses incurred by the Fund"
"1490","and the Indemnified Parties in connection with"
"1491","investigating or defending any such loss, claim,"
"1492","damage, liability or action.  No person guilty of"
"1493","fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning"
"1494","of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be"
"1495","entitled to contribution from any person who was"
"1496","not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation."
"1497","(d)  It is understood, however, that nothing in this"
"1498","paragraph 7 shall protect any Indemnified Party"
"1499","against, or entitle any Indemnified Party to"
"1500","indemnification against or contribution with"
"1501","respect to, any liability to the Fund or its"
"1502","Shareholders to which such Indemnified Party is"
"1503","subject, by reason of its willful misfeasance,"
"1504","bad faith or gross negligence in the performance"
"1505","of its duties, or by reason of any reckless"
"1506","disregard of its obligations and duties, under"
"1507","this Agreement or otherwise, to an extent or in a"
"1508","manner inconsistent with Section 17(i) of the"
"1509","1940 Act."
"1510","      8.  Duration and Termination.  Unless sooner terminated,"
"1511","this Agreement will continue with respect to a Portfolio until"
"1512","the first of the following occurs:  the effective date of a new"
"1513","investment advisory agreement which has been approved by a vote"
"1514","of a majority of the outstanding securities of such Portfolio or"
"1515","the 151st calendar day following the date hereof.  This"
"1516","Agreement may be terminated by the Fund as to any Portfolio at"
"1517","any time, without the payment of any penalty, by vote of a"
"1518","majority of the Trustees of the Fund or by vote of a majority of"
"1519","the outstanding Shares (as so defined) of a Portfolio on ten"
"1520","(10) days' prior written notice to the Adviser, or by the"
"1521","Adviser at any time, without the payment of any penalty, on at"
"1522","least sixty (60) days' prior written notice to the Fund.  This"
"1523","Agreement will automatically and immediately terminate in the"
"1524","event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act)."
"1525","      9.  Status of Adviser as Independent Contractor.  The"
"1526","Adviser shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an"
"1527","independent contractor and shall, unless otherwise expressly"
"1528","provided herein or authorized by the Fund's Board of Trustees"
"1529","from time to time, have no authority to act for or represent the"
"1530","Fund in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund."
"1531","      10.  Amendment of Agreement.  This Agreement may be amended"

"1536","called for the purpose of voting on such amendment, and (b) to"

"1540","Portfolio affected by such amendment.  Any amendment to this"
"1541","Agreement shall only be by written instrument which shall make"
