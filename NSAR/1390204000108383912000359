"1066","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1067","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"1068","of the Fund (hereinafter defined):"
"1069","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"1070","the of the Funds included in Appendix A (the Funds or the"
"1071","Company) as of and for the period ended July 31, 2011, in"
"1072","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1073","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Companys"
"1074","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1075","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1076","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1077","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"1078","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1079","effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial"
"1080","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"1081","effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial"
"1082","reporting."
"1083","The management of the Company is responsible for establishing"
"1084","and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1085","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1086","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1087","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"1088","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1089","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1090","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1091","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1092","companys internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1093","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1094","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1095","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"1096","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1097","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1098","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"1099","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"1100","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"1101","company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1102","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"1103","disposition of a companys assets that could have a material effect"
"1104","on the financial statements."
"1105","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1106","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"1107","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1108","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"1109","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1110","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1111","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1112","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1113","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1114","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A"
"1115","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"1116","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1117","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1118","Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1119","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1120","Our consideration of the Companys internal control over financial"
"1121","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1122","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1123","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"1124","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1125","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"1126","no deficiencies in the Companys internal control over financial"
"1127","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1128","securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"1129","above as of July 31, 2011."
"1130","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1131","management and the Board of Directors of Trustees and the"
"1132","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"

"1179","      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual"
"1180","covenants herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:"
"1181","      1.	Appointment.  Manager hereby appoints Sub-Adviser"
"1182","to provide certain sub-investment advisory services with respect to"
"1183","the portion of each Funds portfolio allocated by Manager to Sub-"

"1185","Sub-Adviser accepts such appointments and agrees to furnish the"
"1186","services herein set forth for the compensation herein provided."
"1187","      2.	Services to be Performed.  Subject always to the"
"1188","supervision of Manager and the Trusts Board of Trustees (the"
"1189"," Board ), Sub-Adviser will furnish an investment program in respect"
"1190","of, make investment decisions for, and place all orders for the"
"1191","purchase and sale of securities for the portion of each Funds"
"1192","investment portfolio allocated by Manager to Sub-Adviser.  In the"
"1193","performance of its duties, Sub-Adviser will satisfy its fiduciary duties"
"1194","to the Trust, will monitor each Funds investments, and will comply"
"1195","with the provisions of the Trusts Declaration of Trust and By-laws,"
"1196","each as amended from time to time (the  Trust Documents ), and the"
"1197","stated investment objectives, policies and restrictions of each Fund."
"1198","Manager will provide Sub-Adviser with current copies of the Trust"
"1199","Documents, each Funds prospectus and Statement of Additional"
"1200","Information and any amendments thereto, and any objectives, policies"
"1201","or restrictions not appearing therein as they may be relevant to Sub-"
"1202","Advisers performance under this Agreement.  Sub-Adviser and"
"1203","Manager will each make its officers and employees available to the"
"1204","other from time to time at reasonable times to review investment"
"1205","policies of each Fund and to consult with each other regarding the"
"1206","investment affairs of each Fund.  Sub-Adviser will report to Manager"
"1207","and the Board with respect to the implementation of its investment"
"1208","program for each Fund."
"1209","      Sub-Adviser is authorized to select the brokers or dealers that"
"1210","will execute the purchases and sales of portfolio securities for each"
"1211","Fund, and is directed to use its best efforts to obtain best execution,"
"1212","which includes most favorable net results and execution of each"
"1213","Funds orders, taking into account all appropriate factors, including"
"1214","price, dealer spread or commission, size and difficulty of the"
"1215","transaction and research or other services provided.  It is understood"
"1216","that Sub-Adviser will not be deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to"
"1217","have breached a fiduciary duty to the Trust or the Funds, or be in"
"1218","breach of any obligation owing to the Trust or the Funds under this"
"1219","Agreement, or otherwise, solely by reason of its having caused a"
"1220","Fund to pay a member of a securities exchange, a broker or a dealer a"
"1221","commission for effecting a securities transaction for a Fund in excess"
"1222","of the amount of commission another member of an exchange, broker"
"1223","or dealer would have charged if Sub-Adviser determined in good faith"
"1224","that the commission paid was reasonable in relation to the brokerage"
"1225","or research services provided by such member, broker or dealer,"
"1226","viewed in terms of that particular transaction or Sub-Advisers overall"
"1227","responsibilities with respect to its accounts, including the Funds, as to"
"1228","which it exercises investment discretion.  In addition, if in the"
"1229","judgment of Sub-Adviser, a Fund would be benefited by"
"1230","supplemental services, Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay spreads or"
"1231","commissions to brokers or dealers furnishing such services in excess"
"1232","of spreads or commissions which another broker or dealer may charge"
"1233","for the same transaction, provided that Sub-Adviser determines in"
"1234","good faith that the commission or spread paid is reasonable in relation"
"1235","to the services provided.  Sub-Adviser will properly communicate to"
"1236","the officers and trustees of the Trust such information relating to"
"1237","transactions for each Fund as they may reasonably request.  In no"
"1238","instance will portfolio securities be purchased from or sold to"
"1239","Manager, Sub-Adviser or any affiliated person of the Trust, Manager"
"1240","or Sub-Adviser, except as may be permitted under the 1940 Act, and"
"1241","under no circumstances will Sub-Adviser select brokers or dealers for"
"1242","Fund transactions on the basis of Fund share sales by such brokers or"
"1243","dealers."
"1244","Sub-Adviser further agrees that it:"
"1245","(a)	will use the same degree of skill and care in providing"
"1246","such services as it uses in providing services to"
"1247","fiduciary accounts for which it has investment"
"1248","responsibilities;"
"1249","(b)	will conform to all applicable Rules and Regulations"
"1250","of the Securities and Exchange Commission in all"
"1251","material respects and in addition will conduct its"

"1256","will make appropriate persons available for the"
"1257","purpose of reviewing with representatives of Manager"
"1258","and the Board on a regular basis at reasonable times"
"1259","the management of the Funds, including, without"
"1260","limitation, review of the general investment strategies"
"1261","of the Funds, the performance of the Funds in relation"
"1262","to standard industry indices and general conditions"
"1263","affecting the marketplace, and will provide various"
"1264","other reports from time to time as reasonably requested"
"1265","by Manager;"
"1266","(d)	will prepare such books and records with respect to"
"1267","each Funds securities transactions as requested by"
"1268","Manager and will furnish Manager and the Board such"
"1269","periodic and special reports as Manager or the Board"
"1270","may reasonably request; and"
"1271","(e)	will monitor the pricing of portfolio securities, and"
"1272","events relating to the issuers of those securities and the"
"1273","markets in which the securities trade in the ordinary"
"1274","course of managing the portfolio securities of the"
"1275","Funds, and will notify Manager promptly of any"
"1276","issuer-specific or market events or other situations that"
"1277","occur (particularly those that may occur after the close"
"1278","of a foreign market in which the securities may"
"1279","primarily trade but before the time at which the Funds"
"1280","securities are priced on a given day) that may"
"1281","materially impact the pricing of one or more securities"
"1282","in Sub-Advisers portion of the portfolio.  In addition,"
"1283","upon the request of Manager, Sub-Adviser will assist"
"1284","Manager in evaluating the impact that such an event"
"1285","may have on the net asset value of the Funds and in"
"1286","determining a recommended fair value of the affected"
"1287","security or securities.  Sub-Adviser shall not be liable"
"1288","for any valuation determined or adopted by the Funds,"
"1289","the Funds custodian and/or portfolio accounting"
"1290","agent, as contemplated in this Agreement, unless such"
"1291","determination is made based upon information"
"1292","provided by Sub-Adviser that is materially incorrect or"
"1293","incomplete as a result of Sub-Advisers gross"
"1294","negligence."
"1295","      3.		Expenses.  During the term of this Agreement, Sub-"
"1296"," Adviser will pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its"
"1297"," activities under this Agreement other than the cost of securities"
"1298"," (including brokerage commission, if any) purchased for each Fund."
"1299","      4.		Compensation.  For the services provided and the"
"1300","expenses assumed pursuant to this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"1301","not receive any investment advisory or other fee from a Fund for the"
"1302","services provided.. Manager will not pay Sub-Adviser a fee, and Sub-"
"1303","Adviser agrees to accept no fee."
"1304","      5.   	Services to Others.  Manager understands, and has"
"1305","advised the Board, that Sub-Adviser now acts, or may in the future"
"1306","act, as an investment adviser to fiduciary and other managed"
"1307","accounts, and as investment adviser or sub-investment adviser to"
"1308","other investment companies that are not series of the Trust, provided"
"1309","that whenever each Fund and one or more other investment advisory"
"1310","clients of Sub-Adviser have available funds for investment,"
"1311","investments suitable and appropriate for each will be allocated in a"
"1312","manner believed by Sub-Adviser to be equitable to each.  Manager"
"1313","recognizes, and has advised the Board, that in some cases this"
"1314","procedure may adversely affect the size of the position that each Fund"
"1315","may obtain in a particular security.  It is further agreed that, on"
"1316","occasions when Sub-Adviser deems the purchase or sale of a security"
"1317","to be in the best interests of each Fund as well as other accounts, it"
"1318","may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, but will not be"
"1319","obligated to, aggregate the securities to be so sold or purchased for"
"1320","each Fund with those to be sold or purchased for other accounts in"
"1321","order to obtain favorable execution and lower brokerage"
"1322","commissions.  In addition, Manager understands, and has advised the"
"1323","Board, that the persons employed by Sub-Adviser to assist in Sub-"
"1324","Advisers duties under this Agreement will not devote their full such"
"1325","efforts and service to the Funds.  It is also agreed that Sub-Adviser"
"1326","may use any supplemental research obtained for the benefit of the"
"1327","Funds in providing investment advice to its other investment advisory"
"1328","accounts or for managing its own accounts."
"1329","      6.	Limitation of Liability.  Manager will not take any"
"1330","action against Sub-Adviser to hold Sub-Adviser liable for any error of"
"1331","judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by a Fund in"
"1332","connection with the performance of Sub-Advisers duties under this"
"1333","Agreement, except for a loss resulting from Sub-Advisers willful"
"1334","misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of its"
"1335","duties or by reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations and"
"1336","duties under this Agreement."
"1337","      7.	Term; Termination; Amendment.  As to each Fund,"
"1338","this Agreement shall become effective and shall run for an initial"
"1339","period as specified for each Fund in Schedule A hereto. This"
"1340","Agreement shall continue in force from year to year thereafter with"
"1341","respect to each Fund, but only as long as such continuance is"
"1342","specifically approved for each Fund at least annually in the manner"
"1343","required by the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder;"
"1344","provided, however, that if the continuation of this Agreement is not"
"1345","approved for each Fund, Sub-Adviser may continue to serve in such"
"1346","capacity for each Fund in the manner and to the extent permitted by"
"1347","the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder."
"1348","      This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event of"
"1349","its assignment and may be terminated at any time without the"
"1350","payment of any penalty by either party on sixty (60) days written"
"1351","notice to Sub-Adviser. This Agreement may also be terminated by the"
"1352","Trust with respect to a Fund by action of the Board or by a vote of a"
"1353","majority of the outstanding voting securities of such Fund on sixty"
"1354","(60) days written notice to Sub-Adviser by the Trust."
"1355","      This Agreement may be terminated with respect to each Fund"
"1356","at any time without the payment of any penalty by Manager or the"
"1357","Board or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of"
"1358","each Fund in the event that it shall have been established by a court of"
"1359","competent jurisdiction that Sub-Adviser or any officer or director of"
"1360","Sub-Adviser has taken any action which results in a breach of the"
"1361","covenants of Sub-Adviser set forth herein."
"1362","      The terms  assignment  and  vote of a majority of the"
"1363","outstanding voting securities  shall have the meanings set forth in the"
"1364","1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder."
"1365","      Termination of this Agreement shall not affect the right of"
"1366","Sub-Adviser to receive payments on any unpaid balance of the"
"1367","compensation described in Section 4 earned prior to such termination."
"1368","This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event the"
"1369","Management Agreement between Manager and the Trust is"
"1370","terminated, assigned or not renewed."
