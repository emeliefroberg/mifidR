"2839","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2840","To the Shareholders and"
"2841","Board of Trustees of Touchstone Strategic Trust"
"2842","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"2843","of Touchstone Strategic Trust (the Trust) as of and for the year"
"2844","ended March 31, 2018, in accordance with the standards of the"
"2845","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"2846","considered the Trust's internal control over financial"
"2847","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"2848","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2849","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"2850","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2851","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's"
"2852","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"2853","express no such opinion."
"2854","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"2855","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"2856","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"2857","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"2858","related costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"2859","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"2860","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"2861","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"2862","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"2863","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"2864","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2865","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"2866","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"2867","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"2868","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"2869","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"2870","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"2871","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"2872","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"2873","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"2874","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"2875","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2876","statements."
"2877","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2878","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2879","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"2880","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2881","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"2882","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2883","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2884","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"2885","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"2886","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"2887","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2888","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"2889","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"2890","material misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"2891","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"2892","timely basis."
"2893","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial"
"2894","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2895","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"2896","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"2897","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"2898","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"2899","Trust's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"2900","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"2901","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"2902","March 31, 2018."
"2903","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"2904","management and the Board of Trustees of Touchstone Strategic"
"2905","Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"2906","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"2907","specified parties."

"2919","Touchstone Sustainability and Impact Equity Fund"
"2920","A series of"
"2921","Touchstone Strategic Trust"
"2922","	This Sub-Advisory Agreement (the Agreement) is made as of"
"2923","March 1, 2018, between Touchstone Advisors, Inc. (the"

"2926","	WHEREAS, Touchstone Strategic Trust (the Trust) is a"
"2927","Massachusetts business trust organized pursuant to an Agreement"
"2928","and Declaration of Trust dated May 19, 1993, as amended, and"
"2929","registered as an open-end management investment company under"
"2930","the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act);"
"2931","and"
"2932","	WHEREAS, the Advisor is an investment advisor registered"
"2933","under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the"
"2934","Advisers Act) and has been retained by the Trust to provide"
"2935","investment advisory services with respect to certain assets of"
"2936","the Touchstone Sustainability and Impact Equity Fund (the"
"2937","Fund); and"
"2938","	WHEREAS, the Sub-Advisor also is an investment advisor"
"2939","registered under the Advisers Act; and"
"2940","	WHEREAS, the Advisor desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to"
"2941","furnish it with portfolio management services in connection with"
"2942","the Advisor's investment advisory activities on behalf of the"
"2943","Fund, and the Sub-Advisor has agreed to furnish such services to"
"2944","the Advisor and the Fund;"
"2945","	NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the terms and conditions"
"2946","set forth below, it is agreed as follows:"
"2947","	1.	Appointment of the Sub-Advisor. In accordance with and"
"2948","subject to the Investment Advisory Agreement between the Trust"
"2949","and the Advisor, attached as Exhibit A (the Advisory
Agreement), the Advisor appoints the Sub-Advisor to manage the"
"2950","investment and reinvestment of that portion of the assets of"
"2951","the Fund allocated to it by the Advisor (the Fund Assets), in"
"2952","conformity with the Fund's currently effective registration"
"2953","statement, including its prospectus and statement of additional"
"2954","information, as amended (collectively, the Disclosure
Documents), and subject to the control and direction of the"
"2955","Advisor and the Trust's Board of Trustees (the Board), for the"
"2956","period and on the terms set forth in this Agreement. The Sub-"
"2957","Advisor accepts such appointment and agrees during such period to"
"2958","render the services and to perform the duties called for by this"
"2959","Agreement for the compensation provided in Section 3 of this"
"2960","Agreement. The Sub-Advisor shall at all times maintain its"
"2961","registration as an investment advisor under the Advisers Act and"
"2962","shall otherwise comply in all material respects with all"
"2963","applicable laws and regulations, both state and federal. For"
"2964","purposes of this Agreement, the Sub-Advisor shall be deemed an"
"2965","independent contractor and shall, except as expressly provided"
"2966","or authorized by written Agreement with the Advisor, Fund, or"
"2967","Trust, have no authority to act for or represent the Trust in"
"2968","any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Trust or the"
"2969","Fund."
"2970","	2.	Duties of the Sub-Advisor. The Sub-Advisor will"
"2971","provide the following services and undertake the following"
"2972","duties:"
"2973","      a.	The Sub-Advisor will manage the investment and"
"2974","reinvestment of the Fund Assets, subject to and in"
"2975","accordance with the investment objectives, policies, and"
"2976","restrictions of the Fund, and in conformity with the"
"2977","Fund's currently effective Disclosure Documents, and, to"
"2978","the extent they do not contradict the Fund's currently"
"2979","effective Disclosure Documents, any written directions"
"2980","which the Advisor or the Trust's Board may give pursuant"
"2981","to this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, the"
"2982","Sub-Advisor will make all determinations with respect to"
"2983","the investment of the Fund Assets and the purchase and"
"2984","sale of portfolio securities and shall take such steps as"
"2985","may be necessary or advisable to implement the same. The"
"2986","Sub-Advisor also will determine the manner in which voting"
"2987","rights, rights to consent to corporate actions, and any"
"2988","other rights pertaining to the portfolio securities will"
"2989","be exercised."
"2990","      b.	As reasonably requested, the Sub-Advisor will"
"2991","render regular reports to the Trust's Board and to the"
"2992","Advisor (or such other service providers as the Advisor"
"2993","shall engage to assist it in the evaluation of the"
"2994","performance and activities of the Sub-Advisor). Such"
"2995","reports shall be made in such form and manner and with"
"2996","respect to such matters regarding the Fund and the Sub-"
"2997","Advisor as the Trust or the Advisor shall reasonably"
"2998","request; provided, however, that in the absence of"
"2999","extraordinary circumstances, a portfolio manager"
"3000","responsible for management of Fund Assets for the Sub-"
"3001","Advisor will not be required to attend in-person more than"
"3002","one meeting per year with the Trust's Board."
"3003","      c.	The Sub-Advisor may utilize the services of a"
"3004","third-party service provider to research and vote proxies"
"3005","on its behalf and on behalf of the Fund."
"3006","      d.	The Sub-Advisor shall not have custody of any of"
"3007","the Fund Assets and is not authorized to provide the Fund"
"3008","with legal or tax advice or to engage the Fund in any"
"3009","legal proceedings, including responding to class action"
"3010","claims; provided, however, that the Sub-Advisor shall"
"3011","promptly forward any notices it receives relating to class"
"3012","action claims to the Fund's custodian or other duly"
"3013","designated Fund agent.  The Sub-Advisor shall assist the"
"3014","custodian or other duly designated Fund agent in"
"3015","evaluating such securities class action claims, as"
"3016","reasonably requested in writing (provided that in so doing"
"3017","the Sub-Advisor shall not incur any extraordinary costs),"
"3018","but the Sub-Advisor will not be responsible for filing any"
"3019","such claims. The Advisor acknowledges that the Fund's"
"3020","custodian or other duly designated Fund agent, and not the"
"3021","Sub-Advisor, will be responsible for evaluating and making"
"3022","all decisions regarding class action claims involving"
"3023","securities presently or formerly held by the Fund."
"3024","      e.	The Sub-Advisor may, to the extent permitted by"
"3025","applicable law and regulations, aggregate purchase and"
"3026","sale orders of securities placed with respect to the Fund"
"3027","Assets with similar orders being made simultaneously for"
"3028","other accounts managed by the Sub-Advisor or its"
"3029","affiliates, if, in the Sub-Advisor's reasonable judgment,"
"3030","such aggregation shall result in an overall economic"
"3031","benefit to the Fund and its other clients. In forming this"
"3032","judgment the Sub-Advisor shall consider the selling or"
"3033","purchase price, brokerage commissions, and other expenses."
"3034","In the event that a purchase or sale of the Fund Assets"
"3035","occurs as part of any aggregate sale or purchase order,"
"3036","the objective of the Sub-Advisor and any of its affiliates"
"3037","involved in such transaction shall be to allocate the"
"3038","securities so purchased or sold, as well as expenses"
"3039","incurred in the transaction, among the Fund and other"
"3040","accounts in a fair and equitable manner."
"3041","      f.	Whenever the Fund and one or more other"
"3042","investment advisory clients of the Sub-Advisor have"
"3043","available funds for investment, investments suitable and"
"3044","appropriate for each will be allocated in a manner"
"3045","believed by the Sub-Advisor to be fair and equitable to"
"3046","each. Moreover, it is possible that due to differing"
"3047","investment objectives or for other reasons, the Sub-"
"3048","Advisor and its affiliates may purchase securities of an"
"3049","issuer for one client and at approximately the same time"
"3050","recommend selling or sell the same or similar types of"
"3051","securities for another client, including the Fund."
"3052","      g.	The Sub-Advisor will not arrange purchases or"
"3053","sales of securities between the Fund and other accounts"
"3054","advised by the Sub-Advisor or its affiliates unless (a)"
"3055","such purchases or sales are in accordance with applicable"
"3056","law and regulation (including Rule 17a-7 under the 1940"
"3057","Act) and the Fund's policies and procedures, (b) the"
"3058","Sub-Advisor determines the purchase or sale is in the"
"3059","best interests of the Fund, and (c) the Fund's Board has"
"3060","approved these types of transactions."
"3061","      h.	The Sub-Advisor shall promptly notify the Advisor"
"3062","if the Sub-Advisor reasonably believes that the value of"
"3063","any security held by the Fund and reflected on the books"
"3064","and records of the Fund may not reflect fair value. The"
"3065","Sub-Advisor agrees to provide any pricing information of"
"3066","which the Sub-Advisor is aware to the Advisor and any Fund"
"3067","pricing agent to assist in the determination of the fair"
"3068","value of any Fund holdings for which market quotations are"
"3069","not readily available or as otherwise required in"
"3070","accordance with the 1940 Act or the Fund's adopted"
"3071","valuation procedures, which may be amended by the Board."
"3072","Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties recognize that"
"3073","the Sub-Advisor is not an official pricing source or"
"3074","agent and has no responsibility for calculating the"
"3075","Fund's net asset value."
"3076","      i.	Regulatory Compliance."
"3077","     (i)	The Sub-Advisor will comply in all material"
"3078","respects with applicable federal and state securities"
"3079","laws, including the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the"
"3080","Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act), the"
"3081","Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act), the"
"3082","Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, each as amended, and"
"3083","the rules and regulations adopted by the Securities"
"3084","and Exchange Commission, the Commodities Futures"
"3085","Trading Commission, or state securities regulator"
"3086","that are applicable to a registered investment"
"3087","adviser providing services to registered open-end"
"3088","investment companies including, without limitation,"
"3089","Rule 206(4)-7 under the Advisers Act."
"3090","     (ii)	The Sub-Advisor shall cause the Fund to"
"3091","comply with the diversification and source of income"
"3092","requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue"
"3093","Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), for"
"3094","qualification as a regulated investment company."
"3095","     (iii)	The Sub-Advisor will cooperate fully"
"3096","with the Trust's Chief Compliance Officers in the"

"3215","        k.	The Sub-Advisor will, on behalf of the Fund,"
"3216","place orders for the execution of all portfolio"
"3217","transactions in accordance with the policies set forth in"
"3218","the Fund's Disclosure Documents. When placing orders with"
"3219","brokers and dealers, the Sub-Advisor's primary objective"
"3220","shall be to seek the most favorable price and execution"
"3221","available for the Fund, and in placing such orders the Sub-"
"3222","Advisor may consider a number of factors, including,"
"3223","without limitation, the overall direct net economic result"
"3224","to the Fund (including commissions, which may not be the"
"3225","lowest available but ordinarily should not be higher than"
"3226","the generally prevailing competitive range); the financial"
"3227","strength and stability of the broker; the efficiency with"
"3228","which the transaction will be effected; the ability to"
"3229","effect the transaction at all where a large block is"
"3230","involved; and the availability of the broker or dealer to"
"3231","stand ready to execute possibly difficult transactions in"
"3232","the future. Consistent with the Conduct Rules of the"
"3233","Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and subject to"
"3234","seeking most favorable price and execution and compliance"
"3235","with Rule 12b-1(h) under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor may"
"3236","select brokers and dealers to execute portfolio"
"3237","transactions of the Fund that promote or sell shares of the"
"3238","Fund. The Sub-Advisor is specifically authorized, to the"
"3239","extent authorized by law (including, without limitation,"
"3240","Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act), to pay a broker or dealer"
"3241","who provides research services to the Sub-Advisor an amount"
"3242","of commission for effecting a portfolio transaction in"
"3243","excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer"
"3244","would have charged for effecting such transaction. This"
"3245","excess payment (often referred to as soft dollar"
"3246","payments) in recognition of such additional research"
"3247","services rendered by the broker or dealer shall only be"
"3248","made if the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that the"
"3249","excess commission is reasonable in relation to the value of"
"3250","the brokerage and research services provided by such broker"
"3251","or dealer viewed in terms of the particular transaction or"
"3252","the Sub-Advisor's overall responsibilities with respect to"
"3253","discretionary accounts that it manages, and that the Fund"
"3254","derives or will derive a reasonable benefit from such"
"3255","research services. The Sub-Advisor will present a written"
"3256","report to the Board, at least quarterly, indicating total"
"3257","brokerage expenses, as well as the services obtained in"
"3258","consideration for such expenses, broken down by broker-"
"3259","dealer and containing such information as the Board"

"3264","any material changes in its insurance policies or"
"3265","insurance coverage; or (ii) if any material claims will be"
"3266","made on its insurance policies related to the services"
"3267","provided to the Trust under this Agreement. Furthermore,"
"3268","the Sub-Advisor shall, upon reasonable request, provide"
"3269","the Trust with any information it may reasonably require"
"3270","concerning the amount of or scope of such insurance."
"3271","      m.	In the event of any reorganization or other"
"3272","material change in the Sub-Advisor, the Sub-Advisor shall"
"3273","give the Advisor and the Board written notice of such"
"3274","reorganization or change within a reasonable time (but not"
"3275","later than 30 days) after such reorganization or change."
"3276","      n.	The Sub-Advisor will bear its expenses of"
"3277","providing services to the Fund pursuant to this Agreement"

"3281","that the Sub-Advisor shall be required to provide only the"
"3282","services expressly described in this Agreement, and shall"
"3283","have no responsibility to provide any other services to"
"3284","the Advisor or the Portfolio except as required by law."
"3285","The Advisor shall remain responsible for the Fund's"

"3290","Sub-Advisor in connection with its activities under this"
"3291","Agreement, including, without limitation, information"
"3292","concerning the Fund; its cash available, or to become"
"3293","available, for investment; and generally as to the"
"3294","conditions of the Fund or its affairs."
"3295","      q.	The Advisor will provide the Sub-Advisor with"
"3296","advance notice of, and the opportunity to comment on, any"
"3297","change in the Funds investment objectives, investment"
"3298","policy risks, and restrictions as stated in the Disclosure"
"3299","Documents, or in any procedures and policies adopted by"

"3308","Disclosure Documents. The Advisor acknowledges and agrees"
"3309","that the Disclosure Documents will at all times be in"
"3310","compliance with all disclosure requirements under all"
"3311","applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating"
"3312","to the Fund."
"3313","      r.	The Advisor acknowledges and agrees that the Sub-"
"3314","Advisor does not guarantee the future performance or any"
"3315","specific level of performance for the Fund Assets, the"
"3316","success of any investment decision or strategy that the"
"3317","Sub-Advisor may use, or the success of the Sub-Advisor's"
"3318","overall management of the Fund Assets. The Advisor"
"3319","acknowledges and agrees that investment decisions made"
"3320","with regard to the Fund Assets by the Sub-Advisor are"
"3321","subject to various market, currency, economic, political,"
"3322","and business risks, and that those investment decisions"
"3323","will not always be beneficial to the Fund. Additionally,"
"3324","there may be loss or depreciation of the value of the Fund"
"3325","Assets because of fluctuation of market values. These"
"3326","risks will be disclosed in the Fund's Disclosure"
"3327","Documents."
"3328","	3.	Compensation of the Sub-Advisor."
"3329","		a.	As compensation for the services to be rendered"

"3338","such capacity for less than the whole of any period"
"3339","specified in Section 12(a) of this Agreement, the"

"3344","value for purposes of purchases and redemptions of shares."
"3345","		b.	The Sub-Advisor reserves the right to waive all"
"3346","or a part of its fees."
