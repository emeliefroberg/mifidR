"2711","Report of Independent Registered Certified Public Accounting Firm"
"2712","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Eagle Series Trust"
"2713","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Eagle Series Trust (the Company) as of and for the year ended October 31, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Company's internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting."
"2714","The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2715","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2716","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2717","Our consideration of the Company's internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Company's internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of October 31, 2016."

"2841","Q.         How many of the nominees will be Independent Trustees if elected?"

"2864","PROXY STATEMENT"
"2865","Special Meeting of Shareholders September 26, 2016"
"2866","INTRODUCTION"
"2867","      This Proxy Statement is being furnished to the shareholders of each of the above Eagle Funds (each, a Fund and collectively, the Funds) in connection with the solicitation of shareholder votes by proxy to be voted at the Special Meeting of Shareholders or any adjournments thereof (Meeting) to be held on September 26, 2016 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time at the offices of Eagle Asset Management, Inc. (Eagle), 880 Carillon Parkway, St. Petersburg, Florida 33716. It is expected that the Notice of Special Meeting, Proxy Statement and proxy card will be first mailed to shareholders on or about July 30, 2016."
"2868","      As more fully described in this Proxy Statement, the purpose of the Meeting is to consider the proposal to elect the current Trustees of Eagle Capital Appreciation Fund, Eagle Growth & Income Fund and Eagle Series Trust (collectively, the Trusts) and elect three new Trustees for the Trusts (the Proposal) and to act upon any other business that may properly come before the Meeting or any adjournments thereof."
"2869","VOTING INFORMATION"
"2870","      If the enclosed proxy card is executed properly and returned, shares represented by it will be voted at the Meeting in accordance with the instructions on the proxy. A proxy may nevertheless be revoked at any time prior to its use by written notification received by the Funds, by the execution of a subsequently dated proxy or by attending the Meeting and voting in person. However, if no instructions are specified on a proxy, shares will be voted FOR the Proposal,"
"2871","and FOR or AGAINST any other matters acted upon at the Meeting in the discretion of the persons named as proxies."
"2872","      This solicitation is being made primarily by the mailing of this proxy statement and the accompanying proxy cards. Supplementary solicitations may be made by mail or telephone by representatives of the Trusts or Eagle. The Funds will bear the cost of preparing, printing and mailing the proxy statement and soliciting and tabulating proxies. The expenses will be allocated among the Funds evenly."
"2873","      The close of business on July 15, 2016 has been established as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting (Record Date). Each share will be entitled to one vote at the Meeting and fractional shares will be entitled to proportionate fractional votes."
"2874","      Quorum and Adjournment: The presence at the Meeting, in person or by proxy, of shareholders entitled to vote a majority of the Funds' shares is required for a quorum for the Proposal. In the event that a quorum is present at the Meeting but sufficient votes to approve the Proposal are not received, or in the event that a quorum is not present at the Meeting, the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of such Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies. The affirmative vote of less than a majority of the votes entitled to be cast represented in person or by proxy is sufficient for adjournments. In such case, the persons named as proxies will vote those proxies, which they are entitled to vote in favor of such item FOR such an adjournment, and will vote those proxies required to be withheld with respect to such item AGAINST such an adjournment. A shareholder vote may be taken on the Proposal prior to any such adjournment if sufficient votes have been received and it is otherwise appropriate."
"2875","      Required Vote: For the Proposal, the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes of each Trust cast at the Meeting on the election of Trustees is required to elect a Trustee. Each Trust will vote separately on the Proposal."
"2876","      Broker non-votes are shares held in street name for which the broker indicates that instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or other persons entitled to vote and with respect to which the broker does not have discretionary voting authority. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as shares present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present but will not be counted as votes cast. Accordingly, abstentions and broker non- votes effectively will have no impact on the Proposal because the required vote is a plurality of the votes cast at the Meeting."
"2877","      The most recent Annual and Semi-Annual Reports for each Fund, including financial statements, previously have been furnished to shareholders. If you would like to receive additional copies of these reports free of charge, please write to Eagle Mutual Funds, 880 Carillon Parkway, St. Petersburg, Florida 33716 or call toll-free at 1-800-421-4184. The Reports also are available on the Funds' website at www.eagleasset.com and the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at www.sec.gov."
"2878","PROPOSAL: ELECTION OF TRUSTEES"
"2879","Funds Affected: All"
"2880","      The Board of each Fund recommends that shareholders of each Fund elect three new Trustee nominees, John Carter, Stephen Roussin and Court James, and elect the incumbent Trustees, J. Cooper Abbott, Keith B. Jarrett, William J. Meurer, Liana O'Drobinak, James L. Pappas, and Deborah L. Talbot (collectively, the Nominees). The Board currently consists of six Trustees, and the Trustees have determined to increase the size of the Board to nine members. If elected, Messrs. James, Carter and Roussin will become new Trustees effective as of the adjournment of the Meeting."
"2881","      If elected, each Nominee would serve as a Trustee for life unless he or she resigns, retires or is removed. The Trustees who are deemed not interested (Independent Trustees) as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act) have adopted a Board Governance Policy that requires an Independent Trustee to retire no later than at the end of the meeting which occurs immediately after his or her 75th birthday."
"2882","      If elected, it is expected that Messrs. Carter and Roussin would serve as Independent Trustees. Mr. James would be deemed an interested person (Interested Trustee) as that term is defined in the 1940 Act due to his employment with Eagle."
"2883","      On May 20, 2016, the Board, including the Independent Trustees, nominated each of the nine Nominees for election or re-election to the Board. The Independent Trustees have sought to sustain a Board with members that have backgrounds and experiences that are diverse and relevant to the variety of tasks and issues that face a mutual fund board. Pertinent information about each Nominee as of May 31, 2016 is set forth below."
"2884","      The persons named as proxies on the enclosed proxy card will vote FOR the election of each Nominee unless the shareholder specifically indicates on his or her proxy card a desire to withhold authority to vote for a Nominee. Each Nominee has consented to be named in this Proxy Statement and has indicated a willingness to serve if elected. Neither the Board nor management has any reason to believe that any Nominee will be unavailable for election. However, if any of the Nominees should not be available for election, the persons named as proxies (or their substitutes) may vote for other persons in their discretion."
"2885","Information Concerning Nominees"
"2886","      Information is provided below for each Nominee for election at the Meeting. The first section of the table lists information for each Nominee who would serve as an Interested Trustee by virtue of their positions with Eagle. Information for each Nominee who would be deemed an Independent Trustee appears in the second section of the table. The address of each Nominee is 880 Carillon Parkway, St. Petersburg, FL 33716."

"2946","Board Leadership Structure and Standing Board Committees"
"2947","      The Board is responsible for and oversees the overall management and operations of each Trust and the Funds. It establishes the major policies, reviews investments, and provides guidelines to Eagle and others who provide services to the Funds. The Board met four times during the last fiscal year. Board members who are not interested persons of the Funds as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (Independent Trustees) constitute more than three-quarters of the Board. In addition, the Chairman of the Board is an Independent Trustee. The Chairman presides at all meetings of the Board and acts as a liaison with officers, attorneys, and other Trustees between meetings. The Board believes that its leadership structure, including having an Independent Trustee as Chairman, allows for effective communication between the Trustees and fund management and enhances the independent oversight of the Funds."
"2948","        The Board has a Nominating Committee, an Audit Committee, a Compliance Committee and a Qualified Legal Compliance Committee."
"2949","Nominating Committee"
"2950","      The Funds have a Nominating Committee, currently consisting of Dr. Jarrett, Mr. Meurer, Dr. Pappas, Dr. Talbot and Ms. O'Drobinak, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The Board will appoint Messrs. Carter and Roussin to serve on the Nominating Committee upon their election by shareholders. The primary responsibilities of the Nominating Committee are to make recommendations to the Board on issues related to the composition of the Board, communicate with management on those issues and evaluate and nominate Board member candidates. The Nominating Committee did not meet during the most recent fiscal year. The Nominating Committee met once in May 2016."
"2951","      In proposing the Nominees, the Nominating Committee considered factors, including but not limited to, the general knowledge, background and experience of each Nominee. Specifically, the Nominating Committee considered whether Nominees possess a very high level of integrity, appropriate experience and a commitment to fulfill the fiduciary duties inherent in Board membership. The Nominating Committee also considered the extent to which a candidate possesses sufficiently diverse skill sets and diversity characteristics that would contribute to the Board's overall effectiveness."
"2952","      The Nominating Committee may consider recommendations for potential candidates from any source, including Board members, Fund shareholders, legal counsel to the Independent Trustees or other such sources as the Committee deems appropriate. In determining potential candidates' qualifications for Board membership, the Committee may consider all factors it may determine to be relevant to fulfilling the role of being a member of the Board. Messrs. Carter Roussin and James were recommended to the Nominating Committee by the Funds' Principal Executive Officer, independent registered public accounting firm (Independent Accountants) and the Funds' President, respectively. They were selected from a pool of potential candidates recommended by members of the Board, legal counsel to the Independent Trustees, management and the Independent Accountants."
"2953","      The Nominating Committee may consider potential candidates for nomination identified by one or more shareholders of a Fund. Shareholders can submit recommendations in writing to the attention of the Chairperson of the Nominating Committee at an address to be maintained by the Fund for this purpose. In order to be considered by the Nominating Committee, any shareholder recommendation must include certain information, such as the candidate's business, professional or other relevant experience and areas of expertise, current business and home addresses and contact information, other board positions or prior experience and any knowledge and experience relating to investment companies and investment company governance. Successful candidates must meet several other criteria as set forth in the Nominating Committee charter, which is attached as Exhibit A to this proxy statement."
"2954","Audit Committee"
"2955","      The Funds have an Audit Committee, currently consisting of Mr. Meurer, Ms. O'Drobinak and Dr. Pappas, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The Board will appoint Mr. Roussin to"
"2956","serve on the Audit Committee upon his election by shareholders. Mr. Meurer serves as Chairman of the Audit Committee and is the Funds' designated Audit Committee Financial Expert. The primary responsibilities of the Audit Committee are, as set forth in its charter, to make recommendations to the Board as to the selection, appointment, retention, compensation and termination of each Trust's Independent Accountants, review and evaluate the Independent Accountants' independence and qualifications, oversee the work of the Independent Accountants, review information and reports provided by management and the Independent Accountants with respect to each Trust's financial statement and internal controls and address any other matters regarding audits and financial statements. The Audit Committee met five times during the most recent fiscal year."
"2957","Compliance Committee"
"2958","      The Funds have a Compliance Committee, currently consisting of Dr. Talbot and Dr. Jarrett, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The Board will appoint Mr. Carter to serve on the Compliance Committee upon his election by shareholders. Dr. Talbot serves as Chairman of the Compliance Committee. The primary responsibilities of the Compliance Committee are: to oversee each Trust's compliance with all regulatory obligations arising under the applicable federal securities law, rules and regulations and oversee management's implementation and enforcement of the Trusts' compliance policies and procedures. The Compliance Committee met four times during the last fiscal year."
"2959","Qualified Legal Compliance Committee"
"2960","      The Funds have a Qualified Legal Compliance Committee, currently consisting of Dr. Jarrett, Mr. Meurer, Ms. O'Drobinak, Dr. Pappas and Dr. Talbot, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The Board will appoint Messrs. Carter and Roussin to serve on the Qualified Legal Compliance Committee upon their election by shareholders. The primary responsibility of the Qualified Legal Compliance Committee is to: (i) receive, review and take appropriate action with respect to any report made or referred to the Qualified Legal Compliance Committee by an attorney of evidence of a material violation of applicable U.S. federal or state securities law, material breach of a fiduciary duty under U.S. federal or state law or a similar material violation by a Trust or by any officer, director, employee, or agent of the Trust; (ii) otherwise fulfill the responsibilities of a qualified legal compliance committee pursuant to Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated thereunder; and perform such other duties as may be assigned to it, from time to time, by the Board. The Qualified Legal Compliance Committee did not meet during the most recent fiscal year."
"2961","Risk Oversight"
"2962","      Consistent with its responsibility for oversight of the Trusts and the Funds, the Board oversees the management of risks relating to the administration and operation of the Trusts and the Funds. Eagle, as part of its responsibilities for the day-to-day operations of the Funds, is responsible for day-to-day risk management for the Funds. The Board, in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment, also separately considers potential risks that may impact the Funds. The Board performs this risk management oversight directly and, as to certain matters, through its committees (described above) and through the Independent Trustees.  The following provides an"
"2963","overview of the principal, but not all, aspects of the Board's oversight of risk management for the Trusts and the Funds."
"2964","      In general, a Fund's risks include, among others, investment risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, valuation risk and operational risk. The Board has adopted, and periodically reviews, policies and procedures designed to address risks to the Trusts and the Funds. In addition, under the general oversight of the Board, Eagle, the Funds' subadvisers and other service providers to the Funds have themselves adopted a variety of policies, procedures and controls designed to address particular risks to the Funds. Different processes, procedures and controls are employed with respect to different types of risks. Further, Eagle oversees and regularly monitors the investments, operations and compliance of the Funds' subadvisers."
"2965","      The Board also oversees risk management for the Trusts and the Funds through review of regular reports, presentations and other information from officers of the Funds and other persons. The Funds' CCO and senior officers of Eagle regularly report to the Board on a range of matters, including those relating to risk management. The Board also regularly receives reports from Eagle and the Funds' subadvisers with respect to the Funds' investments. In addition to regular reports from Eagle, the Board also receives reports regarding other service providers to the Funds, either directly or through Eagle or the Funds' CCO, on a periodic or regular basis. At least annually, the Board receives a report from the Funds' CCO regarding the effectiveness of the Funds' compliance program. Also, on an annual basis, the Board receives reports, presentations and other information from Eagle and the Funds' subadvisers in connection with the Board's consideration of the renewal of: (1) each of the Trusts' agreements with Eagle and the Funds' subadvisers; (2) the Trusts' agreements with EFD; and (3) the Trusts' distribution plans under Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act."
"2966","      The Funds' Principal Financial Officer also reports regularly to the Audit Committee on fund valuation matters. In addition, the Audit Committee receives regular reports from the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm on internal control and financial reporting matters. On at least a quarterly basis, the Independent Trustees meet with the Funds' CCO to discuss matters relating to the Funds' compliance program."
"2967","      Not all risks that may affect the Funds can be identified nor can controls be developed to eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects. It may not be practical or cost effective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks, the processes and controls employed to address certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness, and some risks are simply beyond the reasonable control of Eagle, the Funds, the subadvisers or other service providers. Moreover, it is necessary to bear certain risks (such as investment-related risks) in seeking to achieve each Fund's goals. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the Board's ability to manage risk is subject to substantial limitations."
"2968","Shareholder Communications"
"2969","      Shareholders may communicate with the Board (or individual Trustees serving on the Board) by sending written communications, addressed to the Board as a group or to any individual Trustee, to the Funds at 880 Carillon Parkway, St. Petersburg, Florida 33716. The Funds will ensure that this communication (assuming it is properly marked care of the Board or care of a specific Trustee) is delivered to the Board or the specified Trustee, as the case may be. The Secretary of the Trusts may determine not to forward any letter that does not relate to the business of the Fund."
"2970","Trustee Compensation"
"2971","      Effective January 1, 2016, each Independent Trustee of the Trusts who is not an employee of Eagle or its affiliates receives an annual retainer of $58,000 and an additional fee of $5,000 for each combined quarterly meeting of the Trusts attended. In addition, each Audit Committee and Compliance Committee member receives $1,000 per meeting (in person or telephonic). The Independent Chairman receives an annual retainer of $25,000, the Audit Committee Chairperson receives an annual retainer of $15,000, and the Compliance Committee Chairperson receives an annual retainer of $15,000. Trustees' fees and expenses are paid equally by each Fund. Prior to January 1, 2016, each Independent Trustee received an annual retainer of $48,000."
"2972","      The following table shows the compensation earned by each current Trustee based on each Trust's last fiscal year. No Trustee will receive any benefits upon retirement.  Thus, no pension  or retirement benefits have accrued as part of any of any Trust's expenses. No officer, director or employee of Eagle receives any compensation from the Trusts for acting as a Trustee or officer."

"3363","      The Trusts' Audit Committee Charter provides that the Audit Committee (comprised of the Independent Trustees of the Trusts) is responsible for pre-approval of all auditing services performed for the Trusts. The Audit Committee reports to the Board regarding its approval of the engagement of the auditor and the proposed fees for the engagement, and the majority of the Board"
"3364","(including the members of the Board who are Independent Trustees) must approve the auditor at an in-person meeting.

The Trusts' Audit Committee Charter also permits a designated member of the Audit Committee to pre-approve, between meetings, one or more non-audit service projects, subject to ratification by the Audit Committee at the next meeting of the Audit Committee. The Trusts' Audit Committee pre- approved all fees described above which PwC billed to the Trusts."
"3365","      Representatives of PwC are not expected to be present at the special meeting of shareholders. Should any representatives of PwC attend the meeting they will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire."
"3366","Proxies"
"3367","      Whether you expect to be personally present at the special meeting or not, we encourage you to vote by proxy. You can do this in one of three ways. You may complete, date, sign and return the accompanying proxy card using the enclosed postage prepaid envelope; you may vote by calling the number on the enclosed proxy card; or you may vote on the internet by accessing the website address on the enclosed proxy card. Your shares will be voted as you instruct. If no choice is indicated, your shares will be voted FOR the proposal and in the discretion of the persons named as proxies on such other matters that may properly come before the special meeting. Any shareholder giving a proxy may revoke it before it is exercised at the special meeting by submitting to the Secretary of the Funds a written notice of revocation or a subsequently signed proxy card, or by attending the special meeting and voting in person. A prior proxy can also be revoked through the website or toll free telephone number listed on the enclosed proxy card. If not so revoked, the shares represented by the proxy will be cast at the special meeting and any adjournments thereof. Attendance by a shareholder at the special meeting does not, in itself, revoke a proxy."
"3368","Quorum"
"3369","      A quorum must be present at the meeting for the transaction of business. Under each Trust's Declaration of Trust, a quorum is defined as the presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the shares of the Trusts entitled to vote on the proposal."
"3370","Adjournment"
"3371","      In the event that a quorum is not present at the meeting, or in the event that a quorum is present but sufficient votes to approve the proposal are not received, the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the meeting to a later date to permit further solicitation of votes. Any such adjournment will require the affirmative vote of a majority of shares of the Funds, present or represented by proxy at the meeting to be adjourned. When voting on a proposed adjournment, the persons named as proxies will vote all proxies that they are entitled to vote FOR approval of any proposal in favor of adjournment and will vote all proxies required to be withheld with respect to any such proposal against adjournment."
"3372","Solicitation of Proxies"
"3373","      Proxies are solicited primarily by mail. Additional solicitations may be made by telephone by officers or employees of the Funds and Eagle or by proxy soliciting firms retained by the Funds. The Funds have retained Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (the Solicitor) to provide proxy solicitation  services  in  connection  with  the  meeting  at  an  estimated  cost  of  approximately"
"3374","$250,000, as well as the reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. The Solicitor will also be responsible for printing and mailing the proxy statement as well as providing proxy tabulation services. In addition, the Funds may reimburse persons holding shares in their names or names of their nominees for expenses incurred in forwarding solicitation material to their beneficial owners. The Funds will bear the costs of preparing, printing and mailing the proxy statements and soliciting and tabulating proxies."
"3375","      As the meeting date approaches, the shareholders of the Funds may receive a call from a representative of the Solicitor if the Funds have not yet received their proxies. Authorization to permit the Solicitor to execute proxies may be obtained by telephonic instructions from shareholders. Proxies that are obtained telephonically will be recorded in accordance with the procedures set forth below. Management of the Funds believes that these procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that the identity of the shareholder casting the vote is accurately determined and that the proxies of the shareholders are accurately determined. In all cases where a telephonic proxy is solicited, the Solicitor's representative is required to ask the shareholder for the shareholder's full name, address, title (if the person giving the proxy is authorized to act on behalf of an entity, such as a corporation), the number of shares owned and to confirm that the shareholder has received this proxy statement in the mail. If the shareholder solicited agrees with the information provided to the Solicitor by the Funds, the Solicitor's representative has the responsibility to explain the process, read the proposal listed on the proxy card, and ask for the shareholder's votes on each proposal. The Solicitor's representative, although permitted to answer questions about the process, is not permitted to recommend to the shareholder how to vote, other than to read any recommendation set forth in this proxy statement. The Solicitor will record the shareholder's proxy on the card. Within 72 hours, the Solicitor will send the shareholder a letter to confirm the shareholder's vote and ask the shareholder to call the Solicitor immediately if the shareholder's proxy is not correctly reflected in the confirmation."
"3376","Record Date and Outstanding Shares"
"3377","      Only shareholders of the Funds at the close of business on the Record Date (July 15, 2016) are entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting and any postponement or adjournment thereof.

"4010","By Order of the Board of Trustees, Daniel R. Dzibinski"
"4011","Secretary"
"4012","Eagle Capital Appreciation Fund Eagle Growth & Income Fund Eagle Series Trust"
"4013","Dated: July 22, 2016 St. Petersburg, Florida"
"4014","A. Purpose"
"4015","Exhibit A"
"4016","NOMINATING COMMITTEE CHARTER"
"4017","      The Boards of Trustees of the investment companies that make up the Eagle Mutual Funds (each a Trust and, collectively, the Trusts) have created a Nominating Committee (Committee).  The purpose of the Committee is twofold:"
"4018","1. Identify and recommend for nomination candidates to serve as Board members who are not interested persons of the Trusts (Independent Trustees) as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act); and"
"4019","2. Evaluate and make recommendations to the full Board regarding potential Board candidates who are interested persons of the Trusts (Interested Persons) as that term is defined by the 1940 Act."
"4020","B. Committee Membership"
"4021","1. Composition.  The Committee shall be composed solely of Independent Trustees."
"4022","2. Compensation. The Board shall determine the compensation of Committee members, including the Committee Chairperson."
"4023","3. Selection and Removal. The Board shall appoint members of the Committee and a Chairperson of the Committee for one-year terms. There is no limit on the number of consecutive terms that a Committee member or a Chairperson can serve. By a majority vote, the Board may remove or replace members of the Committee and designate a different member as Chairperson for any reason at any time."
"4024","C. Meetings and Procedures"
"4025","1. Meetings. The Committee shall meet on an as-needed basis to carry out its duties under this Charter. Meetings may be called by the Chairperson of the Committee or by a majority of the Committee members. Meetings shall be chaired by the Chairperson or, in his or her absence, by a member chosen by the Committee. Meetings may be conducted with members present in person or by telephone or other communications facilities that permit all persons participating in the meeting to hear or communicate with each other. A majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The act of a majority of the members present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Committee."
"4026","2. Minutes. The Committee shall keep minutes of its meetings and provide copies of such minutes to each full Board for its review."
"4027","3. Annual Review. The Committee shall review this Charter at least annually and recommend any necessary changes to the Board."
"4028","4. Invitations to Meetings. The Committee may request that a non-member with information on a potential Board candidate attend a meeting of the Committee or meet with any members of, or consultants to, the Committee."
"4029","5. Independent Advisers. The Committee shall have the authority, to the extent it deems necessary or appropriate and without seeking approval of each full Board, to retain special legal, accounting or other advisers. Each Trust shall provide appropriate funding, as determined by the Committee, for payment of ordinary administrative Committee expenses, as well as for compensation to any advisers retained by the Committee."
"4030","6. Self-Evaluation. The Committee shall periodically review the effectiveness of the Committee and its members."
"4031","D. Responsibility of the Committee"
"4032","1. Candidate Identification and Recommendation. The Committee shall identify and recommend to the Board the selection and nomination of candidates for Independent Trustee. The Committee shall consider recommendations for potential candidates from any source it deems appropriate - Board members, Fund shareholders, legal counsel to the Independent Trustees or other such sources as the Committee deems appropriate."
"4033","2. Candidate Evaluations. The Committee shall evaluate potential candidates' qualifications for Board membership and their independence from each Fund's investment adviser and other principal service providers. The Committee shall consider the effect of any relationships delineated in the 1940 Act or other types of relationships, e.g., business, financial or family relationships with the investment adviser(s) or other principal service providers, which might impair independence. In determining potential candidates' qualifications for Board membership, the Committee may consider all factors it may determine to be relevant to fulfilling the role of being a member of the Board."
"4034","a. Criteria for Selecting Nominees"
"4035","The Committee shall nominate candidates for new or vacant Board positions based on its evaluation of which applicants or potential candidates are most qualified to serve and protect the interests of each Trust's shareholders and to promote the effective operation of the Board. In order for the Committee to consider an applicant or potential candidate, the Committee initially must receive at least the following information regarding such person: (1) name; (2) date of birth; (3) education; (4) business, professional or other relevant experience and areas of   expertise;"
"4036","(5) current business, professional or other relevant experience and areas of expertise; (6) current business and home addresses and contact information;"
"4037","(7) other board positions or prior experience; and (8) any knowledge and experience relating to investment companies and investment company governance (collectively, Preliminary Information)."
"4038","A successful candidate must qualify as an Independent Trustee under the 1940 Act and should have certain uniform characteristics, such as a very high level of integrity, appropriate experience, and a commitment to fulfill the fiduciary duties inherent in Board membership. The Committee also shall consider the extent to which potential candidates possess sufficiently diverse skill sets and diversity characteristics that would contribute to the Board's overall effectiveness."
"4039","b. Submissions by Shareholders of Potential Nominees"
"4040","The Committee shall consider potential candidates for nomination identified by one or more shareholders of a Trust. Shareholders can submit recommendations in writing to the attention of the Chairperson of the Committee at an address to be maintained by Trust management for this purpose. In order to be considered by the Committee, any shareholder recommendation must include the Preliminary Information set forth in subsection 2.a above."
"4041","Following an initial evaluation by the Committee based on the Preliminary Information, a successful candidate proposed by a shareholder must:"
"4042","(1) demonstrate the integrity, experience, sound business judgment, talents and commitment necessary to fulfill the fiduciary duties inherent in Board membership and to add value to the Board's performance of its duties;"
"4043","(2) be prepared to submit written answers to a questionnaire seeking professional and personal information that will assist the Committee to evaluate the candidate and to determine, among other matters, whether the candidate would be an Independent Trustee under the 1940 Act or otherwise have material relationships with key service providers to the Trusts;"
"4044","(3) submit character references and agree to appropriate background checks;"
"4045","(4) demonstrate the disposition to act independently from management, but effectively within a Board composed of numerous members;"
"4046","(5) be willing to meet with one or more members of the Committee at a time and location convenient to those Committee members in order to discuss the candidate's qualifications; and"
"4047","(6) if nominated and elected, be able to prepare for and attend in person Board and Committee meetings at various locations in the United States."
"4048","3. Evaluation of Candidates for Nomination as Interested Trustees. The Committee shall evaluate those Interested Persons who are proposed by management of the Trusts to serve as Board members and then make appropriate recommendations to the Board regarding such proposed nominees. The Committee shall review such information as it deems appropriate in order to make this evaluation. At its option, the Committee also can seek to interview any such potential nominee."
