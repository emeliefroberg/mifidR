"487","Report of Independent"
"488","Registered Public"
"489","Accounting Firm"
"490","To the Board of Trustees of"
"491","Two Roads Shared Trust"
"492","and the Shareholders of"
"493","Belvedere Alternative"
"494","Income Fund"
"495","In planning and performing"
"496","our audit of the financial"
"497","statements of Belvedere"
"498","Alternative Income Fund"
"499","(the Fund), a separate"
"500","series of the Two Roads"
"501","Shared Trust, as of"
"502","October 31, 2013 and for"
"503","the period from December"
"504","31, 2012 (commencement"
"505","of operations) through"
"506","October 31, 2013, in"
"507","accordance with the"
"508","standards of the Public"
"509","Company Accounting"
"510","Oversight Board (United"
"511","States), we considered the"
"512","Fund's internal control over"
"513","financial reporting,"
"514","including controls over"
"515","safeguarding securities, as"
"516","a basis for designing our"
"517","auditing procedures for the"
"518","purpose of expressing our"
"519","opinion on the financial"
"520","statements and to comply"
"521","with the requirements of"
"522","Form N-SAR, but not for"
"523","the purpose of expressing"
"524","an opinion on the"
"525","effectiveness of the Fund's"
"526","internal control over"
"527","financial reporting."
"528","Accordingly, we express no"
"529","such opinion."
"530","The management of the"
"531","Fund is responsible for"
"532","establishing and"
"533","maintaining effective"
"534","internal control over"
"535","financial reporting. In"
"536","fulfilling this responsibility,"
"537","estimates and judgments"
"538","by management are"
"539","required to assess the"
"540","expected benefits and"
"541","related costs of controls. A"
"542","fund's internal control over"
"543","financial reporting is a"
"544","process designed to"
"545","provide reasonable"
"546","assurance regarding the"
"547","reliability of financial"
"548","reporting and the"
"549","preparation of financial"
"550","statements for external"
"551","purposes in accordance"
"552","with generally accepted"
"553","accounting principles"
"554","(GAAP). A fund's internal"
"555","control over financial"
"556","reporting includes those"
"557","policies and procedures"
"558","that (1) pertain to the"
"559","maintenance of records"
"560","that, in reasonable detail,"
"561","accurately and fairly reflect"
"562","the transactions and"
"563","dispositions of the assets"
"564","of the fund; (2) provide"
"565","reasonable assurance that"
"566","transactions are recorded"
"567","as necessary to permit"
"568","preparation of financial"
"569","statements in accordance"
"570","with GAAP, and that"
"571","receipts and expenditures"
"572","of the fund are being made"
"573","only in accordance with"
"574","authorizations of"
"575","management and directors"
"576","of the fund; and (3) provide"
"577","reasonable assurance"
"578","regarding prevention or"
"579","timely detection of"
"580","unauthorized acquisition,"
"581","use or disposition of a"
"582","fund's assets that could"
"583","have a material effect on"
"584","the financial statements."
"585","Because of its inherent"
"586","limitations, internal control"
"587","over financial reporting"
"588","may not prevent or detect"
"589","misstatements. Also,"
"590","projections of any"
"591","evaluation of effectiveness"
"592","to future periods are"
"593","subject to the risk that"
"594","controls may become"
"595","inadequate because of"
"596","changes in conditions or"
"597","that the degree of"
"598","compliance with the"
"599","policies or procedures may"
"600","deteriorate."
"601","A deficiency in internal"
"602","control over financial"
"603","reporting exists when the"
"604","design or operation of a"
"605","control does not allow"
"606","management or"
"607","employees, in the normal"
"608","course of performing their"
"609","assigned functions, to"
"610","prevent or detect"
"611","misstatements on a timely"
"612","basis. A material weakness"
"613","is a deficiency, or a"
"614","combination of"
"615","deficiencies, in internal"
"616","control over financial"
"617","reporting, such that there is"
"618","a reasonable possibility"
"619","that a material"
"620","misstatement of the Fund's"
"621","annual or interim financial"
"622","statements will not be"
"623","prevented or detected on a"
"624","timely basis."
"625","Our consideration of the"
"626","Fund's internal control over"
"627","financial reporting was for"
"628","the limited purpose"
"629","described in the first"
"630","paragraph and would not"
"631","necessarily disclose all"
"632","deficiencies in internal"
"633","control that might be"
"634","material weaknesses under"
"635","standards established by"
"636","the Public Company"
"637","Accounting Oversight"
"638","Board (United States)."
"639","However, we noted no"
"640","deficiencies in the Fund's"
"641","internal control over"
"642","financial reporting and its"
"643","operation, including"
"644","controls over safeguarding"
"645","securities, that we consider"
"646","to be a material weakness"
"647","as defined above as of"
"648","October 31, 2013."
"649","This report is intended"
"650","solely for the information"
"651","and use of management"
"652","and the Board of Trustees"
"653","of Belvedere Alternative"
"654","Income Fund, a separate"
"655","series of the Two Roads"
"656","Shared Trust, and the"
"657","Securities and Exchange"
"658","Commission and is not"
"659","intended to be and should"
"660","not be used by anyone"
"661","other than these specified"
"662","parties."
