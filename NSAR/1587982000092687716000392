"1003","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT"
"1004","REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"1005","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1006","To the Shareholders and"
"1007","Board of Trustees of"
"1008","Investment Managers Series Trust II"
"1009","Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53212"
"1010","In planning and performing our audit"
"1011","of the financial statements of"
"1012","MarketGrader 100 Enhanced Index"
"1013","Fund and Altrius Enhanced Income"
"1014","Fund (the Funds), each a series of"
"1015","Investment Managers Series Trust II, as"
"1016","of and for the year ended December 31,"
"1017","2015, in accordance with the standards"
"1018","of the Public Company Accounting"
"1019","Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1020","considered their internal control over"
"1021","financial reporting, including control"
"1022","activities for safeguarding securities, as"
"1023","a basis for designing our auditing"
"1024","procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"1025","our opinion on the financial statements"
"1026","and to comply with the requirements of"
"1027","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1028","expressing an opinion on the"
"1029","effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"1030","control over financial reporting."
"1031","Accordingly, we express no such"
"1032","opinion."
"1033","The management of the Funds is"
"1034","responsible for establishing and"
"1035","maintaining effective internal control"
"1036","over financial reporting.   In fulfilling"
"1037","this responsibility, estimates and"
"1038","judgments by management are required"
"1039","to assess the expected benefits and"
"1040","related costs of controls.   A companys"
"1041","internal control over financial reporting"
"1042","is a process designed to provide"
"1043","reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1044","reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1045","preparation of financial statements for"
"1046","external purposes in accordance with"
"1047","generally accepted accounting"
"1048","principles.   A companys internal control"
"1049","over financial reporting includes those"
"1050","policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"1051","to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1052","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1053","reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"1054","of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"1055","reasonable assurance that transactions"
"1056","are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1057","preparation of financial statements in"
"1058","accordance with generally accepted"
"1059","accounting principles, and that receipts"
"1060","and expenditures of the company are"
"1061","being made only in accordance with"
"1062","authorizations of management and"
"1063","directors of the company; and (3)"
"1064","provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1065","prevention or timely detection of"
"1066","unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"1067","disposition of a companys assets that"
"1068","could have a material effect on the"
"1069","financial statements."
"1070","Because of inherent limitations, internal"
"1071","control over financial reporting may not"
"1072","prevent or detect misstatements.   Also,"
"1073","projections of any evaluation of"
"1074","effectiveness to future periods are"
"1075","subject to the risk that controls may"
"1076","become inadequate because of changes"
"1077","in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1078","compliance with the policies or"
"1079","procedures may deteriorate."
"1080","A deficiency in internal control over"
"1081","financial reporting exists when the"
"1082","design or operation of a control does not"
"1083","allow management or employees, in the"
"1084","normal course of performing their"
"1085","assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1086","misstatements on a timely basis.   A"
"1087","material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"1088","combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1089","control over financial reporting, such"
"1090","that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"1091","a material misstatement of the companys"
"1092","annual or interim financial statements"
"1093","will not be prevented or detected on a"
"1094","timely basis."

"1132","To the Shareholders and"
"1133","Board of Trustees of"
"1134","Investment Managers Series Trust II"
"1135","Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53212"
"1136","In planning and performing our audit of"
"1137","the financial statements of Kaizen"
"1138","Hedged Premium Spreads Fund (the"
"1139","Fund), a series of Investment Managers"
"1140","Series Trust II, as of and for the year"
"1141","ended December 31, 2015, in accordance"
"1142","with the standards of the Public"
"1143","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1144","(United States), we considered their"
"1145","internal control over financial reporting,"
"1146","including control activities for"
"1147","safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1148","designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1149","purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1150","financial statements and to comply with"
"1151","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"1152","for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"1153","on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"1154","control over financial reporting."
"1155","Accordingly, we express no such"
"1156","opinion."
"1157","The management of the Fund is"
"1158","responsible for establishing and"
"1159","maintaining effective internal control"
"1160","over financial reporting.   In fulfilling"
"1161","this responsibility, estimates and"
"1162","judgments by management are required"
"1163","to assess the expected benefits and"
"1164","related costs of controls.   A companys"
"1165","internal control over financial reporting is"
"1166","a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1167","assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1168","financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1169","financial statements for external purposes"
"1170","in accordance with generally accepted"
"1171","accounting principles.   A companys"
"1172","internal control over financial reporting"
"1173","includes those policies and procedures"
"1174","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1175","records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1176","accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1177","transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"1178","of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1179","assurance that transactions are recorded"
"1180","as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1181","financial statements in accordance with"
"1182","generally accepted accounting principles,"
"1183","and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1184","company are being made only in"
"1185","accordance with authorizations of"
"1186","management and directors of the"
"1187","company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1188","assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1189","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"1190","or disposition of a companys assets that"
"1191","could have a material effect on the"
"1192","financial statements."
"1193","Because of inherent limitations, internal"
"1194","control over financial reporting may not"
"1195","prevent or detect misstatements.   Also,"
"1196","projections of any evaluation of"
"1197","effectiveness to future periods are subject"
"1198","to the risk that controls may become"
"1199","inadequate because of changes in"
"1200","conditions, or that the degree of"
"1201","compliance with the policies or"
"1202","procedures may deteriorate."
"1203","A deficiency in internal control over"
"1204","financial reporting exists when the design"
"1205","or operation of a control does not allow"
"1206","management or employees, in the normal"
"1207","course of performing their assigned"
"1208","functions, to prevent or detect"
"1209","misstatements on a timely basis.   A"
"1210","material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"1211","combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1212","control over financial reporting, such that"
"1213","there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1214","material misstatement of the companys"
"1215","annual or interim financial statements"
"1216","will not be prevented or detected on a"
"1217","timely basis."
"1218","Our consideration of the Funds internal"
"1219","control over financial reporting was for"
