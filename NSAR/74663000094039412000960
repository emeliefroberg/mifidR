"583","pursuant to Section 2.5 of Article II of the"
"584","Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust"
"585","of EATON VANCE SERIES TRUST II (the"
"586","Trust), dated December 14, 1995 as from"
"587","time to time amended (the Declaration of
Trust).  All words and terms capitalized in"
"588","these By-Laws shall have the meaning or"
"589","meanings set forth for such words or terms in"
"590","the Declaration of Trust."
"591","ARTICLE I"
"592","The Trustees"
"593","SECTION 1.  Election and Term of Office.  The"
"594","Trustees named in the Preamble of the"
"595","Declaration of Trust and any additional"
"596","Trustees appointed pursuant to Section 4 of"
"597","this Article I, shall serve as Trustees during the"
"598","lifetime of the Trust, except as otherwise"
"599","provided below."
"600","SECTION 2.  Number of Trustees.  The number"
"601","of Trustees shall be fixed by the Trustees,"
"602","provided, however, that such number shall at"
"603","no time exceed eighteen."
"604","SECTION 3.  Resignation and Removal.  Any"
"605","Trustee may resign his trust by written"
"606","instrument signed by him and delivered to"
"607","the other Trustees, which shall take effect"
"608","upon such delivery or upon such later date as"
"609","is specified therein.  Any Trustee who"
"610","requests in writing to be retired or who has"
"611","become incapacitated by illness or injury may"
"612","be retired by written instruments signed by a"
"613","majority of the other Trustees, specifying the"
"614","date of his retirement.  Any Trustee may be"
"615","removed with or without cause, by (i) the"

"617","the Shares or, (ii) the affirmative vote of, or"
"618","written instrument, signed by at least two-"
"619","thirds of the remaining Trustees prior to such"
"620","removal, specifying the date when such"
"621","removal shall become effective, provided,"
"622","however, that the removal of any Trustee who"
"623","is not an Interested Person of the Trust shall"
"624","additionally require the affirmative vote of, or"
"625","a written instrument executed by, at least"
"626","two-thirds of the remaining Trustees who are"
"627","not Interested Persons of the Trust."
"628","	No natural person shall serve as a"
"629","Trustee of the Trust after the holders of"
"630","record of not less than two-thirds of the"
"631","outstanding shares of beneficial interest of"
"632","the Trust (the shares) have declared that"
"633","he be removed from that office by a"
"634","declaration in writing signed by such holders"
"635","and filed with the Custodian of the assets of"
"636","the Trust or by votes cast by such holders in"
"637","person or by proxy at a meeting called for the"
"638","purpose.  Solicitation of such a declaration"
"639","shall be deemed a solicitation of a proxy"
"640","within the meaning of Section 20(a) of the"
"641","Investment Company Act of 1940, as"
"642","amended.  As used herein, the term Act"
"643","shall mean the Investment Company Act of"
"644","1940 and the rules and regulations"
"645","thereunder, as amended from time to time."
"646","	The Trustees of the Trust shall"
"647","promptly call a meeting of the shareholders"
"648","for the purpose of voting upon a question of"
"649","removal of any such Trustee or Trustees when"
"650","requested in writing so to do by the record"
"651","holders of not less than 10 per centum of the"
"652","outstanding shares."
"653","	Whenever ten or more shareholders of"
"654","record of the Trust who have been such for at"
"655","least six months preceding the date of"
"656","application, and who hold in the aggregate"
"657","either shares having a net asset value of at"
"658","least $25,000 or at least 1 per centum of the"
"659","outstanding shares, whichever is less, shall"
"660","apply to the Trustees in writing, stating that"
"661","they wish to communicate with other"
"662","shareholders with a view to obtaining"
"663","signatures to a request for a meeting of"
"664","shareholders pursuant to this Section 3 and"
"665","accompanied by a form of communication"
"666","and request which they wish to transmit, the"
"667","Trustees shall within five business days after"
"668","receipt of such application either"
"669","	(1) afford to such applicants access to a"
"670","list of the names and addresses of all"
"671","shareholders as recorded on the books of the"
"672","Trust; or"
"673","	(2) inform such applicants as to the"
"674","approximate number of shareholders of"
"675","record, and the approximate cost of mailing"
"676","to them the proposed communication and"
"677","form of request."
"678","	If the Trustees elect to follow the"
"679","course specified in subparagraph (2) above of"
"680","this Section 3, the Trustees, upon the written"
"681","request of such applicants, accompanied by a"
"682","tender of the material to be mailed and of the"
"683","reasonable expenses of mailing, shall, with"
"684","reasonable promptness, mail such material to"
"685","all shareholders of record at their addresses"
"686","as recorded on the books, unless within five"
"687","business days after such tender the Trustees"
"688","shall mail to such applicants and file with the"
"689","Securities and Exchange Commission (the
Commission), together with a copy of the"
"690","material to be mailed, a written statement"
"691","signed by at least a majority of the Trustees to"
"692","the effect that in their opinion either such"
"693","material contains untrue statements of fact or"
"694","omits to state facts necessary to make the"
"695","statements contained therein not misleading,"
"696","or would violate applicable law, and"
"697","specifying the basis of such opinion."
"698","	After the Commission has had an"
"699","opportunity for hearing upon the objections"
"700","specified in the written statement so filed by"
"701","the Trustees, the Trustees or such applicants"
"702","may demand that the Commission enter an"
"703","order either sustaining one or more of such"
"704","objections or refusing to sustain any of such"
"705","objections.  If the Commission shall enter an"
"706","order refusing to sustain any of such"
"707","objections, or if, after the entry of an order"
"708","sustaining one or more of such objections,"
"709","the Commission shall find, after notice and"
"710","opportunity for hearing, that all objections so"
"711","sustained have been met, and shall enter an"
"712","order so declaring, the Trustees shall mail"
"713","copies of such material to all shareholders"
"714","with reasonable promptness after the entry of"
"715","such order and the renewal of such tender."
"716","	Until such provisions become null, void,"
"717","inoperative and removed from these By-Laws"
"718","pursuant to the next sentence, the provisions"
"719","of all but the first paragraph of this Section 3"
"720","may not be amended or repealed without the"
"721","vote of a majority of the Trustees and a"
"722","majority of the outstanding shares of the"
"723","Trust.  These same provisions shall be"
"724","deemed null, void, inoperative and removed"
"725","from these By-Laws upon the effectiveness of"
"726","any amendment to the Act which eliminates"
"727","them from Section 16 of the Act or the"
"728","effectiveness of any successor Federal law"
"729","governing the operation of the Trust which"
"730","does not contain such provisions."
"731","SECTION 4.  Vacancies.  The term of office of a"
"732","Trustee shall terminate and a vacancy shall"
"733","occur in the event of the declination, death,"
"734","resignation, retirement, removal, adjudicated"
"735","incompetence, or other incapacity to perform"
"736","the duties of the office, or removal, of a"
"737","Trustee. No such vacancy shall operate to"
"738","annul these By-Laws or to revoke any existing"
"739","agency created pursuant to the terms of"
"740","these By-Laws.  In the case of a vacancy,"
"741","including a vacancy resulting from an increase"
"742","in the number of Trustees, such vacancy may"
"743","be filled by (i) holders of a plurality of the"
"744","Shares entitled to vote, acting at any meeting"
"745","of holders held in accordance with the By-"
"746","Laws, or (ii) to the extent permitted by the"
"747","1940 Act, the vote of a majority of the"
"748","Trustees. As soon as any Trustee so appointed"
"749","shall have accepted this trust, the trust estate"
"750","shall vest in the new Trustee or Trustees,"
"751","together with the continuing Trustees,"
"752","without any further act or conveyance, and he"
"753","shall be deemed a Trustee hereunder and"
"754","under the Declaration of Trust. The power of"
"755","appointment is subject to the provisions of"
"756","Section l6(a) of the Act. Any Trustee so"
"757","elected by the holders or appointed by the"
"758","Trustees shall hold office as provided in these"
"759","By-Laws."
"760","SECTION 5.  Temporary Absence of Trustee."
"761","Any Trustee may, by power of attorney,"
"762","delegate his power for a period not"
"763","exceeding six months at an one time to any"
"764","other Trustee or Trustees, provided that in no"
"765","case shall less than two Trustees personally"
"766","exercise the other powers hereunder except"
"767","as herein otherwise expressly provided."
"768","SECTION 6.  Effect of Death, Resignation,"
"769","Removal, Etc. of a Trustee.  The death,"
"770","declination, resignation, retirement, removal,"
"771","or incapacity of the Trustees, or anyone of"
"772","them, shall not operate to annul the Trust or"
"773","to revoke any existing agency created"
"774","pursuant to the terms of the Declaration of"
"775","Trust or these By-Laws."
"776","ARTICLE II"
"777","Officers and Their Election"
"778","SECTION 1.  Officers.  The officers of the Trust"
"779","shall be a President, a Treasurer, a Secretary,"
"780","and such other officers or agents as the"
"781","Trustees may from time to time elect.  It shall"
"782","not be necessary for any Trustee or other"
"783","officer to be a holder of shares in the Trust."
"784","SECTION 2.  Election of Officers.  The"
"785","President, Treasurer and Secretary shall be"
"786","chosen annually by the Trustees."
"787","       Except for the offices of President and"
"788","Secretary, two or more offices may be held by"
"789","a single person.  The officers shall hold office"
"790","until their successors are chosen and"
"791","qualified."
"792","SECTION 3.  Resignations and Removals.  Any"
"793","officer of the Trust may resign by filing a"
"794","written resignation with the President or with"
"795","the Trustees or with the Secretary, which shall"
"796","take effect on being so filed or at such time as"
"797","may otherwise be specified therein.  The"
"798","Trustees may at any meeting remove an"
"799","officer."
"800","ARTICLE III"
"801","Powers and Duties of Trustees and Officers"
"802","SECTION 1.  Trustees.  The business and affairs"
"803","of the Trust shall be managed by the Trustees,"
"804","and they shall have all powers necessary and"
"805","desirable to carry out that responsibility, so"
"806","far as such powers are not inconsistent with"
"807","the laws of the Commonwealth of"
"808","Massachusetts, the Declaration of Trust, or"
"809","these By-Laws."
"810","SECTION 2.  Executive and other Committees."
"811","The Trustees may elect from their own"
"812","number an executive committee to consist of"
"813","not less than three nor more than five"
"814","members, which shall have the power and"
"815","duty to conduct the current and ordinary"
"816","business of the Trust, including the purchase"
"817","and sale of securities, while the Trustees are"
"818","not in session, and such other powers and"
"819","duties as the Trustees may from time to time"
"820","delegate to such committee.  The Trustees"
"821","may also elect from their own number other"
"822","committees from time to time, the number"
"823","composing such committees and the powers"

"1716","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1717","To the Trustees of Eaton Vance Series Trust"
"1718","II and Shareholders of Eaton Vance"
"1719","Parametric Tax-Managed Emerging Markets"
"1720","Fund:"
"1721","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"1722","financial statements of Eaton Vance"
"1723","Parametric Tax-Managed Emerging Markets"
"1724","Fund (the Fund) (one of the funds"
"1725","constituting Eaton Vance Series Trust II ) as"
"1726","of and for the year ended June 30, 2012, in"
"1727","accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1728","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1729","(United States), we considered the Fund's"
"1730","internal control over financial reporting,"
"1731","including controls over safeguarding"
"1732","securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1733","auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1734","expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1735","statements and to comply with the"
"1736","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"1737","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1738","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"1739","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"1740","express no such opinion."
"1741","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"1742","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"1743","internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"1744","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1745","judgments by management are required to"
"1746","assess the expected benefits and related"
"1747","costs of controls.  A fund's internal control"
"1748","over financial reporting is a process designed"
"1749","to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1750","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1751","preparation of financial statements for"
"1752","external purposes in accordance with"
"1753","generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1754","fund's internal control over financial"
"1755","reporting includes those policies and"
"1756","procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1757","maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1758","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1759","transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"1760","the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"1761","that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1762","permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1763","accordance with generally accepted"
"1764","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1765","expenditures of the fund are being made"
"1766","only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1767","management of the fund and trustees of the"
"1768","trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1769","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1770","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition"
"1771","of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"1772","effect on the financial statements."
"1773","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1774","control over financial reporting may not"
"1775","prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"1776","projections of any evaluation of"
"1777","effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"1778","the risk that controls may become"
"1779","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"1780","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1781","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1782","A deficiency in internal control over"
"1783","financial reporting exists when the design or"
"1784","operation of a control does not allow"
"1785","management or employees, in the normal"
"1786","course of performing their assigned"
"1787","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"1788","on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1789","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"1790","in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1791","such that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"1792","a material misstatement of a fund's annual or"
"1793","interim financial statements will not be"
"1794","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1795","Our consideration of the Fund's internal"
"1796","control over financial reporting was for the"
"1797","limited purpose described in the first"
"1798","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"1799","disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"1800","that might be material weaknesses under"
"1801","standards established by the Public"
