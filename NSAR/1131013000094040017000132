"8585","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"8586","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"8587","GuideStone Funds"
"8588","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"8589","of GuideStone Funds (the Trust) as of"
"8590","and for the period ended December 31, 2016, in accordance with"
"8591","the standards of the Public Company"
"8592","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"8593","Trust's internal control over financial"
"8594","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"8595","basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"8596","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"8597","statements and to comply with the requirements"
"8598","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"8599","on the effectiveness of the Trust's"
"8600","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"8601","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"8602","the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"8603","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"8604","maintaining effective internal control"
"8605","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"8606","estimates and judgments by management are"
"8607","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"8608","controls.  A trust's internal control over"
"8609","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"8610","assurance regarding the reliability of"
"8611","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"8612","for external purposes in accordance with"
"8613","generally accepted accounting principles.  A trust's internal"
"8614","control over financial reporting includes those"
"8615","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"8616","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"8617","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"8618","assets of the trust; (2) provide reasonable"
"8619","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"8620","preparation of financial statements in"
"8621","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"8622","that receipts and expenditures of the trust"
"8623","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"8624","management and trustees of the trust; and"
"8625","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"8626","detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"8627","use or disposition of a trust's assets that could have a"
"8628","material effect on the financial statements."
"8629","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"8630","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"8631","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"8632","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"8633","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"8634","conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"8635","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"8636","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"8637","when the design or operation of a control"
"8638","does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"8639","performing their assigned functions, to"
"8640","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"8641","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"8642","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"8643","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"8644","material misstatement of the Trust's annual or interim financial"
"8645","statements will not be prevented or"
"8646","detected on a timely basis."
"8647","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial"
"8648","reporting was for the limited purpose"
"8649","described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily"
"8650","disclose all deficiencies in internal control over"
"8651","financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"8652","standards established by the Public Company"
"8653","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"8654","no deficiencies in the Trust's internal"
"8655","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"8656","controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"8657","consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of"
"8658","December 31, 2016."

"9786","Adviser simultaneously places orders to purchase or sell the same"
"9787","security on behalf of the Fund Account and one or more other"
"9788","accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser, the orders will be allocated as"

"9809","the Trust, or any other investment company under common control"
"9810","with the Trust concerning transactions of the Fund in securities or"
"9811","other assets.  This will not be deemed to prohibit:  (i) the Sub-"

"9817","sub-adviser of the Fund in order to effect an orderly transition of"
"9818","sub-advisory duties so long as such consultations do not concern"
"9819","transactions prohibited by Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act."
"9820","  (f)  The Sub-Adviser will maintain all books and records required"
"9821","to be maintained pursuant to the 1940 Act and the rules and"
"9822","regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to actions by the"

"9824","Adviser or the Fund's administrator (Administrator) with such"
"9825","periodic and special reports as any of them reasonably may request."
"9826","In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940"

"9832","to surrender promptly to the Trust a complete set of any records"
"9833","that it maintains for the Fund upon request by the Trust."
"9834","  (g)  All transactions will be consummated by payment to or"

"9847","shall issue to the Custodian such instructions as may be"
"9848","appropriate in connection with the settlement of any transaction"
"9849","initiated by the Sub-Adviser. The Trust shall be responsible for"
"9850","all custodial arrangements and the payment of all custodial charges"
"9851","and fees, and, upon giving proper instructions to the Custodian,"
"9852","the Sub-Adviser shall have no responsibility or liability with"
"9853","respect to custodial arrangements or the acts, omissions or other"
"9854","conduct of the Custodian, except that it shall be the"
"9855","responsibility of the Sub-Adviser to notify the Adviser if the"
"9856","Custodian fails to confirm in writing proper execution of the"
"9857","instructions."
"9858","  (h)  The Sub-Adviser agrees to provide, at such times as shall be"

"9870","reasonable efforts to arrange for the provision of valuation"
"9871","information or a price(s) for each portfolio security held in the"
"9872","Fund Account for which the Administrator does not obtain prices in"
"9873","the ordinary course of business from an automated pricing service."
"9874","  4.  Further Duties.  In all matters relating to the performance of"
"9875","this Contract, the Sub-Adviser will act in conformity with the"
"9876","provisions of the Trust's Trust Instrument, By-Laws and Registration"

"9895","Fund Account may be invested from time to time. The Adviser shall"
"9896","instruct the Custodian to forward or cause to be forwarded to the"
"9897","Sub-Adviser (or its designated agent) all relevant proxy"

"9914","such period bears to the full month in which such effectiveness or"
"9915","termination occurs.  The Adviser shall be responsible for computing"
"9916","the fee based upon a percentage of the average daily net asset value"
"9917","of the assets of the Fund Account."
"9918","  8.  Limitation of Liability.  The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable"
"9919","for any loss due solely to a mistake of investment judgment, but"
"9920","shall be liable for any loss which is incurred by reason of an act"
"9921","or omission of its employee, partner, director or affiliate, if such"
