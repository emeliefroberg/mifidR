"482","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT"
"483","REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING"
"484","FIRM"
"485","Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"486","Northern Lights Fund Trust II"
"487","Omaha, Nebraska 68130"
"488","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"489","financial statements of Inflation Hedges"
"490","Strategy Fund (the Fund), a series of Northern"
"491","Lights Fund Trust II as of and for the year ended"
"492","November 30, 2013, in accordance with the"
"493","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"494","Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"495","the Funds internal control over financial"
"496","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"497","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"498","procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"499","opinion on the financial statements and to"
"500","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"501","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"502","on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"503","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"504","express no such opinion."
"505","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"506","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"507","control over financial reporting.   In fulfilling"
"508","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"509","management are required to assess the expected"
"510","benefits and related costs of controls.   A"
"511","companys internal control over financial"
"512","reporting is a process designed to provide"
"513","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability"
"514","of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"515","financial statements for external purposes in"
"516","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"517","principles.   A companys internal control over"
"518","financial reporting includes those policies and"
"519","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"520","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"521","and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"522","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"523","provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"524","are recorded as necessary to permit"
"525","preparation of financial statements  in"
"526","accordance  with  generally  accepted"
"527","accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and"
"528","expenditures of the company are being made only"
"529","in accordance with authorizations of management"
"530","and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"531","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"532","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"533","or disposition of a companys assets that could"
"534","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"535","Because of inherent limitations, internal"
"536","control over financial reporting may not"
"537","prevent or detect misstatements.   Also,"
"538","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"539","future periods are subject to the risk that"
"540","controls may become inadequate because of"
"541","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"542","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"543","deteriorate."
"544","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"545","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"546","a control does not allow management or"
"547","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"548","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"549","misstatements on a timely basis.   A material"
"550","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"551","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"552","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"553","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"554","Funds annual or interim financial statements"
"555","will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"556","basis."
"557","Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"558","Northern Lights Fund Trust II"
"559","Page Two"
"560","Our consideration of the Funds internal control"
"561","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"562","purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"563","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"564","internal control that might be material"
"565","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"566","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"567","(United States).   However, we noted no"
"568","deficiencies in the Funds internal control over"
"569","financial reporting and its operation, including"
"570","controls over safeguarding securities that we"
"571","consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"572","above as of November 30, 2013."
"573","This report is intended solely for the information"
"574","and use of management, the Board of Trustees"
"575","of the Northern Lights Fund Trust II and the"
"576","Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not"
"577","intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
"578","other than these specified parties."
