"641","SETTLED ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO MARKET TIMING"
"642","          On October 8, 2004, Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco), successor by"
"643","merger to Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc. and INVESCO Funds Group, Inc. (IFG), both"
"644","former investment advisers, along with Invesco Aim Distributors, n/k/a Invesco"
"645","Distributors, Inc. (Invesco Distributors) reached final settlements with certain"
"646","regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York"
"647","Attorney General and the Colorado Attorney General, to resolve civil enforcement"
"648","actions and/or investigations related to market timing and related activity in"
"649","the AIM Funds (n/k/a the Invesco Funds), including those formerly advised by"
"650","IFG. As part of the settlements, a $325 million fair fund ($110 million of which"
"651","is civil penalties) was created to compensate shareholders harmed by market"
"652","timing and related activity in funds formerly advised by IFG. Additionally,"
"653","Invesco and Invesco Distributors created a $50 million fair fund ($30 million of"
"654","which is civil penalties) to compensate shareholders harmed by market timing and"
"655","related activity in funds advised by Invesco, which was done pursuant to the"
"656","terms of the settlement. The methodology of the fair funds distributions was"
"657","determined by Invesco's independent distribution consultant (IDC Plan), in"
"658","consultation with Invesco and the independent trustees of the Invesco Funds, and"
"659","approved by the SEC on May 23, 2008."
"660","          The IDC Plan provides for distribution to all eligible investors, for"
"661","the periods spanning January 1, 2000 through July 31, 2003 (for the IFG Fair"
"662","Fund) and January 1, 2001 through September 30, 2003 (for the AIM Fair Fund),"
"663","their proportionate share of the applicable Fair Fund to compensate such"
"664","investors for injury they may have suffered as a result of market timing in the"
"665","affected funds. The IDC Plan includes a provision for any residual amounts in"
"666","the Fair Funds to be distributed in the future to the affected funds. Further"
"667","details regarding the IDC Plan and distributions thereunder are available on"
"668","Invesco's Web site, available at http://www.invesco.com/us."
"669","At the present time, management of Invesco and the Invesco Funds are unable to"
"670","estimate the impact, if any, that the outcome of the Pending Litigation and"
"671","Regulatory Inquiries described herein may have on Invesco, Invesco Distributors"
"672","or the Invesco Funds."
"673","Pending Regulatory Action Alleging Market Timing"
"674","          On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Office of the State Auditor -"
"675","Securities Commission (WVASC) issued a Summary Order to Cease and Desist and"
"676","Notice of Right to Hearing to Invesco and Invesco Distributors (Order No."
"677","05-1318). The WVASC makes findings of fact that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"678","entered into certain arrangements permitting market timing of the Invesco Funds"
"679","and failed to disclose these arrangements in the prospectuses for such Funds,"
"680","and conclusions of law to the effect that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"681","violated the West Virginia securities laws. The WVASC orders Invesco and Invesco"
"682","Distributors to cease any further violations and seeks to impose monetary"
"683","sanctions, including restitution to affected investors, disgorgement of fees,"
"684","reimbursement of investigatory, administrative and legal costs and an"
"685","administrative assessment, to be determined by the Commissioner. Initial"
"686","research indicates that these damages could be limited or capped by statute. By"
"687","agreement with the Commissioner of Securities, Invesco's time to respond to that"
"688","Order has been indefinitely suspended."
"689","Private Civil Actions Alleging Market Timing"
"690","          Multiple civil lawsuits, including purported class action and"
"691","shareholder derivative suits, have been filed against various parties"
"692","(including, depending on the lawsuit, certain Invesco Funds, IFG, Invesco,"
"693","Invesco Aim Management Group, Inc., n/k/a Invesco Management Group, Inc. and"
"694","certain related entities, certain of their current and former officers and/or"
"695","certain unrelated third parties) based on"
"696","<PAGE>"
"697","                                                                    Sub-Item 77E"
"698","allegations of improper market timing and related activity in the Invesco Funds."
"699","These lawsuits allege a variety of theories of recovery, including but not"
"700","limited to: (i) violation of various provisions of the Federal and state"
"701","securities laws; (ii) violation of various provisions of Employee Retirement"
"702","Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA); (iii) breach of fiduciary duty;"
"703","and/or (iv) breach of contract. These lawsuits were initiated in both Federal"
"704","and state courts and seek such remedies as compensatory damages; restitution;"
"705","injunctive relief; disgorgement of management fees; imposition of a constructive"
"706","trust; removal of certain directors and/or employees; various corrective"
"707","measures under ERISA; rescission of certain Funds' advisory agreements;"
"708","interest; and attorneys' and experts' fees. All lawsuits based on allegations of"
"709","market timing, late trading, and related issues have been transferred to the"

"730","          1:04-MD-15864-FPS), filed on September 29, 2004."
"731","          On March 1, 2006, the MDL Court dismissed all derivative causes of"
"732","action in the Essenmacher lawsuit but two: (i) the excessive fee claim under"
"733","Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act); and (ii) the"
"734","control person liability claim under Section 48 of the 1940 Act, and all"
"735","claims asserted in the Lepera class action lawsuit but three: (i) the securities"
"736","fraud claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (ii)"
"737","the excessive fee claim under Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act (which survived only"
"738","insofar as plaintiffs seek recovery of fees associated with the assets involved"
"739","in market timing); and (iii) the control person liability claim under Section"
"740","48 of the 1940 Act. On June 14, 2006, the MDL Court entered an order dismissing"
"741","the Section 48 claim in the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuit. Based on the MDL"
"742","Court's March 1, 2006 and June 14, 2006 orders, all claims asserted against the"
"743","Funds that were transferred to the MDL Court were dismissed, although certain"
"744","Funds remain nominal defendants in the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuit. On"
"745","January 5, 2008, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle both"
"746","the class action (Lepera) and the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuits, subject to"
"747","the MDL Court approval."
"748","          On September 15, 2006, Judge Motz for the MDL Court granted the"
"749","Defendants' motion to dismiss the ERISA (Calderon) lawsuit and dismissed such"
"750","lawsuit. The Plaintiff appealed this decision. On June 16, 2008, the Fourth"
"751","Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal and remanded this lawsuit back"
"752","to the MDL Court for further proceedings. On December 15, 2008, the parties"
"753","reached an agreement in principle to settle this lawsuit, subject to the MDL"
"754","Court approval. No payments are required under the settlement; however, the"
"755","parties agreed that certain limited changes to benefit plans and participants'"
"756","accounts would be made."
"757","          The MDL Court formally approved the settlements on October 25, 2010."
"758","There was a brief period to appeal the MDL Court's approval; however, no appeal"

"821","     On December 1, 2009, the Board of Trustees of AIM Tax-Exempt Funds (Invesco"
"822","Tax-Exempt Funds) (formerly known as AIM Tax-Exempt Funds) (ATEF) approved an"
"823","Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the Agreement). On May 11, 2010, at a"

"825","Fund), shareholders approved the Agreement that provided for the combination"
"826","of the Fund with Invesco Van Kampen High Yield Municipal Fund, (the Acquiring
Fund), an investment portfolio of ATEF (the Reorganization). Pursuant to the"
"827","Agreement, on June 1, 2010, all of the assets of the Fund were transferred to"
"828","the Acquiring Fund. The Acquiring Fund assumed all of the liabilities of the"
"829","Fund, and ATEF issued Class A shares of the Acquiring Fund to the Fund's Class A"

"831","shareholders, Class C shares of Acquiring Fund to the Fund's Class C"
"832","shareholders and Class Y shares of the Acquiring Fund to the Fund's Class I"

"4887","     1.1. It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Reorganization"
"4888","described herein shall be conducted separately of the others, and a party that"
"4889","is not a party to a Reorganization shall incur no obligations, duties or"
"4890","liabilities with respect to such Reorganization by reason of being a party to"
"4891","this Agreement. If any one or more Reorganizations should fail to be"
"4892","consummated, such failure shall not affect the other Reorganizations in any way."
"4893","<PAGE>"
"4894","     1.2. Provided that all conditions precedent to a Reorganization set forth"
"4895","herein have been satisfied as of the Closing Date (defined in Section 3.1), and"
"4896","based on the representations and warranties each party provides to the others,"
"4897","each Target Entity and its corresponding Acquiring Entity agree to take the"
"4898","following steps with respect to their Reorganization(s), the parties to which"
"4899","and classes of shares to be issued in connection with which are set forth in"
"4900","Exhibit A:"
"4901","          (a) The Target Fund shall transfer all of its Assets, as defined and"
"4902","     set forth in Section 1.2(b), to the Acquiring Fund, and the Acquiring Fund"
"4903","     in exchange therefor shall assume the Liabilities, as defined and set forth"
"4904","     in Section 1.2(c), and deliver to the Target Fund the number of full and"
"4905","     fractional Acquiring Fund shares determined in the manner set forth in"
"4906","     Section 2."
"4907","          (b) The assets of the Target Fund to be transferred to the Acquiring"
"4908","     Fund shall consist of all assets and property, including, without"
"4909","     limitation, all cash, securities, commodities and futures interests, claims"
"4910","     (whether absolute or contingent, known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued and"
"4911","     including, without limitation, any interest in pending or future legal"
"4912","     claims in connection with past or present portfolio holdings, whether in"
"4913","     the form of class action claims, opt-out or other direct litigation claims,"
"4914","     or regulator or government-established investor recovery fund claims, and"
"4915","     any and all resulting recoveries) and dividends or interest receivable that"
"4916","     are owned by the Target Fund and any deferred or prepaid expenses shown as"
"4917","     an asset on the books of the Target Fund on the Closing Date, except for"
"4918","     cash, bank deposits or cash equivalent securities in an amount necessary to"
"4919","     pay the estimated costs of extinguishing any Excluded Liabilities (as"
"4920","     defined in Section 1.2(c)) and cash in an amount necessary to pay any"
"4921","     distributions pursuant to Section 7.1(g) (collectively, Assets)."
"4922","          (c) The Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the liabilities of the"
"4923","     Target Fund, whether accrued or contingent, known or unknown, existing at"
"4924","     the Closing Date, except for the Target Fund's Excluded Liabilities (as"
"4925","     defined below), if any, pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, with"
"4926","     respect to each Target Fund separately, Liabilities). Each Target Fund"
"4927","     will use its best efforts to discharge all known Liabilities prior to or at"
"4928","     the Valuation Date (as defined in Section 2.1(a)) to the extent possible"
"4929","     and consistent with its own investment objectives and policies and normal"
"4930","     business operations. If prior to the Closing Date the Acquiring Entity"
"4931","     identifies a liability that the Acquiring Entity and the Target Entity"
"4932","     mutually agree should not be assumed by the Acquiring Fund, such liability"
"4933","     shall be excluded from the definition of Liabilities hereunder and shall be"
"4934","     listed on a Schedule of Excluded Liabilities to be signed by the Acquiring"
"4935","     Entity and the Target Entity at Closing and attached to this Agreement as"
"4936","     Schedule 1.2(c) (the Excluded Liabilities). The Assets minus the"
"4937","     Liabilities of a Target Fund shall be referred to herein as the Target"
"4938","     Fund's Net Assets."
"4939","          (d) As soon as is reasonably practicable after the Closing, the Target"
"4940","     Fund will distribute to its shareholders of record (Target Fund
     Shareholders) the shares of the Acquiring Fund of the corresponding class"
"4941","     received by the Target Fund pursuant to Section 1.2(a), as set forth in"
"4942","     Exhibit A, on a pro rata basis within that class, and without"
"4943","                                      -2-"
"4944","<PAGE>"
"4945","     further notice the outstanding shares of the Target Fund will be redeemed"
"4946","     and cancelled as permitted by its charter and applicable law, and the"
"4947","     Target Fund will as promptly as practicable completely liquidate and"
"4948","     dissolve. Such distribution and liquidation will be accomplished, with"
"4949","     respect to each class of the Target Fund's shares, by the transfer of the"
"4950","     Acquiring Fund shares of the corresponding class then credited to the"
"4951","     account of the Target Fund on the books of the Acquiring Fund to open"
"4952","     accounts on the share records of the Acquiring Fund in the names of the"
"4953","     Target Fund Shareholders of the class. The aggregate net asset value of the"
"4954","     Acquiring Fund shares to be so credited to the corresponding Target Fund"
"4955","     Shareholders shall be equal to the aggregate net asset value of the"
"4956","     corresponding Target Fund's shares owned by the Target Fund Shareholders on"
"4957","     the Valuation Date. The Acquiring Fund shall not issue certificates"
"4958","     representing shares in connection with such exchange."
"4959","          (e) Ownership of Acquiring Fund shares will be shown on its books, as"
"4960","     such are maintained by the Acquiring Fund's transfer agent."
"4961","2.   VALUATION"
"4962","     2.1. With respect to each Reorganization:"
"4963","          (a) The value of the Target Fund's Assets shall be the value of such"
"4964","     Assets computed as of immediately after the close of regular trading on the"
"4965","     New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which shall reflect the declaration of"
"4966","     any dividends, on the business day next preceding the Closing Date (the"
"4967","     Valuation Date), using the Target Fund's valuation procedures established"
"4968","     by the Target Entity's Board of Trustees, which shall be provided to the"
"4969","     Acquiring Fund prior to the Valuation Date."
"4970","          (b) The net asset value per share of each class of the Acquiring Fund"
"4971","     shares issued in connection with the Reorganization shall be the net asset"
"4972","     value per share of the corresponding class of the Target Fund as of the"
"4973","     close of business on the Valuation Date, provided that, if more than one"
"4974","     class of shares of the Target Fund is being exchanged for a single class of"
"4975","     shares of the Acquiring Fund, then the net asset value per share of such"
"4976","     class of shares of the Acquiring Fund issued in connection with the"
"4977","     Reorganization shall be the net asset value per share of the corresponding"
"4978","     class of the Target Fund having attributes most consistent with the"
"4979","     Acquiring Fund share class, as determined by the Acquiring Fund (the"
"4980","     Primary Share Class), or the net asset value of such other class of"
"4981","     shares of the Target Fund as the parties may mutually agree."
"4982","          (c) The number of shares issued of each class of the Acquiring Fund"
"4983","     (including fractional shares, if any, rounded to the nearest thousandth) in"
"4984","     exchange for the Target Fund's Net Assets shall equal the number of shares"
"4985","     of the corresponding class of the Target Fund outstanding as of the"
"4986","     Valuation Time, provided that if two or more classes of shares of the"
"4987","     Target Fund are exchanged for a single class of shares of the Acquiring"
"4988","     Fund, then the number of Acquiring Fund shares issued with respect to each"
"4989","     such Target Fund class, other than the Primary Share Class, shall equal the"
"4990","     quotient of the"
"4991","                                      -3-"
"4992","<PAGE>"
"4993","     net asset value of such class divided by the net asset value per share of"
"4994","     the Primary Share Class, all as of the Valuation Time."
"4995","          (d) All computations of value shall be made by the Target Fund's"
"4996","     designated recordkeeping agent using the valuation procedures described in"
"4997","     this Section 2 and shall be subject to review by the Acquiring Fund's"
"4998","     recordkeeping agent and, if requested by either the Target Entity or the"
"4999","     Acquiring Entity, by the independent registered public accountant of the"
"5000","     requesting party."
"5001","3.   CLOSING AND CLOSING DATE"
"5002","     3.1. Each Reorganization shall close on June 1, 2010 or such other date as"
"5003","the parties may agree with respect to any or all Reorganizations (the Closing
Date). All acts taking place at the closing of a Reorganization (Closing)"
"5004","shall be deemed to take place simultaneously as of immediately prior to the"
"5005","opening of regular trading on the NYSE on the Closing Date of that"
"5006","Reorganization unless otherwise agreed to by the parties (the Closing Time)."
"5007","The Closing of each Reorganization shall be held in person, by facsimile, email"

"5023","     Custodian by wire transfer of federal funds or other appropriate means on"
"5024","     the Closing Date. If the Target Fund is unable to make such delivery on the"
"5025","     Closing Date in the manner contemplated by this Section for the reason that"
"5026","     any of such securities or other investments purchased prior to the Closing"
"5027","     Date have not yet been delivered to the Target Fund or its broker, then the"
"5028","     Acquiring Fund may, in its sole discretion, waive the delivery requirements"
"5029","     of this Section with respect to said undelivered securities or other"
"5030","     investments if the Target Fund has, by or on the Closing Date, delivered to"
"5031","     the Acquiring Fund or its Custodian executed copies of an agreement of"
"5032","     assignment and escrow and due bills executed on behalf of said broker or"
"5033","     brokers, together with such other documents as may be required by the"
"5034","     Acquiring Fund or its Custodian, such as brokers' confirmation slips."
"5035","          (b) The Target Entity shall direct the Target Custodian for each"
"5036","     Target Fund to deliver, at the Closing, a certificate of an authorized"
"5037","     officer stating that (i) except as"

"5045","          (c) At such time prior to the Closing Date as the parties mutually"
"5046","     agree, the Target Fund shall provide (i) instructions and related"
"5047","     information to the Acquiring Fund or its transfer agent with respect to the"
"5048","     Target Fund Shareholders, including names, addresses, dividend reinvestment"

"5057","     obligation to inquire as to the validity, propriety or correctness of any"
"5058","     such instruction, information or documentation, but shall, in each case,"

"5060","     proper, correct and complete."
"5061","          (d) The Target Entity shall direct each applicable transfer agent for"
