"659","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"660","Firm"
"661","To the Board of Trustees of Vanguard Ohio Tax-Free Funds and"
"662","the Shareholders of"
"663","Vanguard Ohio Long-Term Tax-Exempt Fund and"
"664","Vanguard Ohio Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund"
"665","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"666","statements of Vanguard Ohio Long-Term Tax-Exempt Fund and"
"667","Vanguard Ohio Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund (constituting"
"668","Vanguard Ohio Tax-Free Funds, hereafter referred to as the"
"669","?Trust?) as of and for the year ended November 30, 2016, in"
"670","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"671","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"672","Trust?s internal control over financial reporting, including"
"673","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"674","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"675","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"676","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"677","the effectiveness of the Trust?s internal control over financial"
"678","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"679","effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial"
"680","reporting."
"681","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"682","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"683","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"684","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"685","related costs of controls.  A company?s internal control over"
"686","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"687","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"688","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"689","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"690","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"691","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"692","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"693","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"694","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"695","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"696","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"697","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"698","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"699","trustees of the company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance"
"700","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"701","acquisition, use or disposition of a company?s assets that could"
"702","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"703","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"704","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"705","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"706","are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"707","because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"708","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"709","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"710","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"711","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"712","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"713","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"714","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"715","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"716","material misstatement of the Trust's annual or interim financial"

"745","Vanguard Ohio Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund"
"746","Supplement to the Prospectus and Summary Prospectus"
"747","Dated March 29, 2016"
"748","Important Announcement"
"749","The board of trustees of Vanguard Ohio Tax-Free Funds has approved the"
"750","renaming of Vanguard Ohio Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund to Vanguard Ohio"
"751","Municipal Money Market Fund. This name change is expected to occur in"
"752","the first quarter of 2017. The investment objective and limitations of"
"753","the Fund will remain the same, including the 20% limitation on investments"
"754","in securities that are subject to the alternative minimum tax."
"755","The following changes are effective on October 14, 2016, as a"
"756","result of rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange"
"757","Commission (SEC) in July 2014 and September 2015."
"758","Prospectus and Summary Prospectus Text Changes for Vanguard"
"759","Ohio Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund"
"760","The paragraph under Principal Investment Policies is replaced with the"
"761","following:"
"762","Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in a"
"763","variety of high-quality, short-term Ohio municipal securities whose income is"
"764","exempt from federal and Ohio state taxes. To be considered high quality, a"
"765","security must be determined by Vanguard to present minimal credit risk based"
"766","in part on a consideration of maturity, portfolio diversification, portfolio"
"767","liquidity, and credit quality. The Fund invests in securities with effective"
"768","maturities of 397 days or less, maintains a dollar-weighted average maturity"
"769","of 60 days or less, and maintains a dollar-weighted average life of 120 days"
"770","or less."
"771","The last paragraph under Principal Risks is replaced with the following:"
"772","You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to"
"773","preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee"
"774","it will do so. The Fund may impose a fee upon sale of your shares or may"
"775","temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls"
"776","below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An"
"777","investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit"
"778","Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has"
"779","no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should"
"780","not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any"
"781","time."
"782","The following is added to the paragraph under Purchase and Sale of Fund
Shares:"
"783","The Fund is only available for purchase within accounts beneficially owned by"
"784","natural persons."
"785","Prospectus Text Changes"
"786","In the Investing in Money Market Funds section, the following replaces the"
"787","last paragraph under What is Money Market Reform:"
"788","The board of trustees of Vanguard Ohio Tax-Free Funds (the Board), in"
"789","accordance with the best interest of the shareholders, approved a number of"
"790","changes in response to the SEC?s 2014 amendments to the rules governing"
"791","money market funds. The changes-including the Board's ability to implement"
"792","liquidity fees and redemption gates if Vanguard Ohio Tax-Exempt Money Market"
"793","Fund's weekly liquid assets fall below established thresholds-are now in"
"794","effect. As part of these changes, information regarding the Fund's weekly"
"795","liquid assets for the prior six months (by day, as of the close of business)"
"796","is available on the Fund's Portfolio page at vanguard.com."
"797","In the Investing in Money Market Funds section, the following is added after"
"798","the last paragraph under How Does This Affect Vanguard Money Market
Funds Vanguard Ohio Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund:"
"799","If you redeem shares when the Fund has imposed a liquidity fee, then the"
"800","amount you receive for your redemption will be reduced by the amount of the"
"801","liquidity fee and will generally cause you to recognize a loss for tax"
"802","purposes equal to the amount of that fee. Once the Fund imposes a redemption"
"803","gate, then unprocessed orders to redeem will be canceled and the Fund will"
"804","not accept redemption orders until the gate is no longer in effect. If you"
"805","still wish to redeem once the gate is lifted, you will need to submit a new"
"806","redemption request to the Fund or your financial intermediary."
"807","Notices regarding liquidity fees or redemption gates will be filed with the"
"808","SEC on Form N-CR. In addition, announcements will also be made in supplements"
"809","to the Fund?s prospectus and on the Fund?s website."
"810","In the More on the Funds section under the heading Security Selection, the"
"811","Plain Talk About Credit Quality paragraph is replaced with the following:"
"812","A bond's credit-quality rating is an assessment of the issuer's ability to"
"813","pay interest on the bond and, ultimately, to repay the principal. The lower"
"814","the credit quality, the greater the chance in Vanguard's opinion that the"
"815","bond issuer will default, or fail to meet its payment obligations. All things"
"816","being equal, the lower a bond's credit quality, the higher its yield should"
"817","be to compensate investors for assuming additional risk."
"818","In the More on the Funds section under the heading Frequent Trading or
Market-Timing, the following replaces similar text:"
"819","Each Vanguard fund (other than retail and government money market funds), in"
"820","determining its net asset value, will use fair-value pricing when appropriate,"
"821","as described in the Share Price section. Fair-value pricing may reduce or"
"822","eliminate the profitability of certain frequent-trading strategies."
"823","In the More on the Funds section under the heading Share Price,' the
following replaces the second and fifth paragraphs:

Debt securities held by a Vanguard fund are valued based on information
furnished by an independent pricing service or market quotations. Certain
shortterm debt instruments used to manage a fund?s cash may be valued at
amortized cost when it approximates fair value; the instruments held by a
retail or government money market fund are valued on the basis of amortized
cost. The values of any mutual fund shares held by a fund are based on the
NAVs of the shares. The values of any ETF shares, institutional money market
fund shares, or closed-end fund shares held by a fund are based on the market
value of the shares.

Although the stable share price is not guaranteed, the NAV of Vanguard retail
and government money market funds is expected to remain at $1 per share.
Instruments are purchased and managed with that goal in mind.

In the Investing With Vanguard section under the heading Purchasing"
"824","Shares, the following replaces similar text under Earning Dividends:

You generally begin earning dividends on the business day following your trade
date. When buying money market fund shares through a federal funds wire on a
business day, however, you generally can begin earning dividends immediately
by making a purchase request by telephone to Vanguard before 10:45 a.m.,
Eastern time (2 p.m., Eastern time, for Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund;
12:30 p.m., Eastern time, for Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund).

In the Investing With Vanguard section under the heading Redeeming"
"825","Shares, the following replaces similar text under Trade Date:

- Note on timing of wire redemptions from money market funds: For telephone
requests received by Vanguard on a business day before 10:45 a.m., Eastern
time (2 p.m., Eastern time, for Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund; 12:30 p.m.,
Eastern time, for Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund), the redemption
proceeds generally will leave Vanguard by the close of business the same day.
For telephone requests received by Vanguard on a business day after those
cut-off times, or on a nonbusiness day, and for all requests other than by
telephone, the redemption proceeds generally will leave Vanguard by the close
of business on the next business day.

In the Investing With Vanguard section under the heading 'Redeeming
Shares, the following replaces similar text under Earning Dividends:"
"826","You generally will continue earning dividends until the first business day"
"827","following your trade date. Generally, there are two exceptions to this rule:"
"828","(1) If you redeem shares by writing a check against your account, the shares"
"829","will stop earning dividends on the day that your check posts to your account;"
"830","and (2) For money market funds, if you redeem shares with a same-day wire"
"831","request before 10:45 a.m., Eastern time, on a business day (2 p.m., Eastern"
"832","time, for Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund; 12:30 p.m., Eastern time, for"
"833","Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund), the shares will stop earning dividends"
"834","that same day."
"835","In the Investing With Vanguard section under the heading Other Redemption
Rules You Should Know, the following replaces similar text:"
"836","Emergency circumstances. Vanguard funds can postpone payment of"
"837","redemption proceeds for up to seven calendar days. In addition, Vanguard"
"838","funds can suspend redemptions and/or postpone payments of redemption"
"839","proceeds beyond seven calendar days at times when the NYSE is closed or"
"840","during emergency circumstances, as determined by the SEC. In connection"
"841","with a determination by the board of trustees, in accordance with Rule 22e-3"
"842","under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a money market fund may suspend"
"843","redemptions and postpone payment of redemption proceeds in order to"
"844","facilitate an orderly liquidation of the fund. In addition, in accordance"
"845","with Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the board of"
"846","trustees of a retail or institutional money market fund may implement"
"847","liquidity fees and redemption gates if a retail or institutional money market"
"848","fund's weekly liquid assets fall below established thresholds."
"849","In the Investing With Vanguard section under the heading Investing With
Vanguard Through Other Firms, the following is added to the end of the"
"850","paragraph:"
"851","Your financial intermediary will be responsible for taking reasonable"
"852","actions to assist the retail or institutional money market fund to impose,"
"853","lift, or modify liquidity fees or redemption gates."
