"3135","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of The Real Estate Investment Trust Portfolio, The Large-Cap Value Equity Portfolio, The Select 20 Portfolio, The Large-Cap Growth Equity Portfolio, The Focus Smid-Cap Growth Equity Portfolio, The High-Yield Bond Portfolio, The Core Plus Fixed Income Portfolio, The International Equity Portfolio, The Labor Select International Equity Portfolio, The Emerging Markets Portfolio and The Emerging Markets Portfolio II (constituting Delaware Pooled Trust, hereafter referred to as the Trust) as of and for the year ended October 31, 2015, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust?s internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust?s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"3136","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company?s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company?s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3137","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3138","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Trust's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3139","Our consideration of the Trust?s internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trust?s internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of October 31, 2015."
"3140","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the Board of Trustees of Delaware Pooled Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"3447","place  within  or  outside  the  State  of  Delaware  designated by the Board of"
"3448","Trustees.  In  the  absence  of  any  such designation by the Board of Trustees,"
"3449","shareholders'  meetings  shall  be held at the principal executive office of the"
"3450","Trust.  For  purposes of these Amended and Restated By-Laws (the By-Laws), the"
"3451","term  shareholder  shall  mean  a  record  owner  of  shares  of  the  Trust."
"3452","     Section  2. CALL OF MEETING. A meeting of the shareholders may be called at"
"3453","any  time  by the Board of Trustees, the Chairperson (as defined under Section 3"
"3454","of  Article  III  herein)  or  by  the  President (as defined under Section 1 of"

"3477","telegraphic,  facsimile,  electronic  mail or other written communication to the"
"3478","Trust's  principal  executive  office.  Notice"

"3481","deposited in the mail, with a courier or sent by telegram, facsimile, electronic"
"3482","mail  or  other  means  of  written  communication."
"3483","     If any notice addressed to a shareholder at the address of that shareholder"
"3484","appearing  on the books of the Trust is returned to the Trust marked to indicate"
"3485","that  the  notice  to  the  shareholder cannot be delivered at that address, all"
"3486","future  notices  or  reports  shall  be  deemed  to have been duly given without"

"3488","available  to  the  shareholder  on  written  demand  of  the shareholder at the"

"3494","maintained in the records of the Trust.  Such affidavit shall, in the absence of"
"3495","fraud,  be  prima  facie  evidence  of  the  facts  stated  therein."
"3496","     Section 5. ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE. Any shareholders' meeting, whether or"
"3497","not  a  quorum  is  present, may be adjourned from time to time (and at any time"
"3498","during  the  course  of  the  meeting)  by a majority of the votes cast by those"
"3499","shareholders  present  in  person  or  by  proxy,  or  by the chairperson of the"
"3500","meeting.  Any  adjournment may be with respect to one or more proposals, but not"
"3501","necessarily  all  proposals,  to  be voted or acted upon at such meeting and any"
"3502","adjournment will not delay or otherwise affect the effectiveness and validity of"
"3503","a  vote  or  other action taken at a shareholders' meeting prior to adjournment."
"3504","     When  any  shareholders'  meeting  is  adjourned  to another time or place,"
"3505","notice  need  not  be given of the adjourned meeting at which the adjournment is"
"3506","taken,  unless a new record date of the adjourned meeting is fixed or unless the"
"3507","adjournment  is for more than one hundred eighty (180) days from the record date"
"3508","set  for  the  original meeting, in which case the Board of Trustees shall set a"
"3509","new record date. If notice of any such adjourned meeting is required pursuant to"
"3510","the preceding sentence, it shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled"
"3511","to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance with the provisions of Sections 3"
"3512","and  4  of  this  Article.  At any adjourned meeting, the Trust may transact any"
"3513","business  that  might  have  been  transacted  at  the  original  meeting."
"3514","     Section  6.  VOTING.  The  shareholders  entitled to vote at any meeting of"
"3515","shareholders  shall  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the provisions of the"
"3516","Declaration  of  Trust, as in effect at such time. The shareholders' vote may be"
"3517","by  voice  vote  or by ballot; provided, however, that any election for trustees"
"3518","must  be  by  ballot if demanded by any shareholder before the voting has begun."
"3519","     Abstentions  and  broker  non-votes  will  be  included  for  purposes  of"
"3520","determining whether a quorum is present at a shareholders' meeting.  Abstentions"
"3521","and  broker  non-votes  will  be  treated  as  votes  present at a shareholders'"
"3522","meeting,  but  will  not  be  treated  as  votes  cast.  Abstentions  and broker"
"3523","non-votes, therefore, will have no effect on proposals which require a plurality"
"3524","or  majority of votes cast for approval, but will have the same effect as a vote"
"3525","against on proposals requiring a majority of outstanding voting securities for"
"3526","approval."
"3527","     Unless  otherwise  determined  by  the  Board  of  Trustees  at the time it"
"3528","approves an action to be submitted to the shareholders for approval, shareholder"
"3529","approval  of  an  action  shall remain in effect until such time as the approved"
"3530","action is implemented or the shareholders vote to the contrary.  Notwithstanding"
"3531","the  foregoing,  an  agreement  of  merger or consolidation may be terminated or"
"3532","amended  notwithstanding  prior  approval  if so authorized by such agreement of"
"3533","merger or consolidation pursuant to Section 3815 of the Delaware Statutory Trust"
"3534","Act  (DSTA)."
"3535","<PAGE>"
"3536","     Section   7.  WRITTEN  ACTION.  Any action that might be taken at a meeting"
"3537","of  the  shareholders  may  be  taken  without  a meeting in accordance with the"
"3538","provisions  of the Trust's Agreement and Declaration of Trust, as may be amended"
"3539","from  time  to  time."
"3540","     Section  8.  WAIVER  OF  NOTICE  BY  CONSENT  OF  ABSENT SHAREHOLDERS.  The"
"3541","transactions  of  a  meeting  of  shareholders,  however  called and noticed and"
"3542","wherever  held, shall be valid as though transacted at a meeting duly held after"
"3543","regular  call  and  notice  if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy."
"3544","Attendance  by  a  person  at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice"
"3545","with  respect  to that person of that meeting, except when the person objects at"
"3546","the  beginning  of  the  meeting  to the transaction of any business because the"
"3547","meeting  is  not  lawfully called or convened and except that such attendance is"
"3548","not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters not included"
"3549","in  the  notice  of  the  meeting  if  that  objection  is expressly made at the"
"3550","beginning  of the meeting.  Whenever notice of a meeting is required to be given"
"3551","to  a  shareholder  under  the  Declaration of Trust or these By-Laws, a written"
"3552","waiver  thereof, executed before or after the meeting by such shareholder or his"
"3553","or  her attorney thereunto authorized and filed with the records of the meeting,"
"3554","shall  be  deemed  equivalent  to  such  notice."
"3555","     Section  9.  PROXIES. Every shareholder entitled to vote for trustees or on"
"3556","any  other  matter  shall  have the right to do so either in person or by one or"
"3557","more  agents  authorized  by a written proxy signed by the shareholder and filed"
"3558","with  the  secretary  of  the  Trust.  A  proxy  shall  be  deemed signed if the"
"3559","shareholder's  name  is  placed  on  the  proxy  (whether  by  manual signature,"
"3560","typewriting,  telegraphic transmission, electronic transmission or otherwise) by"
"3561","the  shareholder or the shareholder's attorney-in-fact. A validly executed proxy"
"3562","which  does  not  state  that it is irrevocable shall continue in full force and"
"3563","effect  unless  (i)  revoked by the shareholder executing it by a written notice"
"3564","delivered  to  the  Trust  prior  to  the  exercise  of  the  proxy  or  by  the"
"3565","shareholder's  execution  of a subsequent proxy or attendance and vote in person"
"3566","at  the  meeting;  or  (ii)  written  notice  of  the death or incapacity of the"
"3567","shareholder  is  received  by  the  Trust  before  the  proxy's vote is counted;"
"3568","provided,  however,  that no proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven"
"3569","(11)  months  from the date of the proxy unless otherwise provided in the proxy."
"3570","     A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a shareholder shall be"
"3571","deemed  valid  unless  challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of"
"3572","proving  invalidity  shall  rest on the challenger. Subject to the provisions of"
"3573","the  Delaware  Statutory  Trust Act, the Declaration of Trust, or these By-Laws,"
"3574","the  General  Corporation  Law of the State of Delaware relating to proxies, and"
"3575","judicial  interpretations  thereunder,  shall  govern all matters concerning the"
"3576","giving,  voting  or  validity  of  proxies,  as  if  the  Trust  were a Delaware"
"3577","corporation  and  the  shareholders were stockholders of a Delaware corporation."
"3578","Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  herein  to  the contrary, in the event a"
"3579","proposal by anyone other than the officers or Trustees of the Trust is submitted"
"3580","to a vote of the shareholders of one or more Series or classes thereof or of the"
"3581","Trust, or in the event of any proxy contest or proxy solicitation or proposal in"
"3582","opposition  to any proposal by the officers or Trustees of the Trust, Shares may"
"3583","be  voted  only  in  person  or  by  written  proxy  at  a  meeting."
"3584","     With  respect to any shareholders' meeting, the Trust may accept proxies by"
"3585","electronic  transmission  (as  defined in the DSTA) or telephonic, computerized,"
"3586","telecommunications  or  any  other  reasonable alternative to the execution of a"
"3587","written  instrument  authorizing  the  proxy  to act, provided the shareholder's"
"3588","authorization  is received within eleven (11) months before the meeting. A proxy"
"3589","with respect to shares held in the name of two or more Persons shall be valid if"
"3590","executed  by  any  one  of  them unless at or prior to exercise of the proxy the"
"3591","Trust receives a specific written notice to the contrary from any one of them. A"
"3592","proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a shareholder shall be deemed"
"3593","valid  unless  challenged  at or prior to its exercise and the burden of proving"
"3594","invalidity  shall  rest  with  the  challenger."
"3595","<PAGE>"
"3596","     Section 10. INSPECTORS OF ELECTION. Before any meeting of shareholders, the"
"3597","Board  of  Trustees  or  the  appropriate  officers of the Trust may appoint any"
"3598","person  other  than  nominees  for office to act as inspector of election at the"
"3599","meeting  or  its  adjournment.  If no inspector of election is so appointed, the"
"3600","chairperson  of  the  meeting  may,  and  on the request of any shareholder or a"
"3601","shareholder's  proxy shall, appoint an inspector of election at the meeting.  If"
"3602","any  person  appointed  as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act,"
"3603","the  chairperson  of the meeting may, and on the request of any shareholder or a"
"3604","shareholder's  proxy  shall,  appoint  a  person  to  fill  the  vacancy."
"3605","     The  inspector  shall:"
"3606","     (a)     determine  the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of"
"3607","each,  the  shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum and the"
"3608","authenticity,  validity  and  effect  of  proxies;"
"3609","     (b)     receive  votes,  ballots  or  consents;"
"3610","     (c)     hear  and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising"
"3611","in  connection  with  the  right  to  vote;"
"3612","     (d)     count  and  tabulate  all  votes  or  consents;"
"3613","     (e)     determine  when  the  polls  shall  close;"
"3614","     (f)     determine  the  result;  and"
"3615","     (g)     do  any  other  acts  that may be proper to conduct the election or"
"3616","vote  with  fairness  to  all  shareholders."
"3617","                                  ARTICLE III"
"3618","                                    TRUSTEES"
"3619","     Section  1. POWERS. Subject to the applicable provisions of the Declaration"
"3620","of  Trust  and  these By-Laws relating to action requiring shareholder approval,"
"3621","the  business  and affairs of the Trust shall be managed and all powers shall be"
"3622","exercised  by  or  under  the  direction  of  the  Board  of  Trustees."
"3623","     Section  2.  NUMBER  OF  TRUSTEES.  The number of trustees constituting the"
"3624","Board  of Trustees shall be determined as set forth in the Declaration of Trust."
"3625","     Section  3.  CHAIRPERSON. The Board of Trustees may elect a chairperson for"
"3626","the  purpose  of  presiding  at  meetings  of  the  Board  of  Trustees  (the"
"3627","Chairperson).  The  Chairperson  shall  exercise and perform such other powers"
"3628","and  duties as may be from time to time assigned to the Chairperson by the Board"
"3629","of  Trustees  or prescribed by the By-Laws.  The Chairperson may delegate his or"
"3630","her  powers  and  duties to the trustees or officers of the Trust that he or she"
"3631","deems  appropriate,  provided that such delegation is consistent with applicable"
"3632","legal  and  regulatory  requirements."
"3633","     Section 4. VACANCIES. Vacancies in the Board of Trustees may be filled by a"
"3634","majority  of  the  remaining  trustees,  though less than a quorum, or by a sole"
"3635","remaining  trustee, unless the Board of Trustees calls a meeting of shareholders"
"3636","for  the purpose of filling such vacancies.  Notwithstanding the above, whenever"
"3637","and  for  so  long as the Trust is a participant in or otherwise has in effect a"
"3638","plan  under  which  the Trust may be deemed to bear expenses of distributing its"
"3639","shares  as that practice is described in Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, then the"
"3640","selection and nomination of the trustees who are not interested persons of the"
"3641","<PAGE>"
"3642","Trust,  as  that  term  is  defined in the 1940 Act (the Independent Trustees)"
"3643","shall  be,  and  is,  committed  to  the discretion of the Independent Trustees."
"3644","     In  the event that all trustee offices become vacant, an authorized officer"
"3645","of  Delaware Management Company, a series of Delaware Management Business Trust,"
"3646","or  any  successor  entity  thereto  or  affiliate thereof serving as investment"
"3647","adviser  to  the Trust (DMC), on behalf DMC, shall serve as the sole remaining"
"3648","trustee  effective  upon the vacancy in the office of the last trustee.  In such"
"3649","case,  such  officer  of  DMC,  as the sole remaining trustee, shall, as soon as"
"3650","practicable,  fill  all  of  the  vacancies  on the Board of Trustees; provided,"
"3651","however,  that,  upon filling such vacancies, the percentage of trustees who are"
"3652","Independent  Trustees  of  the  Trust shall be no less than that required by the"
"3653","1940  Act.  Thereupon, such officer of DMC shall resign as trustee and a meeting"
"3654","of  the  shareholders  shall  be  called,  as  required by the 1940 Act, for the"
"3655","election  of  trustees."
"3656","     Whenever  a  vacancy  in  the  Board  of Trustees shall occur (by reason of"
"3657","death, resignation, removal, an increase in the authorized number of trustees or"
"3658","other  cause),  until such vacancy is filled as provided herein or the number of"
"3659","authorized  trustees constituting the Board of Trustees is decreased pursuant to"
"3660","Article  IV,  Section  1  of  the  Declaration  of Trust, the trustee(s) then in"
"3661","office,  regardless of the number and even if less than a quorum, shall have all"
"3662","the  powers  granted to the Board of Trustees and shall discharge all the duties"
"3663","imposed upon the Board of Trustees by the Declaration of Trust and these By-Laws"
"3664","as  though  such  number  constitutes  the  entire  Board  of  Trustees."
"3665","     Section 5. PLACE OF MEETINGS AND MEETINGS BY TELEPHONE. All meetings of the"
"3666","Board  of  Trustees  may  be  held  at  any place within or outside the State of"
"3667","Delaware  that  has been designated from time to time by resolution of the Board"
"3668","of  Trustees.  In  the  absence of such a designation, regular meetings shall be"
