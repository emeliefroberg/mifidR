"3197","Item 77D - 	Deutsche GNMA Fund (a series of"
"3198","Deutsche Income Trust) (the Fund)

Effective May 22, 2017, the Fund's principal investment
strategy was amended to include the following:

Derivatives. Portfolio management generally may use
interest rate futures contracts or interest rate swaps,
which are types of derivatives (a contract whose value is
based on, for example, indices, currencies or securities)
for duration management (i.e., reducing or increasing the
sensitivity of the fund's portfolio to interest rate
changes). Portfolio management may, from time to time,
seek to enhance returns by employing various strategies
to identify interest rate trends across developed markets
using derivatives, including interest rate futures
contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign currency
transactions. In addition, portfolio management
generally may use (i) options on GNMA TBAs or total
return swaps to seek to enhance potential gains; and (ii)
options on interest rate futures or on interest rates to
hedge against potential adverse interest rate movements.

The fund may also use other types of derivatives (i) for
hedging purposes; (ii) for risk management; (iii) for non-
hedging purposes to seek to enhance potential gains; or
(iv) as a substitute for direct investment in a particular
asset class or to keep cash on hand to meet shareholder
redemptions.

Effective May 22, 2017, the Fund's principal investment
strategy was amended further to include the following:

For the purpose of complying with the 80% test, the
fund does not use the notional value of a derivative
instrument, but rather, uses the mark-to-market value
(i.e., the unrealized net gain or loss on an open derivative
instrument) of the derivative instrument. The mark-to-"
"3199","market value of a derivative instrument will not be
treated as an investment in Ginnie Maes. By
calculating the 80% test on the basis of mark-to-"
"3200","market value, rather than the notional value of
derivative instruments, the fund may invest a greater
percentage of its assets in such derivative instruments
than would otherwise be the case.

Although the fund's aggregate notional market exposure
from derivatives may equal up to 100% of the fund's
assets, the fund normally limits the net notional value of
all derivatives instruments, after aggregating the fund's
long and short positions, to 20% of the fund's net assets.
In addition, the net mark-to-market value of all open
interest rate strategy related derivatives instruments, plus
any required initial margin payments, is normally
expected to be less than 5% of the fund's net assets.

Item 77M - 	Deutsche GNMA Fund (a series of
Deutsche Income Trust) (the
Fund)
The Board of Trustees of Deutsche Strategic
Government Securities Fund (Acquired Fund)
approved a proposal by Deutsche Investment
Management Americas Inc., the advisor of the
Acquired Fund, to effect the merger of the Acquired
Fund into Deutsche GNMA Fund (Acquiring Fund),
on or about May 22, 2017 (Merger Date).

The merger is expected to be a tax-free
reorganization for federal income tax purposes. On
the Merger Date, any investment in the Acquired
Fund was exchanged for an investment with an
equal aggregate net asset value in the Acquiring
Fund. Therefore, as a result of the merger,
shareholders of the Acquired Fund became
shareholders of the Acquiring Fund.
