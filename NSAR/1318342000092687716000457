"498","<TEXT>"
"499","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT"
"500","REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"501","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"502","To the Shareholders and"
"503","Board of Trustees of"
"504","Investment Managers Series Trust"
"505","Milwaukee, Wisconsin  53202"
"506","In planning and performing our audit of"
"507","the financial statements of Palmer Square"
"508","Income Plus Fund (the Fund), a series of"
"509","Investment Managers Series Trust, as of"
"510","and for the period ended January 31, 2016,"
"511","in accordance with the standards of the"
"512","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"513","(United States), we considered their"
"514","internal control over financial reporting,"
"515","including control activities for"
"516","safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"517","designing our auditing procedures for the"
"518","purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"519","financial statements and to comply with the"
"520","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"521","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"522","effectiveness of the Funds internal control"
"523","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"524","express no such opinion."
"525","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"526","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"527","internal control over financial reporting."
"528","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"529","and judgments by management are required to"
"530","assess the expected benefits and related"
"531","costs of controls. A companys internal"
"532","control over financial reporting is a"
"533","process designedto provide reasonable"
"534","assurance regarding the reliability of"
"535","financial reporting and the preparation"
"536","of financial statements for external"
"537","purposes in accordance with generally"
"538","accepted accounting principles. A companys"
"539","internal control over financial reporting"
"540","includes those policies and procedures that"
"541","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"542","that,in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"543","fairly reflect the transactions and"
"544","dispositions of the assets of the company"
"545","(2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"546","transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"547","permit preparation of financial statements"
"548","in accordance with generally accepted"
"549","accounting principles, and that receipts"
"550","and expenditures of the company are being"
"551","made only in accordance with authorizations"
"552","of management and directors of the company"
"553","and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"554","regarding prevention or timely detection"
"555","of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"556","disposition of a companys assets that could"
"557","have a material effect on the financial"
"558","statements."
"559","Because of inherent limitations, internal"
"560","control over financial reporting may not"
"561","prevent or detect misstatements.   Also,"
"562","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"
"563","to future periods are subject to the risk"
"564","that controls may become inadequate because"
"565","of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"566","of compliance with the policies or procedures"
"567","may deteriorate."
"568","A deficiency in internal control over"
"569","financial reporting exists when the design"
"570","or operation of a control does not allow"
"571","management or employees, in the normal"
"572","course of performing their assigned"
"573","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"574","on a timely basis. A material weakness is"
"575","a deficiency, or combination of"
"576","deficiencies, in internal control over"
"577","financial reporting, such that there is"
"578","a reasonable possibility that a material"
"579","misstatement of the companys annual or"
"580","interim financial statements will not be"
"581","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"582","Our consideration of the Funds internal"
"583","control over financial reporting was for"
"584","the limited purpose described in the first"
"585","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"586","disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"587","control that might be material weaknesses"
"588","under standards established by the Public"
"589","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"590","(United States). However, we noted no"
"591","deficiencies in the Funds internal"
"592","control over financial reporting and"
"593","its operation, including controls for"
"594","safeguarding securities, which we consider"
"595","to be material weaknesses, as defined above,"
"596","as of January 31, 2016."
"597","This report is intended solely for the"
"598","information and use of management,"
"599","Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"600","Investment Managers Series Trust and the"
"601","Securities and Exchange Commission, and"
"602","is not intended to be and should not be"
"603","used by anyone other than these specified"
"604","parties."
