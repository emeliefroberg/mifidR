"549","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"550","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"551","Putnam High Yield Fund"
"552","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"553","of Putnam High Yield Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year"
"554","ended November 30, 2017, in accordance with the standards of the"
"555","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"556","considered the Funds internal control over financial reporting,"
"557","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"558","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"559","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"560","requirements of Form NSAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"561","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control"
"562","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such"
"563","opinion."
"564","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"565","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"566","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"567","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"568","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"569","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"570","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"571","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"572","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"573","A companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"574","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"575","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"576","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"577","assets of the company (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"578","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"579","financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"580","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"581","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"582","company and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"583","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"584","or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material"
"585","effect on the financial statements."
"586","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"587","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"588","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"589","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"590","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"591","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"592","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"593","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"594","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"595","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"596","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"597","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"598","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"599","material misstatement of a funds annual or interim financial"
"600","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"601","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"602","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"603","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"604","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"605","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"606","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"607","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"608","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"609","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"610","November 30, 2017."
"611","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"612","management and the Board of Trustees of Putnam High Yield Fund"
"613","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"614","to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"615","specified parties."

"627","11/30/2017 Annual"
"628","On May 8, 2017, the fund issued 133,323,321; 1,960,101;"

"631","102,575,817; 1,471,128; 6,066,094; 1,682,679; 1,092,362; and"
"632","31,949,627 class A, class B, class C, class M, class R and class"
"633","Y shares of Putnam High Yield Trust to acquire that funds net"
"634","assets in a tax-free exchange approved by the funds Board of"
"635","Trustees. The purpose of the transaction was to combine two"
"636","Putnam funds with substantially similar investment objectives"
"637","and investment strategies into a single Putnam fund with a"
"638","larger asset base and therefore potentially lower expenses for"
"639","fund shareholders. The investment portfolio of Putnam High Yield"
"640","Trust, with a fair value of $1,068,704,680 and an identified"
"641","cost of $1,050,423,181 at May 5, 2017, was the principal asset"
"642","acquired by the fund. The net assets of the fund and Putnam High"
"643","Yield Trust on May 5, 2017, were $584,134,939 and"
"644","$1,104,679,284, respectively. On May 5, 2017, Putnam High Yield"
"645","Trust had distributions in excess of net investment income of"
"646","$3,987,937, accumulated net realized loss of $291,058,489 and"
"647","unrealized appreciation of $18,282,179. The aggregate net assets"
"648","of the fund immediately following the acquisition were"
"649","$1,688,814,223. Assuming the acquisition had been completed on"
"650","December 1, 2016, the funds pro forma results of operations for"
"651","the reporting period are as follows (unaudited):"
"652","Net investment Income					$86,606,483"
"653","Net gain on investments					$45,852,363"
"654","Net Increase in net assets resulting from operations 	$132,458,846"
"655","Because the combined investment portfolios have been managed as"
"656","a single portfolio since the acquisition was completed, it is"
"657","not practicable to separate the amounts of revenue and earnings"
"658","of Putnam High Yield Trust that have been included in the funds"
"659","Statement of operations for the current fiscal period."
