"1031","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT"
"1032","REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"1033","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1034","To the Shareholders of Pacific"
"1035","Financial Core Equity Fund, Pacific"
"1036","Financial Explorer Fund, Pacific"

"1041","Based Moderate Fund and Board of"
"1042","Trustees of"
"1043","Northern Lights Fund Trust"
"1044","In planning and performing our audit"
"1045","of the financial statements of Pacific"
"1046","Financial Core Equity Fund, Pacific"
"1047","Financial Explorer Fund, Pacific"
"1048","Financial International Fund, Pacific"
"1049","Financial Strategic Conservative"
"1050","Fund, Pacific Financial Tactical Fund"
"1051","and Pacific Financial Faith & Values"
"1052","Based Moderate Fund (the Funds),"
"1053","each a series of the Northern Lights"
"1054","Fund Trust, as of April 30, 2014, in"
"1055","accordance with the standards of the"
"1056","Public Company Accounting"
"1057","Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1058","considered the Funds' internal"
"1059","control over financial reporting,"
"1060","including controls over safeguarding"
"1061","securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1062","auditing procedures for the purpose"
"1063","of expressing our opinion on the"
"1064","financial statements and to comply"
"1065","with the requirements of Form N-"
"1066","SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1067","expressing an opinion on the"
"1068","effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"1069","control over financial reporting."
"1070","Accordingly, we express no such"
"1071","opinion."
"1072","The management of the Funds is"
"1073","responsible for establishing and"
"1074","maintaining effective internal control"
"1075","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"1076","this responsibility, estimates and"
"1077","judgments by management are"
"1078","required to assess the expected"
"1079","benefits and related costs of controls."
"1080","A fund's internal control over"
"1081","financial reporting is a process"
"1082","designed to provide reasonable"
"1083","assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1084","financial reporting and the"
"1085","preparation of financial statements"
"1086","for external purposes in accordance"
"1087","with generally accepted accounting"
"1088","principles (GAAP).  A fund's internal"
"1089","control over financial reporting"
"1090","includes those policies and"
"1091","procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1092","maintenance of records that, in"
"1093","reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1094","fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1095","dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"1096","(2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1097","transactions are recorded as"
"1098","necessary to permit preparation of"
"1099","financial statements in accordance"
"1100","with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"1101","expenditures of the fund are being"
"1102","made only in accordance with"
"1103","authorizations of management and"
"1104","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"1105","reasonable assurance regarding"
"1106","prevention or timely detection of"
"1107","unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"1108","disposition of a fund's assets that"
"1109","could have a material effect on the"
"1110","financial statements."
"1111","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"1112","internal control over financial"
"1113","reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1114","misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"1115","any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"1116","future periods are subject to the risk"
"1117","that controls may become inadequate"
"1118","because of changes in conditions, or"
"1119","that the degree of compliance with"
"1120","the policies or procedures may"
"1121","deteriorate."
"1122","A deficiency in internal control over"
"1123","financial reporting exists when the"
"1124","design or operation of a control does"
"1125","not allow management or employees,"
"1126","in the normal course of performing"
"1127","their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1128","detect misstatements on a timely"
"1129","basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1130","deficiency, or a combination of"
"1131","deficiencies, in internal control over"
"1132","financial reporting, such that there is"
"1133","a reasonable possibility that a"
"1134","material misstatement of the Funds'"
"1135","annual or interim financial statements"
"1136","will not be prevented or detected on a"
"1137","timely basis."
"1138","Our consideration of the Funds'"
"1139","internal control over financial"
"1140","reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1141","described in the first paragraph and"
"1142","would not necessarily disclose all"
"1143","deficiencies in internal control that"
"1144","might be material weaknesses under"
"1145","standards established by the Public"
"1146","Company Accounting Oversight"
"1147","Board (United States).  However, we"
"1148","noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"1149","internal control over financial"
"1150","reporting and its operation, including"
"1151","controls over safeguarding securities,"
"1152","that we consider to be a material"
"1153","weakness as defined above as of"
"1154","April 30, 2014."
