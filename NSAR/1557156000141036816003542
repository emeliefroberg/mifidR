"4818","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"4819","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Goldman Sachs Trust II:"
"4820","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of the"
"4821","following funds of the Goldman Sachs Trust II:"
"4822","the Goldman Sachs Multi-Manager Alternatives Fund,"
"4823","the Goldman Sachs Multi-Manager Global Equity Fund,"
"4824","the Goldman Sachs Multi-Manager Real Assets Strategy Fund,"
"4825","the Goldman Sachs Multi-Manager Non-Core Fixed Income Fund,"
"4826","the Multi-Manager U.S. Dynamic Equity Fund,"
"4827","the Multi-Manager International Equity Fund,"
"4828","the Multi-Manager U.S. Small Cap Equity Fund,"
"4829","the Goldman Sachs Target Date 2020 Portfolio,"
"4830","the Goldman Sachs Target Date 2025 Portfolio,"
"4831","the Goldman Sachs Target Date 2030 Portfolio,"
"4832","the Goldman Sachs Target Date 2035 Portfolio,"
"4833","the Goldman Sachs Target Date 2040 Portfolio,"
"4834","the Goldman Sachs Target Date 2045 Portfolio,"
"4835","the Goldman Sachs Target Date 2050 Portfolio,"
"4836","and the Goldman Sachs Target Date 2055 Portfolio (collectively, referred to"
"4837"," as the Funds) as of and for the periods ended October 31, 2016, in accordance"
"4838","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"4839","(United States), we considered the Funds internal control over financial"
"4840","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"4841","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"4842","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"4843","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"4844","the Funds internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not"
"4845","express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"4846","financial reporting."
"4847","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"4848","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"4849","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"4850","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A funds internal control"
"4851"," over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"4852","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"4853"," of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"4854","accepted accounting principles. A funds internal control over financial"
"4855","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"4856","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"4857","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"4858","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"4859"," to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"4860"," accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"4861","the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"4862"," and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"4863","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"4864","disposition of a funds assets that could have a material effect on the"
"4865","financial statements."
"4866","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"4867","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"4868","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"4869","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"4870","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"4871","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"4872","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"4873","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"4874","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"4875","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"4876","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"4877","misstatement of the Funds annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"4878"," prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"4879","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial reporting was"
"4880","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"4881","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"4882","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"4883","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we"
"4884","noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal control over financial reporting"
"4885"," and its operations, including controls over safeguarding securities that we"
"4886"," consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of October 31, 2016."
"4887","This report is intended solely for the information and use of the"
"4888","Board of Trustees, management and the Securities and Exchange Commission and"
"4889"," is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"4890","specified parties."

"5157"," fractional Acquiring Fund Shares determined by dividing: (A) the aggregate"
"5158","value of the Acquired Funds Assets, net of the Liabilities (each as defined"
"5159"," in paragraph 1.2), computed in the manner set forth in paragraph 2.1,"
"5160","by (B) the net asset value of one share of the Acquiring Fund computed in"
"5161","the manner set forth in paragraph 2.1, in each case as of the time and date"
"5162"," set forth in paragraph 2.1; and"
"5163","(ii)	to assume the Liabilities of the Acquired Fund, as set forth in"

"5165","Transactions described in paragraph 1.1(i) and (ii) shall take place on"
"5166","the date of the closing provided for in paragraph 3.1 (Closing Date)."

"5197","best efforts to discharge all known Liabilities prior to or at the Valuation"
"5198"," Date (as defined in paragraph 2.1) to the extent permissible and consistent"
"5199"," with its own investment objectives and policies.  If prior to the Closing"
"5200","Date, the Goldman Sachs Trust identifies a Liability that the Goldman Sachs"
"5201"," Trust and the Madison Trust, on behalf of an Acquired Fund, mutually agree"
"5202"," should not be assumed by the Goldman Sachs Trust, such Liability shall be"
"5203","excluded from the definition of Liabilities hereunder and shall be listed on"
"5204"," a Schedule of Excluded Liabilities to be signed by the Goldman Sachs Trust"
"5205","and the Madison Trust at the Closing (the Excluded Liabilities).  Certain"
"5206","Liabilities that would otherwise be listed as Excluded Liabilities may be"
"5207","assumed by the Goldman Sachs Trust on behalf of an Acquiring Fund, on the"
"5208","condition that the Goldman Sachs Trust and the relevant Acquiring Fund be"
"5209","indemnified in writing to their reasonable satisfaction by MAM or its"
"5210","affiliates against any and all losses, claims, damages or liability to"
"5211","which the Goldman Sachs Trust and the Acquiring Fund may become subject as"
"5212","a result of assuming such Liability."
"5213","1.3.	Immediately following the action contemplated by paragraph 1.1, each"
"5214"," Acquired Fund will (a) distribute to its shareholders of record with respect"
"5215"," to each class of Acquired Fund Shares as of the Closing Date (Acquired Fund"
"5216"," Shareholders), on a pro rata basis within that class, the Acquiring Fund"
"5217","Shares of the corresponding class received by the Acquired Fund pursuant to"
"5218","paragraph 1.1 and (b) as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter,"
"5219","completely liquidate. Such distribution and liquidation will be accomplished,"
"5220"," with respect to each class of Acquired Fund Shares, by the transfer of the"
"5221","corresponding Acquiring Fund Shares then credited to the account of each"
"5222","Acquired Fund on the books of the applicable Acquiring Fund to open accounts"
"5223"," on the share records of the applicable Acquiring Fund in the names of the"
"5224","Acquired Fund Shareholders.  An Acquiring Fund shall not issue certificates"
"5225","representing any class of Acquiring Fund Shares in connection with such"
"5226","exchange. The aggregate net asset value of each class of Acquiring Fund"
"5227","Shares to be so credited to each corresponding class of Acquired Fund"
"5228","Shareholders shall, with respect to each class, be equal to the aggregate"
"5229"," net asset value of the Acquired Fund Shares of that class owned by Acquired"
"5230"," Fund Shareholders on the Valuation Date. All issued and outstanding Acquired"
"5231"," Fund Shares will simultaneously be redeemed and canceled on the books of the"
"5232"," Acquired Fund.  The Acquired Funds will be dissolved in accordance with the"
"5233"," laws of Delaware as soon as practicable following the Closing Date."
"5234","1.4.	Ownership of Acquiring Fund Shares will be shown on the books of each"
"5235"," Acquiring Funds Transfer Agent, as defined in paragraph 3.3."
"5236","1.5.	Any reporting responsibility of an Acquired Fund, including, but not"
"5237","limited to, the responsibility for filing regulatory reports, tax returns,"
"5238","or other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission),"
"5239","any state securities commission, and any federal, state or local tax"
"5240","authorities or any other relevant regulatory authority, is and shall remain"
"5241","the responsibility of the Acquired Fund.  Each Acquired Fund shall file such"
"5242"," regulatory reports, tax returns, or other documents on a timely basis."
"5243","1.6.	At least fifteen business days prior to the Valuation Date, MAM, on"
"5244"," behalf of each Acquired Fund, will provide GSAM with a schedule of the"
"5245","Assets held by such Acquired Fund.  At least ten business days prior to the"
"5246"," Valuation Date, GSAM, on behalf of each Acquiring Fund will advise MAM of"
"5247","any investments of the corresponding Acquired Fund shown on the Acquired"
"5248","Funds schedule of Assets which such Acquiring Fund would not be permitted"
"5249","to hold (i) under its investment objective, principal investment strategies"
"5250"," or investment restrictions; (ii) under applicable law; or (iii) because"
"5251","the transfer of such investments would result in material operational or"
"5252","administrative difficulties to such Acquiring Fund in connection with"
"5253","facilitating the orderly transition of such Acquired Funds Assets.  Under"
"5254"," such circumstances, to the extent practicable, an Acquired Fund will, if"
"5255"," requested by an Acquiring Fund and, to the extent permissible and"
"5256","consistent with its own investment objectives and policies and the"
"5257","fiduciary duties of the investment adviser responsible for the portfolio"
"5258"," management of the Acquired Fund, dispose of such investments prior to the"
"5259"," Valuation Date.  In addition, if it is determined that the portfolios of"
"5260"," an Acquired Fund and the corresponding Acquiring Fund, when aggregated,"
"5261","would contain investments exceeding certain percentage limitations to which"
"5262"," the Acquiring Fund is or will be subject with respect to such investments,"
"5263"," to the extent practicable, the Acquired Fund will, if requested by the"
"5264","Acquiring Fund and, to the extent permissible and consistent with its own"
"5265"," investment objectives and policies and the fiduciary duties of the"
"5266","investment adviser responsible for the portfolio management of the Acquired"
"5267"," Fund, dispose of and/or reinvest a sufficient amount of such investments"
"5268","as may be necessary to avoid violating such limitations as of the Valuation"
"5269"," Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein will require an"
"5270","Acquired Fund to dispose of any Assets, if, in the reasonable judgment of"
"5271"," the Acquired Funds investment adviser, such disposition would adversely"
"5272","affect the tax-free nature of the Reorganization for federal income tax"
"5273","purposes or would otherwise not be in the best interests of the"
"5274","Acquired Fund."
"5275","1.7.	No sales load, contingent deferred sales charge, commission,"
"5276","redemption fee or other transactional fee will be charged by the Acquired"
"5277","Fund as a result of, or in connection with, the Reorganization."
"5278","1.8.	Immediately after the Closing Date, the share transfer books"
"5279","relating to the Acquired Fund shall be closed and no transfer of shares"
"5280"," shall thereafter be made on such books."
"5281","2. 	VALUATION"
"5282","2.1.	The value of the Assets of each Acquired Fund shall be the value"
"5283"," of such Assets as of the close of business of the New York Stock Exchange"
"5284","and after the declaration of any dividends on the business day immediately"
"5285"," preceding the Closing Date (such time and date being hereinafter called"
"5286","the Valuation Date), computed using the valuation procedures set forth in"
"5287","the then-current prospectus and statement of additional information with"
"5288","respect to each Acquiring Fund and the valuation procedures established by"
"5289","the Goldman Sachs Trusts Board of Trustees (such procedures, the Goldman"
"5290","Sachs Trust Valuation Procedures).   Each Acquired Fund shall deliver"
"5291","a copy of its valuation report to each Acquiring Fund by 7 p.m. (Eastern"
"5292"," time on the Valuation Date."
"5293","2.2.	The Madison Trust and the Goldman Sachs Trust agree to use all"
"5294","commercially reasonable efforts to resolve prior to the Valuation Date any"
"5295"," material pricing differences between the prices of portfolio securities"
"5296","determined in accordance with the pricing policies and procedures of an"
"5297","Acquired Fund and those determined in accordance with the Goldman Sachs"
"5298","Trust Valuation Procedures."

"5611"," petitions, closing agreements, settlement agreements, pending ruling"
"5612","requests and any similar documents submitted by, received by or agreed to"
"5613","by or on behalf of the Acquired Fund. Each Acquired Fund has disclosed on"
"5614","its federal income tax returns all positions taken therein that could give"
"5615"," rise to a substantial understatement of federal income tax within the"
"5616","meaning of Section 6662 of the Code;"

"5848","income tax purposes.  However, upon filing its first federal income tax return"
"5849"," at the completion of its first taxable year, each Acquiring Fund will elect"
"5850","to be a regulated investment company and until such time will take all steps"
"5851"," necessary to ensure that it qualifies for taxation as a regulated investment"

"5866","have been duly authorized by all necessary action, if any, on the part of"
"5867","the Trustees of the Goldman Sachs Trust, on behalf of each Acquiring Fund,"
"5868"," and no other action or proceedings by the Acquiring Funds are necessary to"

"5920"," MAM use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to MAMs fiduciary duty,"
"5921","to limit or cease portfolio trading on behalf of an Acquired Fund for a"
"5922","period of up to three days prior to the Valuation Date.  MAM agrees that"
"5923","it will accommodate such requests to the extent such trading restrictions"
"5924"," are consistent with the investment objectives, policies and strategies of"
"5925"," the applicable Acquired Fund and consistent with fulfilling its fiduciary"
"5926"," obligations as an investment adviser. No party shall take any action that"
"5927"," would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in any of its"
"5928","representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement being or becoming"
"5929"," untrue in any material respect."
"5930","5.2.	Each Acquired Fund will call a meeting of the Acquired Fund"
"5931","Shareholders to be held prior to the Closing Date to consider and act upon"
"5932"," this Agreement and to take all other action necessary to obtain the"

"5934","In the event that any Acquired Fund receives insufficient votes from"
"5935","shareholders, the meeting may be adjourned as permitted under the Madison"
"5936"," Trusts Declaration of Trust, Bylaws, applicable law and the Acquired Funds"

"5946"," at any time prior to the Closing Date a party becomes aware of any untrue"
"5947","statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact required"
"5948","to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made not misleading"

"5966"," such acts to be set forth in the Registration Statement, including the"
