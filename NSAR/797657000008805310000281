"2845","Litigation Update"
"2846","Federal Court Market Timing Litigation:"
"2847","A number of private lawsuits have been filed including purported"
"2848","class and derivative lawsuits, making various allegations and"
"2849","naming as defendants various persons, including certain Scudder"
"2850","and Deutsche (now DWS) funds (singularly, a Fund and"
"2851","collectively, the Funds), the Funds' investment advisors and"
"2852","their affiliates, certain individuals (including in some cases Fund"
"2853","Trustees/Directors, officers), and other parties.  Each Fund's"
"2854","investment advisor has agreed to indemnify the applicable Funds"
"2855","in connection with these lawsuits, or other lawsuits or regulatory"
"2856","actions that may be filed making allegations similar to these"
"2857","lawsuits regarding market timing, revenue sharing, fund valuation"
"2858","or other subjects related to investigations of the foregoing matters."
"2859","Based on currently available information, the Funds' investment"
"2860","advisors believe the likelihood that the pending lawsuits will have"
"2861","a material adverse financial impact on a Fund is remote and such"
"2862","actions are not likely to materially affect their ability to perform"
"2863","under their investment management agreements with the Funds."
"2864","Fifteen class and derivative actions pertaining to market timing"
"2865","have been consolidated and transferred to a Multidistrict Litigation"
"2866","Panel in the District of Maryland (MDL) (Multidistrict Litigation"
"2867","1586-In re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation).  The 11"
"2868","Complaints originally filed in the Southern District of New York"
"2869","that were transferred to the MDL were virtually identical and each"
"2870","asserted claims against Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Investment"
"2871","Management Americas Inc. (DIMA) and Deutsche Asset"
"2872","Management, Inc. as well as approximately 85 Funds in the"
"2873","Scudder and Deutsche family of funds and John Doe defendants."
"2874","The three cases that were originally filed in the Eastern District of"
"2875","New York and the one case originally filed in the District of"
"2876","Delaware are derivative actions brought by purported shareholders"
"2877","in certain of the Funds.  These actions are against Deutsche"
"2878","Investment Management Americas Inc., Deutsche Asset"
"2879","Management, Inc., and John Doe defendants."
"2880","On September 29, 2004, two consolidated amended complaints,"
"2881","one a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint and the"
"2882","other a Consolidated Amended Fund Derivative Complaint, were"
"2883","filed in the MDL."
"2884","On January 11, 2006, Plaintiffs filed a Second Consolidated"
"2885","Amended Class Action Complaint in the MDL.  The officer"
"2886","defendants have been voluntarily dismissed from the class action"
"2887","pursuant to a tolling agreement with Plaintiffs.  Deutsche Bank AG"
"2888","has been dismissed from the derivative action.  On March 16,"
"2889","2007, the Court issued an opinion in the MDL granting in part and"
"2890","denying in part the Deutsche Defendants' motion to dismiss the"
"2891","Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint."
"2892","Plaintiffs filed a Third Consolidated Amended Class Action"
"2893","Complaint (Third Amended Complaint) on December 10, 2007"
"2894","in the MDL.  In the Third Amended Complaint, the Plaintiffs"
"2895","added the names of Funds that they allegedly purchased or held"
"2896","during the class period.  In addition, as contemplated in the Court's"
"2897","scheduling order, the Third Amended Complaint added a new"
"2898","Plaintiff in an attempt to address standing challenges raised by the"
"2899","Defendants.  On January 16, 2008, the Court granted in part and"
"2900","denied in part the Defendants' motion to dismiss certain claims on"
"2901","standing grounds.  The parties conducted extensive discovery.  The"
"2902","Defendants have filed a motion for summary judgment and various"
"2903","related motions, and Class Plaintiffs contemporaneously filed a"
"2904","motion for class certification. The Court heard oral argument on"
"2905","these motions on December 10-11, 2008."
"2906","On February 12, 2010, the parties agreed to a stipulation and"
"2907","agreement of settlement, which is subject to approval by the Court."

"2921","Madison County.  Defendants appealed this decision.  On April 5,"
"2922","2005 the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District"
"2923","Court's decision and instructed the District Court to undo the"
"2924","remand order and dismiss the complaint.  On May 27, 2005, the"
"2925","District Court, in accord with the Seventh Circuit's mandate,"
"2926","dismissed the action with prejudice.  On September 29, 2005,"
"2927","Plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme"
"2928","Court of the United States.  On January 6, 2006, the Supreme"
"2929","Court granted the petition to address jurisdictional questions.  On"

"2942","Court's decision.  The Circuit Court issued an Order dated July 16,"
"2943","2008 stating that the issues raised by the motion to dismiss are"
"2944","nearly identical to those in a pending appeal in an action involving"
"2945","the Putnam funds, and that the Court would therefore wait for the"
"2946","decision of the Illinois Appellate Court in that case before ruling"
"2947","on the motion to dismiss."

"2949","the Putnam fund defendants and against the plaintiffs in that"
"2950","action, holding that the plaintiffs' claims are precluded by the"
"2951","Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act.  The plaintiffs filed a"

"2954","leave to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.  The Circuit Court in"
"2955","the Potter case has scheduled a hearing for March 5, 2010 to"
"2956","determine whether to act on the pending motions or await further"
"2957","proceedings in the Putnam case."

"2962","Icardo v. Deutsche Bank AG, et al.  These three class actions were"
"2963","consolidated. The consolidated Complaint filed on December 19,"
