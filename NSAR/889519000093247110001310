"1551","Act or other governing statute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other"
"1552","regulatory agency with authority over the Fund."
"1553","Real Estate. The Fund may not invest directly in real estate unless it is"
"1554","acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments. This"
"1555","restriction shall not prevent the Fund from investing in securities or other"
"1556","instruments (1) issued by companies that invest, deal, or otherwise engage in"
"1557","transactions in real estate, or (2) backed or secured by real estate or"
"1558","interests in real estate."

"1629","disposition of a company?s assets that could have a"
"1630","material effect on the financial statements."
"1631","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1632","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1633","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1634","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1635","risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"1636","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1637","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1638","deteriorate."
"1639","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1640","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1641","control does not allow management or employees,"
"1642","in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1643","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1644","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"1645","a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"1646","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1647","possibility that a material misstatement of the Trust's"
"1648","annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1649","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1650","Our consideration of the Trust?s internal control over"
"1651","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1652","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1653","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"1654","control over financial reporting that might be material"
"1655","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1656","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1657","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1658","in the Trust?s internal control over financial reporting"
"1659","and its operation, including controls over"
"1660","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be"
"1661","material weaknesses as defined above as of"
"1662","December 31, 2009."
