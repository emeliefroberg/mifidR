"2332","(the &ldquo;Series&rdquo;), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"

"2334","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"2335","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"

"2337","<P STYLE=font: 12pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: justify; margin-right: 0>Management of the Series is responsible"
"2338","for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"2339","and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"2340","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"2341","and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"2342","A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"2343","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"2344","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"2345","with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"2346","and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"

"2348","<P STYLE=font: 12pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"2349","control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"

"2351","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"

"2354","reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"2355","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
