"1168","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"1169","Accounting Firm"
"1170","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"1171","Salient MF Trust:"
"1172","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"1173","consolidated financial statements of Salient"
"1174","Risk Parity Fund and Subsidiary, Salient MLP"
"1175","& Energy Infrastructure Fund II and"
"1176","Subsidiary, Salient Alternative Beta Fund and"
"1177","Subsidiary, Salient Trend Fund and Subsidiary,"
"1178","and Salient Global Equity Fund (collectively,"
"1179","the Funds) as of and for the periods ended"
"1180","December 31, 2013, in accordance with the"
"1181","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1182","Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1183","considered the Funds internal control over"
"1184","financial reporting, including control activities"
"1185","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1186","designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1187","purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1188","consolidated financial statements and to"
"1189","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1190","but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"1191","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds"
"1192","internal control over financial reporting."
"1193","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1194","Management of the Funds is responsible for"
"1195","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1196","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"1197","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1198","management are required to assess the"
"1199","expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"1200","A companys internal control over financial"
"1201","reporting is a process designed to provide"
"1202","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability"
"1203","of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1204","financial statements for external purposes in"
"1205","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1206","principles (GAAP). A companys internal"
"1207","control over financial reporting includes those"
"1208","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1209","maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1210","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1211","transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"1212","the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"1213","that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1214","permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1215","accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"1216","expenditures of the company are being made"
"1217","only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1218","management and directors of the company; and"
"1219","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1220","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1221","acquisition, use or disposition of the companys"
"1222","assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1223","financial statements."
"1224","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1225","control over financial reporting may not"
"1226","prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"1227","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"
"1228","to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1229","controls may become inadequate because of"
"1230","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1231","compliance with the policies or procedures"
"1232","may deteriorate."
"1233","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1234","reporting exists when the design or operation"
"1235","of a control does not allow management or"
"1236","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1237","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1238","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"1239","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1240","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1241","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1242","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1243","Funds annual or interim consolidated financial"
"1244","statements will not be prevented or detected on"
"1245","a timely basis."
"1246","Our consideration of the Funds internal control"
"1247","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"1248","purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"1249","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"1250","in internal control that might be material"
"1251","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1252","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1253","(United States). However, we noted no"
"1254","deficiencies in the Funds internal control over"
"1255","financial reporting and its operation, including"
"1256","controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"1257","consider to be a material weakness as defined"
"1258","above as of December 31, 2013."
