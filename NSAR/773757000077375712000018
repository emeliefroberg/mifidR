"3782","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"3783","To the Trustees and Shareholders of Columbia Funds Series Trust I"
"3784","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Columbia"
"3785","Emerging Markets Fund, Columbia Energy and Natural Resources Fund, Columbia"
"3786","Pacific/Asia Fund, Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund, Columbia Value and"
"3787","Restructuring Fund and Columbia Select Small Cap Fund (each a series of"
"3788","Columbia Funds Series Trust I and hereafter referred to as the Funds) as of"
"3789","and for the period ended March 31, 2012, in accordance with the standards of"
"3790","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"3791","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"3792","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"3793","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"3794","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"3795","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"3796","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"3797","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"3798","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"3799","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"3800","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"3801","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal"
"3802","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"3803","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"3804","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"3805","accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"3806","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"3807","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"3808","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"3809","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"3810","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"3811","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"3812","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"3813","trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"3814","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"3815","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"3816","statements."
"3817","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"3818","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"3819","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"3820","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"3821","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3822","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"3823","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"3824","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3825","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"3826","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"3827","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"3828","the Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"3829","detected on a timely basis."
"3830","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"3831","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3832","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"3833","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"3834","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"3835","no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and"
"3836","its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"3837","consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of March 31, 2012."

"3870","Item 77D/77Q1(b) - Policies with Respect to Securities Investments:"
"3871","On January 17, 2012, Form Type 497(e), Accession No. 0001193125-12-013093, a"
"3872","supplement to the registration statement of Columbia Funds Series Trust I on"
"3873","behalf of the Columbia Select Small Cap Fund was filed with the SEC. It is"
"3874","hereby incorporated by reference as part of the response to these Items 77D"
"3875","and 77Q1(b) of Form N-SAR. The supplement made material changes to the"
"3876","disclosure of the Columbia Select Small Cap Fund's prospectuses, as follows:"
"3877","1.	Principal Investment Strategies"
"3878","Effective on January 27, 2012, the section of each prospectus for the Fund"
"3879","entitled Principal Investment Strategies is deleted in its entirety and"
"3880","replaced with the following disclosure:"
"3881","Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net"
"3882","assets in equity securities (including, but not limited to, common"
"3883","stocks, preferred stocks and securities convertible into common or"
"3884","preferred stocks) of companies that have market capitalizations in the"
"3885","range of companies in the Russell 2000 Growth Index at the time of"
"3886","purchase (between $23 million and $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2011)."
"3887","The Fund invests primarily in common stocks of companies that Columbia"
"3888","Management Investment Advisers, LLC, the Fund's investment adviser (the"
"3889","Adviser), believes have the potential for long-term, above-average"
"3890","earnings growth. The Fund may also invest up to 20% of its net assets in"
"3891","stocks of companies that have market capitalizations at time of purchase"
"3892","outside the range of Russell 2000 Growth Index."
"3893","The Fund may also invest up to 20% of its total assets in foreign"
"3894","securities.  The Fund may invest directly in foreign securities or"
"3895","indirectly through depositary receipts. Depositary receipts are receipts"
"3896","issued by a bank or trust company and evidence ownership of underlying"
"3897","securities issued by foreign companies."
"3898","The Adviser combines fundamental and quantitative analysis with risk"
"3899","management in identifying investment opportunities and constructing the"
"3900","Fund's portfolio. The Adviser considers, among other factors:"
"3901","- the financial condition and management of a company, including its"
"3902","competitive position, the quality of its balance sheet and earnings, its"
"3903","future prospects, the strength of its corporate culture, including the"
"3904","structure of economic and other incentives for employees and management,"
"3905","and the potential for growth and stock price appreciation."
"3906","- overall economic and market conditions."
"3907","The Adviser may sell a security when the security's price reaches a"
"3908","target set by the Adviser; if the Adviser believes that there is"
"3909","deterioration in the issuer's financial circumstances or fundamental"
"3910","prospects, or that other investments are more attractive; or for other"
"3911","reasons."
"3912","The Fund's investment strategy may involve the frequent trading of"
"3913","portfolio securities.  This may cause the Fund to incur higher"
"3914","transaction costs (which may adversely affect the Fund's performance)"
"3915","and may increase taxable distributions for shareholders."
"3916","2.	Principal Risks"
"3917","Effective on January 27, 2012, the section of each prospectus for the Fund"
"3918","entitled Principal Risks is revised by deleting Derivatives Risk, Special"
"3919","Situations Risk and Value Securities Risk and by adding the following:"
"3920","- Currency Risk - Securities denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies"
"3921","are subject to the risk that, for example, if the value of a foreign"
"3922","currency were to decline against the U.S. dollar, such decline would"
"3923","reduce the U.S. dollar value of any securities held by the Fund"
"3924","denominated in that currency."
"3925","- Foreign Securities Risk - Foreign securities are subject to special"
"3926","risks as compared to securities of U.S. issuers. For example, foreign"
"3927","markets can be extremely volatile. Fluctuations in currency exchange"
"3928","rates may impact the value of foreign securities denominated in"
"3929","foreign currencies or in U.S. dollars, without a change in the"
"3930","intrinsic value of those securities. Foreign securities may be less"
"3931","liquid than domestic securities so that the Fund may, at times, be"
"3932","unable to sell foreign securities at desirable times or prices."
"3933","Brokerage commissions, custodial fees and other fees are also"
"3934","generally higher for foreign securities. The Fund may have limited or"
"3935","no legal recourse in the event of default with respect to certain"
"3936","foreign securities, including those issued by foreign governments. In"
"3937","addition, foreign governments may impose potentially confiscatory"
"3938","withholding or other taxes, which could reduce the amount of income"
"3939","and capital gains available to distribute to shareholders. Other"
"3940","risks include possible delays in the settlement of transactions or in"
"3941","the payment of income; generally less publicly available information"
"3942","about companies; the impact of political, social or diplomatic"
"3943","events; possible seizure, expropriation or nationalization of a"
"3944","company or its assets; possible imposition of currency exchange"
"3945","controls; and accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards"
"3946","that may be less comprehensive and stringent than those applicable to"
"3947","domestic companies."
"3948","- Frequent Trading Risk -  Frequent trading of investments increases"
"3949","the possibility that the Fund will realize taxable capital gains"
"3950","(including short-term capital gains, which are generally taxable at"
"3951","higher rates than long-term capital gains for U.S. federal income tax"
"3952","purposes), which could reduce the Fund's after-tax return. Frequent"
"3953","trading can also mean higher brokerage and other transaction costs,"
"3954","which could reduce the Fund's return."
"3955","- Sector Risk - At times, the Fund may have a significant portion of"
"3956","its assets invested in securities of companies conducting business in"
"3957","a broadly related group of industries within an economic sector."
"3958","Companies in the same economic sector may be similarly affected by"
"3959","economic or market events, making the Fund more vulnerable to"
"3960","unfavorable developments in that economic sector than funds that"
"3961","invest more broadly."
"3962","3.	Performance Information"
"3963","Effective on January 27, 2012, the Fund has added Russell 2000 Growth Index"
"3964","as a benchmark.  Accordingly, effective on such date, the following changes"
"3965","are made to the prospectuses:"
"3966","- The paragraph under the section of each prospectus for the Fund"
"3967","entitled Performance Information - Average Annual Total Return is"
"3968","deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following disclosure:"
"3969","The table compares the Fund's returns for each period with those of"
"3970","the Russell 2000 Index and Russell 2000 Growth Index.  The Russell"
"3971","2000 Index is an unmanaged index composed of the 2,000 smallest"
"3972","companies in the Russell 3000 Index, which represents approximately"
"3973","8% of the total market capitalization of the Russell 3000 Index. The"
"3974","Russell 3000 Index measures the performance of the 3,000 largest"
"3975","U.S. companies based on total market capitalization, which"
"3976","represents approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market."
"3977","The Russell 2000 Growth Index measures the performance of those"
"3978","Russell 2000 Index companies with higher price-to-book ratios and"
"3979","higher forecasted growth values.  Prior to January 27, 2012, the"
"3980","Russell 2000 Index was the Fund's sole benchmark.  The Fund added"
"3981","the Russell 2000 Growth Index as a benchmark effective January 27,"
"3982","2012 because the Adviser believes that the additional index provides"
"3983","a useful performance comparison given the Fund's investment in"
"3984","companies believed to have the potential for long-term, above-"
"3985","average earnings growth."
"3986","- The following line under the section of each prospectus for the Fund"
"3987","entitled Performance Information - Average Annual Total Return is"
"3988","added with the following disclosure:"
"3989","Russell 2000 Growth Index           1 year    5 years   10 years"
"3990","(reflects no deductions"
"3991","for fees, expenses or taxes)        -2.91%      2.09%      4.48%"
"3992","4.	Management of the Fund"
"3993","Effective January 27, 2012, the Fund will be managed by different portfolio"
"3994","managers.  Accordingly, effective on such date, the following changes are"
"3995","made to the prospectuses:"
"3996","- The section of each prospectus for the Fund entitled Investment
Adviser and Portfolio Manager(s) - Portfolio Manager is deleted in"
"3997","its entirety and replaced with the following:"
"3998","Portfolio Managers"

"4012","responsible for overseeing the Fund's investments is shown in the"
"4013","table below. The SAI provides more information about each portfolio"
"4014","manager's compensation, other accounts managed by each portfolio"
"4015","manager and each portfolio manager's ownership of securities in the"

"4056","5.	Additional Investment Strategies and Policies"
"4057","- Effective on  January 27, 2012, the section of each prospectus for the"
"4058","Fund entitled Additional Investment Strategies and Policies - Holding
Other Kinds of Investments is deleted in its entirety and replaced with"
"4059","the following disclosure:"
"4060","The Fund may hold investments that are not part of its principal"
"4061","investment strategies. These investments and their risks are described"
"4062","below and in the Statement of Additional Information (SAI). The Fund"
"4063","may choose not to invest in certain securities described in this"
"4064","prospectus and in the SAI, although it has the ability to do so."
"4065","The Fund may invest in derivatives such as futures, forward contracts,"
"4066","options and swap contracts, including credit default swaps."
"4067","Derivatives are financial contracts whose values are based on (or"
"4068","derived from), for example, traditional securities (such as a stock"
"4069","or bond), assets (such as a commodity like gold or a foreign"
"4070","currency), reference rates (such as LIBOR) or market indices (such as"
"4071","the S&P 500(r) Index). The Fund may use derivative instruments for both"
"4072","hedging and non-hedging purposes, including, for example, to produce"
"4073","incremental earnings, to hedge existing positions, to provide a"
"4074","substitute for a position in an underlying asset, to increase or"
"4075","reduce market or credit exposure, or to increase flexibility."
"4076","Derivative strategies often involve leverage, which may exaggerate a"
"4077","loss, potentially causing the Fund to lose more money than it would"
"4078","have lost had it invested in the underlying security or other asset."
"4079","The values of derivatives may move in unexpected ways, especially in"
"4080","unusual market conditions, and may result in increased volatility,"
"4081","among other consequences. The use of derivatives may also increase the"
"4082","amount of taxes payable by shareholders holding shares in a taxable"
"4083","account. Other risks arise from the Fund's potential inability to"
"4084","terminate or to sell derivative positions. A liquid secondary market"
"4085","may not always exist for the Fund's derivative positions at times when"
"4086","the Fund might wish to terminate or to sell such"
"4087","positions. Derivatives traded in the over-the-counter market"
"4088","(investments not traded on an exchange) are subject to the risk that"
"4089","the other party will not meet its obligations. The use of derivatives"
"4090","also involves the risks of mispricing or improper valuation and that"
"4091","changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly"
"4092","with the underlying security, asset, reference rate or index. The Fund"
"4093","also may not be able to find a suitable derivative transaction"
"4094","counterparty, and thus may be unable to engage in derivative"
"4095","transactions when it is deemed favorable to do so, or at all. For more"
"4096","information on the risks of derivative investments and strategies, see"
"4097","the SAI."
"4098","- Effective as of the date of this supplement, the second paragraph of the"
"4099","section of each prospectus for the Fund entitled Additional Investment
Strategies and Policies - Portfolio Holdings Disclosure is replaced"
"4100","with the following disclosure:"

"4158","Item 77E - Legal Proceedings:"
"4159","In December 2005, without admitting or denying the allegations, American"
"4160","Express Financial Corporation (AEFC, which is now known as Ameriprise"
"4161","Financial, Inc. (Ameriprise Financial)) entered into settlement agreements"
"4162","with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Minnesota Department of"
"4163","Commerce (MDOC) related to market timing activities. As a result, AEFC was"
"4164","censured and ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any"
"4165","violations of certain provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the"
"4166","Investment Company Act of 1940, and various Minnesota laws. AEFC agreed to pay"
"4167","disgorgement of $10 million and civil money penalties of $7 million. AEFC also"

"4170","ordered by the SEC in accordance with various undertakings detailed at"

"4172","affiliates have cooperated with the SEC and the MDOC in these legal"

"4174","Ameriprise Financial and certain of its affiliates have historically been"

"4176","including routine litigation, class actions, and governmental actions,"
