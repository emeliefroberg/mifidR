"4290","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"

"4300","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"4301","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"

"4318","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"

"4420","On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Securities Commissioner (WVSC) issued a"
"4421","Summary Order to Cease and Desist and Notice of Right to Hearing to AIM"
"4422","Advisors, Inc. and AIM Distributors, Inc. (predecessors to Invesco Advisers,"
"4423","Inc. and Invesco Distributors, Inc., respectively) (collectively, Invesco)"
"4424","(Order No. 05-1318). The WVSC alleged that Invesco entered into certain"
"4425","arrangements permitting market timing and failed to disclose these arrangements"
"4426","in violation of the West Virginia securities laws. The WVSC ordered Invesco to"
"4427","cease any further violations and sought to impose monetary sanctions, including"
"4428","restitution to affected investors, disgorgement of fees, reimbursement of"
"4429","investigatory, administrative and legal costs and an administrative
assessment to be determined by the Commissioner. On October 27, 2011, a"
"4430","hearing examiner was appointed to this matter. This matter continues to be"
"4431","indefinitely suspended."
"4432","Management of Invesco and the Trust believe that the outcome of the proceedings"
"4433","described above will not have a material adverse effect on the Trust or on the"

"4445","                      TERMS OF NEW OR AMENDED SECURITIES"
"4446","                AIM INVESTMENT FUNDS (INVESCO INVESTMENT FUNDS)"
"4447","Invesco Balanced-Risk Allocation Fund, Invesco Balanced-Risk Commodity Strategy"
"4448","Fund, Invesco Developing Markets Fund, Invesco Emerging Markets Equity Fund,"
"4449","Invesco Emerging Market Local Currency Debt Fund, Invesco Endeavor Fund and"
"4450","Invesco Premium Income Fund"
"4451","On September 24, 2012, AIM Investment Funds (Invesco Investment Funds) (the"
"4452","Trust) commenced operations of Class R6 shares for the following funds:"
"4453","Invesco Balanced-Risk Allocation Fund, Invesco Balanced-Risk Commodity Strategy"
"4454","Fund, Invesco Developing Markets Fund, Invesco Emerging Markets Equity Fund,"
"4455","Invesco Emerging Market Local Currency Debt Fund, Invesco Endeavor Fund and"
"4456","Invesco Premium Income Fund (each a Fund and collectively the Funds). Class"
"4457","R6 shares are sold at net asset value, and are not subject to an initial sales"
"4458","charge or to a CDSC. Shares of beneficial interest of the Trust are redeemable"
"4459","at their net asset value at the option of the shareholder or at the option of"
"4460","the Trust in certain circumstances, subject in certain circumstances to a"
"4461","contingent deferred sales charge. Each class of shares represents an interest"
"4462","in the same portfolio of investments. Differing sales charges and expenses will"
"4463","result in differing net asset values and dividends and distributions. Each"
"4464","share of a Fund generally has the same voting, dividend, liquidation and other"
"4465","rights; however, each class of shares of a Fund is subject to different sales"
"4466","loads, conversion features, exchange privileges and class-specific expenses."
"4467","Only shareholders of a specific class may vote on matters relating to that"
"4468","class's distribution plan. Shareholders of each Fund are entitled to one vote"
"4469","per share (with proportionate voting for fractional shares), irrespective of"
"4470","the relative net asset value of the shares of a Fund. However, on matters"
"4471","affecting an individual Fund or class of shares, a separate vote of"
"4472","shareholders of that Fund or class is required. Shareholders of a Fund or class"
"4473","are not entitled to vote on any matter which does not affect that Fund or class"
"4474","but that requires a separate vote of another Fund or class. When issued, shares"
"4475","of each Fund are fully paid and nonassessable, have no preemptive or"
"4476","subscription rights, and are freely transferable. Class R6 shares do not have"
"4477","conversion rights. Class R6 shares do not have cumulative voting rights, which"
"4478","means that when shareholders elect trustees, holders of more than 50% of the"
"4479","shares voting for the election of trustees can elect all of the trustees of the"
"4480","Trust, and the holders of fewer than 50% of the shares voting for the election"
"4481","of trustees will not be able to elect any trustees. Upon any liquidation of the"
"4482","Trust, shareholders of each class are entitled to share pro rata in the net"
"4483","assets belonging to the applicable Fund allocable to such class available for"
"4484","distribution after satisfaction of outstanding liabilities of the Fund"
"4485","allocable to such class."
"4486","Under Delaware law, shareholders of a Delaware statutory trust shall be"
"4487","entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to shareholders"
"4488","of private for-profit corporations organized under Delaware law. There is a"
"4489","remote possibility, however, that shareholders could, under certain"
"4490","circumstances, be held liable for the obligations of the Trust to the extent"
"4491","the courts of another state, which does not recognize such limited liability,"
"4492","were to apply the laws of such state to a controversy involving such"
"4493","obligations. The Trust Agreement disclaims shareholder liability for acts or"
"4494","obligations of the Trust and requires that notice of such disclaimer be given"
"4495","in each agreement, obligation or instrument entered into or executed by the"
"4496","Trust or the trustees to all parties. The Trust Agreement provides for"
"4497","indemnification out of the property of the Fund for all losses and expenses of"
"4498","any shareholder of such Fund held liable on account of being or having been a"
"4499","shareholder. Thus, the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss due to"
"4500","shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which the Fund is unable"
"4501","to meet its obligations and the complaining party is not held to be bound by"
"4502","the disclaimer."
