"919","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"920"," Accounting Firm"
"921","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"922","of Access One Trust:"
"923","In planning and performing our audit of"
"924","the financial statements of Access VP"
"925","High Yield Fund (the Fund) as of and"
"926","for the year ended December 31, 2009,"
"927"," in accordance with the standards of the"
"928","Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"929","Board (United States), we considered"
"930","the Funds internal control over financial"
"931","reporting, including controls over"
"932","safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"933","designing our auditing procedures for"
"934","the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"935","on the financial statements and to comply"
"936","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"937","not for the purpose of expressing an"
"938","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds"
"939","internal control over financial reporting."
"940","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion"
"941","on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"942","control over financial reporting."
"943","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"944","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"945","internal control over financial reporting."
"946","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"947","and judgments by management are"
"948","required to assess the expected benefits"
"949","and related costs of controls.  A funds"
"950","internal control over financial reporting"
"951","is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"952","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"953","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"954","statements for external purposes in"
"955","accordance with generally accepted"
"956","accounting principles.  A funds internal"
"957","control over financial reporting includes"
"958","those policies and procedures that (1)"
"959","pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"960","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"961","reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"962","of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"963","reasonable assurance that transactions"
"964","are recorded as necessary to permit"
"965","preparation of financial statements in"
"966","accordance with generally accepted"
"967","accounting principles, and that receipts"
"968","and expenditures of the fund are being"
"969","made only in accordance with authorizations"
"970","of management and trustees of the fund;"
"971","and (3)  provide reasonable assurance"
"972","regarding prevention or timely detection"
"973","of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"974","disposition of a funds assets that could"
"975","have a material effect on the financial"
"976","statements."
"977","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"978","internal control over financial reporting"
"979","may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"980","Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"981","effectiveness to future periods are subject"
"982"," to the risk that controls may become"
"983","inadequate because of changes in"
"984","conditions, or that the degree of"
"985","compliance with the policies or procedures"
"986","may deteriorate."
"987","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"988","reporting exists when the design or operation"
"989","of a control does not allow management or"
"990","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"991","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"992","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"993","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"994","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"995","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"996","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"997","Funds annual or interim financial statements"
"998","will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"999","basis."
"1000","Our consideration of the Funds internal control"
"1001","over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1002","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1003","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"1004","control over financial reporting that might be"
"1005","material weaknesses under standards established"
"1006","by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1007","Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"1008","deficiencies in the Funds internal control over"
"1009"," financial reporting and its operation, including"
"1010","controls over safeguarding securities that we"
"1011","consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"1012","above as of December 31, 2009."
"1013","This report is intended solely for the information"
"1014","and use of management and the Board of Trustees"
"1015","of Access One Trust and the Securities and"
"1016","Exchange Commission and is not intended"
