"822","       Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"823","The Board of Directors and Shareholders"
"824","Prudential Global Total Return Fund, Inc.:"
"825","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"826","Prudential Global Return Fund, Inc. (formerly Dryden Global Total"
"827","Return Fund, Inc.) (hereafter referred to as the Fund), as of and for"
"828","the year ended October 31, 2011, in accordance with the standards of"
"829","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"830","considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"831","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"832","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"833","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"834","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"835","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"836","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"837","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"838","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"839","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"840","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"841","controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"842","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"843","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"844","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"845","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"846","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"847","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"848","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"849","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"850","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"851","with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"852","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"853","authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)"
"854","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"855","of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's"
"856","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"857","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"858","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"859","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"860","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"861","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"862","procedures may deteriorate."
"863","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"864","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"865","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"866","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"867","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"868","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"869","possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim"
"870","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"871","basis."
"872","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"873","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"874","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"875","that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"876","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"877","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over"
"878","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"879","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as"
"880","defined above as of October 31, 2011."
"881","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"882","management and the Board of Directors of the Fund and the Securities"
"883","and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be"
"884","used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"906","____"
"907","At a recent meeting of the Board of Directors of Prudential"
"908","Global Total Return Fund, Inc. (the Fund), the Board"
"909","approved a change to the Fund's non-fundamental"
"910","investment limits for asset-backed securities (ABS) and"
"911","high yield debt securities.  This change will become effective"
"912","on or about March 1, 2012."
"913","This supplement amends the Fund's Prospectus and is in"
"914","addition to any existing supplement to the Fund's Prospectus."
"915","1.  The first paragraph under the caption SUMMARY
SECTION - INVESTMENTS, RISKS AND PERFORMANCE
- Principal Investment Strategies is deleted and replaced"
"916","with the following:"
"917","       The Fund seeks investments that will increase in"
"918","value, as well as pay the Fund interest and other income. The"
"919","Fund normally invests at least 65% of its total assets in"
"920","income-producing debt securities of U.S. and foreign"
"921","corporations and governments, supranational organizations,"
"922","semi-governmental entities or government agencies,"
"923","authorities or instrumentalities, investment-grade U.S. or"
"924","foreign mortgages and mortgage-related securities and U.S. or"
"925","foreign short-term and long-term bank debt securities or bank"
"926","deposits. The Fund invests in securities of emerging market"
"927","countries. The Fund may invest in debt securities that are"
"928","denominated in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. Our"
"929","approach to global investing focuses on country and"
"930","currency selection. We look at fundamentals to identify"
"931","relative value. The Fund may invest up to 50% of its total"
"932","assets in high-yield, high-risk bonds, also known as junk"
"933","bonds."
"934","2.  The fifth and sixth paragraphs under the caption HOW
THE FUND INVESTS - INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND
POLICIES are deleted and replaced with the following:"
"935","	The Fund may invest in debt securities that are"
"936","investment-grade. This means major rating services, like"
"937","Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) or Moody's"
"938","Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's), have rated the securities"
"939","within one of their four highest quality grades. Debt"
"940","obligations in the fourth highest grade are regarded as"
"941","investment-grade, but have speculative characteristics and"
"942","are riskier than higher rated securities. A rating is an"
"943","assessment of the likelihood of timely repayment of interest"
"944","and principal and can be useful when comparing different"
"945","debt obligations. Ratings are not a guarantee of quality. The"
"946","opinions of the rating agencies do not reflect market risk and"
"947","they may at times lag behind the current financial conditions"
"948","of a company. The Fund also may invest in obligations that"
"949","are not rated, but that the investment subadviser believes are"
"950","of comparable quality to the obligations described above."
"951","	Up to 50% of the Fund's total assets may be invested"
"952","in lower-rated securities, which are riskier than investment-"
"953","grade debt obligations and considered speculative with"
"954","respect to their capacity to pay principal and interest. The"
"955","Fund's investments in these high-yield or junk bonds will"
"956","have a minimum rating of C by Moody's or S&P or an"
"957","equivalent rating by another major rating service at the time"
"958","they are purchased. The Fund may continue to hold such a"
"959","security if it is subsequently downgraded below C or an"
"960","equivalent rating or is no longer rated by a major rating"
"961","service."
"962","3.  The following changes are made to the chart titled"
