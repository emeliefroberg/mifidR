"681","<DESCRIPTION>INTERNAL CONTROL LETTER"
"682","<TEXT>"
"683","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"684","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders"
"685","of Cohen & Steers Global Infrastructure Fund, Inc."
"686","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Cohen &"
"687","Steers Global Infrastructure Fund, Inc. (the Fund) as of and for the year"
"688","ended December 31, 2009, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"689","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's"
"690","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"691","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"692","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"693","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"694","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"695","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"696","internal control over financial reporting."
"697","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"698","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"699","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"700","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control"
"701","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"702","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"703","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"704","accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"705","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"706","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"707","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"708","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"709","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"710","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"711","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"712","directors of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"713","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"714","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"715","statements."
"716","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"717","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"718","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"719","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"720","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"721","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"722","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"723","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"724","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"725","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"726","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"727","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"728","on a timely basis."
"729","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"730","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"731","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"732","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"733","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"734","no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"735","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"736","be material weaknesses as defined above as of December 31, 2009."
"737","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"738","the Board of Directors of Cohen & Steers Global Infrastructure Fund, Inc. and"
"739","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not"
"740","be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"792"," we might do with respect to such purchases, sales or other transactions"
"793"," as well as with respect to all other things necessary or incidental to"
"794"," the furtherance or conduct of such purchases, sale or other transactions."
"795"," (c) You will make your officers and employees available to us from time"

"807"," they engage, or the conditions prevailing in the economy generally."
"808"," You will also furnish us and the Funds Board of Directors with"
"809"," such statistical and analytical information with respect to the"
"810"," Subadvisor Assets as you may believe appropriate or as we or the"
"811"," Fund reasonably may request.  In making such purchases and sales"
"812"," of the Subadvisor Assets, you will bear in mind the policies set"
"813"," from time to time by the Funds Board of Directors as well as the"
"814"," limitations imposed by the Funds Articles of Incorporation and"
"815"," in the Funds Registration Statement under the Act and of the Internal"
"816"," Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, in respect of regulated investment"
"817"," companies."
"818"," (d) It is understood that you will conform to all applicable rules and"
"819"," regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission in all material"
"820"," respects and in addition will conduct your activities under this"
"821"," Agreement in accordance with any applicable regulations."
"822"," (e) It is understood that you will from time to time employ or associate"
"823"," with yourselves such persons as you believe to be particularly fitted"

"868"," outstanding voting securities (as so defined) of the Fund or by a"
"869"," vote of a majority of the Board of Directors of the Fund, each on"
"870"," 60 days written notice to you, or by you on 60 days written notice"
"871"," to us and to the Fund."
"872","7. This agreement may not be transferred, assigned, sold or in"
"873"," any manner hypothecated or pledged by you and this agreement"
"874"," shall terminate automatically in the event of any such transfer,"
"875"," assignment, sale, hypothecation or pledge by you. The terms transfer,"
"876"," assignment and sale as used in this paragraph shall have the meanings"
"877"," ascribed thereto by governing law and any interpretation thereof"
"878"," contained in rules or regulations promulgated by the Securities and"

"1156"," assist you in the execution of your duties hereunder, the cost of performance"
"1157"," of such duties to be borne and paid by you.  No obligation may be incurred"
"1158"," on our behalf in any such respect."
"1159","3. We shall expect of you, and you will give us and the Fund the benefit of,"
"1160"," your best judgment and efforts in rendering these services to us and the Fund,"
"1161"," and we and the Fund agree as an inducement to your undertaking these services"
"1162"," that you shall not be liable hereunder for any mistake of judgment or in"
"1163"," any event whatsoever, except for lack of good faith, provided that nothing"
"1164"," herein shall be deemed to protect, or purport to protect, you against any"
"1165"," liability to us or the Fund or to our security holders to which you would"
