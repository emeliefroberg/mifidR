"490","PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"491","To the Board of Trustees of Northern Lights"
"492","Fund Trust and the Shareholders of Zeo Strategic"
"493","Income Fund"
"494","We have audited the accompanying statement of"
"495","assets and liabilities of the Zeo Strategic Income"
"496","Fund, a series of shares of beneficial interest in"
"497","Northern Lights Fund Trust, including the portfolio"
"498","of investments, as of April 30, 2015, and the related"
"499","statement of operations for the year then ended,"
"500","the statements of changes in net assets for each of"
"501","the years in the two-year period then ended and the"
"502","financial highlights for each of the years in the"
"503","three-year period then ended and for the period"
"504","May 31, 2011 (commencement of operations)"
"505","through April 30, 2012. These financial statements"
"506","and financial highlights are the responsibility of the"
"507","Funds management.  Our responsibility is to"
"508","express an opinion on these financial statements"
"509","and financial highlights based on our audits."
"510","We conducted our audits in accordance with the"
"511","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"512","Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards"
"513","require that we plan and perform the audits to"
"514","obtain reasonable assurance about whether the"
"515","financial statements and financial highlights are"
"516","free of material misstatement.  An audit includes"
"517","examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the"
"518","amounts and disclosures in the financial"
"519","statements.  Our procedures included confirmation"
"520","of securities owned as of April 30, 2015 by"
"521","correspondence with the custodian and brokers. An"
"522","audit also includes assessing the accounting"
"523","principles used and significant estimates made by"
"524","management, as well as evaluating the overall"
"525","financial statement presentation.  We believe that"
"526","our audits provide a reasonable basis for our"
"527","opinion."
"528","In our opinion, the financial statements and"
"529","financial highlights referred to above present fairly,"
"530","in all material respects, the financial position of Zeo"
"531","Strategic Income Fund as of April 30, 2015, the"
"532","results of its operations for the year then ended, the"
"533","changes in its net assets for each of the years in"
"534","the two-year period then ended and its financial"
"535","highlights for each of the years in the three-year"
"536","period then ended and for the period May 31, 2011"
"537","through April 30, 2012, in conformity with"
"538","accounting principles generally accepted in the"
"539","United States of America."
