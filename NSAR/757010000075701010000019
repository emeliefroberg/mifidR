"6414","outstanding shares of Target Fund, as of 1:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on the Closing"

"6423","accomplished by the establishment of accounts on the share records of Acquiring"

"6425","of the close of business on the Closing Date.  Fractional Acquiring Fund Shares"

"6450","recent respective prospectuses of Acquiring Fund and Target Fund, or amendments"
"6451","thereto."
"6452","(b) In the event of a Market Disruption on the proposed Closing Date, so that"
"6453","an accurate appraisal of the net asset value of Acquiring Fund Shares or Target"
"6454","Fund Shares or the value of Target Fund's Net Assets is impracticable, the"
"6455","Closing Date shall be postponed until the first business day when regular"

"6480","originally as a Massachusetts business trust in September 1984 and converted"
"6481","into a Delaware statutory trust effective July 1, 2007.  Tax-Free Trust is duly"

"6486","exemption for the purposes of raising initial capital or obtaining any required"
"6487","initial shareholder approvals."
"6488","(b) Tax-Free Trust is authorized to issue an unlimited number shares of"
"6489","beneficial interest, without par value, of Acquiring Fund, each outstanding"
"6490","share of which is, and each share of which when issued pursuant to and in"

"6502","Fund as of their respective dates and the results of Acquiring Fund's operations"
"6503","for the periods indicated in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting"
"6504","Principles applied on a consistent basis."
"6505","(d) The books and records of Acquiring Fund accurately summarize the accounting"
"6506","data represented and contain no material omissions with respect to the business"

"6516","may otherwise be required under the federal and state securities laws or the"
"6517","rules and regulations thereunder."
"6518","(f) Tax-Free Trust has elected to treat Acquiring Fund as a regulated"
"6519","investment company (RIC) for federal income tax purposes under Part I of"
"6520","Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code)."
"6521","Acquiring Fund is a fund as defined in Section 851(g)(2) of the Code, has"
"6522","qualified as a RIC for each taxable year since its inception, and intends to"
"6523","continue to qualify as a RIC as of the Closing Date, and consummation of the"
"6524","transactions contemplated by the Plan will not cause it to fail to be qualified"
"6525","as a RIC as of the Closing Date."
"6526","(g) Acquiring Fund is not under jurisdiction of a Court in a Title 11 or"
"6527","similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code."

"6532","ordinary course of business as an investment company."
"6533","(j) There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Target Fund and"
"6534","Acquiring Fund that was issued, acquired, or will be settled at a discount."
"6535","(k) Acquiring Fund does not own, directly or indirectly, nor has it owned"
"6536","during the past five (5) years, directly or indirectly, any shares of Target"
"6537","Fund."
"6538","(l) Tax-Free Trust has no plan or intention to issue additional shares of"
"6539","Acquiring Fund following the Plan of Reorganization except for shares issued"
"6540","in the ordinary course of Acquiring Fund's business as a series of an open-end"
"6541","investment company; nor does Tax-Free Trust have any plan or intention to"
"6542","redeem or otherwise reacquire any shares of Acquiring Fund issued pursuant to"
"6543","the Plan of Reorganization, either directly or through any transaction,"
"6544","agreement, or arrangement with any other person, other than in the ordinary"
"6545","course of its business or to the extent necessary to comply with its legal"
"6546","obligation under Section 22(e) of the 1940 Act."
"6547","(m) Acquiring Fund is in the same line of business as Target Fund before the"
"6548","Plan of Reorganization and did not enter into such line of business as part of"
"6549","the Plan of Reorganization. Acquiring Fund will actively continue Target Fund's"
"6550","business in substantially the same manner that Target Fund conducted that"
"6551","business immediately before the Plan of Reorganization and has no plan or"
"6552","intention to change such business. On the Closing Date, Acquiring Fund expects"
"6553","that at least 33 1/3% of Target Fund's portfolio assets will meet the investment"
"6554","objectives, strategies, policies, risks and restrictions of Acquiring Fund."
"6555","Acquiring Fund has no plan or intention to change any of its investment"
"6556","objectives, strategies, policies, risks and restrictions after the Plan of"
"6557","Reorganization. Acquiring Fund has no plan or intention to sell or otherwise"
"6558","dispose of any of the former assets of Target Fund, except for dispositions"
"6559","made in the ordinary course of its business or dispositions necessary to"
"6560","maintain its qualification as a RIC, although in the ordinary course of its"
"6561","business, Acquiring Fund will continuously review its investment portfolio"
"6562","(as Target Fund did before the Closing) to determine whether to retain or"
"6563","dispose of particular  securities, including those included among the former"
"6564","assets of Target Fund."
"6565","(n) The registration statement on Form N-14 referred to in Section 7(g) hereof"
"6566","(the Registration Statement), and any prospectus or statement of additional"
"6567","information of Acquiring Fund contained or incorporated therein by reference,"
"6568","and any supplement or amendment to the Registration Statement or any such"
"6569","prospectus or statement of additional information, on the effective and"
"6570","clearance dates of the Registration Statement, on the date of the Special"
"6571","Meeting of Target Fund shareholders, and on the Closing Date: (i) shall comply"

"6579","5. Representations and Warranties by Target Trust on behalf of Target Fund."
"6580","Target Trust, on behalf of Target Fund, represents and warrants to Tax-Free"
"6581","Trust that:"
"6582","(a) Target Fund is a series of Target Trust, a statutory trust organized"

"6593","of which is fully paid, non-assessable, and has full voting rights.  Target"
"6594","Trust issues shares of four (4) series, including Target Fund.  Target Fund has"
"6595","one class of shares and an unlimited number of shares of beneficial interest of"

"6597","shareholder of Target Trust has or will have any option, warrant, or preemptive"
"6598","rights of subscription or purchase with respect to Target Fund Shares."
"6599","(c) The financial statements appearing in Target Fund's Annual Report to"
"6600","Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, audited by"
"6601","PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, copies of which have been delivered to Tax-Free"
"6602","Trust, and any interim financial statements for Target Fund that may be"
"6603","furnished to Tax-Free Trust, fairly present the financial position of Target"
"6604","Fund as of their respective dates and the results of Target Fund's operations"
"6605","for the periods indicated in conformity with generally accepted accounting"
"6606","principles applied on a consistent basis."

"6608","under any provision of its Agreement and Declaration of Trust or Bylaws, as"
"6609","amended, or any contract or any other commitment or obligation, and is not"
"6610","subject to any order or decree that would be violated by its execution of or"
"6611","performance under the Plan.  Target Fund has no material contracts or other"
"6612","commitments (other than the Plan or agreements for the purchase of securities"
"6613","entered into in the ordinary course of business and consistent with its"
"6614","obligations under the Plan) which will not be terminated by Target Fund in"
"6615","accordance with their terms at or prior to the Closing Date, or which will"
"6616","result in a penalty or additional fee to be due or payable by Target Fund."
"6617","(e) Target Trust has elected to treat Target Fund as a RIC for federal income"
"6618","tax purposes under Part I of Subchapter M of the Code.  Target Fund is a fund"

"7742","by June 30, 2009, the Plan shall automatically terminate on that date, unless"

"7868","Tax-Free Income Fund (constituting portfolios of Franklin Tax-Free Trust"
"7869","(the Funds)) as of and for the year ended February 28, 2009, in accordance"
"7870","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"7871","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"7872","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"7873","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"7874","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"7875","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"7876","Funds' internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not"
"7877","express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"7878","financial reporting."
"7879","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"7880","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"7881","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"7882","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A Fund's internal control"
"7883","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"7884","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"7885","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"7886","accepted accounting principles.  A Fund's internal control over financial"
"7887","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"7888","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"7889","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"7890","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"7891","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"7892","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"7893"," are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"7894","trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"7895","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"7896"," of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"7897","statements."
"7898","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"7899","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"7900","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"7901","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"7902","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"7903","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"7904","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"7905"," normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"7906","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"7907","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"7908","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"7909","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"7910"," on a timely basis."
"7911","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"7912","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"7913","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"7914","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"7915","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we"
"7916","noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"7917","and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"7918","consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of February 28, 2009."
"7919","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"7920","the Board of Trustees of Franklin Tax-Free Trust and the Securities and"
