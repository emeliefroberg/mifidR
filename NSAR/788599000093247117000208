"678","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"679","Firm"
"680","To the Board of Trustees of Vanguard New York Tax-Free Funds"
"681","and the Shareholders of"
"682","Vanguard New York Long-Term Tax-Exempt Fund and"
"683","Vanguard New York Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund"
"684","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"685","statements of Vanguard New York Long-Term Tax-Exempt Fund"
"686","and Vanguard New York Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund"
"687","(constituting Vanguard New York Tax-Free Funds, hereafter"
"688","referred to as the ?Trust?) as of and for the year ended November"
"689","30, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"690","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"691","considered the Trust?s internal control over financial reporting,"
"692","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"693","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"694","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"695","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"696","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust?s internal"
"697","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express"
"698","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control"
"699","over financial reporting."
"700","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"701","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"702","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"703","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"704","related costs of controls.  A company?s internal control over"
"705","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"706","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"707","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"708","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"709","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"710","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"711","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"712","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"713","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"714","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"

"726","because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"

"728","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"

"764","Vanguard New York Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund"
"765","Supplement to the Prospectus and Summary Prospectus"
"766","Dated March 29, 2016"
"767","Important Announcement"
"768","The board of trustees of Vanguard New York Tax-Free Funds has approved"
"769","the renaming of Vanguard New York Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund to Vanguard"
"770","New York Municipal Money Market Fund. This name change is expected to"
"771","occur in the first quarter of 2017. The investment objective and limitations"
"772","of the Fund will remain the same, including the 20% limitation on investments"
"773","in securities that are subject to the alternative minimum tax."
"774","The following changes are effective on October 14, 2016, as a"
"775","result of rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange"
"776","Commission (SEC) in July 2014 and September 2015."
"777","Prospectus and Summary Prospectus Text Changes for Vanguard"
"778","New York Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund"
"779","The paragraph under Principal Investment Policies is replaced with the"
"780","following:"
"781","Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in a"
"782","variety of high-quality, short-term New York municipal securities whose"
"783","income is exempt from federal and New York state taxes. To be considered high"
"784","quality, a security must be determined by Vanguard to present minimal credit"
"785","risk based in part on a consideration of maturity, portfolio diversification,"
"786","portfolio liquidity, and credit quality. The Fund invests in securities with"
"787","effective maturities of 397 days or less, maintains a dollar-weighted average"
"788","maturity of 60 days or less, and maintains a dollar-weighted average life of"
"789","120 days or less."
"790","The last paragraph under Principal Risks is replaced with the following:"
"791","You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to"
"792","preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee"
"793","it will do so. The Fund may impose a fee upon sale of your shares or may"
"794","temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls"
"795","below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An"
"796","investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit"
"797","Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has"
"798","no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should"
"799","not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any"
"800","time."
"801","The following is added to the paragraph under Purchase and Sale of Fund
Shares:"
"802","The Fund is only available for purchase within accounts beneficially owned"
"803","by natural persons."
"804","Prospectus Text Changes"
"805","In the Investing in Money Market Funds section, the following replaces the"
"806","last paragraph under What is Money Market Reform:"
"807","The board of trustees of Vanguard New York Tax-Free Funds (the Board), in"
"808","accordance with the best interest of the shareholders, approved a number of"
"809","changes in response to the SEC?s 2014 amendments to the rules governing"
"810","money market funds. The changes including the Board's ability to implement"
"811","liquidity fees and redemption gates if Vanguard New York Tax-Exempt Money"
"812","Market Fund's weekly liquid assets fall below established thresholds are now"
"813","in effect. As part of these changes, information regarding the Fund's weekly"
"814","liquid assets for the prior six months (by day, as of the close of business)"
"815","is available on the Fund?s Portfolio page at vanguard.com."
"816","In the Investing in Money Market Funds section, the following is added after"
"817","the last paragraph under How Does This Affect Vanguard Money Market
Funds Vanguard New York Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund:

If you redeem shares when the Fund has imposed a liquidity fee, then the
amount you receive for your redemption will be reduced by the amount of the
liquidity fee and will generally cause you to recognize a loss for tax
purposes equal to the amount of that fee. Once the Fund imposes a redemption
gate, then unprocessed orders to redeem will be canceled and the Fund will
not accept redemption orders until the gate is no longer in effect. If you
still wish to redeem once the gate is lifted, you will need to submit a new
redemption request to the Fund or your financial intermediary.

Notices regarding liquidity fees or redemption gates will be filed with the
SEC on Form N-CR. In addition, announcements will also be made in supplements
to the Fund?s prospectus and on the Fund's website.

In the More on the Funds section under the heading Security Selection, the
Plain Talk About Credit Quality paragraph is replaced with the following:

A bond's credit-quality rating is an assessment of the issuer's ability to
pay interest on the bond and, ultimately, to repay the principal. The lower
the credit quality, the greater the chance?in Vanguard's opinion that the
bond issuer will default, or fail to meet its payment obligations. All
things being equal, the lower a bond?s credit quality, the higher its yield
should be to compensate investors for assuming additional risk.

In the More on the Funds section under the heading Frequent Trading or"
"818","Market-Timing, the following replaces similar text:

Each Vanguard fund (other than retail and government money market funds), in
determining its net asset value, will use fair-value pricing when appropriate,
as described in the Share Price section. Fair-value pricing may reduce or
eliminate the profitability of certain frequent-trading strategies.

In the More on the Funds section under the heading Share Price, the
following replaces the second and fifth paragraphs:

Debt securities held by a Vanguard fund are valued based on information
furnished by an independent pricing service or market quotations. Certain
shortterm debt instruments used to manage a fund's cash may be valued at
amortized cost when it approximates fair value; the instruments held by a
retail or government money market fund are valued on the basis of amortized
cost. The values of any mutual fund shares held by a fund are based on the
NAVs of the shares. The values of any ETF shares, institutional money market
fund shares, or closed-end fund shares held by a fund are based on the market
value of the shares.

Although the stable share price is not guaranteed, the NAV of Vanguard retail
and government money market funds is expected to remain at $1 per share.
Instruments are purchased and managed with that goal in mind.

In the Investing With Vanguard section under the heading Purchasing"
"819","Shares, the following replaces similar text under Earning Dividends:

You generally begin earning dividends on the business day following your
trade date. When buying money market fund shares through a federal funds wire
on a business day, however, you generally can begin earning dividends
immediately by making a purchase request by telephone to Vanguard before
10:45 a.m., Eastern time (2 p.m., Eastern time, for Vanguard Prime Money
Market Fund; 12:30 p.m., Eastern time, for Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund).

In the Investing With Vanguard section under the heading Redeeming"
"820","Shares, the following replaces similar text under Trade Date:

- Note on timing of wire redemptions from money market funds: For telephone
requests received by Vanguard on a business day before 10:45 a.m., Eastern
time (2 p.m., Eastern time, for Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund; 12:30 p.m.,
Eastern time, for Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund), the redemption
proceeds generally will leave Vanguard by the close of business the same day.
For telephone requests received by Vanguard on a business day after those
cut-off times, or on a nonbusiness day, and for all requests other than by
telephone, the redemption proceeds generally will leave Vanguard by the close
of business on the next business day.

In the Investing With Vanguard section under the heading Redeeming"
"821","Shares, the following replaces similar text under Earning Dividends:
You generally will continue earning dividends until the first business day
following your trade date. Generally, there are two exceptions to this rule:
(1) If you redeem shares by writing a check against your account, the shares
will stop earning dividends on the day that your check posts to your account;
and (2) For money market funds, if you redeem shares with a same-day wire
request before 10:45 a.m., Eastern time, on a business day (2 p.m., Eastern
time, for Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund; 12:30 p.m., Eastern time, for
Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund), the shares will stop earning dividends
that same day. In the Investing With Vanguard section under the heading Other"
"822","Redemption Rules You Should Know, the following replaces similar text:

Emergency circumstances. Vanguard funds can postpone payment of
redemption proceeds for up to seven calendar days. In addition, Vanguard funds
can suspend redemptions and/or postpone payments of redemption proceeds
beyond seven calendar days at times when the NYSE is closed or during
emergency circumstances, as determined by the SEC. In connection with a
determination by the board of trustees, in accordance with Rule 22e-3 under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, a money market fund may suspend
redemptions and postpone payment of redemption proceeds in order to
facilitate an orderly liquidation of the fund. In addition, in accordance with
Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the board of trustees of a
retail or institutional money market fund may implement liquidity fees and
redemption gates if a retail or institutional money market fund's weekly
liquid assets fall below established thresholds.

In the Investing With Vanguard section under the heading Investing With"
"823","Vanguard Through Other Firms, the following is added to the end of the
paragraph: Your financial intermediary will be responsible for taking
reasonable actions to assist the retail or institutional money market fund to
impose, lift, or modify liquidity fees or redemption gates.
