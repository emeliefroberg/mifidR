"976","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"977","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Elfun"
"978","International Equity Fund, Elfun Trusts, Elfun Diversified"
"979","Fund, Elfun Tax-Exempt Income Fund, Elfun Income Fund, and"
"980","Elfun Government Money Market Fund:"
"981","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"982","statements of Elfun International Equity Fund, Elfun Trusts,"
"983","Elfun Diversified Fund, Elfun Tax-Exempt Income Fund, Elfun"
"984","Income Fund, and Elfun Government Money Market Fund"
"985","(collectively, the Funds), as of and for the year ended"
"986","December 31, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the"
"987","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"988","considered the Funds internal control over financial"
"989","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"990","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"991","of expressing our opinions on the financial statements and to"
"992","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"993","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"994","Funds internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"995","we express no such opinion."
"996","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"997","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"998","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"999","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"1000","benefits and related costs of controls.  A companys internal"
"1001","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1002","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1003","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1004","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1005","accepted accounting principles.  A companys internal control"
"1006","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1007","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"1008","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1009","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"1010","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1011","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1012","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1013","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"1014","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1015","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"1016","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"1017","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a companys"
"1018","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1019","statements."
"1020","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1021","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1022","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1023","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1024","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"1025","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1026","deteriorate."
"1027","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1028","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1029","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1030","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1031","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1032","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1033","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1034","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1035","companys annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1036","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1037","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"1038","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1039","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"1040","in internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1041","standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"1042","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"1043","deficiencies in the Funds internal control over financial"
"1044","reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"1045","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material"
"1046","weakness as defined above as of December 31, 2016."
"1047","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1048","management and the Board of Trustees of Elfun International"

"1359","   Paragraph 4 above, the Trustees shall have the power to appoint and"
"1360","   discharge from time to time one or more persons or entities to act as"
"1361","   unitholder servicing agent or agents (individually, an Agent and"

"1371","   be twelve, it being understood that such number may hereafter be changed at"
"1372","   any time and from time to time; provided, however, that there shall always"
"1373","   be at least one Trustee. When a quorum is present at a meeting, a majority"
"1374","   of the Units voted shall decide any question and a plurality shall elect a"
"1375","   Trustee, except when a different vote is specifically required by any"
"1376","   provision herein or the Bylaws, if any, or any applicable law. From time to"
"1377","   time, the Trustees may fill vacancies in the Trustees."
"1378","                                      4"
"1379","<PAGE>"
"1380","      Any Trustee may at any time resign as a trustee of the Fund by giving"
"1381","   written notice thereof to the other Trustees. Any Trustee may be removed at"
"1382","   any time as a trustee of the Fund by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of"
"1383","   the Trustees then in office. The Trustees shall hold office until their"
"1384","   resignation, removal, death or the appointment of their successor."
"1385","      The Trustees may appoint from among them a Chairman and one or more Vice"
"1386","   Chairmen. The Chairman and Vice Chairmen shall have such powers and duties"
"1387","   with respect to the calling and conducting of meetings of Trustees as the"
"1388","   Trustees may direct. The Trustees may appoint from time to time a Chief"
"1389","   Executive Officer or President, a Secretary, and Assistant Secretary and"
"1390","   such other Fund officers as they may deem necessary or advisable, and the"
"1391","   Trustees may delegate to these persons, subject to the mandatory"
"1392","   requirements of applicable law, such powers and duties as they deem"
"1393","   appropriate. The Trustees may also adopt from time to time such rules and"
"1394","   regulations for the organization and transaction of the Fund's business as"
"1395","   they deem necessary or advisable."
"1396","      The Trustees may act either by meetings or by written consent. In the"
"1397","   case of meetings, a majority of the Trustees shall constitute a quorum for"
"1398","   the conduct of business, and the vote of a majority of the Trustees present"
"1399","   at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act and deed of the"
"1400","   Trustees. In the case of action by written consent, it shall be sufficient"
"1401","   to bind all the Trustees, and shall be deemed their act and deed, if written"
"1402","   consents are obtained from a majority of the Trustees, provided, however,"
"1403","   that the written consents are filed with the minutes of the Trustees'"
"1404","   meetings and reported at the next meeting of the Trustees. Meetings of the"
"1405","   Trustees may be held either in person or by telephone or other means which"
"1406","   permit the Trustees to confer with one another. The manner, time and place"
"1407","   of holding meetings, the notices thereof, and the length of time required"
"1408","   for such notices shall be determined by the Trustees. Waivers of notice,"
"1409","   either before, at or after a meeting, shall be permitted."
"1410","   9. Compensation and Expenses of Trustees. The Trustees may receive"
"1411","   compensation for the services they perform for the Fund in an amount to be"
"1412","   determined by the Trustees; provided, however, that any change in"
"1413","   compensation previously reported to Unitholders as being paid to the"
"1414","   Trustees shall be reported in the shareholder report next published and"
"1415","   distributed to Unitholders after this change. Compensation of the Trustees"
"1416","   as provided herein, as well as the compensation of any agent, employee or"
"1417","   counsel of the Trustees and the expenses of administering the Fund shall be"
"1418","   paid from the assets of the Fund."
"1419","   10. Fiduciary Duties. Each Trustee shall discharge his duties with respect"
"1420","   to the Fund solely in the interest of the Unitholders and with the care,"
"1421","   skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a"
"1422","   prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters"
"1423","   would use in the conduct of an enterprise of like character and with similar"
"1424","   aims."
"1425","   11. Statements of Account. The Agent will deliver to each Unitholder a"
"1426","   statement of account (the Statement of Account) showing the number of"
"1427","   Units to which they are"
"1428","                                      5"
"1429","<PAGE>"
"1430","   entitled by reason of payments made by them or for their account, including"
"1431","   the reinvestment of income and gains, if any."
"1432","      Units shall be issued to Unitholders in consideration of investments made"
"1433","   in the Fund on the basis of the Units' Net Asset Value, as determined in the"
"1434","   manner provided below in Paragraph 13."
"1435","      Each Unit shall be equal to every other Unit, without preference or"
"1436","   priority of any one Unit over another. Unitholders shall have no voting"
"1437","   rights hereunder except with respect to amendments to this Agreement, as"
"1438","   described in Paragraph 20 below, and as required by applicable law. Each"
"1439","   Unit entitles the holder to one vote. The Units do not confer preemptive,"
"1440","   subscription or conversion rights to Unitholders."
"1441","      The Trustees are authorized and empowered in their discretion, at any"
"1442","   time and from time to time, to authorize Unit splits or reverse splits,"
"1443","   provided, however, that the proportionate interest of each Unitholder shall"
"1444","   not in any way be adversely affected thereby. In the event the number of"
"1445","   Units is increased, the Trustees shall issue to each Unitholder, without"
"1446","   further payment, a Statement of Account showing the additional Units to"
"1447","   which the Unitholder shall be entitled, such additional Units to be in the"
"1448","   same proportion to the number of Units held by the Unitholder prior to such"
"1449","   issuance as the total number of additional Units to be issued is to the"
"1450","   total number of Units outstanding prior to such issuance. In the event that"
"1451","   the number of Units shall be reduced, the Trustees shall issue a Statement"
"1452","   of Account showing such reduction, and the Trustees may do all things"
"1453","   necessary or expedient to make such reduction effective."
"1454","   12. Death of a Unitholder. The death of a Unitholder during the continuance"
"1455","   of the Fund shall not operate to terminate the Fund, nor shall it entitle"
"1456","   the personal representative of any such deceased Unitholder to an accounting"
"1457","   or to take any action in the courts or otherwise against the Fund or the"
"1458","   Trustees; provided, however, the right of redemption provided for in"
"1459","   Paragraph 14 below shall not expire with the death of the Unitholder, but"
"1460","   such right may be exercised by the personal representatives, legatees,"
"1461","   distributees, or beneficiaries in the manner provided in Paragraph 14."
"1462","   13. Valuation of Units. The net asset value (the Net Asset Value) of the"
"1463","   Units shall be determined by the Trustees or their designees each day that"
"1464","   the New York Stock Exchange is open, as of the close of trading on the"
"1465","   Exchange, New York City time, under policies and procedures as may be"
"1466","   approved from time to time by the Trustees. Such value when so determined"
"1467","   shall be taken as the value thereof for all purposes of this Agreement and"
"1468","   shall be binding and final upon the Unitholders, their personal"
"1469","   representatives, heirs, legatees, distributees, and beneficiaries."
"1470","   14. Redemption of Units. Unitholders may redeem Units either in whole or in"
"1471","   part by delivering a redemption form, duly executed and in form satisfactory"
"1472","   to the Trustees, to the Agent or as the Trustees may otherwise direct, or in"
"1473","   such other manner as the Trustees may provide that is consistent with"
"1474","   applicable law. Redemptions shall be made at the Net Asset Value next"
"1475","   computed after such delivery (or other acceptable tender) less such"
"1476","   redemption fee as the Trustees may from time to time prescribe."
"1477","                                      6"
"1478","<PAGE>"
"1479","      The Trustees may suspend a Unitholder's right of redemption or postpone"
"1480","   the date of payment when (a) trading in the markets the Fund normally"
"1481","   utilizes is restricted or an emergency exists as determined by the"
"1482","   Commission so that disposal of the Fund's investments or determination of"
"1483","   its Net Asset Value is not reasonably practicable, or (b) the Commission, by"
"1484","   order, has otherwise provided for or permitted such suspension or"
"1485","   postponement."
"1486","   15. Payment in Cash. Any payment made to Unitholders pursuant to the"
"1487","   provisions of this Agreement shall be made in cash."
"1488","   16. Distributions. The Trustees may in their discretion, to the extent"

"1490","   policies of the Fund, at any time or times distribute income, capital gains"
"1491","   or principal to the Unitholders in such amounts as the Trustees may"
"1492","   determine. Each such distribution shall be made in the proportion which the"

"1494","   issued and outstanding at the time of such distribution."
"1495","   17. Audit. As soon as practicable after the end of each calendar year, the"

"1498","   certified or chartered accountants of recognized standing selected by the"
"1499","   Trustees. A certified copy of each such audit report shall be filed with the"
"1500","   Trustees. Such audit report shall show the Net Asset Value of Units"
"1501","   outstanding as of the 31st day of December of such calendar year and shall"
"1502","   show other matters as the Trustee may require and to the extent consistent"
"1503","   with applicable law."
"1504","   18. Taxes. All taxes that may be required to be paid in respect of the issue"
"1505","   and/or transfer of Units shall be paid by the Unitholders to whom the Units"
"1506","   are issued."
"1507","   19. Termination by Trustees. The Trustees may, in their discretion,"
"1508","   determine to terminate the Fund in whole or in part. In any such case, the"
"1509","   Trustees shall redeem outstanding Units at Net Asset Value, which shall be"
"1510","   determined as of a date fixed by the Trustees and specified in the notice of"
"1511","   termination delivered to Unitholders."
"1512","   20. Amendments. The Trustees shall have power to amend this Trust Agreement,"
"1513","   but no amendment shall be made which shall affect the Unitholders' right of"
"1514","   redemption or other substantial rights of the Unitholders unless and until a"
"1515","   copy of such proposed amendment shall have been submitted by mail to the"
"1516","   Unitholders and either (1) the consent to said amendment shall have been"
"1517","   received from Unitholders holding 70% or more of the number of Units in the"
"1518","   Fund then outstanding or (2) within thirty days after the date of mailing a"
"1519","   copy of such proposed amendment, Unitholders holding 30% or more of the"
"1520","   number of Units in the Fund shall not have delivered to the Trustees written"
"1521","   dissent in respect of such proposed amendment."
"1522","   21. Situs and Choice of Law. The situs of the Fund and the place of its"
"1523","   administration shall be in the State of New York and, after July 1, 2016, in"
"1524","   the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. All questions concerning the validity,"

"1573","   WHEREAS, each Fund is an open-end management investment company organized"
"1574","under the laws of the State of Connecticut and registered under the Investment"

"1587","   Fund on the terms set forth in this Agreement. SSGA FM hereby accepts such"
"1588","   appointment and agrees to render the services herein set forth on the terms"
"1589","   herein contained."
"1590","2. Services to be Performed"
"1591","   a.   SSGA FM will recommend to the Trustees of each Fund (the Trustees)"
"1592","        certain individuals to fill the positions of Manager, Secretary and, if"
"1593","        the Trustees so desire, Assistant Secretary and other officers of the"

"1602","        of all the assets in the Fund from time to time (including any income"
"1603","        earned thereon and increments in the value thereof). Among other"
"1604","        things, SSGA FM shall be responsible for all"

"1611","        time to time and such general guidance, policies and instructions as"
"1612","        the Trustees may additionally establish. SSGA FM shall, in addition,"
"1613","        make recommendations as and when requested by the Trustees with respect"
"1614","        to the adoption or modification of investment policies and each Fund's"
"1615","        objective."
"1616","   c.   Unless a Fund gives written instructions to the contrary, SSGA FM shall"
"1617","        vote or not vote all proxies solicited by or with respect to the"
"1618","        issuers of securities in which assets of the Fund may be invested. SSGA"
"1619","        FM shall use its best good faith judgment to vote or not vote such"
"1620","        proxies in a manner which best serves the interests of a Fund's"
"1621","        shareholders. Each Fund has received and reviewed the proxy guidelines"
"1622","        of SSGA FM, which indicate how SSGA FM will vote."

"1629","        i.   prepare and distribute, or cause the Fund to prepare and"
"1630","             distribute, all reports including reports to the Unitholders which"
"1631","             are required by Federal and state regulatory authorities, as well"
"1632","             as any other reports specifically requested by the Trustees from"

"1637","        iii. cooperate with the independent public accountants retained by the"
"1638","             Trustees in their examination of the Fund and will cooperate in"
"1639","             any inspection of the accounts and records by the Trustees;"
"1640","        iv.  compute, or cause the Fund to compute, the net asset value for the"
"1641","             Fund in accordance with the Fund's organizational documents"
"1642","             (referred to herein as the Trust Agreement) and the Fund's"
"1643","             prospectus and statement of additional information (the"
"1644","             Registration Statement);"
"1645","        v.   prepare, or cause the Fund to prepare, such reports to, and"
"1646","             filings with Federal, state or local governmental authorities,"
"1647","             including tax returns, as may be required by applicable law or as"
"1648","             requested by the Trustees;"
"1649","        vi.  submit periodically to the Trustees, or cause the Fund to submit"
"1650","             periodically to the Trustees, written reports covering fund"
"1651","             transactions, the results of the Fund's operations, the assets and"
"1652","             financial condition of the"
"1653","                                      2"
"1654","<PAGE>"
"1655","             Fund, and such other information in such form and at such times as"
"1656","             the Trustees may reasonably request; and"
"1657","       vii. be responsible for causing the Fund to effect adequate routines to"
"1658","            collect, receive and deposit all income of the Fund and other"
"1659","            payments to the Fund, including stock dividends, rights, warrants"
"1660","            and similar items, but excluding payments associated with"
"1661","            subscriptions and redemptions."
"1662","    e. SSGA FM will keep each Fund informed of developments materially"
"1663","       affecting the Fund, and will, on its own initiative, furnish the Fund"
"1664","       from time to time with whatever information SSGA FM believes is"
"1665","       appropriate for this purpose."
"1666","    f. SSGA FM, in the performance of its duties and obligations under this"
"1667","       Agreement, shall act in conformity with the certain documents relating"
"1668","       to the Funds, as amended and including but not limited to: the Trust"
"1669","       Agreement, the Registration Statement, any exemptive applications,"
"1670","       notices and orders on which a Fund relies at the time, and with any"
"1671","       instructions and directions of the Trustees."
"1672","    g. SSGA FM may from time to time, in its discretion and with the approval"
"1673","       of the Trustees, delegate certain of its investment advisory"
"1674","       responsibilities under this Agreement in respect of any Fund to one or"
"1675","       more qualified companies (each, a sub-adviser), each of which is"
"1676","       registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended,"
"1677","       provided that the separate costs of employing such sub-advisers and of"
"1678","       the sub-advisers themselves are borne by SSGA FM or the sub-adviser and"
"1679","       not by the Fund in question. Unless the Board specifies otherwise in"
"1680","       connection with its approval of any such delegation or unless any"
"1681","       agreement pursuant to which such delegation is effected specifies"
"1682","       otherwise, (i) the obligation of SSGA FM in respect of the activities of"
"1683","       any such sub-adviser shall be to provide to the Trustees its"
"1684","       recommendation as to the selection of the sub-adviser and as to the"
"1685","       periodic renewal of the sub-advisory agreement with the sub-adviser, and"
"1686","       to oversee generally the performance by such sub-adviser of its"
"1687","       obligations to the Fund in question over time (which oversight may"
"1688","       include periodic review of policies and procedures of the sub-adviser"
"1689","       but will not include approval of or responsibility for specific"
"1690","       investment decisions by the sub-adviser) and to report to the Trustees"
"1691","       periodically as to its evaluation of the performance of such sub-adviser"
"1692","       and as to the nature and scope of such general oversight, in accordance"
"1693","       with the standard of care set out in Section 7 below, and (ii) assuming"
"1694","       compliance by SSGA FM with its obligations under clause (i), SSGA FM"
"1695","       shall not be responsible or have any liability for any investment"
"1696","       decision or any other act or omission on the part of any sub-adviser,"
"1697","       including without limitation any error or mistake of judgment on the"
"1698","       part of the sub-adviser or failure by the sub-adviser to comply with any"
"1699","       policies, procedures, guidelines, or objectives of any Fund."

"1701","<PAGE>"
"1702","3. Selection of Investments on Behalf of the Fund"
"1703","   Unless otherwise set forth in the Registration Statement or directed by a"
"1704","   Fund, SSGA FM will, in selecting brokers or dealers to effect transactions"
"1705","   on behalf of a Fund, seek the best overall terms available. In so doing,"
"1706","   SSGA FM may consider the breadth of the market for the investment, the price"
"1707","   of the security, the size and difficulty of the order, the willingness of"
"1708","   the broker or dealer to position, the reliability, financial condition and"
"1709","   execution and operational capabilities of the broker or dealer, and the"
"1710","   reasonableness of the commission or size of the dealer's spread, if any,"
"1711","   for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. SSGA FM may also"
"1712","   consider brokerage and research services provided to the Fund and/or other"
"1713","   accounts over which SSGA FM or its affiliates exercise investment"
"1714","   discretion. The Funds recognize the desirability of SSGA FM's having access"
"1715","   to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic"
"1716","   analyses provided by brokers and that those brokers may execute brokerage"
"1717","   transactions at a higher cost to a Fund than would be the case if the"
"1718","   transactions were executed on the basis of the most favorable price and"
"1719","   efficient execution. To the extent permitted by applicable law and"
"1720","   regulations, SSGA FM shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have"
"1721","   breached any duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of"
"1722","   its having caused a Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage"
"1723","   and research services to SSGA FM an amount of commission for effecting a"
"1724","   portfolio investment transaction in excess of the amount of commission that"
"1725","   another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction,"
"1726","   if SSGA FM determines in good faith that such amount of commission was"
"1727","   reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services"
"1728","   provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular"
"1729","   transaction or SSGA FM's overall responsibilities with respect to the Fund"
"1730","   and to other clients of SSGA FM as to which SSGA FM exercises investment"
"1731","   discretion. Each Fund hereby agrees that any entity or person associated"
"1732","   with SSGA FM which is a member of a national securities exchange is"
"1733","   authorized to effect any transaction on such exchange for the account of the"
"1734","   Fund which is permitted by Section 11(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of"
"1735","   1934, as amended."
"1736","4. Services to Other Companies or Accounts"
"1737","   a. Each Fund understands and acknowledges that SSGA FM now acts and will"
"1738","      continue to act as investment manager or adviser to various fiduciary or"
"1739","      other managed accounts and no Fund has any objection to SSGA FM's so"
"1740","      acting, so long as when a Fund and any account served by SSGA FM are"
"1741","      prepared to invest in, or desire to dispose of, the same security,"
"1742","      available investments or opportunities for sales, as well as the expenses"
"1743","      incurred in such transactions, will be allocated in a manner believed by"
"1744","      SSGA FM to be equitable to the Fund and the account. Each Fund recognizes"
"1745","      that, in some cases, this procedure may adversely affect the price paid"
"1746","      or received by a Fund or the size of the position obtained or disposed of"
"1747","      by a Fund."
"1748","   b. Each Fund understands and acknowledges that the persons employed by SSGA"
"1749","      FM to assist in the performance of its duties under this Agreement will"
"1750","      not devote their full time to that service and agrees that nothing"
"1751","      contained in this Agreement will be deemed to limit or restrict the right"
"1752","      of SSGA FM or any affiliate of SSGA"
"1753","                                      4"
"1754","<PAGE>"
"1755","      FM to engage in and devote time and attention to other businesses or to"
"1756","      render services of whatever kind or nature."
"1757","5. Compensation"
"1758","   In consideration of the services rendered by SSGA FM pursuant to this"
"1759","   Agreement, each Fund will, within thirty (30) days after receipt of an"
"1760","   invoice therefor, pay SSGA FM a monthly fee calculated as a percentage of"
"1761","   the average daily net assets of each Fund during the month in question at"
"1762","   the annual rate set forth on Appendix A. Each Fund shall be responsible for"
"1763","   paying all expenses that it may incur in its operation. The costs to be"
"1764","   borne by each Fund include, but are not limited to: the direct and indirect"
"1765","   costs of SSGA FM personnel providing investment advisory and other services"
"1766","   to the Fund (but no compensation related strictly to their services as"
"1767","   officers and trustees of the Fund); the costs of external accounting, audit,"
"1768","   legal and compliance services; the costs of maintaining the Fund's"
"1769","   existence; the costs attributable to Unitholder services (including without"
"1770","   limitation, telephone and personnel expenses); charges and expenses of any"

"1772","   in connection with the Fund; brokerage fees and expenses; taxes; interest on"
"1773","   borrowings; registration costs of the Fund and its shares under Federal and"
"1774","   state securities laws; the cost and expense of printing, including"
"1775","   typesetting and distributing to regulatory authorities and the Fund's"
"1776","   Unitholders, prospectuses and statements of additional information"
"1777","   describing the Fund and any supplements to those documents; all expenses"
"1778","   incurred in conducting meetings of the Fund's Unitholders and meetings of"
"1779","   the Fund's Board of Trustees relating to the Fund; all expenses incurred in"
"1780","   preparing, printing and mailing proxy statements and reports to Unitholders"
"1781","   of the Fund; all expenses incident to any dividend, withdrawal or redemption"
"1782","   options provided to Fund Unitholders; charges and expenses of any outside"
"1783","   service used for pricing the Fund's portfolio securities and calculating the"
"1784","   net asset value of the Fund's Units; membership dues of industry"
"1785","   associations; postage; insurance premiums on property or personnel"
"1786","   (including Fund officers and Trustees) of the Fund that inure to their"
"1787","   benefit; extraordinary expenses (including, but not limited to, legal claims"
"1788","   and liabilities and litigation costs and any indemnification relating"
"1789","   thereto); and all other costs of the Fund's operations."
"1790","6. Records"
"1791","   SSGA FM shall maintain such books and records with respect to its activities"
"1792","   hereunder as may be required from time to time by applicable law and as the"
"1793","   Trustees may, in addition, reasonably request. SSGA FM shall make available"
"1794","   its books and records to the Trustees and their agents, counsel and"
"1795","   accountants as and when requested by the Trustees for purposes of audit or"
"1796","   otherwise."
"1797","7. Limitation of Liability"
"1798","   a.   SSGA FM will exercise its best judgment in rendering the services"
"1799","        described in this Agreement, except that SSGA FM shall not be liable,"
"1800","        subject to any contrary mandatory requirements of applicable law, for"
"1801","        any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by any"
"1802","        Fund in connection with the matters to"
"1803","                                      5"
"1804","<PAGE>"
"1805","          which this Agreement relates, other than a loss resulting from"
"1806","          willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of"
"1807","          SSGA FM in the performance of its duties under this Agreement or from"
"1808","          SSGA FM's reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this"
"1809","          Agreement."
"1810","     b.   Each Fund and SSGA FM agree that the obligations of such Fund under"
"1811","          this Agreement will not be binding upon any of the Trustees,"
"1812","          shareholders, nominees, officers, employees or agents, whether past,"
"1813","          present or future, of any Fund, individually, but are binding only"
"1814","          upon the assets and property of the Fund in question. The execution"
"1815","          and delivery of this Agreement have been authorized by the Trustees"
"1816","          of the Funds, and signed by an authorized officer of the Funds,"
"1817","          acting as such, and neither the authorization by the Trustees nor the"
"1818","          execution and delivery by the officer will be deemed to have been"
"1819","          made by any of them individually or to impose any liability on any of"
"1820","          them personally, but will bind only the trust property of each Fund."
"1821","8.   Communications"
"1822","     All communications between SSGA FM and the Trustees may be made orally or"
"1823","     in writing and SSGA FM may rely on any such communications with respect to"
"1824","     a Fund if it believes in good faith that the same have been given to it by"
"1825","     a person reasonably believed by SSGA FM to have the authority to act for"
"1826","     or on behalf of the Fund."
"1827","9.   No Third Party Beneficiaries"
"1828","     No person other than the Funds and SSGA FM is a party to this Agreement or"
"1829","     shall be entitled to any right or benefit arising under or in respect of"
"1830","     this Agreement; there are no third party beneficiaries of this Agreement."
"1831","     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing in this"
"1832","     Agreement is intended to, or shall be read to, (i) create in any person"
"1833","     other than the Funds (including without limitation any shareholder in a"
"1834","     Fund) any direct, indirect, derivative, or other rights against SSGA FM,"
"1835","     or (ii) create or give rise to any duty or obligation on the part of SSGA"
"1836","     FM (including without limitation any fiduciary duty) to any person other"
"1837","     than the Funds, all of which rights, benefits, duties, and obligations are"
"1838","     hereby expressly excluded."
"1839","10.  Choice of Law"
"1840","     This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of The"
"1841","     Commonwealth of Massachusetts and any applicable federal law."
"1842","11.  Exclusive Forum"
"1843","     Exclusive jurisdiction over any action, suit, or proceeding under, arising"
"1844","     out of, or relating to this Agreement shall lie in the federal and state"
"1845","     courts within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and each party hereby"
"1846","     waives any objection it may have at any time to the laying of venue of any"
"1847","     such proceedings brought in any such courts, waives any claim that such"
"1848","     proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient"
"1849","                                      6"

"1851","     forum, and further waives the right to object, with respect to such"
"1852","     proceedings, that such court does not have jurisdiction over that party."
"1853","12.  Entire Agreement; Amendments; Severability"
"1854","     This Agreement embodies the entire understanding of the parties hereto"
"1855","     with respect to its subject matter, supersedes any prior or"
"1856","     contemporaneous agreements or understandings between the parties with"
"1857","     respect to such subject matter and may only be modified or amended or the"
"1858","     terms hereof waived by an instrument in writing signed by one person or"
"1859","     entity against whom such amendment, modification or waiver is sought to be"
"1860","     enforced. If, for any reason, any provision of this Agreement is held to"
"1861","     be invalid or unenforceable, the validity and enforceability of the"
"1862","     remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby."
"1863","13.  Continuance and Termination"
"1864","     This Agreement will become effective as of the day and year first above"
"1865","     written and will continue for an initial two-year term and will continue"
"1866","     thereafter with respect to a Fund so long as such continuance is approved"
"1867","     at least annually (a) by the Trustees or (b) by a vote of a majority of"
"1868","     the Fund's outstanding voting securities, as defined in the 1940 Act,"
"1869","     provided that in either event the continuance is also approved by a"
"1870","     majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons (as defined in"
"1871","     the 1940 Act) of any party to this Agreement, by vote cast in person at a"
"1872","     meeting called for the purpose of voting on the approval. This Agreement"
"1873","     may be terminated by either party hereto at any time on not more than"
"1874","     sixty (60) nor less than thirty (30) days' prior notice thereof to the"
"1875","     other party hereto. This Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by"
"1876","     either party hereto to any third party and any such attempted assignment"
"1877","     or transfer shall automatically act to terminate this Agreement. In the"
"1878","     event of expiration or termination of this Agreement, SSGA FM shall"
"1879","     transfer, or cause to be transferred, the assets allocated to SSGA FM, and"
"1880","     such accounting and investment records as the Trustees may request for"
"1881","     continued operation of the Fund, to the person or persons designated by"
"1882","     the Trustees."
