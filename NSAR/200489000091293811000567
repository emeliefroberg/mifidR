"1316","In  planning  and  performing  our  audit  of  the  financial  statements of MFS"
"1317","International New Discovery (the Fund) (one of the portfolios  comprising  MFS"
"1318","Series  Trust  V) as of and for the year ended September 30, 2011, in accordance"
"1319","with the standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1320","States),  we considered the Fund's internal control  over  financial  reporting,"
"1321","including controls  over  safeguarding  securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1322","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing  our  opinion on the financial"
"1323","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,  but  not  for the"
"1324","purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"1325","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1326","The  management of the Fund is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining"
"1327","effective   internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  In  fulfilling  this"
"1328","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1329","expected benefits  and  related  costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"1330","over financial reporting is a process  designed  to provide reasonable assurance"
"1331","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"1332","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1333","accounting  principles.  A company's internal control over  financial  reporting"
"1334","includes those policies and  procedures  that  (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1335","records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and   fairly   reflect  the"
"1336","transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2) provide"
"1337","reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as necessary to permit"
"1338","preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with generally  accepted"
"1339","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures  of  the  company  are"
"1340","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"1341","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1342","detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"1343","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1344","Because of its  inherent  limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1345","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1346","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1347","inadequate because of changes in conditions,  or  that  the degree of compliance"
"1348","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1349","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"1350","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,  in the normal"
"1351","course   of   performing   their   assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"1352","misstatements on a timely basis. A material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or  a"
"1353","combination  of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1354","that there is  a  reasonable  possibility  that  a  material misstatement of the"

"1357","Our consideration of the  Fund's  internal  control over financial reporting was"

"1360","weaknesses  under  standards  established  by  the   Public  Company  Accounting"
"1361","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
