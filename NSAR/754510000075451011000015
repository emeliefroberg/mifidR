"4334","research reports and investment recommendations as the Advisor may reasonably require.  Such information"
"4335","may include written and oral reports and analyses."
"4336","</P>"
"4337","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(b) <I><U>Investment Management</U>:</I>  If and to the extent requested by the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor shall, subject to"
"4338","the supervision of the Advisor, manage all or a portion of the investments of the Portfolio in accordance with"
"4339","the investment objective, policies and limitations provided in the Portfolio's Prospectus or other governing"
"4340","instruments, as amended from time to time, the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &quot;1940 Act&quot;) and rules"
"4341","thereunder, as amended from time to time, and such other limitations as the Trust or Advisor may impose"
"4342","with respect to the Portfolio by notice to the Sub-Advisor.  With respect to the portion of the investments of"
"4343","the Portfolio under its management, the Sub-Advisor is authorized to make investment decisions on behalf of"
"4344","the Portfolio with regard to any stock, bond, other security or investment instrument, and to place orders for"
"4345","the purchase and sale of such securities through such broker-dealers as the Sub-Advisor may select.  The Sub-Advisor may also be authorized, but only to the extent such duties are delegated in writing by the Advisor, to"
"4346","provide additional investment management services to the Portfolio, including but not limited to services"
"4347","such as managing foreign currency investments, purchasing and selling or writing futures and options contracts, borrowing money or lending securities on behalf of the Portfolio.  All investment management and any"

"4358","reasonably request from time to time, or as the Sub-Advisor may deem to be desirable."
"4359","</P>"
"4360","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	3.  <U>Brokerage</U>:  In connection with the services provided under subparagraph (b) of paragraph 1 of this Agreement, the Sub-Advisor shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's account with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Advisor, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the"
"4361","Advisor or Sub-Advisor.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices"
"4362","which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"4363","Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or to the other accounts over which the Sub-Advisor or Advisor exercise"
"4364","investment discretion.  The Sub-Advisor is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and"
"4365","research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess of the"
"4366","amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor"
"4367","determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"4368","research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor has with respect to accounts over which it"
"4369","exercises investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Trust shall periodically review the commissions paid by the"
"4370","Portfolio to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the"

"4378","equal to 110% of the Sub-Advisor's costs incurred in connection with rendering the services referred to in"
"4379","subparagraph (a) of paragraph 1 of this Agreement.  The Sub-Advisory Fee shall not be reduced to reflect"

"4585","Blue Chip Growth Fund and Fidelity Series Small Cap Opportunities Fund"
"4586","(collectively, the Funds), each a fund of Fidelity Securities Fund, as of and"
"4587","for the year ended July 31, 2011, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"4588","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds&rsquo;"
"4589","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"4590","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"4591","expressing our opinions on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"4592","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"4593","the effectiveness of the Funds&rsquo; internal control over financial reporting."
"4594","Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</P>"
"4595","<P>The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"4596","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"4597","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"4598","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund&rsquo;s internal control over"
"4599","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"4600","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"4601","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"4602","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting"

"4617","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"

"4815","<P>To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Fidelity Securities Fund:</P>"
"4816","<P></P>"
"4817","<P>In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements Fidelity"
"4818","Securities Fund: Fidelity Blue Chip Value Fund, Fidelity Dividend Growth Fund,"
"4819","Fidelity Growth &amp; Income Portfolio, Fidelity International Real Estate Fund,"
"4820","Fidelity Leveraged Company Stock Fund, Fidelity Small Cap Growth Fund, and"
"4821","Fidelity Small Cap Value Fund (collectively, the Trust) as of and for the year"
"4822","ended July 31, 2011, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"4823","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust's internal"
"4824","control over financial reporting, including control activities for safeguarding"
"4825","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"4826","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"4827","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"4828","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"4829","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's"
"4830","internal control over financial reporting.</P>"
"4831","<P>The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"4832","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"4833","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"4834","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"4835","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"4836","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"4837","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"4838","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"4839","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"4840","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"4841","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"4842","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"4843","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"4844","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Trust are being"
"4845","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"4846","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"4847","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a Trust's assets"
"4848","that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
"4849","<P>Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"4850","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"4851","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"4852","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"4853","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"

"12974","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises hereinafter set forth, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser agree as follows:"
"12975","</P>"
"12976","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	1.	(a)  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Adviser, direct the investments of all or"
"12977","such portion of the Portfolio's assets as the Adviser shall designate in accordance with the investment objective, policies and limitations as provided in the Portfolio's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as amended from time"
"12978","to time, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and rules thereunder, as amended from time to time (the &acute;&acute;1940 Act&quot;),"

"12980","personnel for servicing the investments of the Portfolio; and shall pay the salaries and fees of all personnel of the"
"12981","Sub-Adviser performing services for the Portfolio relating to research, statistical and investment activities.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with the Portfolio or the Adviser, to buy, sell,"
"12982","lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment instruments on behalf of the Portfolio.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times be subject to the control"

"12987","deem to be desirable.  The Sub-Adviser shall make recommendations to the Fund's Board of Trustees with respect to"
"12988","Portfolio policies, and shall carry out such policies as are adopted by the Trustees.  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to"
"12989","review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other services as the Sub-Adviser shall from time to time determine to"

In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"12997","Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser, Adviser or their affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess"
"12998","of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either"
"12999","that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to"
"13000","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the"
"13001","commissions paid by the Portfolio to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were"

"13022","the Trust or to any shareholder of the Portfolio for any act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering"
