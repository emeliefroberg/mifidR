"1002","Century Growth Opportunities Fund, in"
"1003","accordance with the standards of the"
"1004","Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1005","Board (United States), we considered"
"1006","the Trust's internal controls over"
"1007","financial reporting, including controls"
"1008","over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"1009","for designing our auditing procedures"
"1010","for the purpose of expressing our"
"1011","opinion on the financial statements and"
"1012","to comply with the requirements of"
"1013","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1014","expressing an opinion on the"
"1015","effectiveness of the Trust's internal"
"1016","control over financial reporting."
"1017","Accordingly, we express no such"
"1018","opinion."
"1019","The management of the Trust is"
"1020","responsible for establishing and"
"1021","maintaining effective internal control"
"1022","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1023","responsibility, estimates and judgments"
"1024","by management are required to assess"
"1025","the expected benefits and related costs"
"1026","of controls. A fund's internal control"
"1027","over financial reporting is a process"
"1028","designed to provide reasonable"
"1029","assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1030","financial reporting and the preparation"
"1031","of financial statements for external"
"1032","purposes in accordance with generally"
"1033","accepted accounting principles. A fund's"
"1034","internal control over financial reporting"
"1035","includes those policies and procedures"
"1036","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1037","records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1038","accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1039","transactions and dispositions of the"
"1040","assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1041","reasonable assurance that transactions"
"1042","are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1043","preparation of financial statements in"
"1044","accordance with generally accepted"
"1045","accounting principles, and that receipts"
"1046","and expenditures of the fund are being"
"1047","made only in accordance with"
"1048","authorizations of management and"
"1049","directors of the funds; and (3) provide"
"1050","reasonable assurance regarding"
"1051","prevention or timely detection of"
"1052","unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"1053","disposition of a fund's assets that could"
"1054","have a material effect on the financial"
"1055","statements."
"1056","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"1057","internal control over financial reporting"
"1058","may not prevent or detect"
"1059","misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"1060","evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1061","periods are subject to the risk that"
"1062","controls may become inadequate"
"1063","because of changes in conditions, or that"
"1064","the degree of compliance with the"
"1065","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1066","A deficiency in internal control over"
"1067","financial reporting exists when the"
"1068","design or operation of a control does not"
"1069","allow management or employees, in the"
"1070","normal course of performing their"
"1071","assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1072","misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"1073","material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1074","combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1075","control over financial reporting, such"
"1076","that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"1077","a material misstatement of the fund's"
"1078","annual or interim financial statements"
"1079","will not be prevented or detected on a"
"1080","timely basis."
"1081","Our consideration of the Trust's internal"
"1082","control over financial reporting was for"
"1083","the limited purpose described in the first"
"1084","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"1085","disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"1086","control that might be material"
"1087","weaknesses under standards established"
"1088","by the Public Company Accounting"
"1089","Oversight Board (United States)."
"1090","However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"1091","the Trust's internal controls over"
"1092","financial reporting and its operation,"
"1093","including controls for safeguarding"
"1094","securities that we consider to be a"
"1095","material weakness, as defined above as"
"1096","of October 31, 2011."
