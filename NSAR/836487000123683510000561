"631","      herein have been satisfied as of the Closing Date (as defined below), and"
"632","      based on the representations and warranties each party provides to the"
"633","      others, each Target Entity and the Acquiring Entity agree to take the"
"634","      following steps with respect to their Reorganization(s), the parties to"

"658","            Fund Shares delivered to the Target Fund in exchange for such Assets"
"659","            shall be delivered at net asset value without sales load, commission"

                                       21
<PAGE>

            however, that after receipt of Target Fund shareholder approval, no
            amendment shall be made by the parties hereto which substantially

            as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party
            of any such right, power or privilege, or any single or partial
            exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any further

            Reorganizations at any time prior to the Closing Date:

            1.    by the consent of the Target Entity Board and the Acquiring
                  Entity Board;

            2.    by the Target Fund, if the Acquiring Fund breaches in any
                  material respect any of its representations, warranties,

                  Closing has not occurred on or prior to December 31, 2010
                  (provided that the rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant
                  to this subsection C.(4) shall not be available to any party
                  whose failure to fulfill any of its obligations under this
                  Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of

            5.    by the Acquiring Fund in the event that: (a) all the
                  conditions precedent to the Target Fund's obligation to close,
                  as set forth in Section VII of this Agreement, have been fully
                  satisfied (or can be fully satisfied at the Closing); (b) the
                  Acquiring Fund gives the Target Fund written assurance of its
                  intent to close irrespective of the satisfaction or
                  nonsatisfaction of all conditions precedent to the Acquiring
                  Fund's obligation to close, as set forth in Section VIII of
                  this Agreement; and (c) the Target Fund then fails or refuses

                  December 31, 2010; or

            6.    by the Target Fund in the event that: (a) all the conditions
                  precedent to the Acquiring Fund's obligation to close, as set
                  forth in Section VIII of this Agreement, have been fully
                  satisfied (or can be fully satisfied at the Closing); (b) the
                  Target Fund gives the Acquiring Fund written assurance of its
                  intent to close irrespective of the satisfaction or
                  nonsatisfaction of all the conditions precedent to the Target
                  Fund's obligation to close, as set forth in Section VII of
                  this Agreement; and (c) the Acquiring Fund then fails or
                  refuses to close within the earlier of five (5) business days
                  or December 31, 2010.

X.    REMEDIES.

      In the event of termination of this Agreement by either or both of the
Target Fund and Acquiring Fund pursuant to Section IX.C., written notice thereof
shall forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other party hereto, and
this Agreement shall therefore terminate and become void and have no effect, and
the transactions contemplated herein and thereby shall be abandoned, without
further action by the parties hereto.

XI.   SURVIVAL OF WARRANTIES AND INDEMNIFICATION.

      A.    SURVIVAL. The representations and warranties included or provided
            for herein, or in the schedules or other instruments delivered or to
            be delivered pursuant hereto, shall survive the Closing Date for a
            three (3) year period except that any representation or warranty
            with respect to taxes shall survive for the expiration of the
            statutory period of limitations for assessments of tax deficiencies
            as the same may be extended from time to time by the taxpayer. The
            covenants and agreements included or provided for herein shall
            survive and be continuing obligations in accordance with their
            terms. The period for which a representation, warranty, covenant or
            agreement survives shall be referred to hereinafter as the Survival"
"1448","            Period. Notwithstanding anything set forth in the immediately
            preceding sentence, the right of the Acquiring Fund and the Target
            Fund to seek indemnity pursuant to this Agreement shall survive for
            a period of ninety (90) days beyond the expiration of the Survival
            Period of the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement upon
            which indemnity is sought. In no event shall the Acquiring Fund or
            the Target Fund be obligated to indemnify the other if indemnity is
            not sought within ninety (90) days of the expiration of the
            applicable Survival Period.

      B.    INDEMNIFICATION. Each party (an Indemnitor) shall indemnify and
            hold the other and its directors, trustees, officers, agents and
            persons

                                       23
<PAGE>

            controlled by or controlling any of them (each an Indemnified"
"1449","            Party) harmless from and against any and all losses, damages,
            liabilities, claims, demands, judgments, settlements, deficiencies,
            taxes, assessments, charges, costs and expenses of any nature
            whatsoever (including reasonable attorneys' fees), including amounts
            paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromise or as fines and
            penalties, and counsel fees reasonably incurred by such Indemnified
            Party in connection with the defense or disposition of any claim,
            action, suit or other proceeding, whether civil or criminal, before
            any court or administrative or investigative body in which such
            Indemnified Party may be or may have been involved as a party or
            otherwise or with which such Indemnified Party may be or may have
            been threatened (collectively, the Losses) arising out of or
            related to any claim of a breach of any representation, warranty or
            covenant made herein by the Indemnitor, provided, however, that no
            Indemnified Party shall be indemnified hereunder against any Losses
            arising directly from such Indemnified Party's (i) willful
            misfeasance, (ii) bad faith, (iii) gross negligence or (iv) reckless
            disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such Indemnified
            Party's position.

      C.    INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURE. The Indemnified Party shall use its best
            efforts to minimize any liabilities, damages, deficiencies, claims,
            judgments, assessments, costs and expenses in respect of which
            indemnity may be sought hereunder. The Indemnified Party shall give
            written notice to the Indemnitor within the earlier of ten (10) days
            of receipt of written notice to the Indemnified Party or thirty (30)
            days from discovery by the Indemnified Party of any matters which
            may give rise to a claim for indemnification or reimbursement under
            this Agreement. The failure to give such notice shall not affect the
            right of the Indemnified Party to indemnity hereunder unless such
            failure has materially and adversely affected the rights of the
            Indemnitor; provided that in any event such notice shall have been
            given prior to the expiration of the Survival Period. At any time
            after ten (10) days from the giving of such notice, the Indemnified
            Party may, at its option, resist, settle or otherwise compromise, or
            pay such claim unless it shall have received notice from the
            Indemnitor that the Indemnitor intends, at the Indemnitor's sole
            cost and expense, to assume the defense of any such matter, in which
            case the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at no cost or
            expense to the Indemnitor, to participate in such defense. If the
            Indemnitor does not assume the defense of such matter, and in any
            event until the Indemnitor states in writing that it will assume the
            defense, the Indemnitor shall pay all costs of the Indemnified Party
            arising out of the defense until the defense is assumed; provided,
            however, that the Indemnified Party shall consult with the
            Indemnitor and obtain the Indemnitor's prior written consent to any
            payment or settlement of any such claim. The Indemnitor shall keep
            the Indemnified Party fully apprised at all times as to the

                                       24
<PAGE>

            status of the defense. If the Indemnitor does not assume the
            defense, the Indemnified Party shall keep Indemnitor apprised at all
            times as to the status of the defense. Following indemnification as
            provided for hereunder, the Indemnitor shall be subrogated to all
            rights of the Indemnified Party with respect to all third parties,
            firms or corporations relating to the matter for which
            indemnification has been made.

XII.  SURVIVAL.

      The provisions set forth in Sections X, XI and XVI hereof shall survive
the termination of this Agreement for any cause whatsoever.

XIII. NOTICES.

      All notices hereunder shall be sufficiently given for all purposes
hereunder if in writing and delivered personally or sent by registered mail or
certified mail, postage prepaid. Notice to the Target Entity, with respect to
its corresponding Target Fund shall be addressed to the Target Entity c/o Van
Kampen Asset Management, 522 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10036, Attention:

attention of such other person as the Acquiring Entity may designate by written
notice to the Target Entity. Any notice shall be deemed to have been served or
given as of the date such notice is delivered personally or mailed.

XIV.  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

      This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their successors and assigns. This Agreement shall not be
assigned by any party without the prior written consent of the other party
hereto.

XV.   BOOKS AND RECORDS.

      The Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund agree that copies of the books and
records of the Target Fund relating to the Assets including, but not limited to,
all files, records, written materials (e.g., closing transcripts, surveillance
files and credit reports) shall be delivered by the Target Fund to the Acquiring
Fund on or prior to the Closing Date. In addition to, and without limiting the
foregoing, the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund agree to take such action as
may be necessary in order that the Acquiring Fund shall have reasonable access
to such other books and records as may be reasonably requested, all for three
(3) complete fiscal and tax years after the Closing Date; namely, general
ledgers, journal entries, voucher registers, distribution journals, payroll
registers, monthly balance owing reports, income tax returns, tax depreciation
schedules, and investment tax credit basis schedules.

         Item 77I. Terms of New or Amended Securities
- - Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund, Inc. - Advantage Portfolio

The Board of Directors of Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund, Inc.
(the Board of Directors), at a meeting duly convened and held
on December 9-10, 2009, adopted resolutions which established an
additional portfolio of common stock, consisting of four classes,
designated as Advantage Portfolio - Class I, Advantage Portfolio
- - Class P, Advantage Portfolio - Class H, Advantage Portfolio
- - Class L, and classified 500,000,000 shares of common stock as
shares of Advantage Portfolio - Class I, 500,000,000 shares of
common stock as shares of Advantage Portfolio - Class P,
500,000,000 shares of common stock as shares of Advantage Portfolio
- - Class H, and 500,000,000 shares of common stock as shares of
Advantage Portfolio - Class L.   The terms applicable to the classes
of common stock designated and classified as set forth above,
including any preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers,
restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications and terms
and conditions of redemption, as set by the Board of Directors, are
the same as the terms of the existing classes of common stock which
are set forth in the Articles of Restatement of Morgan Stanley
Institutional Fund, Inc. as amended and supplemented (the Charter).
The shares of the Advantage Portfolio, when issued, are fully paid
and nonassessable, and have no preference as to conversion, exchange,
dividends, retirement or other features. The shares of the Advantage
Portfolio have no pre-emptive rights.  The shares of Morgan Stanley
Institutional Fund, Inc. have non-cumulative voting rights, which
means that the holders of more than 50% of the shares voting for the
election of Directors can elect 100% of the Directors if they choose
to do so.  Shareholders are entitled to one vote for each full share
held (and a fractional vote for each fractional share held), then
standing in their name on the books of Morgan Stanley Institutional
Fund, Inc.  The Advantage Portfolio is not subject to the liabilities
of any other portfolio of Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund, Inc.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund, Inc.

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements
of the Advantage Portfolio of Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund,
Inc. (the Fund) as of and for the year ended August 31, 2010,
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), we considered its internal control
over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding
securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for
the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements
and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's
internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express
no such opinion.

The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.
In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by
management are required to assess the expected benefits and
related costs of controls. A company's internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when
the design or operation of a control does not allow management or
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned
functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's
annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis.

Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph
and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal
control that might be material weaknesses under standards established
by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting and its operation, including controls over
safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness
as defined above as of August 31, 2010.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of
management and the Board of Directors of Morgan Stanley Institutional
Fund, Inc., and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not
intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these
specified parties.
