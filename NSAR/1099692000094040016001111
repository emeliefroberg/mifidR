"797","      Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"798","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"799","Prudential Investment Portfolios 2:"
"800","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"801","statements of Prudential Core Taxable Money Market Fund and"
"802","Prudential Core Short-Term Bond Fund (hereafter referred to as"
"803","the Funds), each a series of Prudential Investment Portfolios"
"804","2, as of and for the year ended January 31, 2016, in accordance"
"805","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"806","Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal control"
"807","over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"808","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"809","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"810","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"811","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"812","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"813","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"814","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"815","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"816","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"817","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"818","related costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"819","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"820","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"821","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"822","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"823","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"824","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"825","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"826","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"827","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"828","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"829","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"830","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"831","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"832","management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide"
"833","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"834","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's"
"835","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"836","statements."
"837","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"838","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"839","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"840","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"841","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"842","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"843","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"844","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"845","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"846","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"847","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"848","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"849","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"850","material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial"
"851","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"852","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"853","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"854","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"855","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"856","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"857","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"858","Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"859","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"860","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"861","January 31, 2016."
"862","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"863","management and the Board of Trustees of the Funds and the"
"864","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"865","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"882","Legal Proceedings"
"883","Legal Proceedings. On October 30, 2015, a lawsuit was filed against"
"884","Prudential Investments LLC (Defendant) in the United States"
"885","District Court for the District of Maryland bearing the caption"
"886","North Valley GI Medical Group, et al. v. Prudential Investments"
"887","LLC, No. 1:15-cv-03268, by North Valley GI Medical Group and"
"888","certain other purported shareholders on behalf of six Prudential"
"889","retail mutual funds: Prudential Jennison Growth Fund, Prudential"
"890","Jennison Mid-Cap Growth Fund, Inc., Prudential Global Real Estate"
"891","Fund, Prudential Jennison Equity Income Fund, Prudential Short-Term"
"892","Corporate Bond Fund, Inc., and Prudential Jennison Natural"
"893","Resources Fund, Inc. (collectively, the Named Funds). None of the"
"894","Named Funds is a party to the lawsuit. Plaintiffs allege that"
"895","Defendant violated Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act of"
"896","1940 (the 1940 Act) by receiving allegedly excessive investment"
"897","advisory fees from each Named Fund and seek, among other things, a"
"898","declaration that Defendant has violated Section 36(b) of the 1940"
"899","Act, rescission of the investment advisory agreements between"
"900","Defendant and the Named Funds, an award of compensatory damages,"
"901","including repayment to each Named Fund of all allegedly excessive"
"902","investment advisory fees paid by such Fund from one year prior to"
"903","the filing of the lawsuit through the date of trial of the action,"
"904","plus purported lost investment returns on those amounts and"
"905","interest thereon, and attorneys' fees and costs. Defendant believes"
"906","the claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend the"
"907","action."
