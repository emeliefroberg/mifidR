"864","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"865","Accounting Firm"
"866","To the Board of Trustees of Vanguard California"
"867","Tax-Free Funds and the Shareholders of"
"868","Vanguard California Tax-Exempt Money Market"
"869","Fund"
"870","Vanguard California Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt"
"871","Fund and"
"872","Vanguard California Long-Term Tax-Exempt Fund"
"873","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"874","statements of Vanguard California Tax-Exempt"
"875","Money Market Fund, Vanguard California"
"876","Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt Fund and Vanguard"
"877","California Long-Term Tax-Exempt Fund (constituting"
"878","Vanguard California Tax-Free Funds, hereafter"
"879","referred to as the ?Trust?) as of and for the year"
"880","ended November 30, 2009, in accordance with the"
"881","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"882","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"883","Trust?s internal control over financial reporting,"
"884","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"885","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"886","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"887","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"888","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"889","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust?s internal"
"890","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"891","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"892","Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"893","The management of the Trust is responsible for"
"894","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"895","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"896","estimates and judgments by management are"
"897","required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"898","costs of controls.  A company?s internal control over"
"899","financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"900","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"901","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"902","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"903","generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"904","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"905","includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"906","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"907","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"908","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"909","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"910","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"911","preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"912","with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"913","that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"914","being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"915","management and trustees of the company; and (3)"
"916","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"917","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"918","or disposition of a company?s assets that could have"
"919","a material effect on the financial statements."
"920","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"921","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"922","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"923","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"924","risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"925","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"926","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"927","deteriorate."
"928","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"929","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"930","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"931","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"932","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"933","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"934","a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"935","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"936","possibility that a material misstatement of the Trust's"
"937","annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"938","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"939","Our consideration of the Trust?s internal control over"
"940","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"941","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"942","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"943","control over financial reporting that might be material"
"944","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"945","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"946","States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"947","Trust?s internal control over financial reporting and its"
"948","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"949","securities that we consider to be material"
"950","weaknesses as defined above as of November 30,"
"951","2009."
"952","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"953","use of management and the Board of Trustees of"
"954","Vanguard California Tax-Free Funds and the"
"955","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"956","intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
"957","other than these specified parties."

"1075","[For index funds that do not concentrate.] The Fund will not concentrate its"
"1076","investments in the securities of issuers whose principal business activities are"
"1077","in the same industry, except as may be necessary to approximate the composition"
"1078","of its target index."

"1080","concentrate its investments in the securities of issuers whose principal"

"1086","Portfolio, and Market Liquidity Fund.] The Fund will concentrate its assets in"
"1087","the securities of issuers whose principal business activities are in the"

"1089","services industry is deemed to include the group of industries within the"

"1100","Act or other governing statute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other"
"1101","regulatory agency with authority over the Fund."
"1102","Real Estate. The Fund may not invest directly in real estate unless it is"
"1103","acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments. This"
"1104","restriction shall not prevent the Fund from investing in securities or other"
"1105","instruments (1) issued by companies that invest, deal, or otherwise engage in"
"1106","transactions in real estate, or (2) backed or secured by real estate or"
"1107","interests in real estate."
