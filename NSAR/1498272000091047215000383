"456","Report of Independent"
"457","Registered Public"
"458","Accounting Firm"
"459","To the Board of Trustees of"
"460","Equinox Funds Trust"
"461","and the Shareholders of"
"462","Equinox Chesapeake"
"463","Strategy Fund"
"464","In planning and performing"
"465","our audit of the"
"466","consolidated financial"
"467","statements of Equinox"
"468","Chesapeake Strategy Fund"
"469","(the Fund), a separate"
"470","series of the Equinox"
"471","Funds Trust, as of and for"
"472","the year ended September"
"473","30, 2014 (on which we"
"474","have issued our report"
"475","dated December 1, 2014"
"476","(June 16, 2015 as to the"
"477","effect of the restatement"
"478","discussed in Note 7), in"
"479","accordance with the"
"480","standards of the Public"
"481","Company Accounting"
"482","Oversight Board (United"
"483","States), we considered the"
"484","Fund's internal control over"
"485","financial reporting,"
"486","including controls over"
"487","safeguarding securities, as"
"488","a basis for designing our"
"489","auditing procedures for the"
"490","purpose of expressing our"
"491","opinion on the consolidated"
"492","financial statements and to"
"493","comply with the"
"494","requirements of Form N-"
"495","SAR, but not for the"
"496","purpose of expressing an"
"497","opinion on the"
"498","effectiveness of the Fund's"
"499","internal control over"
"500","financial reporting."
"501","Accordingly, we express no"
"502","such opinion."
"503","The management of the"
"504","Fund is responsible for"
"505","establishing and"
"506","maintaining effective"
"507","internal control over"
"508","financial reporting. In"
"509","fulfilling this responsibility,"
"510","estimates and judgments"
"511","by management are"
"512","required to assess the"
"513","expected benefits and"
"514","related costs of controls. A"
"515","fund's internal control over"
"516","financial reporting is a"
"517","process designed to"
"518","provide reasonable"
"519","assurance regarding the"
"520","reliability of financial"
"521","reporting and the"
"522","preparation of financial"
"523","statements for external"
"524","purposes in accordance"
"525","with generally accepted"
"526","accounting principles"
"527","(GAAP). A fund's internal"
"528","control over financial"
"529","reporting includes those"
"530","policies and procedures"
"531","that (a) pertain to the"
"532","maintenance of records"
"533","that, in reasonable detail,"
"534","accurately and fairly reflect"
"535","the transactions and"
"536","dispositions of the assets"
"537","of the fund; (b) provide"
"538","reasonable assurance that"
"539","transactions are recorded"
"540","as necessary to permit"
"541","preparation of financial"
"542","statements in accordance"
"543","with GAAP, and that"
"544","receipts and expenditures"
"545","of the fund are being made"
"546","only in accordance with"
"547","authorizations of"
"548","management and trustees"
"549","of the fund; and (c) provide"
"550","reasonable assurance"
"551","regarding prevention or"
"552","timely detection of"
"553","unauthorized acquisition,"
"554","use or disposition of a"
"555","fund's assets that could"
"556","have a material effect on"
"557","the financial statements."
"558","Because of inherent"
"559","limitations, internal control"
"560","over financial reporting"
"561","may not prevent or detect"
"562","misstatements. Also,"
"563","projections of effectiveness"
"564","to future periods are"
"565","subject to the risk that"
"566","controls may become"
"567","inadequate because of"
"568","changes in conditions, or"
"569","that the degree of"
"570","compliance with the"
"571","policies or procedures may"
"572","deteriorate."
"573","A deficiency in internal"
"574","control over financial"
"575","reporting exists when the"
"576","design or operation of a"
"577","control does not allow"
"578","management or"
"579","employees, in the normal"
"580","course of performing their"
"581","assigned functions, to"
"582","prevent or detect"
"583","misstatements on a timely"
"584","basis. A material weakness"
"585","is a deficiency, or"
"586","combination of"
"587","deficiencies, in internal"
"588","control over financial"
"589","reporting, such that there is"
"590","a reasonable possibility"
"591","that a material"
"592","misstatement of the Fund's"
"593","annual or interim financial"
"594","statements will not be"
"595","prevented or detected on a"
"596","timely basis."
"597","Our consideration of the"
"598","Fund's internal control over"
"599","financial reporting was for"
"600","the limited purpose"
"601","described in the first"
"602","paragraph and would not"
"603","necessarily identify all"
"604","deficiencies in internal"
"605","control that might be"
"606","material weaknesses under"
"607","standards established by"
"608","the Public Company"
"609","Accounting Oversight"
"610","Board (United States). In"
"611","our letter to you dated"
"612","December 1, 2014, we"
"613","reported that we had"
"614","identified no deficiencies in"
"615","the Fund's internal controls"
"616","over financial reporting and"
"617","their operations, including"
"618","controls for safeguarding"
"619","securities that we"
"620","considered to be a material"
"621","weakness, as defined"
"622","above, as of September"
"623","30, 2014.  However,"
"624","subsequent to the issuance"
"625","of our letter, we noted the"
"626","following control deficiency"
"627","in the Fund's internal"
"628","control over financial"
"629","reporting and their"
"630","operations that we"
"631","considered to be a material"
"632","weakness as of September"
"633","30, 2014."
"634","Management's controls"
"635","related to the review and"
"636","analysis of fair value of the"
"637","Fund's investment in the"
"638","total return swap with"
"639","Deutsche Bank AG,"
"640","London Branch in"
"641","accordance with Financial"
"642","Accounting Standards"
"643","Board Accounting"
"644","Standards Codification"
"645","820, Fair Value"
"646","Measurements.  As a result"
"647","of this material weakness,"
"648","the Fund's Consolidated"
"649","Statement of Assets and"
"650","Liabilities, including the"
"651","Consolidated Portfolio of"
"652","Investments as of"
"653","September 30, 2014, the"
"654","related statement of"
"655","operations, the statement"
"656","of changes in net assets"
"657","and financial highlights for"
"658","the year then ended were"
"659","restated to appropriately"
"660","account for the fair value of"
"661","the total return swap.  This"
"662","material weakness was"
"663","considered in determining"
"664","the nature, timing, and"
"665","extent of the audit tests"
"666","applied in our audit of the"
"667","Fund's consolidated"
"668","financial statements (as"
"669","restated) as of and for the"
"670","year ended September 30,"
"671","2014, and this report does"
"672","not affect our report on"
"673","such consolidated financial"
"674","statements."
"675","This report is intended"
"676","solely for the information"
"677","and use of management"
"678","and the Board of Trustees"
"679","of the Funds and the"
"680","Securities and Exchange"
"681","Commission and is not"
"682","intended to be and should"
"683","not be used by anyone"
