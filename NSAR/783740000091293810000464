"563","           Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"564","To the Board of Trustees of MFS Series Trust X and"
"565","Shareholders of MFS Emerging Markets Debt Fund"
"566","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of MFS"
"567","Emerging Markets Debt Fund (the Fund)(one of the portfolios comprising  MFS"
"568","Series Trust X) as of and for the year ended July 31, 2010, in accordance"
"569","with the  standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"570","(United States), we considered the Funds internal control over financial"
"571","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"572","designing  our auditing  procedures for the purpose of  expressing  our"
"573","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the  requirements of"
"574","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing  an opinion on the"
"575","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"576","Accordingly, we express no such opinion. The management of the Fund is"
"577","responsible for establishing and maintaining  effective  internal control over"
"578","financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"579","judgments by management are required to assess the expected  benefits and"
"580","related costs of controls. A companys internal control over financial"
"581","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance  regarding"
"582","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"583","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"584","accounting  principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting"
"585","includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of"
"586","records that, in reasonable  detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"587","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"588","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"589","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"590","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"591","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"592","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"593","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a companys"
"594","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"595","Because of its  inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"596","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"597","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"598","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"599","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"600","A deficiency in internal control over financial  reporting  exists when the"
"601","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"602","the normal course of performing their assigned  functions, to prevent or"
"603","detect  misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"604","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"605","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material  misstatement of"
"606","the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented"
"607","or detected on a timely basis."
"608","Our consideration  of the Funds  internal  control  over  financial  reporting"
"609","was for the limited  purpose  described  in the first paragraph and would not"
"610","necessarily  disclose all  deficiencies in internal  control that might be"
"611","material  weaknesses under standards established  by the Public  Company"
"612","Accounting  Oversight  Board (United  States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"613","in the Funds internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"614","including controls over safeguarding  securities that we consider to be a"
"615","material weakness as defined above as of July 31, 2010."
"616","This  report is intended  solely for the  information  and use of  management"
"617","and the Board of Trustees of MFS Series  Trust X and the Securities and Exchange"
"618","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"619","these specified parties."
