"767","reserve the right to terminate or limit the"
"768","exchange privilege of any shareholder"
"769","deemed to be engaging in market timing"
"770","or other inappropriate trading activity as"
"771","defined in the Funds' prospectuses as from"

"775","any time upon 60 days' notice to"
"776","shareholders."
"777","Allocation of Income and Expenses"
"778","Each class of shares pays the expenses"
"779","associated with its different distribution and"
"780","shareholder servicing arrangements"
"781","(Account Expenses).  Each class of shares"
"782","may, at the Trustees' discretion, also pay a"
"783","different share of other expenses (together"
"784","with 12b-1 fees and Account Expenses,"
"785","Class Expenses), not including advisory"
"786","fees or other expenses related to the"
"787","management of a Trust's assets, if these"
"788","expenses are actually incurred in a different"
"789","amount by that class, or if the class receives"
"790","services of a different kind or to a different"
"791","degree than other classes."
"792","The gross income of each Fund generally"
"793","shall be allocated to each class on the basis"
"794","of net assets.  To the extent practicable,"
"795","certain expenses (other than Class Expenses"
"796","as defined above, which shall be allocated"
"797","more specifically) shall be subtracted from"
"798","gross income on the basis of the net assets of"
"799","each class of each Fund.  These expenses"
"800","include:"
"801","*	Expenses incurred by a Trust"
"802","(including, but not limited to, fees of"
"803","Trustees, insurance and legal"
"804","counsel) not attributable to a"
"805","particular Fund or to a particular"
"806","class of shares of a Fund (Trust
Level Expenses); and"
"807","*	Expenses incurred by a Fund not"
"808","attributable to any particular class of"
"809","the Fund's shares (for example,"
"810","advisory fees, custodial fees or other"
"811","expenses relating to the management"
"812","of the Fund's assets) (Fund
Expenses)."
"813","Expenses of a Fund shall be apportioned to"
"814","each class of shares depending upon the"
"815","nature of the expense item.  Trust Level"
"816","Expenses and Fund Expenses shall be"
"817","allocated among the classes of shares based"
"818","on their relative net assets in relation to the"
"819","net assets of the relevant Trust.  Approved"
"820","Class Expenses shall be allocated to the"
"821","particular class to which they are"
"822","attributable.  However, if a Class Expense"
"823","can no longer be attributed to a class, it will"
"824","be charged to a Fund for allocation among"
"825","classes in proportion to the net assets of each"
"826","such class.  Any additional Class Expenses"
"827","not specifically identified above that are"
"828","subsequently identified and determined to be"
"829","properly allocated to one class of shares"
"830","shall not be so allocated until approved by"
"831","the Board of Trustees of the Trust in light of"
"832","the requirements of the 1940 Act and the"
"833","Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended."
"834","Each Trust reserves the right to utilize any"
"835","other appropriate method to allocate income"
"836","and expenses among the classes, including"
"837","those specified in Rule 18f-3(c)(1), provided"
"838","that a majority of the Trustees and a"
"839","majority of the independent Trustees"
"840","determine that the method is fair to the"

"921","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"922","Accounting Firm"
"923","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Natixis"
"924","Funds I:"
"925","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"926","statements of Loomis Sayles Core Plus Bond"
"927","Fund, a series of Natixis Funds Trust I (the Fund) as"
"928","of and for the year ended September 30, 2017, in"
"929","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"930","Accounting Oversight Board (United States),, we"
"931","considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"932","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"933","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"934","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"935","on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"936","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"937","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"938","Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"939","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"940","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"941","financial reporting."
"942","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"943","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"944","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"945","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"946","management are required to assess the expected"
"947","benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's"
"948","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"949","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"950","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"951","preparation of financial statements for external"
"952","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"953","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over"
"954","financial reporting includes those policies and"
"955","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"956","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"957","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"958","of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"959","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"960","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"961","generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"962","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made"
"963","only in accordance with authorizations of"
"964","management and trustees of the funds; and (3)"
"965","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"966","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"967","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a"
"968","material effect on the financial statements."
"969","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"970","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"971","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"972","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"973","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"974","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"975","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"976","deteriorate."
"977","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"978","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"979","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"980","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"981","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"982","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"983","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"984","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"985","possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's"
"986","annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"987","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"988","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"989","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"990","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"991","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"992","over financial reporting that might be material"
"993","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"994","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"995","States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"996","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"997","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"998","securities that we consider to be material weaknesses"
"999","as defined above as of September 30, 2017."
