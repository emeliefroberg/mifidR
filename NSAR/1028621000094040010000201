"2135","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"2136","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of the"
"2137","Metropolitan West Funds:"
"2138","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"2139","statements of the Metropolitan West Funds (the Trust)"
"2140","comprising the Ultra Short Bond Fund, the Low Duration Bond"
"2141","Fund, the Intermediate Bond Fund, the Total Return Bond"
"2142","Fund, the High Yield Bond Fund, the Strategic Income Fund,"
"2143","and the AlphaTrak 500 Fund (collectively, the Funds) as"
"2144","of and for the year ended March 31, 2010, in accordance"
"2145","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"2146","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"2147","internal control over financial reporting, including"
"2148","control activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"2149","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2150","expressing our opinions on the financial statements and to"
"2151","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"2152","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"2153","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"2154","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2155","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"2156","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"2157","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"2158","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"2159","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"2160","company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"2161","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"2162","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"2163","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"2164","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"2165","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"2166","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"2167","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"2168","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"2169","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"2170","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2171","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"2172","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"2173","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"2174","accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"2175","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"2176","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"2177","acquisition, use, or disposition of a company's assets that"
"2178","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2179","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2180","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2181","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2182","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"2183","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2184","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"2185","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2186","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"2187","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"2188","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"2189","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2190","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"2191","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2192","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"2193","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2194","company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"2195","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2196","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"2197","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"2198","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"2199","all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"2200","significant deficiencies or material weaknesses under"
"2201","standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"2202","Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"2203","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2204","reporting and its operation, including controls for"
"2205","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material"
"2206","weakness, as defined above, as of March 31, 2010."
"2207","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"2208","of management and the Board of Trustees of the Funds and"
"2209","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"2210","to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"2211","specified parties."

"2424","                   Investment Management Agreement"
"2425","            THIS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (this"
"2426","Agreement) is made as of the 31st day of March, 2010, by and"
"2427","between Metropolitan West Funds, a Delaware statutory trust"
"2428","(hereinafter called the Trust), on behalf of each series of"
"2429","the Trust listed in Appendix A hereto, as may be amended from"
"2430","time to time (hereinafter referred to individually as a Fund"
"2431","and collectively as the Funds) and Metropolitan West Asset"
"2432","Management, LLC, a California limited liability company"
"2433","(hereinafter called the Manager)."
"2434","                                WITNESSETH:"
"2435","            WHEREAS, the Trust is an open-end management"
"2436","investment company, registered as such under the Investment"
"2437","Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act); and"
"2438","            WHEREAS, the Manager is registered as an investment"
"2439","adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended,"
"2440","and is engaged in the business of supplying investment advice,"
"2441","investment management and administrative services, as an"
"2442","independent contractor; and"
"2443","            WHEREAS, the Trust desires to retain the Manager to"
"2444","render advice and services to the Funds pursuant to the terms"
"2445","and provisions of this Agreement, and the Manager is interested"
"2446","in furnishing said advice and services; and"
"2447","            WHEREAS, this Agreement replaces a prior investment"
"2448","management agreement that terminated because of a change of"
"2449","control of the Manager;"
"2450","            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and"
"2451","the mutual promises hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto,"
"2452","intending to be legally bound hereby, mutually agree as follows:"
"2453","            1.   Appointment of Manager.  The Trust hereby employs"
"2454","the Manager and the Manager hereby accepts such employment, to"
"2455","render investment advice and management services with respect to"
"2456","the assets of the Funds for the period and on the terms set"
"2457","forth in this Agreement, subject to the supervision and"
"2458","direction of the Trust's Board of Trustees."
"2459","            2.   Duties of Manager."
"2460","                  (a)   General Duties.  The Manager shall act as"
"2461","investment manager to the Funds and shall supervise investments"
"2462","of the Funds on behalf of the Funds in accordance with the"
"2463","investment objectives, programs and restrictions of the Funds as"
"2464","provided in the Trust's governing documents, including, without"
"2465","limitation, the Trust's Agreement and Declaration of Trust and"
"2466","By-Laws, or otherwise and such other limitations as the Trustees"
"2467","may impose from time to time in writing to the Manager.  Without"
"2468","limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Manager shall:"
"2469","(i) furnish the Funds with advice and recommendations with"
"2470","respect to the investment of each Fund's assets and the purchase"
"2471","and sale of portfolio securities for the Funds, including the"
"2472","taking of such other steps as may be necessary to implement such"
"2473","advice and recommendations; (ii) furnish the Funds with reports,"
"2474","statements and other data on securities, economic conditions and"
"2475","other pertinent subjects which the Trust's Board of Trustees may"
"2476","reasonably request; (iii) manage the investments of the Funds,"
"2477","subject to the ultimate supervision and direction of the Trust's"
"2478","Board of Trustees; (iv) provide persons satisfactory to the"
"2479","Trust's Board of Trustees to act as officers and employees of"
"2480","the Trust and the Funds (such officers and employees, as well as"
"2481","certain trustees, may be trustees, directors, officers,"
"2482","partners, or employees of the Manager or its affiliates) but not"
"2483","including personnel to provide limited administrative services"
"2484","to the Fund not typically provided by the Fund's administrator"
"2485","under separate agreement; and (v) render to the Trust's Board of"
"2486","Trustees such periodic and special reports with respect to each"
"2487","Fund's investment activities as the Board may reasonably"
"2488","request."
"2489","                  (b)   Brokerage.  The Manager shall place orders"
"2490","for the purchase and sale of securities either directly with the"
"2491","issuer or with a broker or dealer selected by the Manager.  In"
"2492","placing each Fund's securities trades, it is recognized that the"
"2493","Manager will give primary consideration to securing the most"
"2494","favorable price and efficient execution, so that each Fund's"
"2495","total cost or proceeds in each transaction will be the most"
"2496","favorable under all the circumstances.  Within the framework of"
"2497","this policy, the Manager may consider the financial"
"2498","responsibility, research and investment information, and other"
"2499","services provided by brokers or dealers who may effect or be a"
"2500","party to any such transaction or other transactions to which"
"2501","other clients of the Manager may be a party."
"2502","            It is also understood that it is desirable for the"
"2503","Funds that the Manager have access to investment and market"
"2504","research and securities and economic analyses provided by"
"2505","brokers and others.  It is also understood that brokers"
"2506","providing such services may execute brokerage transactions at a"
"2507","higher cost to the Funds than might result from the allocation"
"2508","of brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most"
"2509","favorable price and efficient execution.  Therefore, the"
"2510","purchase and sale of securities for the Funds may be made with"
"2511","brokers who provide such research and analysis, subject to"
"2512","review by the Trust's Board of Trustees from time to time with"
"2513","respect to the extent and continuation of this practice to"
"2514","determine whether each Fund benefits, directly or indirectly,"
"2515","from such practice.  It is understood by both parties that the"
"2516","Manager may select broker-dealers for the execution of the"
"2517","Funds' portfolio transactions who provide research and analysis"
"2518","as the Manager may lawfully and appropriately use in its"
"2519","investment management and advisory capacities, whether or not"
"2520","such research and analysis may also be useful to the Manager in"
"2521","connection with its services to other clients."
"2522","            On occasions when the Manager deems the purchase or"
"2523","sale of a security to be in the best interest of one or more of"
"2524","the Funds as well as of other clients, the Manager, to the"
"2525","extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, may"
"2526","aggregate the securities to be so purchased or sold in order to"
"2527","obtain the most favorable price or lower brokerage commissions"
"2528","and the most efficient execution.  In such event, allocation of"
"2529","the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the expenses"
"2530","incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Manager in the"
"2531","manner it considers to be the most equitable and consistent with"
"2532","its fiduciary obligations to the Funds and to such other"
"2533","clients."
"2534","                  (c)   Administrative Services.  The Manager shall"
"2535","oversee the administration of the Funds' business and affairs"
"2536","although the provision of administrative services, to the extent"
"2537","not covered by subparagraphs (a) or (b) above, is not the"
"2538","obligation of the Manager under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding"
"2539","any other provisions of this Agreement, the Manager shall be"
"2540","entitled to reimbursement from the Funds for all or a portion of"
"2541","the reasonable costs and expenses, including salary, associated"
"2542","with the provision by Manager of personnel to render"
"2543","administrative services to the Funds."
"2544","            3.   Best Efforts and Judgment.  The Manager shall use"
"2545","its best judgment and efforts in rendering the advice and"
"2546","services to the Funds as contemplated by this Agreement."
"2547","            4.   Independent Contractor.  The Manager shall, for"
"2548","all purposes herein, be deemed to be an independent contractor,"
"2549","and shall, unless otherwise expressly provided and authorized to"
"2550","do so, have no authority to act for or represent the Trust or"
"2551","the Funds in any way, or in any way be deemed an agent for the"
"2552","Trust or for the Funds.  It is expressly understood and agreed"
"2553","that the services to be rendered by the Manager to the Funds"
"2554","under the provisions of this Agreement are not to be deemed"
"2555","exclusive, and the Manager shall be free to render similar or"
"2556","different services to others so long as its ability to render"
"2557","the services provided for in this Agreement shall not be"
"2558","impaired thereby."
"2559","            5.   Manager's Personnel.  The Manager shall, at its"
"2560","own expense, maintain such staff and employ or retain such"
"2561","personnel and consult with such other persons as it shall from"
"2562","time to time determine to be necessary to the performance of its"
"2563","obligations under this Agreement.  Without limiting the"
"2564","generality of the foregoing, the staff and personnel of the"
"2565","Manager shall be deemed to include persons employed or retained"
"2566","by the Manager to furnish statistical information, research, and"
"2567","other factual information, advice regarding economic factors and"
"2568","trends, information with respect to technical and scientific"
"2569","developments, and such other information, advice and assistance"
"2570","as the Manager or the Trust's Board of Trustees may desire and"
"2571","reasonably request."
"2572","            6.   Reports by Funds to Manager.  Each Fund will from"
"2573","time to time furnish to the Manager detailed statements of its"
"2574","investments and assets, and information as to its investment"
"2575","objective and needs, and will make available to the Manager such"
"2576","financial reports, proxy statements, legal and other information"
"2577","relating to each Fund's investments as may be in its possession"
"2578","or available to it, together with such other information as the"
"2579","Manager may reasonably request."
"2580","            7.   Expenses."
"2581","                  (a)   With respect to the operation of each Fund,"
"2582","and to the extent not paid or reimbursed through a plan adopted"
"2583","by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, the Manager is"
"2584","responsible for (i) the compensation of any of the Trust's"
"2585","trustees, officers, and employees who are affiliates of the"

"2587","services in connection with expenses which are the Fund's"

"2590","of additional information, and sales and advertising materials"

"2593","shareholders), and (iii) providing office space and equipment"
"2594","reasonably necessary for the operation of the Funds."
"2595","                  (b)   Each Fund is responsible for and has assumed"
"2596","the obligation for payment of all of its expenses, other than as"
"2597","stated in Subparagraph 7(a) above, including but not limited to:"
"2598","fees and expenses incurred in connection with the issuance,"
"2599","registration and transfer of its shares; brokerage and"
"2600","commission expenses; all expenses of transfer, receipt,"

"2609","Board of Trustees that are properly payable by the Fund;"

"2614","property or personnel of each Fund which inure to its benefit,"
"2615","including liability and fidelity bond insurance; the cost of"

"2626","any; and all other charges and costs of its operation plus any"
"2627","extraordinary and non-recurring expenses, except as herein"
"2628","otherwise prescribed."
"2629","                  (c)   To the extent the Manager incurs any costs"
"2630","by assuming expenses which are an obligation of a Fund as set"
"2631","forth herein, such Fund shall promptly reimburse the Manager for"
"2632","such costs and expenses, except to the extent the Manager has"
"2633","otherwise agreed to bear such expenses.  To the extent the"
"2634","services for which a Fund is obligated to pay are performed by"
"2635","the Manager, the Manager shall be entitled to recover from such"
"2636","Fund to the extent of the Manager's actual costs for providing"
"2637","such services."
"2638","            8.   Investment Advisory and Management Fee."
"2639","                  (a)   Each Fund shall pay to the Manager, and the"
"2640","Manager agrees to accept, as full compensation for all"
"2641","administrative and investment management and advisory services"
"2642","furnished or provided to such Fund pursuant to this Agreement, a"
"2643","management fee at the annual rate set forth in the Fee Schedule"
"2644","attached hereto as Appendix A, as may be amended in writing from"
"2645","time to time by the Trust and the Manager."
"2646","                  (b)   The management fee shall be accrued daily by"
"2647","each Fund and paid to the Manager on the first business day of"
"2648","the succeeding month."
"2649","                  (c)   The initial fee under this Agreement shall"
"2650","be payable on the first business day of the first month"
"2651","following the effective date of this Agreement and shall be"
"2652","prorated as set forth below.  If this Agreement is terminated"
"2653","before the end of any month, the fee to the Manager shall be"
"2654","prorated for the portion of any month in which this Agreement is"
"2655","in effect which is not a complete month according to the"
"2656","proportion which the number of calendar days in the month during"
"2657","which the Agreement is in effect bears to the number of calendar"
"2658","days in the month, and shall be payable within ten (10) days"
"2659","after the date of termination."
"2660","                  (d)   The Manager may reduce any portion of the"
"2661","compensation or reimbursement of expenses due to it pursuant to"
"2662","this Agreement and may agree to make payments to limit the"
"2663","expenses which are the responsibility of a Fund under this"
"2664","Agreement.  Any such reduction or payment shall be applicable"
"2665","only to such specific reduction or payment and shall not"
"2666","constitute an agreement to reduce any future compensation or"
"2667","reimbursement due to the Manager hereunder or to continue future"
"2668","payments.  Any such reduction will be agreed to prior to accrual"
"2669","of the related expense or fee and will be estimated daily and"
"2670","reconciled and paid on a monthly basis.  Any fee withheld"
"2671","pursuant to this paragraph from the Manager shall be reimbursed"
"2672","by the appropriate Fund to the Manager in the first, second or"
"2673","third (or any combination thereof) fiscal year next succeeding"
"2674","the fiscal year of the reduction to the extent approved by the"
"2675","Trust's disinterested Trustees.  The Manager may not request or"
"2676","receive reimbursement for prior reductions or reimbursements"
"2677","before payment of a Fund's operating expenses for the current"
"2678","year and cannot cause a Fund to exceed any more restrictive"
"2679","limitation to which the Manager has agreed in making such"
"2680","reimbursement."
"2681","                  (e)   The Manager may agree not to require payment"
"2682","of any portion of the compensation or reimbursement of expenses"
"2683","otherwise due to it pursuant to this Agreement prior to the time"
"2684","such compensation or reimbursement has accrued as a liability of"
"2685","the Fund.  Any such agreement shall be applicable only with"
"2686","respect to the specific items covered thereby and shall not"
"2687","constitute an agreement not to require payment of any future"
"2688","compensation or reimbursement due to the Manager hereunder."
"2689","            9.   Fund Share Activities of Manager's Officers and"
"2690","Employees.  The Manager agrees that neither it nor any of its"
"2691","officers or employees shall take any short position in the"
"2692","shares of the Funds.  This prohibition shall not prevent the"
"2693","purchase of such shares by any of the officers or bona fide"
"2694","employees of the Manager or any trust, pension, profit-sharing"
"2695","or other benefit plan for such persons or affiliates thereof, at"
"2696","a price not less than the net asset value thereof at the time of"
"2697","purchase, as allowed pursuant to rules promulgated under the"
"2698","1940 Act."
"2699","            10.   Conflicts with Trust's Governing Documents and"
"2700","Applicable Laws.  Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to"
"2701","require the Trust or the Funds to take any action contrary to"
"2702","the Trust's Agreement and Declaration of Trust, By-Laws, or any"
"2703","applicable statute or regulation, or to relieve or deprive the"
"2704","Board of Trustees of the Trust of its responsibility for and"
"2705","control of the conduct of the affairs of the Trust and Funds."
"2706","            11.   Manager's Liabilities."
"2707","                  (a)   In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad"
"2708","faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the"
"2709","obligations or duties hereunder on the part of the Manager, the"
"2710","Manager shall not be subject to liability to the Trust or the"
"2711","Funds or to any shareholder of the Funds for any act or omission"
"2712","in the course of, or connected with, rendering services"
"2713","hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the"
"2714","purchase, holding or sale of any security by the Funds."
"2715","                  (b)   The Funds shall indemnify and hold harmless"
"2716","the Manager and the partners, members, officers and employees of"
"2717","the Manager and its general partner (any such person, an"
"2718","Indemnified Party) against any loss, liability, claim, damage"
"2719","or expense (including the reasonable cost of investigating and"
"2720","defending any alleged loss, liability, claim, damage or expenses"
"2721","and reasonable counsel fees incurred in connection therewith)"
"2722","arising out of the Indemnified Party's performance or non-"
"2723","performance of any duties under this Agreement provided,"
"2724","however, that nothing herein shall be deemed to protect any"
"2725","Indemnified Party against any liability to which such"
"2726","Indemnified Party would otherwise be subject by reason of"
"2727","willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the"
"2728","performance of duties hereunder or by reason of reckless"
"2729","disregard of obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"2730","                  (c)   No provision of this Agreement shall be"
"2731","construed to protect any Trustee or officer of the Trust, or"
"2732","officer of the Manager (or its managers), from liability in"
"2733","violation of Sections 17(h) and (i) of the 1940 Act."
"2734","            12.   Non-Exclusivity.  The Trust's employment of the"
"2735","Manager is not an exclusive arrangement, and the Trust may from"
"2736","time to time employ other individuals or entities to furnish it"
"2737","with the services provided for herein.  The Manager also may be"
"2738","retained by other advisory clients for the same or similar"
"2739","strategies employed by the Trust.  If this Agreement is"
"2740","terminated with respect to any Fund, this Agreement shall remain"
"2741","in full force and effect with respect to all other Funds listed"
