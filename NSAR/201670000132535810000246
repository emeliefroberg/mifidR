"498","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"499","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"500","Delaware Group State Tax-Free Income Trust"
"501","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Delaware Group State Tax-"
"502","Free Income Trust  (the Trust)  as of and for the year ended February 28, 2010,  in accordance"
"503","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"504","considered the Trust's internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"505","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"506","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"507","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's"
"508","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"509","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"510","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"511","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"512","company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"513","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"514","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"515","company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"516","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"517","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"518","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"519","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"520","the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"521","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"522","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"523","material effect on the financial statements."
"524","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"525","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"526","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"527","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"528","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"529","control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"530","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is"
"531","a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"532","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or"
"533","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"534","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting was for the limited"
"535","purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"536","internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"537","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"538","the Trust's internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"539","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"540","February 28, 2010."
"541","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the Board of"
"542","Trustees of Delaware Group State Tax-Free Income Trust and the Securities and Exchange"
"543","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"544","specified parties."

"564","Due to independence matters under the Securities and Exchange Commission's auditor"
"565","independence rules relating to the January 4, 2010 acquisition of Delaware Investments"
"566","(including Delaware Management Company, Delaware Distributors, L.P. and Delaware"
"567","Service Company, Inc.) by Macquarie Group, Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y) has resigned"
"568","as the independent registered public accounting firm for Delaware Group State Tax-Free"
"569","Income Trust (the Fund) effective April 28, 2010.  At a meeting held on February 18,"
"570","2010, the Board of Trustees of the Fund, upon recommendation of the Audit Committee,"
"571","selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC (PwC) to serve as the independent registered"
"572","public accounting firm for the Fund for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2011.  During"
"573","the fiscal years ended February 28, 2010 and February 28, 2009, E&Y's audit reports on"
"574","the financial statements of the Fund did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of"
"575","opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting"
"576","principles.  In addition, there were no disagreements between the Fund and E&Y on"
"577","accounting principles, financial statements disclosures or audit scope, which, if not"
"578","resolved to the satisfaction of E&Y, would have caused them to make reference to the"
"579","disagreement in their reports.  Neither the Fund nor anyone on its behalf has consulted"
"580","with PwC at any time prior to their selection with respect to the application of accounting"
"581","principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed or the type of audit"
"582","opinion that might be rendered on the Fund's financial statements."

"632","OF"
"633","DELAWARE GROUP STATE TAX-FREE INCOME TRUST"
"634","         The undersigned Trustees of Delaware Group State Tax-Free Income Trust, a"
"635","Delaware statutory trust (the Trust), constituting a majority of the Board of Trustees of the"
"636","Trust, do hereby certify that pursuant to the authority granted to the Trustees in Article VIII,"
"637","Section 5 of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust of the Trust made as of December 17, 1998,"
"638","as amended to date (the Declaration of Trust), the Declaration of Trust is hereby amended as"
"639","follows:"
"640","	FIRST.	ARTICLE III, Section 6(b) is amended by replacing the first paragraph"
"641","with the following:"
"642","	(b) Liabilities Held with Respect to a Particular Series.  The assets of the Trust held with"
"643","respect to each particular Series shall be charged against the liabilities of the Trust held with"
"644","respect to that Series and all expenses, costs, charges, and reserves attributable to that Series, and"
"645","any liabilities, expenses, costs, charges and reserves of the Trust which are not readily"
"646","identifiable as being held with respect to any particular Series (collectively, General
Liabilities) shall be allocated and charged by the Board of Trustees to and among any one or"
"647","more of the Series in such manner and on such basis as the Board of Trustees in its sole"
"648","discretion deems fair and equitable.  The liabilities, expenses, costs, charges and reserves so"
"649","charged to a Series are herein referred to as liabilities held with respect to that Series.  Each"
"650","allocation of liabilities, expenses, costs, charges and reserves by the Board of Trustees shall be"
"651","conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders of all Series for all purposes.  All Persons who"
"652","have extended credit which has been allocated to a particular Series, or who have a claim or"
"653","contract which has been allocated to any particular Series, shall look exclusively to the assets of"
"654","that particular Series for payment of such credit, claim, or contract.  In the absence of an express"
"655","contractual agreement so limiting the claims of such creditors, claimants and contract providers,"
"656","each creditor, claimant and contract provider will be deemed nevertheless to have impliedly"
"657","agreed to such limitation unless an express provision to the contrary has been incorporated in the"
"658","written contract or other document establishing the claimant relationship."
"659","	SECOND.	This Certificate of Amendment may be signed in one or more"
"660","counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute"
"661","one and the same instrument."
"662","         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Trustees have duly executed this"
