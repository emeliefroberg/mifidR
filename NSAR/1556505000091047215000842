"608","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT"
"609","REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"610","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"611","To the Shareholders of Spectrum"
"612","Low Volatility Fund and"
"613","Spectrum Advisors Preferred"
"614","Fund"
"615","and Board of Trustees of"
"616","Advisors Preferred Trust"
"617","In planning and performing our"
"618","audit of the financial statements"
"619","of Spectrum Low Volatility Fund"
"620","and Spectrum Advisors Preferred"
"621","Fund (the Funds), each a series"
"622","of Advisors Preferred Trust, as of"
"623","and for the year or period ended"
"624","September 30, 2015, in"
"625","accordance with the standards of"
"626","the Public Company Accounting"
"627","Oversight Board (United States),"
"628","we considered the Funds' internal"
"629","control over financial reporting,"
"630","including controls over"
"631","safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"632","for designing our auditing"
"633","procedures for the purpose of"
"634","expressing our opinion on the"
"635","financial statements and to"
"636","comply with the requirements of"
"637","Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"638","purpose of expressing an opinion"
"639","on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"640","internal control over financial"
"641","reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"642","express no such opinion."
"643","The management of the Funds is"
"644","responsible for establishing and"
"645","maintaining effective internal"
"646","control over financial reporting."
"647","In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"648","estimates and judgments by"
"649","management are required to"
"650","assess the expected benefits and"
"651","related costs of controls.  A"
"652","fund's internal control over"
"653","financial reporting is a process"
"654","designed to provide reasonable"
"655","assurance regarding the reliability"
"656","of financial reporting and the"
"657","preparation of financial"
"658","statements for external purposes"
"659","in accordance with generally"
"660","accepted accounting principles"
"661","(GAAP).  A fund's internal"
"662","control over financial reporting"
"663","includes those policies and"
"664","procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"665","maintenance of records that, in"
"666","reasonable detail, accurately and"
"667","fairly reflect the transactions and"
"668","dispositions of the assets of the"
"669","fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"670","assurance that transactions are"
"671","recorded as necessary to permit"
"672","preparation of financial"
"673","statements in accordance with"
"674","GAAP, and that receipts and"
"675","expenditures of the fund are"
"676","being made only in accordance"
"677","with authorizations of"
"678","management and trustees of the"
"679","fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"680","assurance regarding prevention or"
"681","timely detection of unauthorized"
"682","acquisition, use or disposition of"
"683","a fund's assets that could have a"
"684","material effect on the financial"
"685","statements."
"686","Because of its inherent"
"687","limitations, internal control over"
"688","financial reporting may not"
"689","prevent or detect misstatements."
"690","Also, projections of any"
"691","evaluation of effectiveness to"
"692","future periods are subject to the"
"693","risk that controls may become"
"694","inadequate because of changes in"
"695","conditions, or that the degree of"
"696","compliance with the policies or"
"697","procedures may deteriorate."
"698","A deficiency in internal control"
"699","over financial reporting exists"
"700","when the design or operation of a"
"701","control does not allow"
"702","management or employees, in the"
"703","normal course of performing their"
"704","assigned functions, to prevent or"
"705","detect misstatements on a timely"
"706","basis.  A material weakness is a"
"707","deficiency, or combination of"
"708","deficiencies, in internal control"
"709","over financial reporting, such that"
"710","there is a reasonable possibility"
"711","that a material misstatement of"
"712","the Funds' annual or interim"
"713","financial statements will not be"
"714","prevented or detected on a timely"
"715","basis."
"716","Our consideration of the Funds'"
"717","internal control over financial"
"718","reporting was for the limited"
"719","purpose described in the first"
"720","paragraph and would not"
"721","necessarily disclose all"
"722","deficiencies in internal control"
"723","that might be material"
"724","weaknesses under standards"
"725","established by the Public"
"726","Company Accounting Oversight"
"727","Board (United States).  However,"
"728","we noted no deficiencies in the"
"729","Funds' internal control over"
"730","financial reporting and its"
"731","operation, including controls over"
"732","safeguarding securities, that we"
"733","consider to be a material"
"734","weakness as defined above as of"
"735","September 30, 2015."
"736","This report is intended solely for"
"737","the information and use of"
"738","management and the Board of"
"739","Trustees of the Funds and the"
"740","Securities and Exchange"
"741","Commission and is not intended"
"742","to be and should not be used by"
"743","anyone other than these specified"
