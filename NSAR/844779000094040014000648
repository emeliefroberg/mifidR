"582","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"583","To the Shareholders of BlackRock Multi-Manager Alternative"
"584","Strategies Fund and the Board of Trustees of BlackRock Funds:"
"585","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"586","of BlackRock Multi-Manager Alternative Strategies Fund (the"
"587","Fund), a series of BlackRock Funds, as of and for the period"
"588","ended August 31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the"
"589","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"590","considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"591","including control over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"592","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"593","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"594","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"595","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"596","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"597","express no such opinion."
"598","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"599","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"600","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"601","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"602","related costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"603","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"604","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"605","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"606","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"607","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"608","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"609","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"610","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"611","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"612","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"613","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"614","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"615","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"616","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"617","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"618","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a company's"
"619","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"620","statements."
"621","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"622","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"623","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"624","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"625","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"626","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"627","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"628","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"629","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"630","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"631","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"632","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"633","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"634","material misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"635","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"636","timely basis."
"637","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"638","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"639","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"640","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"641","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"642","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"643","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"644","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, that"
"645","we consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as of"
"646","August 31, 2014."
"647","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"648","management of BlackRock Multi-Manager Alternative Strategies"
"649","Fund, and the Board of Trustees of BlackRock Funds, and the"
"650","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"651","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1157","holding company, the Adviser will not provide"
"1158","instruction to the Sub-Adviser on how to vote securities"
"1159","of any U.S. bank holding company (as that term is"

"1163","by or with respect to the issuers of securities in which"
"1164","the assets of the Managed Portion may be invested in"
"1165","accordance with the Sub-Adviser's proxy voting policies"

"1195","Board and the officers of the Trust and in compliance"
"1196","with (i) except as set forth in the Investment"

"1221","the Sub-Adviser shall have a commercially reasonable"
"1222","amount of time to comply with any amendment to such"
"1223","Adviser Procedures. The Sub-Adviser shall maintain"
"1224","compliance procedures and operational processes relating"
"1225","to its services to the Fund that are reasonably designed"
"1226","to ensure the Fund's compliance with this Section 2(e)"
"1227","and that the Sub-Adviser reasonably believes are"
"1228","adequate to ensure its compliance with applicable law."
"1229","No supervisory activity undertaken by the Adviser shall"

"1231","the foregoing."
"1232","(f) The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not consult with"
"1233","any other sub-investment adviser for the Fund or the"
"1234","Trust or any other fund under common control with the"
"1235","Trust, concerning transactions for the Managed Portion"
"1236","in securities or other assets, except that such"
"1237","consultations are permitted between the current and"
"1238","successor sub-investment advisers of the Fund in order"
"1239","to effect an orderly transition of sub-advisory duties"
"1240","so long as such consultations are not transactions"

"1247","Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934
Act), and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder, and on behalf of"
"1248","the Fund, the Adviser hereby consents to the retention"
"1249","of compensation for such transactions in accordance with"
"1250","Rule 11a2-2(T)(a)(2)(iv). Notwithstanding the foregoing,"
"1251","the Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not deal with"
"1252","itself, or with members of the Board or any principal"
"1253","underwriter of the Fund, as principals or agents in"
"1254","making purchases or sales of securities or other"
"1255","property for the account of the Fund, nor will the Sub-"

"1258","is participating, or arrange for purchases and sales of"
"1259","securities between the Fund and another account advised"
"1260","by the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates, except in each"
"1261","case as permitted by the 1940 Act and the rules and"
"1262","regulations thereunder, and in accordance with such"
"1263","policies and procedures as may be adopted by the Fund"
"1264","from time to time and disclosed to the Sub-Adviser, and"
"1265","will comply with all other provisions of the Governing"
"1266","Documents and the Fund's then-current Registration"
"1267","Statement relative to the Sub-Adviser and its directors,"
"1268","officers and employees."
"1269","3.	Fund Transactions."
"1270","(a)	In connection with purchases and sales of"
"1271","portfolio securities and other instruments for the"
"1272","account of the Fund, neither the Sub-Adviser nor its"
"1273","affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) or"
"1274","any of their respective partners, officers or"
"1275","employees shall act as principal, except as otherwise"
"1276","permitted by the 1940 Act and the rules and"
"1277","regulations thereunder. The Sub-Adviser or its agents"
"1278","shall arrange for the placing of orders for the"
"1279","purchase and sale of portfolio securities and other"
"1280","financial instruments for the Fund's account either"
"1281","directly with the issuer or with any Counterparty,"
"1282","provided that the Sub-Adviser complies with Section"
"1283","2(b) with respect to each such Counterparty."
"1284","(b) In the selection of such brokers or dealers and the"
"1285","placing of such orders, and subject to its duty to"
"1286","obtain best execution of securities transactions for the"
"1287","Managed Portion (which duty does not require the Sub-"
"1288","Adviser to obtain the lowest possible commission cost),"
"1289","the Sub-Adviser is directed at all times to seek to"
"1290","obtain for the Managed Portion the most favorable"
"1291","execution and net price available under the"
"1292","circumstances. It is also understood that it may be"
"1293","desirable for the Managed Portion that the Sub-Adviser"
"1294","have access to supplemental investment and market"
"1295","research and security and economic analyses that are"
"1296","consistent with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act, and are"
"1297","provided by brokers who may execute brokerage"
"1298","transactions at a higher cost to the Managed Portion"
"1299","than may result when allocating brokerage to other"
"1300","brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price"
"1301","and efficient execution. Therefore, subject to"
"1302","compliance with the safe harbor provided by Section"
"1303","28(e) of the 1934 Act and such other conditions and"
"1304","limitations as may be established by the Adviser from"
"1305","time to time, if any, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to"
"1306","consider such services provided to the Managed Portion"
"1307","and other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or any of"
"1308","its affiliates exercises investment discretion and to"
"1309","place orders for the purchase and sale of securities for"
"1310","the Managed Portion with such brokers, if the Sub-"
"1311","Adviser determines in good faith that the amount of"
"1312","commissions for executing such portfolio transactions is"
"1313","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"1314","research services provided by such brokers. It is"
"1315","understood that the services provided by such brokers"
"1316","may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with its"
"1317","services to other clients. The Sub-Adviser may, on"
"1318","occasions when it deems the purchase or sale of a"
"1319","security to be in the best interests of the Managed"
"1320","Portion as well as its other clients, aggregate, to the"
"1321","extent permitted by applicable laws, rules and"
"1322","regulations, the securities to be sold or purchased in"
"1323","order to obtain the best net price and the most"
"1324","favorable execution. In such event, allocation of the"
"1325","securities so purchased or sold, as well as the expenses"
"1326","incurred in the transaction, shall be made by the Sub-"
"1327","Adviser in the manner it considers to be the most"
"1328","equitable and consistent with its obligations to the"
"1329","Managed Portion and to such other clients. The Board may"
"1330","from time to time adopt policies and procedures that"
"1331","modify and/or restrict the Sub-Adviser's authority"
"1332","regarding the execution of the Managed Portion's"
"1333","portfolio transactions provided herein."
"1334","(c) The Sub-Adviser shall not acquire on behalf of the"
"1335","Managed Portion any equity securities registered under"
"1336","Section 12 of the 1934 Act with the purpose or effect,"
"1337","at the time of such acquisition, of changing or"
"1338","influencing control of the issuer of the securities or"
"1339","in connection with or as a participant in any"
"1340","transaction having such purpose or effect, including any"
"1341","transaction subject to Rule 13d-3(b) promulgated under"
"1342","the 1934 Act.  For purposes of all applicable filing"
"1343","requirements under the 1934 Act, including without"
"1344","limitation Sections 13(d) and (g) and other laws, the"
"1345","Sub-Adviser shall be deemed to have sole investment"
"1346","discretion with respect to all securities held in the"
"1347","Managed Portion.  If any investments made by the Sub-"
"1348","Adviser on behalf of the Managed Portion are required to"
"1349","be disclosed in any other reports naming the Fund or the"
"1350","Adviser to be filed by the Sub-Adviser with any"
"1351","governmental or self-regulatory agency or organization"
"1352","or exchange, the Sub-Adviser shall provide the Adviser"
"1353","with prompt written notice thereof, setting forth in"
"1354","reasonable detail the nature of the report and the"
"1355","investments of the Managed Portion to be reported."
"1356","(d) The Fund may establish one or more wholly-owned"
"1357","subsidiaries of the Fund through which it may conduct a"
"1358","significant portion of its commodities investing"
"1359","activities or for other investment purposes."
"1360","4. Compensation of the Sub-Adviser."
"1361","(a) For the services provided and the expenses assumed"
"1362","by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, the"
"1363","Adviser, not the Fund, shall pay to the Sub-Adviser a"
"1364","fee, computed daily and payable monthly, in arrears, at"

"1369","hereto as Exhibit A."
"1370","(b) If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates"

"1374","the case may be, shall be pro-rated according to the"
"1375","proportion that such period bears to the full month in"
"1376","which such effectiveness or termination occurs."
"1377","5. Expenses. The Sub-Adviser agrees, at its own expense, to"
"1378","render the services set forth herein and to provide the"

"2372","Adviser will perform certain of the day-to-day operations of the"
"2373","Portfolio which may include one or more of the following"
"2374","services:  (i) act as investment advisor for and manage the"
"2375","investment and reinvestment of those assets of the Portfolio as"
"2376","Adviser may from time to time request and in connection"
"2377","therewith have complete discretion in purchasing and selling"
"2378","such securities and other assets for the Portfolio and in"
"2379","voting, exercising consents and exercising all other rights"
"2380","appertaining to such securities and other assets on behalf of"
"2381","the Portfolio; (ii) provide investment research and credit"
"2382","analysis concerning the Portfolio's fixed-income investments;"
"2383","(iii) assist in determining what portion of the Portfolio's"

"2388","and records as are required to support Fund operations (in"
"2389","conjunction with record-keeping and accounting functions"
"2390","performed by Adviser).  At the request of Adviser, Sub-Adviser"
"2391","will also, subject to the oversight and supervision of Adviser"
"2392","and the Fund's Board of Trustees, provide to Adviser or the Fund"
"2393","any of the facilities and equipment and perform any of the"
"2394","services described in Section 4 of the Advisory Agreement.  In"
"2395","addition, Sub-Adviser will keep the Fund and Adviser informed of"
"2396","developments materially affecting the Portfolio and shall, on"
"2397","its own initiative, furnish to the Fund from time to time"
"2398","whatever information Sub-Adviser believes appropriate for this"
"2399","purpose.  Sub-Adviser will periodically communicate to Adviser,"
"2400","at such times as Adviser may direct, information concerning the"
"2401","purchase and sale of securities for the Portfolio, including (i)"
"2402","the name of the issuer, (ii) the amount of the purchase or sale,"
"2403","(iii) the name of the broker or dealer, if any, through which"
"2404","the purchase or sale will be effected, (iv) the CUSIP number of"
"2405","the instrument, if any, and (v) such other information as"
"2406","Adviser may reasonably require for purposes of fulfilling its"
"2407","obligations to the Fund under the Advisory Agreement.  Sub-"
"2408","Adviser will provide the services rendered by it under this"
"2409","Agreement in accordance with the Portfolio's investment"
"2410","objective, policies and restrictions as stated in the"
"2411","Portfolio's prospectus and statement of additional information"
"2412","(as currently in effect and as they may be amended or"
"2413","supplemented from time to time), and the resolutions of the"
"2414","Fund's Board of Trustees."
"2415","            III.	Other Sub-Adviser Covenants.  Sub-Adviser further"
"2416","agrees that it:"
"2417","                  A.	In the performance of its duties under this"
"2418","Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall at all times conform to, and"
"2419","act in accordance with, any requirements imposed by:  (i) the"
"2420","provisions of the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act of"
"2421","1940, as amended (the Advisers Act) and all applicable Rules"
"2422","and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the"
"2423","SEC); (ii) any other applicable provision of law; (iii) the"
"2424","provisions of the Declaration of Trust and Amended and Restated"
"2425","Code of Regulations of the Fund, as such documents are amended"
"2426","from time to time; (iv) the investment objectives and policies"
"2427","of the Portfolio as set forth in the Portfolio's Registration"
"2428","Statement on Form N-1A and/or the resolutions of the Board of"
"2429","Trustees; and (v) any policies and determinations of the Board"
"2430","of Trustees of the Trust; and"
"2431","                  B.	will place orders either directly with the"
"2432","issuer or with any broker or dealer.  Subject to the other"
"2433","provisions of this paragraph, in placing orders with brokers and"
"2434","dealers, Sub-Adviser will attempt to obtain the best price and"
"2435","the most favorable execution of orders.  In placing orders, Sub-"
"2436","Adviser will consider the experience and skill of the firm's"
"2437","securities traders as well as the firm's financial"
"2438","responsibility and administrative efficiency.  Consistent with"
"2439","this obligation, Sub-Adviser may, subject to the approval of the"
"2440","Fund's Board of Trustees, select brokers on the basis of the"
"2441","research, statistical and pricing services they provide to the"
"2442","Portfolio and other clients of Adviser or Sub-Adviser."
"2443","Information and research received from such brokers will be in"
"2444","addition to, and not in lieu of, the services required to be"
"2445","performed by Sub-Adviser hereunder.  A commission paid to such"
"2446","brokers may be higher than that which another qualified broker"
"2447","would have charged for effecting the same transaction, provided"
"2448","that Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission"
"2449","is reasonable in terms of either the transaction or the overall"
"2450","responsibility of Adviser and Sub-Adviser to the Portfolio and"
"2451","their other clients and that the total commissions paid by the"
"2452","Portfolio will be reasonable in relation to the benefits to the"
"2453","Portfolio over the long-term.  In no instance, however, will the"
"2454","Portfolio's securities be purchased from or sold to Adviser,"
"2455","Sub-Adviser, the Fund's distributor or any affiliated person"
"2456","thereof, except to the extent permitted by the SEC or by"
"2457","applicable law.  It is understood that Sub-Adviser may utilize"
"2458","affiliates in connection with the placement of orders with"
"2459","issuers and brokers or dealers, but such use of affiliates shall"
"2460","not affect the responsibility of Sub-Adviser to Adviser for such"
"2461","activities.  Subject to the foregoing and the provisions of the"
"2462","1940 Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and"
"2463","other applicable provisions of law, Sub-Adviser may select"
"2464","brokers and dealers with which it or the Fund is affiliated;"
"2465","                  C.	will maintain or cause Adviser to maintain"
"2466","books and records with respect to the Portfolio's securities"
"2467","transactions and will furnish Adviser and the Fund's Board of"
"2468","Trustees such periodic and special reports as they may request;"
"2469","                  D.	will maintain a policy and practice of"
"2470","conducting its investment advisory services hereunder"
"2471","independently of the commercial banking operations of its"
"2472","affiliates.  When Sub-Adviser makes investment recommendations"
"2473","for the Portfolio, its investment advisory personnel will not"
"2474","inquire or take into consideration whether the issuer of"
"2475","securities proposed for purchase or sale for the Portfolio's"
"2476","account are customers of the commercial departments of its"
"2477","affiliates.  In dealing with commercial customers of its"
"2478","affiliates, Sub-Adviser will not inquire or take into"
"2479","consideration whether securities of those customers are held by"
"2480","the Fund; and"
"2481","                  E.	will treat confidentially and as proprietary"
"2482","information of the Fund all records and other information"
"2483","relative to the Fund, any of the Portfolio's and the Fund's"
"2484","prior, current or potential shareholders, and will not use such"
"2485","records and information for any purpose other than performance"
"2486","of its responsibilities and duties hereunder, except after prior"
"2487","notification to and approval in writing by the Fund, which"
"2488","approval shall not be unreasonably withheld and may not be"
"2489","withheld where Sub-Adviser may be exposed to civil or criminal"
"2490","contempt proceedings for failure to comply, when requested to"
"2491","divulge such information by duly constituted authorities, or"
"2492","when so requested by the Fund."
"2493","            IV.	Services Not Exclusive.  Nothing in this"
"2494","Agreement shall prevent the Sub-Adviser or any officer, employee"
"2495","or other affiliate thereof from acting as investment advisor for"
"2496","any other person, firm or corporation, or from engaging in any"
"2497","other lawful activity, and shall not in any way limit or"
"2498","restrict the Sub-Adviser or any of its officers, employees or"
"2499","agents from buying, selling or trading any securities for its or"
"2500","their own accounts or for the accounts of others for whom it or"
"2501","they may be acting; provided, however, that the Sub-Adviser will"
"2502","undertake no activities which, in its judgment, will adversely"
"2503","affect the performance of its obligations under this Agreement."
"2504","            V.	Books and Records.  In compliance with the"
"2505","requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, Sub-Adviser"
"2506","hereby agrees that all records which it maintains for the"
"2507","Portfolio are the property of the Fund and further agrees to"
"2508","surrender promptly to the Fund any such records upon the Fund's"
"2509","request.  Sub-Adviser further agrees to preserve for the periods"
"2510","prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the records required"
"2511","to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act (to the extent"
"2512","such books and records are not maintained by Adviser)."
"2513","            VI.	Expenses.  During the term of this Agreement,"
"2514","Sub-Adviser will bear all costs and expenses of its employees"
"2515","and any overhead incurred by Sub-Adviser in connection with its"
"2516","duties hereunder; provided that the Board of Trustees of the"
"2517","Fund may approve reimbursement to Sub-Adviser of the pro rata"
"2518","portion of the salaries, bonuses, health insurance, retirement"
"2519","benefits and all similar employment costs for the time spent on"
"2520","Portfolio operations (including, without limitation, compliance"
"2521","matters) (other than the provision of investment advice and"
"2522","administrative services required to be provided hereunder) of"
"2523","all personnel employed by Sub-Adviser who devote substantial"
"2524","time to Portfolio operations or the operations of other"
"2525","investment companies advised or sub-advised by Sub-Adviser."
"2526","            VII.	Compensation."
"2527","                  A.	Adviser agrees to pay to Sub-Adviser and"
"2528","Sub-Adviser agrees to accept as full compensation for all"
"2529","services rendered by Sub-Adviser as such a fee, computed daily"
"2530","and payable monthly, at the annual rate set forth on Schedule A"
"2531","attached hereto.  For any period less than a month during which"
"2532","this Agreement is in effect, the fee shall be prorated according"
"2533","to the proportion which such period bears to a full month of 28,"
"2534","29, 30 or 31 days, as the case may be."
"2535","                  B.	For purposes of this Agreement, the net"
"2536","assets of the Portfolio shall be calculated pursuant to the"
"2537","procedures adopted by resolutions of the Fund's Board of"
"2538","Trustees for calculating the value of the Fund's assets or"
"2539","delegating such calculations to third parties."
"2540","                  C.	If Adviser waives any or all of its advisory"
"2541","fee payable under the Advisory Agreement, or reimburses the Fund"
"2542","pursuant to Section 8(b) of that Agreement, with respect to the"
"2543","Portfolio, Sub-Adviser will bear its share of the amount of such"
"2544","waiver or reimbursement by waiving fees otherwise payable to it"
"2545","hereunder on a proportionate basis to be determined by comparing"
"2546","the aggregate fees that would otherwise be paid to it hereunder"
"2547","with respect to the Portfolio to the aggregate fees that would"
"2548","otherwise be paid by the Fund to Adviser under the Advisory"
"2549","Agreement with respect to the Portfolio.  Adviser shall inform"
"2550","Sub-Adviser prior to waiving any advisory fees."
"2551","            VIII.	Limitation of Liability.  Sub-Adviser shall"
"2552","not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for"
"2553","any loss suffered by Adviser or by the Fund or the Portfolio in"
"2554","connection with the performance of this Agreement, except a loss"
"2555","resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the"
"2556","receipt of compensation for services or a loss resulting from"
"2557","willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part"
"2558","in the performance of its duties or from reckless disregard by"
"2559","it of its obligations or duties under this Agreement.  As used"
"2560","in this Section 8, the term Sub-Adviser shall include any"
"2561","affiliates of the Sub-Adviser performing services for the"
"2562","Portfolio contemplated hereby and partners, directors, officers"
"2563","and employees of the Sub-Adviser and such affiliates."
"2564","            IX.	Duration and Termination.  This Agreement will"
"2565","become effective as of the date hereof and, unless sooner"
"2566","terminated with respect to the Portfolio as provided herein,"
"2567","shall continue in effect with respect to the Portfolio for a"
"2568","period of two years.  Thereafter, if not terminated, this"
"2569","Agreement shall continue in effect with respect to the Portfolio"
"2570","for successive periods of 12 months, provided such continuance"
"2571","is specifically approved at least annually (a) by the vote of a"
"2572","majority of those members of the Fund's Board of Trustees who"
"2573","are not interested persons of any party to this Agreement, cast"
"2574","in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such"
"2575","approval, and (b) by the Fund's Board of Trustees or by a vote"
"2576","of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the"
"2577","Portfolio.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be"
"2578","terminated with respect to the Portfolio at any time, without"
"2579","the payment of any penalty, by the Fund (by vote of the Fund's"
"2580","Board of Trustees or by vote of a majority of the outstanding"
"2581","voting securities of the Portfolio), or by Adviser or Sub-"
"2582","Adviser on sixty days' written notice, and will terminate"
"2583","automatically upon any termination of the Advisory Agreement"
"2584","between the Fund and Adviser.  This Agreement will also"
"2585","immediately terminate in the event of its assignment.  (As used"
"2586","in this Agreement, the terms majority of the outstanding voting
securities, interested person and assignment shall have the"
"2587","same meanings as such terms in the 1940 Act.)"

"2596","orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party"
"2597","against which enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or"
"2598","termination is sought.  Any amendment of this Agreement shall be"

"2752","                  A. will comply with (i) the provisions of the"
"2753","1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended and"
"2754","all applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and"
"2755","Exchange Commission (the SEC), (ii) any other applicable"
"2756","provision of law and (iii) the provisions of this Agreement, the"
"2757","Declaration of Trust and the Amended and Restated Code of"
"2758","Regulations of the Fund as such are amended from time to time;"
"2759","                  B. will place orders either directly with the"
"2760","issuer or with any broker or dealer.  Subject to the other"
"2761","provisions of this paragraph, in placing orders with brokers and"
"2762","dealers, Sub-Adviser will attempt to obtain the best price and"
"2763","the most favorable execution of its orders.  In placing orders,"
"2764","Sub-Adviser will consider the experience and skill of the firm's"
"2765","securities traders as well as the firm's financial"
"2766","responsibility and administrative efficiency.  Consistent with"
"2767","this obligation, Sub-Adviser may, subject to the approval of the"
"2768","Fund's Board of Trustees, select brokers on the basis of the"
"2769","research, statistical and pricing services they provide to the"
"2770","Portfolio and other clients of Adviser or Sub-Adviser."
"2771","Information and research received from such brokers will be in"
"2772","addition to, and not in lieu of, the services required to be"
"2773","performed by Sub-Adviser hereunder.  A commission paid to such"
"2774","brokers may be higher than that which another qualified broker"
"2775","would have charged for effecting the same transaction, provided"
"2776","that Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission"
"2777","is reasonable in terms of either the transaction or the overall"
"2778","responsibility of Adviser and Sub-Adviser to the Portfolio and"
"2779","their other clients and that the total commissions paid by the"
"2780","Portfolio will be reasonable in relation to the benefits to the"
"2781","Fund over the long-term.  In no instance, however, will the"
"2782","Fund's securities be purchased from or sold to Adviser, Sub-"
"2783","Adviser, the Fund's distributor or any affiliated person"
"2784","thereof, except to the extent permitted by the SEC or by"
"2785","applicable law.  It is understood that Sub-Adviser may utilize"
"2786","affiliates in connection with the placement of orders with"
"2787","issuers and brokers or dealers, but such use of affiliates shall"
"2788","not affect the responsibility of Sub-Adviser to Adviser for such"
"2789","activities.  Subject to the foregoing and the provisions of the"
"2790","1940 Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and"
"2791","other applicable provisions of law, Sub-Adviser may select"
"2792","brokers and dealers with which it or the Fund is affiliated;"
"2793","                  C. will maintain or cause Adviser to maintain"
"2794","books and records with respect to the Portfolio's securities"
"2795","transactions and will furnish Adviser and the Fund's Board of"
"2796","Trustees periodic and special reports as they may request;"
"2797","                  D. will maintain a policy and practice of"
"2798","conducting its investment advisory services hereunder"
"2799","independently of the commercial banking operations of its"
"2800","affiliates.  When Sub-Adviser makes investment recommendations"
"2801","for the Portfolio, its investment advisory personnel will not"
"2802","inquire or take into consideration whether the issuer of"
"2803","securities proposed for purchase or sale for the Portfolio's"
"2804","account are customers of the commercial departments of its"
"2805","affiliates.  In dealing with commercial customers of its"
"2806","affiliates, Sub-Adviser will not inquire or take into"
"2807","consideration whether securities of those customers are held by"
"2808","the Fund; and"
"2809","                  E. will treat confidentially and as proprietary"
"2810","information of the Fund all records and other information"
"2811","relative to the Fund, any of the Portfolio's and the Fund's"
"2812","prior, current or potential shareholders, and will not use such"
"2813","records and information for any purpose other than performance"
"2814","of its responsibilities and duties hereunder, except after prior"
"2815","notification to and approval in writing by the Fund, which"
"2816","approval shall not be unreasonably withheld and may not be"
"2817","withheld where Sub-Adviser may be exposed to civil or criminal"
"2818","contempt proceedings for failure to comply, when requested to"
"2819","divulge such information by duly constituted authorities, or"
"2820","when so requested by the Fund."
"2821","            IV. Services Not Exclusive.  Sub-Adviser's services"
"2822","hereunder are not deemed to be exclusive, and Sub-Adviser shall"
"2823","be free to render similar services to others so long as its"
"2824","services under this Agreement are not impaired thereby."
"2825","            V. Books and Records.  In compliance with the"
"2826","requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, Sub-Adviser"
"2827","hereby agrees that all records which it maintains for the"
"2828","Portfolio are the property of the Fund and further agrees to"
"2829","surrender promptly to the Fund any such records upon the Fund's"
"2830","request.  Sub-Adviser further agrees to preserve for the periods"
"2831","prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the records required"
"2832","to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act."
"2833","            VI. Expenses.  During the term of this Agreement,"
"2834","Sub-Adviser will bear all costs and expenses of its employees"
"2835","and any overhead incurred by Sub-Adviser in connection with its"
"2836","duties hereunder; provided that the Board of Trustees of the"
"2837","Fund may approve reimbursement to Sub-Adviser of the pro rata"
"2838","portion of the salaries, bonuses, health insurance, retirement"
"2839","benefits and all similar employment costs for the time spent on"
"2840","Fund operations (including, without limitation, compliance"
"2841","matters) (other than the provision of investment advice required"
"2842","to be provided hereunder) of all personnel employed by Sub-"
"2843","Adviser who devote substantial time to Fund operations or the"
"2844","operations of other investment companies advised or sub-advised"
"2845","by Sub-Adviser."
"2846","            VII. Compensation.  For the services provided and the"
"2847","expenses assumed pursuant to this Agreement, Adviser will pay to"
"2848","Sub-Adviser a fee, computed daily and payable monthly, at the"
"2849","annual rate set forth on Appendix A attached hereto.  For any"
"2850","period less than a month during which this Agreement is in"
"2851","effect, the fee shall be prorated according to the proportion"
"2852","which such period bears to a full month of 28, 29, 30 or 31"
"2853","days, as the case may be."
"2854","            For purposes of the fee rates set forth on Appendix A,"
"2855","the net assets of the Portfolio shall be calculated pursuant to"
"2856","the procedures adopted by resolutions of the Fund's Board of"
"2857","Trustees for calculating the value of the Fund's assets or"
"2858","delegating such calculations to third parties."
"2859","            If Adviser waives any or all of its advisory fee"
"2860","payable under the Advisory Agreement, or reimburses the Fund"
"2861","pursuant to Section 8(b) of that Agreement, with respect to the"
"2862","Portfolio, Sub-Adviser will bear its share of the amount of such"
"2863","waiver or reimbursement by waiving fees otherwise payable to it"
"2864","hereunder on a proportionate basis to be determined by comparing"
"2865","the aggregate fees that would otherwise be paid to it hereunder"
"2866","with respect to the Portfolio to the aggregate fees that would"
"2867","otherwise be paid by the Fund to Adviser under the Advisory"
"2868","Agreement with respect to the Portfolio.  Adviser shall inform"
"2869","Sub-Adviser prior to waiving any advisory fees."
"2870","            VIII. Limitation of Liability.  Sub-Adviser shall"
"2871","not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for"
"2872","any loss suffered by Adviser or by the Fund or the Portfolio in"
"2873","connection with the performance of this Agreement, except a loss"
"2874","resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the"
"2875","receipt of compensation for services or a loss resulting from"
"2876","willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part"
"2877","in the performance of its duties or from reckless disregard by"
"2878","it of its obligations or duties under this Agreement."
"2879","            IX. Duration and Termination.  This Agreement will"
"2880","become effective as of the date hereof and, unless sooner"
"2881","terminated with respect to the Portfolio as provided herein,"
"2882","shall continue in effect with respect to the Portfolio for a"
"2883","period of two years.  Thereafter, if not terminated, this"
"2884","Agreement shall continue in effect with respect to the Portfolio"
"2885","for successive periods of 12 months, provided such continuance"
"2886","is specifically approved at least annually (a) by the vote of a"
"2887","majority of those members of the Fund's Board of Trustees who"
"2888","are not interested persons of any party to this Agreement, cast"
"2889","in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such"
"2890","approval, and (b) by the Fund's Board of Trustees or by a vote"
"2891","of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the"
"2892","Portfolio.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be"
"2893","terminated with respect to the Portfolio at any time, without"
"2894","the payment of any penalty, by the Fund (by vote of the Fund's"
"2895","Board of Trustees or by vote of a majority of the outstanding"
"2896","voting securities of the Portfolio), or by Adviser or Sub-"
"2897","Adviser on sixty days' written notice, and will terminate"
"2898","automatically upon any termination of the Advisory Agreement"
"2899","between the Fund and Adviser.  This Agreement will also"
"2900","immediately terminate in the event of its assignment.  (As used"
"2901","in this Agreement, the terms majority of the outstanding voting
securities, interested person and assignment shall have the"
"2902","same meanings as such terms in the 1940 Act.)"
"2903","            X. Notices.  Any notice under this Agreement shall"
"2904","be in writing to the other party at such address as the other"

"2910","this Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated"
"2911","orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party"

"2913","termination is sought.  Any amendment of this Agreement shall be"
"2914","subject to the 1940 Act."
"2915","            XII. Miscellaneous.  The captions in this Agreement"

"3014","is agreed by and between the parties hereto as follows:"

"3054","Advisor will periodically communicate to the Advisor, at such"
"3055","times as the Advisor may direct, information concerning the"

"3057","the name of the issuer, (b) the amount of the purchase or sale,"

"3064","Agreement in accordance with the Fund's investment objectives,"
"3065","policies and restrictions as stated in the Fund's Prospectus and"
"3066","Statement of Additional Information (as currently in effect and"
"3067","as they may be amended or supplemented from time to time) and"
"3068","the resolutions of the Trust's Board of Trustees."
"3069","The Sub-Advisor represents, warrants and covenants that it is"
"3070","authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority."
"3071","      III.	Covenants."
"3072","            A.	In the performance of its duties under this"
"3073","Agreement, the Sub-Advisor shall at all times conform to, and"
"3074","act in accordance with, any requirements imposed by:  (i) the"
"3075","provisions of the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act of"
"3076","1940, as amended (the Advisers Act) and all applicable Rules"
"3077","and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the"
"3078","SEC); (ii) any other applicable provision of law; (iii) the"
"3079","provisions of the Declaration of Trust and By-Laws of the Trust,"
"3080","as such documents are amended from time to time; (iv) the"
"3081","investment objectives and policies of the Fund as set forth in"
"3082","the Fund's Registration Statement on Form N-1A and/or the"
"3083","resolutions of the Board of Trustees; and (v) any policies and"
"3084","determinations of the Board of Trustees of the Trust; and"
"3085","            B.	In addition, the Sub-Advisor will:"
"3086","            1.	place orders either directly with the issuer"
"3087","or with any broker or dealer.  Subject to the other"
"3088","provisions of this paragraph, in placing orders with"
"3089","brokers and dealers, the Sub-Advisor will attempt to obtain"
"3090","the best price and the most favorable execution of its"
"3091","orders.  The Advisor has been provided with a copy of the"
"3092","Sub-Advisor's order execution policy and hereby confirms"
"3093","that it has read and understood the information in the"
"3094","order execution policy and agrees to it.  In particular,"
"3095","the Advisor agrees that the Sub-Advisor may trade outside"
"3096","of the regulated market or multilateral trading facility."
"3097","In placing orders, the Sub-Advisor will consider the"
"3098","experience and skill of the firm's securities traders as"
"3099","well as the firm's financial responsibility and"
"3100","administrative efficiency.  Consistent with this"
"3101","obligation, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers on the basis"
"3102","of the research, statistical and pricing services they"
"3103","provide to the Fund and other clients of the Advisor or the"
"3104","Sub-Advisor.  Information and research received from such"
"3105","brokers will be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the"
"3106","services required to be performed by the Sub-Advisor"
"3107","hereunder.  A commission paid to such brokers may be higher"
"3108","than that which another qualified broker would have charged"
"3109","for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-"
"3110","Advisor determines in good faith that such commission is"
"3111","reasonable in terms either of the transaction or the"
"3112","overall responsibility of the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor"
"3113","to the Fund and their other clients and that the total"
"3114","commissions paid by the Fund will be reasonable in relation"
"3115","to the benefits to the Fund over the long-term.  Subject to"
"3116","the foregoing and the provisions of the 1940 Act, the"
"3117","Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and other"
"3118","applicable provisions of law, the Sub-Advisor may select"
"3119","brokers and dealers with which it or the Fund is"
"3120","affiliated;"
"3121","            2.	maintain books and records with respect to"
"3122","the Fund's securities transactions and will render to the"
"3123","Advisor and the Trust's Board of Trustees such periodic and"
"3124","special reports as they may request;"
"3125","            3.	maintain a policy and practice of conducting"
"3126","its investment advisory services hereunder independently of"
"3127","the commercial banking operations of its affiliates.  When"
"3128","the Sub-Advisor makes investment recommendations for the"
"3129","Fund, its investment advisory personnel will not inquire or"
"3130","take into consideration whether the issuer of securities"
"3131","proposed for purchase or sale for the Fund's account are"
"3132","customers of the commercial department of its affiliates;"
"3133","and"
"3134","            4.	treat confidentially and as proprietary"
"3135","information of the Fund all records and other information"
"3136","relative to the Fund, and the Fund's prior, current or"
"3137","potential shareholders, and will not use such records and"
"3138","information for any purpose other than performance of its"
"3139","responsibilities and duties hereunder, except after prior"
"3140","notification to and approval in writing by the Fund, which"
"3141","approval shall not be unreasonably withheld and may not be"
"3142","withheld where the Sub-Advisor may be exposed to civil or"
"3143","criminal contempt proceedings for failure to comply, when"
"3144","requested to divulge such information by duly constituted"
"3145","authorities, or when so requested by the Fund."
"3146","            C.	In addition, the Advisor:"
"3147","            1.	agrees that the Sub-Advisor may aggregate"
"3148","transactions for the Fund with transactions for other"
"3149","clients and/ or its own account.  In relation to a"
"3150","particular order, aggregation may operate on some occasions"
"3151","to the advantage of the Advisor and on other occasions to"
"3152","the Advisor's disadvantage.  However, it must be unlikely"
"3153","that the aggregation of orders and transactions will work"
"3154","overall to the disadvantage of the Advisor before"
"3155","transactions will be aggregated;"
"3156","            2.	instructs the Sub-Advisor not to make or"
"3157","book client limit orders (being a specific instruction from"
"3158","the Advisor to buy or sell a financial instrument at a"
"3159","specified price limit or better and for a specified size)"
"3160","in respect of securities admitted to trading on a regulated"
"3161","market which are not immediately executed under prevailing"
"3162","market conditions."
"3163","      IV.	Services Not Exclusive.  Nothing in this Agreement"
"3164","shall prevent the Sub-Advisor or any officer, employee or other"
"3165","affiliate thereof from acting as investment advisor for any"
"3166","other person, firm or corporation, or from engaging in any other"
"3167","lawful activity, and shall not in any way limit or restrict the"
"3168","Sub-Advisor or any of its officers, employees or agents from"
"3169","buying, selling or trading any securities for its or their own"
"3170","accounts or for the accounts of others for whom it or they may"
"3171","be acting; provided, however, that the Sub-Advisor will"
"3172","undertake no activities which, in its judgment, will adversely"
"3173","affect the performance of its obligations under this Agreement."
"3174","      V.	Books and Records.  In compliance with the"
"3175","requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor"
"3176","hereby agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund"
"3177","are the property of the Trust and further agrees to surrender"
"3178","promptly to the Trust any such records upon the Trust's request."
"3179","The Sub-Advisor further agrees to preserve for the periods"
"3180","prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the records required"
"3181","to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act (to the extent"
"3182","such books and records are not maintained by the Advisor)."
"3183","      VI.	Expenses.  During the term of this Agreement, the Sub-"
"3184","Advisor will bear all costs and expenses of its employees and"
"3185","any overhead incurred by the Sub-Advisor in connection with its"
"3186","duties hereunder; provided that the Board of Trustees of the"
"3187","Trust may approve reimbursement to the Sub-Advisor of the pro-"
"3188","rata portion of the salaries, bonuses, health insurance,"
"3189","retirement benefits and all similar employment costs for the"
"3190","time spent on Fund operations (including, without limitation,"
"3191","compliance matters) (other than the provision of investment"
"3192","advice and administrative services required to be provided"
"3193","hereunder) of all personnel employed by the Sub-Advisor who"
"3194","devote substantial time to Fund operations or the operations of"
"3195","other investment companies advised or sub-advised by the Sub-"
"3196","Advisor."
"3197","      VII.	Compensation."
"3198","            A.	The Advisor agrees to pay to the Sub-Advisor and"
"3199","the Sub-Advisor agrees to accept as full compensation for all"
"3200","services rendered by the Sub-Advisor as such, a monthly fee in"
"3201","arrears at an annual rate equal to the amount set forth in"
"3202","Schedule A hereto.  For any period less than a month during"
"3203","which this Agreement is in effect, the fee shall be prorated"
"3204","according to the proportion which such period bears to a full"
"3205","month of 28, 29, 30 or 31 days, as the case may be."
"3206","            B.	For purposes of this Agreement, the net assets of"
"3207","the Fund shall be calculated pursuant to the procedures adopted"
"3208","by resolutions of the Trustees of the Trust for calculating the"
"3209","value of the Fund's assets or delegating such calculations to"
"3210","third parties."
"3211","            C.	If Advisor waives any or all of its advisory fee"
"3212","payable under the Advisory Agreement, or reimburses the Trust"
"3213","pursuant to Section 8(b) of that Agreement, with respect to the"
"3214","Fund, Sub-Advisor will bear its share of the amount of such"
"3215","waiver or reimbursement by waiving fees otherwise payable to it"
"3216","hereunder on a proportionate basis to be determined by comparing"
"3217","the aggregate fees that would otherwise be paid to it hereunder"
"3218","with respect to the Fund to the aggregate fees that would"
"3219","otherwise be paid by the Trust to Advisor under the Advisory"
"3220","Agreement with respect to the Fund.  Advisor shall inform Sub-"
"3221","Advisor prior to waiving any advisory fees."
"3222","      VIII.	Indemnity."
"3223","            (a) The Fund may, in the discretion of the Board of"
"3224","Trustees of the Trust, indemnify the Sub-Advisor, and each of"
"3225","the Sub-Advisor's directors, officers, employees, agents,"
"3226","associates and controlling persons and the directors, partners,"
"3227","members, officers, employees and agents thereof (including any"
"3228","individual who serves at the Sub-Advisor's request as director,"
"3229","officer, partner, member, trustee or the like of another entity)"
"3230","(each such person being an Indemnitee) against any liabilities"
"3231","and expenses, including amounts paid in satisfaction of"
"3232","judgments, in compromise or as fines and penalties, and counsel"
"3233","fees (all as provided in accordance with applicable state law)"
"3234","reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with the"
"3235","defense or disposition of any action, suit or other proceeding,"
"3236","whether civil or criminal, before any court or administrative or"
"3237","investigative body in which such Indemnitee may be or may have"
"3238","been involved as a party or otherwise or with which such"
"3239","Indemnitee may be or may have been threatened, while acting in"
"3240","any capacity set forth herein or thereafter by reason of such"
"3241","Indemnitee having acted in any such capacity, except with"
"3242","respect to any matter as to which such Indemnitee shall have"
"3243","been adjudicated not to have acted in good faith in the"
"3244","reasonable belief that such Indemnitee's action was in the best"
"3245","interest of the Fund and furthermore, in the case of any"
"3246","criminal proceeding, so long as such Indemnitee had no"
"3247","reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful;"
"3248","provided, however, that (1) no Indemnitee shall be indemnified"
"3249","hereunder against any liability to the Fund or its shareholders"
"3250","or any expense of such Indemnitee arising by reason of (i)"
"3251","willful misfeasance, (ii) bad faith, (iii) gross negligence or"
"3252","(iv) reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of"
"3253","such Indemnitee's position (the conduct referred to in such"
"3254","clauses (i) through (iv) being sometimes referred to herein as"
"3255","disabling conduct), (2) as to any matter disposed of by"
"3256","settlement or a compromise payment by such Indemnitee, pursuant"
"3257","to a consent decree or otherwise, no indemnification either for"
"3258","said payment or for any other expenses shall be provided unless"
"3259","there has been a determination that such settlement or"
"3260","compromise is in the best interests of the Fund and that such"
"3261","Indemnitee appears to have acted in good faith in the reasonable"
"3262","belief that such Indemnitee's action was in the best interest of"
"3263","the Fund and did not involve disabling-conduct by such"
"3264","Indemnitee and (3) with respect to any action, suit or other"
"3265","proceeding voluntarily prosecuted by any Indemnitee as"
"3266","plaintiff, indemnification shall be mandatory only if the"
"3267","prosecution of such action, suit or other proceeding by such"
"3268","Indemnitee was authorized by a majority of the full Board of"
"3269","Trustees of the Trust."
"3270","            (b) The Fund shall make advance payments in connection"
"3271","with the expenses of defending any action with respect to which"
"3272","indemnification might be sought hereunder if the Fund receives a"
"3273","written affirmation of the Indemnitee's good faith belief that"
"3274","the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification has been"
"3275","met and a written undertaking to reimburse the Fund unless it is"
"3276","subsequently determined that such Indemnitee is entitled to such"
"3277","indemnification and if the Trustees of the Trust determine that"
"3278","the facts then known to them would not preclude indemnification."
"3279","In addition, at least one of the following conditions must be"
"3280","met:  (A) the Indemnitee shall provide a security for such"
"3281","Indemnitee's undertaking, (B) the Fund shall be insured against"
"3282","losses arising by reason of any unlawful advance, or (C) a"
"3283","majority of a quorum consisting of Trustees of the Trust who are"
"3284","neither interested persons of the Trust (as defined in Section"
"3285","2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) nor parties to the proceeding"
"3286","(Disinterested Non-Party Trustees) or an independent legal"
"3287","counsel in a written opinion, shall determine, based on a review"
"3288","of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial-type"
"3289","inquiry), that there is reason to believe that the Indemnitee"
"3290","ultimately will be found entitled to indemnification."
"3291","            (c) All determinations with respect to the standards"
"3292","for indemnification hereunder shall be made (1) by a final"
"3293","decision on the merits by a court or other body before whom the"
"3294","proceeding was brought that such Indemnitee is not liable by"
"3295","reason of disabling conduct, or (2) in the absence of such a"
"3296","decision, by (i) a majority vote of a quorum of the"
"3297","Disinterested Non-Party Trustees of the Trust, or (ii) if such a"
"3298","quorum is not obtainable or even, if obtainable, if a majority"
"3299","vote of such quorum so directs, independent legal counsel in a"
"3300","written opinion.  All determinations that advance payments in"
"3301","connection with the expense of defending any proceeding shall be"
"3302","authorized shall be made in accordance with the immediately"
"3303","preceding clause (2) above."
"3304","      The rights accruing to any Indemnitee under these"
"3305","provisions shall not exclude any other right to which such"
"3306","Indemnitee may be lawfully entitled."
"3307","      IX.	Limitation on Liability."
"3308","            A.	The Sub-Advisor will not be liable for any error"
"3309","of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the"
"3310","Advisor or by the Trust or the Fund in connection with the"
"3311","performance of this Agreement, except a loss resulting from a"
"3312","breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of"
"3313","compensation for services or a loss resulting from willful"
"3314","misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the"
"3315","performance of its duties or from reckless disregard by it of"
"3316","its duties under this Agreement.  As used in this Section 9(a),"
"3317","the term Sub-Advisor shall include any affiliates of the Sub-"
"3318","Advisor performing services for the Fund contemplated hereby and"
"3319","partners, directors, officers and employees of the Sub-Advisor"
"3320","and such affiliates."
"3321","            B.	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary"
"3322","contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto acknowledge and"
"3323","agree that, as provided in Article Seventh of the Declaration of"
"3324","Trust, this Agreement is executed by the Trustees and/or"
"3325","officers of the Trust, not individually but as such Trustees"
"3326","and/or officers of the Trust, and the obligations hereunder are"
"3327","not binding upon any of the Trustees or Shareholders"
"3328","individually but bind only the estate of the Trust."
"3329","      X.	Duration and Termination.  This Agreement shall become"
"3330","effective as of the date hereof and, unless sooner terminated"
"3331","with respect to the Fund as provided herein, shall continue in"
"3332","effect for a period of two years.  Thereafter, if not"
"3333","terminated, this Agreement shall continue in effect with respect"
"3334","to the Fund for successive periods of 12 months, provided such"
"3335","continuance is specifically approved at least annually by both"
"3336","(a) the vote of a majority of the Trust's Board of Trustees or a"
"3337","vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the"
"3338","Fund at the time outstanding and entitled to vote and (b) by the"
"3339","vote of a majority of the Trustees, who are not parties to this"
"3340","Agreement or interested persons (as such term is defined in the"
"3341","1940 Act) of any such party, cast in person at a meeting called"
"3342","for the purpose of voting on such approval.  Notwithstanding the"
"3343","foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated by the Trust or the"
"3344","Advisor at any time, without the payment of any penalty, upon"
"3345","giving the Sub-Advisor 60 days' notice (which notice may be"
"3346","waived by the Sub-Advisor), provided that such termination by"
"3347","the Trust or the Advisor shall be directed or approved by the"
"3348","vote of a majority of the Trustees of the Trust in office at the"
"3349","time or by the vote of the holders of a majority of the"
"3350","outstanding voting securities of the Fund entitled to vote, or"
"3351","by the Sub-Advisor on 60 days' written notice (which notice may"
"3352","be waived by the Trust and the Advisor), and will terminate"
"3353","automatically upon any termination of the Advisory Agreement"
"3354","between the Trust and the Advisor.  This Agreement will also"
"3355","immediately terminate in the event of its assignment.  (As used"
"3356","in this Agreement, the terms majority of the outstanding voting
securities, interested person and assignment shall have the"
"3357","same meanings of such terms in the 1940 Act.)"
"3358","      XI.	Notices.  Any notice under this Agreement shall be in"
"3359","writing to the other party at such address as the other party"
"3360","may designate from time to time for the receipt of such notice"

"3362","actually received or on the fourth day after the postmark if"
"3363","such notice is mailed first class postage prepaid."
"3364","      XII.	Amendment of this Agreement.  This Agreement may be"
"3365","amended by the parties only if such amendment is specifically"

"3658","believes are adequate to ensure its compliance with"
"3659","applicable law. No supervisory activity undertaken by"

"3663","any other sub-investment adviser for the Fund or the"
"3664","Trust or any other fund under common control with the"
"3665","Trust, concerning transactions for the Managed Portion"

"3668","successor sub-investment advisers of the Fund in order"
"3669","to effect an orderly transition of sub-advisory duties"
"3670","so long as such consultations are not transactions"
"3671","prohibited by Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act."
"3672","(g) On behalf of the Fund, the Adviser hereby authorizes"
"3673","any entity or person associated with the Sub-Adviser"
"3674","which is a member of a national securities exchange to"
"3675","effect any transaction on the exchange for the account"

"3677","Exchange Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder, and on"
"3678","behalf of the Fund, the Adviser hereby consents to the"
"3679","retention of compensation for such transactions in"
"3680","accordance with Rule 11a2-2(T)(a)(2)(iv)."
"3681","Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sub-Adviser agrees"
"3682","that it will not deal with itself, or with members of"
"3683","the Board or any principal underwriter of the Fund, as"
"3684","principals or agents in making purchases or sales of"
"3685","securities or other property for the account of the"
"3686","Fund, nor will the Sub-Adviser purchase any securities"
"3687","from an underwriting or selling group in which the Sub-"
"3688","Adviser or its affiliates is participating, or arrange"
"3689","for purchases and sales of securities between the Fund"
"3690","and another account advised by the Sub-Adviser or its"
"3691","affiliates, except in each case as permitted by the 1940"
"3692","Act and in accordance with such policies and procedures"
"3693","as may be adopted by the Fund from time to time and"
"3694","disclosed to the Sub-Adviser, and will comply with all"
"3695","other provisions of the Governing Documents and the"
"3696","Fund's then-current Registration Statement relative to"
"3697","the Sub-Adviser and its directors, officers and"
"3698","employees."
"3699","3.	Fund Transactions."
"3700","(a)	In connection with purchases and sales of"
"3701","portfolio securities and other instruments for the"
"3702","account of the Fund, neither the Sub-Adviser nor its"
"3703","affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) or"
"3704","any of their respective partners, officers or"
"3705","employees shall act as principal, except as otherwise"
"3706","permitted by the 1940 Act. The Sub-Adviser or its"
"3707","agents shall arrange for the placing of orders for"
"3708","the purchase and sale of portfolio securities and"
"3709","other financial instruments for the Fund's account"
"3710","either directly with the issuer or with any"
"3711","Counterparty, provided that the Sub-Adviser complies"
"3712","with Section 2(b) with respect to each such"
"3713","Counterparty."
"3714","(b) In the selection of such brokers or dealers and the"
"3715","placing of such orders, the Sub-Adviser is directed at"
"3716","all times to seek to obtain for the Managed Portion the"
"3717","most favorable execution and net price available. It is"
"3718","also understood that it may be desirable for the Managed"
"3719","Portion that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental"
"3720","investment and market research and security and economic"
"3721","analyses that are consistent with Section 28(e) of the"
"3722","Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934
Act), and are provided by brokers who may execute"
"3723","brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Managed"
"3724","Portion than may result when allocating brokerage to"
"3725","other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable"
"3726","price and efficient execution. Therefore, subject to"
"3727","compliance with the safe harbor provided by Section"
"3728","28(e) of the 1934 Act and such other conditions and"
"3729","limitations as may be established by the Adviser from"
"3730","time to time, if any, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to"
"3731","consider such services provided to the Managed Portion"
"3732","and other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or any of"
"3733","its affiliates exercises investment discretion and to"
"3734","place orders for the purchase and sale of securities for"
"3735","the Managed Portion with such brokers, if the Sub-"
"3736","Adviser determines in good faith that the amount of"
"3737","commissions for executing such portfolio transactions is"
"3738","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"3739","research services provided by such brokers, subject to"
"3740","review by the Adviser and the Board from time to time"
"3741","with respect to the extent and continuation of this"
"3742","practice. It is understood that the services provided by"
"3743","such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in"
"3744","connection with its services to other clients. The Sub-"
"3745","Adviser may, on occasions when it deems the purchase or"
"3746","sale of a security to be in the best interests of the"
"3747","Managed Portion as well as its other clients, aggregate,"
"3748","to the extent permitted by applicable laws, rules and"
"3749","regulations, the securities to be sold or purchased in"
"3750","order to obtain the best net price and the most"
"3751","favorable execution. In such event, allocation of the"
"3752","securities so purchased or sold, as well as the expenses"
"3753","incurred in the transaction, shall be made by the Sub-"
"3754","Adviser in the manner it considers to be the most"
"3755","equitable and consistent with its obligations to the"
"3756","Managed Portion and to such other clients. The Board may"
"3757","from time to time adopt policies and procedures that"
"3758","modify and/or restrict the Sub-Adviser's authority"
"3759","regarding the execution of the Managed Portion's"
"3760","portfolio transactions provided herein."
"3761","(c) The Sub-Adviser shall not beneficially own or hold"
"3762","on behalf of the Managed Portion any equity securities"
"3763","registered under Section 12 of the 1934 Act with the"
"3764","purpose or effect of (i) instituting or becoming a"
"3765","participant in a proxy contest in order to change or"
"3766","influence control of the issuer of the securities; or"
"3767","(ii) acting as a participant in any transaction that"
"3768","would have the effect of causing the Sub-Adviser to name"
"3769","the Fund or the Managed Portion in a filing made by the"
"3770","Sub-Adviser under Regulation 13D-G promulgated under the"
"3771","1934 Act; or (iii) acting as a participant in any"
"3772","transaction that would have the effect of causing the"
"3773","Managed Portion to be included in a filing made by the"
"3774","Sub-Adviser on Schedule 13D for a security purchased by"
"3775","the Sub-Adviser in the Managed Portion.  If any"
"3776","investments made by the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the"
"3777","Managed Portion are required to be disclosed in any"
"3778","other reports to be filed by the Sub-Adviser with any"
"3779","governmental or self-regulatory agency or organization"
"3780","or exchange in any manner requiring disclosure of the"
"3781","Fund, the Sub-Adviser shall provide the Adviser with"
"3782","prompt written notice thereof as far in advance of the"
"3783","date of such filing as is practicable, setting forth in"
"3784","reasonable detail the nature of the report and the"
"3785","investments of the Managed Portion to be reported."
"3786","(d) The Fund may establish one or more wholly-owned"
"3787","subsidiaries of the Fund through which it may conduct a"
"3788","significant portion of its commodities investing"
"3789","activities or for other investment purposes."
"3790","4. Compensation of the Sub-Adviser."
"3791","(a) For the services provided and the expenses assumed"
"3792","by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, Adviser,"
"3793","not the Fund, shall pay to the Sub-Adviser a fee,"
"3794","computed daily and payable monthly, in arrears, at an"

"4466","investment adviser to the Trust or Fund."
"4467","Nothing in this Section 15 shall be deemed a limitation or"

"4474","employees, managers, members, officers, trustees,"
"4475","directors and shareholders from and against all losses,"
"4476","claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses"
"4477","(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' and"
"4478","accountants' fees and disbursements) arising out of this"
"4479","Agreement except to the extent such claims (i) arise out"
"4480","of Adviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross"
"4481","negligence or reckless disregard in the performance of"
"4482","its obligations and duties hereunder; (ii) arise out of"
"4483","Adviser's material breach of this Agreement or (iii) do"
"4484","not arise out of the Sub-Adviser's breach of its"
"4485","Liability Standard."
"4486","(b)	Adviser will, to the extent permissible under applicable"
"4487","law, indemnify and hold harmless Sub-Adviser, its"
"4488","affiliates, and their respective employees, officers and"

"4495","reckless disregard in the performance of its obligations"
"4496","and duties hereunder; (ii) Sub-Adviser's material breach"
"4497","of this Agreement; or (iii) Sub-Adviser's breach of"
"4498","fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of"
"4499","compensation for services."
"4500","(c)	After receipt by the Adviser or Sub-Adviser or any party"
"4501","entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the"
"4502","Indemnified Party) of notice of commencement of any"
"4503","action if a claim in respect thereof is to be made"
"4504","against any person obligated to provide indemnification"
"4505","pursuant to this Agreement (the Indemnifying Party),"
"4506","such Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying"
"4507","Party in writing of the commencement thereof as soon as"
"4508","practicable after the summons or other first written"
"4509","notification giving information of the nature of the"
"4510","claim that has been served upon the Indemnified Party;"
"4511","provided that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying"
"4512","Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any"
"4513","liability under this Agreement except to the extent such"
"4514","Indemnifying Party is damaged solely as a result of the"
"4515","failure to give such notice.  The Indemnifying Party will"
"4516","be entitled to assume the defense of such action. If the"
"4517","Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense thereof"
"4518","and retains counsel, the Indemnified Party will bear the"
"4519","fees and expenses of any additional counsel retained by"
"4520","it, unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified"
"4521","Party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such"
"4522","counsel, or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding"
"4523","(including any impleaded parties) include both the"
"4524","Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and"
"4525","representation by both parties by the same counsel would"
"4526","be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing"
"4527","interests between them.  The Indemnifying Party shall not"
"4528","be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected"
"4529","without its written consent, which consent shall not be"
"4530","unreasonably withheld, but if settled with such consent"
"4531","or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the"
"4532","Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify the Indemnified"
"4533","Party against any loss or liability by reason of such"
"4534","settlement of judgment to the extent provided by this"
"4535","Agreement.  If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to"
"4536","assume the defense, the Indemnifying Party will reimburse"
"4537","the Indemnified Party for the reasonable fees and"
"4538","expenses of any counsel retained by it, which fees and"
"4539","expenses will be payable to the Indemnified Party at such"
"4540","intervals as the parties may determine or upon the"
"4541","Indemnifying Party's receipt of a bill related thereto."
"4542","17. Duration and Termination."
"4543","(a)	This Agreement is effective as of the date first"
"4544","written above, provided that this Agreement shall not"
"4545","take effect unless it has first been approved (i) by the"
"4546","vote of a majority of those Trustees of the Trust who are"
"4547","not parties to this Agreement or interested persons of"

"4549","the purpose of voting on such approval, and (ii) by vote"
"4550","of a majority of the Fund's outstanding voting securities"
"4551","(within the meaning of the 1940 Act), unless the Adviser"
"4552","has authority to enter into this Agreement pursuant to"
"4553","exemptive relief from the SEC without a vote of the"
"4554","Fund's outstanding voting securities."
"4555","(b)	Unless sooner terminated as provided herein, this"
"4556","Agreement shall continue in effect for two years from its"
"4557","date of execution. Thereafter, if not terminated, this"
"4558","Agreement shall continue automatically for successive"
"4559","periods of twelve months each, provided that such"
"4560","continuance is specifically approved at least annually"
"4561","(i) by the vote of a majority of those Trustees of the"
"4562","Trust who are not parties to this Agreement or interested"
"4563","persons of any such party, cast in person at a meeting"

"4565","(ii) by either the vote of (A) the Board or (B) a"

"4570","hereunder in the manner and to the extent permitted by"
"4571","the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder."
"4572","The foregoing requirement that continuance of this"
"4573","Agreement be specifically approved at least annually"
"4574","shall be construed in a manner consistent with the 1940"
"4575","Act and the rules and regulations thereunder."
"4576","(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be"
"4577","terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty,"
"4578","by vote of a majority of the Board or by a vote of a"
"4579","majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund."
"4580","This Agreement may also be terminated, without the payment"
"4581","of any penalty, by the Adviser: (i) upon 60 days written"
"4582","notice to the Sub-Adviser; (ii) immediately upon material"
"4583","breach by the Sub-Adviser of any of the representations,"
"4584","warranties and agreements set forth in this Agreement; or"
"4585","(iii) immediately if, in the reasonable judgment of"
"4586","Adviser, the Sub-Adviser becomes unable to discharge its"
"4587","duties and obligations under this Agreement, including"
"4588","without limitation, circumstances such as financial"
"4589","insolvency of the Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser may"
"4590","terminate this Agreement at any time, without the payment"
"4591","of any penalty, on 90 days written notice to Adviser and"
"4592","the Trust. This Agreement will terminate automatically in"
"4593","the event of its assignment or upon termination of the"
"4594","Investment Advisory Agreement, as it relates to this Fund."
"4595","(d) In the event of termination for any reason, all records"
"4596","of the Fund that are maintained by the Sub-Adviser in"
"4597","accordance with the 1940 Act and Section 14 of this"
"4598","Agreement shall promptly be returned to the Adviser or the"

"4997","(Adviser Procedures). The Sub-Adviser shall maintain"
"4998","compliance procedures and operational processes for the"

"5009","any other sub-investment adviser for the Fund or the"
"5010","Trust or any other fund under common control with the"
"5011","Trust, concerning transactions for the Managed Portion"
"5012","in securities or other assets, except that such"
"5013","consultations are permitted between the current and"
"5014","successor sub-investment advisers of the Fund in order"
"5015","to effect an orderly transition of sub-advisory duties"
"5016","so long as such consultations are not transactions"
"5017","prohibited by Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act."
"5018","(g) On behalf of the Fund, the Adviser hereby authorizes"
"5019","any entity or person associated with the Sub-Adviser"
"5020","which is a member of a national securities exchange to"
"5021","effect any transaction on the exchange for the account"
"5022","of the Fund which is permitted by Section 11(a) of the"
"5023","Exchange Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder, and on"
"5024","behalf of the Fund, the Adviser hereby consents to the"

"5026","accordance with Rule 11a2-2(T)(a)(2)(iv)."
"5027","Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sub-Adviser agrees"
"5028","that it will not deal with itself, or with members of"
"5029","the Board or any principal underwriter of the Fund, as"
"5030","principals or agents in making purchases or sales of"
"5031","securities or other property for the account of the"
"5032","Fund, nor will the Sub-Adviser purchase any securities"
"5033","from an underwriting or selling group in which the Sub-"
"5034","Adviser or its affiliates is participating, or arrange"
"5035","for purchases and sales of securities between the Fund"
"5036","and another account advised by the Sub-Adviser or its"
"5037","affiliates, except in each case as permitted by the 1940"
"5038","Act and in accordance with such policies and procedures"
"5039","as may be adopted by the Fund from time to time and"
"5040","disclosed to the Sub-Adviser, and will comply with all"
"5041","other provisions of the Governing Documents and the"
"5042","Fund's then-current Registration Statement relative to"
"5043","the Sub-Adviser and its directors, officers and"
"5044","employees."
"5045","3.	Fund Transactions."
"5046","(a)	In connection with purchases and sales of"
"5047","portfolio securities and other instruments for the"
"5048","account of the Fund, neither the Sub-Adviser nor its"
"5049","affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) or"
"5050","any of their respective partners, officers or"
"5051","employees shall act as principal, except as otherwise"
"5052","permitted by the 1940 Act. The Sub-Adviser or its"
"5053","agents shall arrange for the placing of orders for"
"5054","the purchase and sale of portfolio securities and"
"5055","other financial instruments for the Fund's account"
"5056","either directly with the issuer or with any"
"5057","Counterparty, provided that the Sub-Adviser complies"
"5058","with Section 2(b) with respect to each such"
"5059","Counterparty."
"5060","(b) In the selection of such brokers or dealers and the"
"5061","placing of such orders, the Sub-Adviser is directed at"
"5062","all times to seek to obtain for the Managed Portion the"
"5063","most favorable execution and net price available. It is"
"5064","also understood that it may be desirable for the Managed"
"5065","Portion that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental"
"5066","investment and market research and security and economic"
"5067","analyses that are consistent with Section 28(e) of the"
"5068","Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934
Act), and are provided by brokers who may execute"
"5069","brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Managed"
"5070","Portion than may result when allocating brokerage to"
"5071","other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable"
"5072","price and efficient execution. Therefore, subject to"
"5073","compliance with the safe harbor provided by Section"
"5074","28(e) of the 1934 Act and such other conditions and"
"5075","limitations as may be established by the Adviser from"
"5076","time to time, if any, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to"
"5077","consider such services provided to the Managed Portion"
"5078","and other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or any of"
"5079","its affiliates exercises investment discretion and to"
"5080","place orders for the purchase and sale of securities for"
"5081","the Managed Portion with such brokers, if the Sub-"
"5082","Adviser determines in good faith that the amount of"
"5083","commissions for executing such portfolio transactions is"
"5084","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"5085","research services provided by such brokers, subject to"
"5086","review by the Adviser and the Board from time to time"
"5087","with respect to the extent and continuation of this"
"5088","practice. It is understood that the services provided by"
"5089","such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in"
"5090","connection with its services to other clients. The Sub-"
"5091","Adviser may, on occasions when it deems the purchase or"
"5092","sale of a security to be in the best interests of the"
"5093","Managed Portion as well as its other clients, aggregate,"
"5094","to the extent permitted by applicable laws, rules and"
"5095","regulations, the securities to be sold or purchased in"
"5096","order to obtain the best net price and the most"
"5097","favorable execution. In such event, allocation of the"
"5098","securities so purchased or sold, as well as the expenses"
"5099","incurred in the transaction, shall be made by the Sub-"
"5100","Adviser in the manner it considers to be the most"
"5101","equitable and consistent with its obligations to the"
"5102","Managed Portion and to such other clients. The Board may"
"5103","from time to time adopt policies and procedures that"
"5104","modify and/or restrict the Sub-Adviser's authority"
"5105","regarding the execution of the Managed Portion's"
"5106","portfolio transactions provided herein."
"5107","(c) The Sub-Adviser shall not acquire on behalf of the"
"5108","Managed Portion any equity securities registered under"
"5109","Section 12 of the 1934 Act with the purpose or effect,"
"5110","at the time of such acquisition, of changing or"
"5111","influencing control of the issuer of the securities or"
"5112","in connection with or as a participant in any"
"5113","transaction having such purpose or effect, including any"
"5114","transaction subject to Rule 13d-3(b) promulgated under"
"5115","the 1934 Act. For purposes of all applicable filing"
"5116","requirements under the 1934 Act, including without"
"5117","limitation Sections 13(d) and (g), and other laws, the"
"5118","Sub-Adviser shall be deemed to have sole investment"
"5119","discretion with respect to all securities held in the"
"5120","Managed Portion.  If any investments made by the Sub-"
"5121","Adviser on behalf of the Managed Portion are required to"
"5122","be publicly disclosed in any other reports to be filed"
"5123","by the Sub-Adviser with any governmental or self-"
"5124","regulatory agency or organization or exchange, the Sub-"
"5125","Adviser shall provide the Adviser with prompt written"
"5126","notice thereof, setting forth in reasonable detail the"
"5127","nature of the report and the investments of the Managed"
"5128","Portion to be reported."
"5129","(d) The Fund may establish one or more wholly-owned"
"5130","subsidiaries of the Fund through which it may conduct a"
"5131","significant portion of its commodities investing"
"5132","activities or for other investment purposes."
"5133","4. Compensation of the Sub-Adviser."
"5134","(a) For the services provided and the expenses assumed"
"5135","by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, Adviser,"
"5136","not the Fund, shall pay to the Sub-Adviser a fee,"
"5137","computed daily and payable monthly, in arrears by the"
"5138","last day of the following month, at an annual rate of"
"5139","the average daily net assets of the Managed Portion that"
"5140","the Sub-Adviser manages (computed in the manner"
"5141","specified in the Investment Advisory Agreement), in"
"5142","accordance with the schedule attached hereto as Exhibit"
"5143","A."
"5144","(b) If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates"

"5148","the case may be, shall be pro-rated according to the"
"5149","proportion that such period bears to the full month in"
"5150","which such effectiveness or termination occurs."
"5151","5. Expenses. The Sub-Adviser agrees, at its own expense, to"
"5152","render the services set forth herein and to provide the"
"5153","office space, furnishings, equipment and personnel required"
"5154","by it to perform such services on the terms and for the"
"5155","compensation provided in this Agreement. The Fund shall be"

"6424","Portion as well as its other clients, aggregate, to the"
"6425","extent permitted by applicable laws, rules and"
"6426","regulations, the securities to be sold or purchased in"

"6431","Adviser in the manner it considers to be the most"
"6432","equitable and consistent with its obligations to the"
"6433","Managed Portion and to such other clients. The Board may"
"6434","from time to time adopt policies and procedures that"

"7537","written notice thereof to Sub-Adviser, and such"
"7538","amendment or modification shall become effective on the"
"7539","fifth calendar day following delivery thereof.  Once the"
"7540","Trading Agreements have been negotiated and executed by"
"7541","Adviser, subject to any other written instructions of"
"7542","Adviser or the Trust, the Sub-Adviser is hereby"
"7543","appointed Adviser's and the Trust's agent and attorney-"

"7551","the Fund to perform any payment or delivery obligations"
"7552","required under any Trading Agreement or transaction,"

"7556","shall comply with applicable federal laws, the"
"7557","regulations thereunder, the Sub-Adviser's duties and"

"7567","and perform all duties which may be exercisable in"

"7576","or similar plan with reference to such securities; and"

"7579","the Sub-Adviser has sole and full discretion to vote"
"7580","(or abstain from voting) any securities in the Managed"
"7581","Portion and neither the Fund nor the Adviser will,"

"7592","may be invested in accordance with the Sub-Adviser's"
"7593","proxy voting policies and procedures, as presented to"
"7594","the Fund, and in a manner that the Sub-Adviser"
"7595","reasonably believes best serves the interests of the"
"7596","Fund's shareholders and that complies with applicable"

"7623","Sub-Adviser shall discharge its responsibilities"

"7650","and such other guidelines, policies and procedures"
"7651","implemented by the Adviser with respect to the Fund or"
"7652","to the Sub-Adviser's activities under this Agreement"
"7653","and provided to the Sub-Adviser in writing (Adviser
Procedures). The Sub-Adviser shall maintain"
"7654","compliance procedures and operational processes only"
"7655","for the Managed Portion to ensure the Managed"
"7656","Portion's compliance with the foregoing and that the"
"7657","Sub-Adviser reasonably believes are adequate to ensure"
"7658","the Managed Portion's compliance with applicable"
"7659","securities law. The Sub-Adviser and Adviser"
"7660","acknowledge that the Sub-Adviser is not the compliance"
"7661","agent for the Adviser or the Trust, or with respect to"
"7662","the Fund, and does not have access to all of the"
"7663","Trust's or the Fund's books and records, or the books"
"7664","and records of the Adviser or books  and records of"
"7665","another sub-adviser to the Fund which would be"
"7666","necessary to perform compliance testing, including,"
"7667","but not limited to, testing for compliance of the Fund"
"7668","as a whole with the requirements of Sections 851(b)(2)"

"7670","other requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal"
"7671","Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment"
"7672","companies. To the extent that the Sub-Adviser has"
"7673","agreed to perform any services specified in this"
"7674","Section 2(e), the Sub-Adviser shall perform such"
"7675","services based upon its reasonable interpretations of"
"7676","applicable securities and tax laws and regulations and"
"7677","shall not be liable under this Agreement (except to"
"7678","the extent that the Adviser has otherwise given Sub-"
"7679","Adviser guidance in writing or Sub-Adviser breaches"
"7680","the Liability Standard) (i) for any such services"
"7681","performed in compliance with this Section 2(e), and"
"7682","(ii) to the extent that any such liability results"
"7683","solely from the aggregation of any assets being"
"7684","managed by another sub-adviser to the Fund where the"
"7685","Managed Portion is in compliance with the Adviser"
"7686","Procedures."
"7687","(f) The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not consult"
"7688","with any other sub-investment adviser for the Fund or"
"7689","the Trust or any other fund under common control with"
"7690","the Trust, concerning transactions for the Managed"
"7691","Portion in securities or other assets, except that"
"7692","such consultations are permitted between the current"
"7693","and successor sub-investment advisers of the Fund in"
"7694","order to effect an orderly transition of sub-advisory"
"7695","duties so long as such consultations are not"
"7696","transactions prohibited by Section 17(a) of the 1940"
"7697","Act."
"7698","(g) On behalf of the Fund, the Adviser hereby"
"7699","authorizes any entity or person associated with the"
"7700","Sub-Adviser which is a member of a national securities"
"7701","exchange to effect any transaction on the exchange for"
"7702","the account of the Fund which is permitted by Section"
"7703","11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder,"
"7704","and on behalf of the Fund, the Adviser hereby consents"
"7705","to the retention of compensation for such transactions"
"7706","in accordance with Rule 11a2-2(T)(a)(2)(iv)."
"7707","Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sub-Adviser agrees"
"7708","that it will not deal with itself, or with members of"
"7709","the Board or any principal underwriter of the Fund, as"
"7710","principals or agents in making purchases or sales of"
"7711","securities or other property for the account of the"
"7712","Fund, nor will the Sub-Adviser purchase any securities"
"7713","from an underwriting or selling group in which the"
"7714","Sub-Adviser or its affiliates is participating, or"
"7715","arrange for purchases and sales of securities between"
"7716","the Fund and another account advised by the Sub-"
"7717","Adviser or its affiliates, except in each case as"
"7718","permitted by the 1940 Act and in accordance with such"
"7719","policies and procedures as may be adopted by the Fund"
"7720","from time to time and disclosed to the Sub-Adviser,"
"7721","and will comply with all other provisions of the"
"7722","Governing Documents and the Fund's then-current"
"7723","Registration Statement relative to the Sub-Adviser and"
"7724","its directors, officers and employees."
"7725","3.	Fund Transactions."
"7726","(a) In connection with purchases and sales of"
"7727","portfolio securities and other instruments for the"
"7728","account of the Fund, neither the Sub-Adviser nor its"
"7729","affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) or any"
"7730","of their respective partners, officers or employees"
"7731","shall act as principal, except as otherwise permitted"
"7732","by the 1940 Act. The Sub-Adviser or its agents shall"
"7733","arrange for the placing of orders for the purchase and"
"7734","sale of portfolio securities and other financial"
"7735","instruments for the Fund's account either directly"
"7736","with the issuer or with any Counterparty, provided"
"7737","that the Sub-Adviser complies with Section 2(b) with"
"7738","respect to each such Counterparty."
"7739","(b) In the selection of any such brokers or dealers by"
"7740","the Sub-Adviser (subject to Section 2(b)) and the"
"7741","placing of such orders from those brokers or dealers,"
"7742","the Sub-Adviser is directed at all times to seek to"
"7743","obtain for the Managed Portion the most favorable"
"7744","execution and net price available. It is also"
"7745","understood that it may be desirable for the Managed"
"7746","Portion that the Sub-Adviser have access to"
"7747","supplemental investment and market research and"
"7748","security and economic analyses that are consistent"
"7749","with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act, and are provided"
"7750","by brokers who may execute brokerage transactions at a"
"7751","higher cost to the Managed Portion than may result"
"7752","when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the"
"7753","basis of seeking the most favorable price and"
"7754","efficient execution. Therefore, subject to compliance"
"7755","with the safe harbor provided by Section 28(e) of the"
"7756","1934 Act and such other conditions and limitations as"
"7757","may be established by the Adviser from time to time,"
"7758","if any, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider such"
"7759","services provided to the Managed Portion and other"
"7760","accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or any of its"
"7761","affiliates exercises investment discretion and to"
"7762","place orders for the purchase and sale of securities"
"7763","for the Managed Portion with such brokers, if the Sub-"
"7764","Adviser determines in good faith that the amount of"
"7765","commissions for executing such portfolio transactions"
"7766","is reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"7767","brokerage and research services provided by such"
"7768","brokers, subject to review by the Adviser and the"
"7769","Board from time to time with respect to the extent and"
"7770","continuation of this practice. It is understood that"
"7771","the services provided by such brokers may be useful to"
"7772","the Sub-Adviser in connection with its services to"
"7773","other clients. The Sub-Adviser may, on occasions when"
"7774","it deems the purchase or sale of a security to be in"
"7775","the best interests of the Managed Portion as well as"
"7776","its other clients, aggregate, to the extent permitted"
"7777","by applicable laws, rules and regulations, the"
"7778","securities to be sold or purchased in order to obtain"
"7779","the best net price and the most favorable execution."
"7780","In such event, allocation of the securities so"
"7781","purchased or sold, as well as the expenses incurred in"
"7782","the transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in"
"7783","the manner it considers to be the most equitable and"
"7784","consistent with its obligations to the Managed Portion"
"7785","and to such other clients. The Board may from time to"
"7786","time adopt policies and procedures that modify and/or"
"7787","restrict the Sub-Adviser's authority regarding the"
"7788","execution of the Managed Portion's portfolio"
"7789","transactions provided herein so long as such policies"
"7790","and procedures are consistent with applicable law."
"7791","(c) The Sub-Adviser shall not acquire on behalf of the"
"7792","Managed Portion any equity securities registered under"
"7793","Section 12 of the 1934 Act with the purpose or effect,"
"7794","at the time of such acquisition, of changing or"
"7795","influencing control of the issuer of the securities or"
"7796","in connection with or as a participant in any"
"7797","transaction having such purpose or effect, including"
"7798","any transaction subject to Rule 13d-3(b) promulgated"
"7799","under the 1934 Act. For purposes of all applicable"
"7800","filing requirements under the 1934 Act, including"
"7801","without limitation Sections 13(d) and (g), and other"
"7802","laws, the Sub-Adviser shall be deemed to have sole"
"7803","investment discretion with respect to all securities"
"7804","held in the Managed Portion. If any investments made"
"7805","by the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the Managed Portion"
"7806","are required to be disclosed in any other reports to"
"7807","be filed by the Sub-Adviser with any governmental or"
"7808","self-regulatory agency or organization or exchange,"
"7809","the Sub-Adviser shall provide the Adviser with prompt"
"7810","written notice thereof, setting forth in reasonable"
"7811","detail the nature of the report and the investments of"
"7812","the Managed Portion to be reported."
"7813","(d) The Fund may establish one or more wholly-owned"
"7814","subsidiaries of the Fund through which it may conduct"
"7815","a significant portion of its commodities investing"
"7816","activities or for other investment purposes."
"7817","(e) The Adviser has received the Fund's written"
"7818","consent and authorization for the Sub-Adviser to enter"
"7819","into block trades (as defined in Commodity Futures"
"7820","Trading Commission (CFTC) regulations) involving"
"7821","swap transactions (as defined in the CEA) on the"
"7822","Fund's behalf when available and in accordance with"
"7823","the Investment Guidelines and applicable laws and"
"7824","regulations.  The Adviser has provided a copy of such"
"7825","consent to the Sub-Adviser.  Pursuant to such consent,"
"7826","the Sub-Adviser may aggregate orders executed on the"
"7827","Fund's behalf with orders executed on behalf of other"
"7828","clients of the Sub-Adviser in order to meet applicable"
"7829","minimum block size requirements."
"7830","4. Compensation of the Sub-Adviser."
"7831","(a) For the services provided and the expenses assumed"
"7832","by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement,"
"7833","Adviser, not the Fund, shall pay to the Sub-Adviser a"
"7834","fee, computed daily and payable monthly, in arrears,"
"7835","at an annual rate of the average daily net assets of"
"7836","the Managed Portion that the Sub-Adviser manages"
"7837","(computed in the manner specified in the Investment"
"7838","Advisory Agreement), in accordance with the schedule"
"7839","attached hereto as Exhibit A."
"7840","(b) If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates"
"7841","before the end of any month, the fee for the period"
"7842","from the effective date to the end of the month or"
"7843","from the beginning of such month to the date of"
"7844","termination, as the case may be, shall be pro-rated"
"7845","according to the proportion that such period bears to"
"7846","the full month in which such effectiveness or"
"7847","termination occurs."
"7848","5. Expenses. The Sub-Adviser agrees, at its own expense, to"
"7849","render the services set forth herein and to provide"
"7850","the office space, furnishings, equipment and personnel"
"7851","required by it to perform such services on the terms"
"7852","and for the compensation provided in this Agreement."
"7853","The Fund shall be responsible for payment of brokerage"
"7854","commissions, transfer fees, pricing services,"
"7855","registration costs, transaction-related taxes and"
"7856","other similar costs and transaction-related expenses"
"7857","and fees arising out of transactions effected on"
"7858","behalf of the Fund, which shall be deducted from the"

"7860","Adviser will pay all expenses incurred by it in"
"7861","connection with its activities under this Agreement,"
"7862","including without limitation, all costs associated"
"7863","with attending or otherwise participating in regular"

"7875","preparation, printing, filing and mailing thereof, as"
"7876","well as any shareholder meeting and/or solicitation"
"7877","costs, if applicable)."
"7878","      6. Delivery of Information, Reports and Certain"
"7879","Notifications."
"7880","(a) At least two days prior to the date of the"

"8023","appropriate, and shall work to resolve all open"
"8024","reconciliation items, including trade breaks,"
"8025","contained in such report promptly in the course of its"
"8026","duties hereunder, provided that the Adviser, the"
"8027","Fund's custodian, and accounting agent each provide"
"8028","their reasonable cooperation relating thereto."

"9118","(f) The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not consult with"
"9119","any other known sub-investment adviser for the Fund or"
"9120","the Trust or any other fund under common control with"

"9125","to effect an orderly transition of sub-advisory duties"
"9126","so long as such consultations are not transactions"
"9127","prohibited by Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act."
"9128","(g) On behalf of the Fund, the Adviser hereby authorizes"

"9132","of the Fund which is permitted by Section 11(a) of the"
"9133","Exchange Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder, and on"
"9134","behalf of the Fund, the Adviser hereby consents to the"
"9135","retention of compensation for such transactions in"
"9136","accordance with Rule 11a2-2(T)(a)(2)(iv)."
"9137","Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sub-Adviser agrees"
"9138","that it will not deal with itself, or with known members"
"9139","of the Board or any principal underwriter of the Fund,"
"9140","as principals or agents in making purchases or sales of"
"9141","securities or other property for the account of the"
"9142","Fund, nor will the Sub-Adviser purchase any securities"
"9143","from an underwriting or selling group in which the Sub-"
"9144","Adviser or its affiliates is participating, or arrange"
"9145","for purchases and sales of securities between the Fund"
"9146","and another account advised by the Sub-Adviser or its"
"9147","affiliates, except in each case as permitted by the 1940"
"9148","Act and in accordance with such policies and procedures"
"9149","as may be adopted by the Fund from time to time and"
"9150","disclosed to the Sub-Adviser, and will comply with all"
"9151","other provisions of the Governing Documents and the"
"9152","Fund's then-current Registration Statement relative to"
"9153","the Sub-Adviser and its directors, officers and"
"9154","employees."
"9155","3.	Fund Transactions."
"9156","(a)	In connection with purchases and sales of"
"9157","portfolio securities and other instruments for the"
"9158","account of the Fund, neither the Sub-Adviser nor its"
"9159","affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) or any"
"9160","of their respective partners, officers or employees"
"9161","shall act as principal, except as otherwise permitted by"
"9162","the 1940 Act. The Sub-Adviser or its agents shall"
"9163","arrange for the placing of orders for the purchase and"
"9164","sale of portfolio securities and other financial"
"9165","instruments for the Fund's account either directly with"
"9166","the issuer or with any Counterparty, provided that the"
"9167","Sub-Adviser complies with Section 2(b) with respect to"
"9168","each such Counterparty."
"9169","(b) When placing such orders with a Counterparty or"
"9170","Counterparties, the Sub-Adviser is directed at all times"
"9171","to use reasonable efforts to obtain for the Managed"
"9172","Portion the most favorable execution considering a"
"9173","variety of  circumstances in accordance with the"
"9174","Adviser's and Sub-Adviser's policies. It is also"
"9175","understood that it may be desirable for the Managed"
"9176","Portion that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental"
"9177","investment and market research and security and economic"
"9178","analyses that are consistent with Section 28(e) of the"
"9179","Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934
Act), and are provided by Counterparties who may"
"9180","execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the"
"9181","Managed Portion than may result when allocating"
"9182","brokerage to other brokers solely on the basis of"
"9183","seeking the most favorable price. Therefore, subject to"
"9184","compliance with the safe harbor provided by Section"
"9185","28(e) of the 1934 Act and such other conditions and"
"9186","limitations as may be established by the Adviser from"
"9187","time to time and provided in writing to the Sub-Adviser,"
"9188","if any, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider such"
"9189","brokerage and research services provided to the Managed"
"9190","Portion and other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or"
"9191","any of its affiliates exercises investment discretion"
"9192","and to place orders for the purchase and sale of"
"9193","securities for the Managed Portion with such"
"9194","Counterparties, if the Sub-Adviser determines in good"
"9195","faith that the amount of commissions for executing such"
"9196","portfolio transactions is reasonable in relation to the"
"9197","value of the brokerage and research services provided by"
"9198","such Counterparties, subject to review by the Adviser"
"9199","and the Board from time to time with respect to the"
"9200","extent and continuation of this practice. It is"
"9201","understood that the services provided by such"
"9202","Counterparties may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in"
"9203","connection with its services to other clients. The Sub-"
"9204","Adviser may, on occasions when it deems the purchase or"
"9205","sale of a security to be in the best interests of the"
"9206","Managed Portion as well as its other clients, aggregate,"
"9207","to the extent permitted by applicable laws, rules and"
"9208","regulations, the securities to be sold or purchased. In"
"9209","such event, allocation of the securities so purchased or"
"9210","sold, as well as the expenses incurred in the"
"9211","transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in the"
"9212","manner it considers to be the most equitable and"
"9213","consistent with its obligations to the Managed Portion"
"9214","and to such other clients. The Board may from time to"
"9215","time adopt policies and procedures that modify and/or"
"9216","restrict the Sub-Adviser's authority regarding the"
"9217","execution of the Managed Portion's portfolio"
"9218","transactions provided herein and shall provide any such"
"9219","changes to Sub-Adviser in writing."
"9220","(c) The Sub-Adviser shall not acquire on behalf of the"
"9221","Managed Portion any equity securities registered under"
"9222","Section 12 of the 1934 Act with the purpose or effect,"
"9223","at the time of such acquisition, of changing or"
"9224","influencing control of the issuer of the securities or"
"9225","in connection with or as a participant in any"
"9226","transaction having such purpose or effect, including any"
"9227","transaction subject to Rule 13d-3(b) promulgated under"
"9228","the 1934 Act. For purposes of all applicable filing"
"9229","requirements under the 1934 Act, including without"
"9230","limitation Sections 13(d) and (g), and other laws, the"
"9231","Sub-Adviser shall be deemed to have sole investment"
"9232","discretion with respect to all securities held in the"
"9233","Managed Portion.  If any investments made by the Sub-"
"9234","Adviser on behalf of the Managed Portion are required to"
"9235","be disclosed in any other reports to be filed by the"
"9236","Sub-Adviser with any governmental or self-regulatory"
"9237","agency or organization or exchange, the Sub-Adviser"
"9238","shall provide the Adviser with prompt written notice"
"9239","thereof, setting forth in reasonable detail the nature"
"9240","of the report and the investments of the Managed Portion"
"9241","to be reported."
"9242","(d) The Fund may establish one or more wholly-owned"
"9243","subsidiaries of the Fund through which it may conduct a"
"9244","significant portion of its commodities investing"
"9245","activities or for other investment purposes."
"9246","4. Compensation of the Sub-Adviser."
"9247","(a) For the services provided and the expenses assumed by"
"9248","the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, Adviser, not"
"9249","the Fund, shall pay to the Sub-Adviser a fee, computed"
"9250","daily and payable monthly, in arrears, at an annual rate of"
"9251","the average daily net assets of the Managed Portion that"
"9252","the Sub-Adviser manages (computed in the manner specified"
"9253","in the Investment Advisory Agreement), in accordance with"
"9254","the schedule attached hereto as Exhibit A."
"9255","(b) If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates"
"9256","before the end of any month, the fee for the period from"
"9257","the effective date to the end of the month or from the"
"9258","beginning of such month to the date of termination, as the"
"9259","case may be, shall be pro-rated according to the proportion"
"9260","that such period bears to the full month in which such"
"9261","effectiveness or termination occurs."
"9262","5. Expenses. The Sub-Adviser agrees, at its own expense, to"
"9263","render the services set forth herein and to provide the"
"9264","office space, furnishings, other office equipment and"
"9265","personnel required by it to perform such services on the"
"9266","terms and for the compensation provided in this Agreement."
"9267","The Fund shall be responsible for payment of brokerage"
"9268","commissions, transfer fees, registration costs, transaction-"
"9269","related taxes and other similar costs and transaction-related"
"9270","expenses and fees arising out of transactions effected on"
"9271","behalf of the Fund, including, but not limited to, interest"
"9272","payable on Fund borrowings, which shall be deducted from the"
"9273","Managed Portion. Subject to the foregoing, the Sub-Adviser"
"9274","will pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its"
"9275","activities under this Agreement, including without"
"9276","limitation, all costs associated with attending or otherwise"
"9277","participating in regular or special meetings of the Board or"
"9278","shareholders, or with the Adviser, as reasonably requested,"
"9279","and additions or modifications to the Sub-Adviser's"
"9280","operations necessary to perform its services hereunder in"
"9281","compliance with this Agreement, the Investment Guidelines,"
"9282","any other Board/Adviser Procedures and applicable law.  The"
"9283","Sub-Adviser shall be responsible for its proportionate share"

"10481","for purchases and sales of securities between the Fund"
"10482","and another account advised by the Sub-Adviser or its"
"10483","affiliates, except in each case as permitted by the 1940"
"10484","Act and in accordance with such policies and procedures"
"10485","as may be adopted by the Fund from time to time and"
"10486","disclosed to the Sub-Adviser, and will comply with all"
"10487","other provisions of the Governing Documents and the"
"10488","Fund's then-current Registration Statement relative to"
"10489","the Sub-Adviser and its directors, officers and"
"10490","employees."
"10491","3.	Fund Transactions."
"10492","(a)	In connection with purchases and sales of"
"10493","portfolio securities and other instruments for the"
"10494","account of the Fund, neither the Sub-Adviser nor its"
"10495","affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) or"
"10496","any of their respective partners, officers or"
"10497","employees shall act as principal, except as otherwise"
"10498","permitted by the 1940 Act. The Sub-Adviser or its"
"10499","agents shall arrange for the placing of orders for"
"10500","the purchase and sale of portfolio securities and"
"10501","other financial instruments for the Fund's account"
"10502","either directly with the issuer or with any"
"10503","Counterparty, provided that the Sub-Adviser complies"
"10504","with Section 2(b) with respect to each such"
"10505","Counterparty."
"10506","(b) In the selection of such brokers or dealers and the"
"10507","placing of such orders, the Sub-Adviser is directed at"
"10508","all times to seek to obtain for the Managed Portion the"
"10509","most favorable execution available. It is also"
"10510","understood that it may be desirable for the Managed"
"10511","Portion that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental"
"10512","investment and market research and security and economic"
"10513","analyses that are consistent with Section 28(e) of the"
"10514","Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934
Act), and are provided by brokers who may execute"
"10515","brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Managed"
"10516","Portion than may result when allocating brokerage to"
"10517","other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable"
"10518","price and efficient execution. Therefore, subject to"
"10519","compliance with the safe harbor provided by Section"
"10520","28(e) of the 1934 Act and such other conditions and"
"10521","limitations as may be established by the Adviser from"
"10522","time to time, if any, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to"
"10523","consider such services provided to the Managed Portion"
"10524","and other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or any of"
"10525","its affiliates exercises investment discretion and to"
"10526","place orders for the purchase and sale of securities and"
"10527","other financial instruments for the Managed Portion with"
"10528","such brokers, if the Sub-Adviser determines in good"
"10529","faith that the amount of commissions for executing such"
"10530","portfolio transactions is reasonable in relation to the"
"10531","value of the brokerage and research services provided by"
"10532","such brokers, subject to review by the Adviser and the"
"10533","Board from time to time with respect to the extent and"
"10534","continuation of this practice. It is understood that the"
"10535","services provided by such brokers may be useful to the"
"10536","Sub-Adviser in connection with its services to other"
"10537","clients. The Sub-Adviser may, on occasions when it deems"
"10538","the purchase or sale of a security to be in the best"
"10539","interests of the Managed Portion as well as its other"
"10540","clients, aggregate, to the extent permitted by"
"10541","applicable laws, rules and regulations, the securities"
"10542","and other financial instruments to be sold or purchased"
"10543","in order to obtain the best net price and the most"
"10544","favorable execution. In such event, allocation of the"
"10545","securities and other financial instruments so purchased"
"10546","or sold, as well as the expenses incurred in the"
"10547","transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in the"
"10548","manner it considers to be fair and equitable and"
"10549","consistent with its obligations to the Managed Portion"
"10550","and to such other clients. The Board may from time to"
"10551","time adopt policies and procedures that modify and/or"
"10552","restrict the Sub-Adviser's authority regarding the"
"10553","execution of the Managed Portion's portfolio"
"10554","transactions provided herein."
"10555","(c) The Sub-Adviser shall not acquire on behalf of the"
"10556","Managed Portion any equity securities registered under"

"10569","Adviser on behalf of the Managed Portion are required to"
"10570","be disclosed in any other reports to be filed by the"
"10571","Sub-Adviser with any governmental or self-regulatory"
"10572","agency or organization or exchange, the Sub-Adviser"
"10573","shall provide the Adviser with prompt written notice"
"10574","thereof, setting forth in reasonable detail the nature"
"10575","of the report and the investments of the Managed Portion"
"10576","to be reported."
