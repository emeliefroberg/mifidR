"1455","Trust) as of and for the year ended March 31, 2012, in"
"1456","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1457","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"1458","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1459","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"1460","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1461","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1462","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1463","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"1464","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"1465","express no such opinion."
"1466","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"1467","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1468","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1469","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"1470","benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control"
"1471","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"1472","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"1473","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"1474","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1475","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"1476","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"1477","to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1478","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"1479","the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1480","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1481","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"1482","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1483","fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1484","management and trustees of the trust; and (3) provide"
"1485","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"1486","of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's"
"1487","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1488","statements."
"1489","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1490","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1491","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1492","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1493","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"1494","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1495","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1496","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1497","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1498","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"1499","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1500","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1501","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1502","material misstatement of a fund's annual or interim financial"
"1503","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1504","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1505","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1506","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1507","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1508","standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"1509","Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"1510","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial"

"1649","AMENDMENT effective November 14, 2011, made to the"
"1650","Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust dated January 11,"

"1653","(hereinafter called the Trust), by at least a majority of the"
"1654","Trustees of the Trust in office on November 14, 2011."
"1655","WHEREAS, Section 8.4 of Article VIII of the Declaration"
"1656","empowers a majority of the Trustees of the Trust to amend the"
"1657","Declaration without the vote or consent of Shareholders to make"
"1658","such changes as do not have a materially adverse effect on the"

"1660","NOW, THEREFORE, at least a majority of the duly elected and"
"1661","qualified Trustees do hereby amend the Declaration in the"

"1664","amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:"
"1665","Section 8.2.  Termination of the Trust or a Series or a Class.  (a)"

"1668","of the Shares outstanding and entitled to vote at any meeting of"
"1669","Shareholders of the Trust or the appropriate Series or Class"
"1670","thereof, or by an instrument or instruments in writing without a"
"1671","meeting, consented to by the holder of two-thirds of the Shares"

"1681","in an economically viable manner.  Such factors and events may"
"1682","include (but are not limited to) the inability of a Series or Class"

"1706","liquidate its business."
"1707","(iii)	After paying or adequately providing for the payment"
"1708","of all liabilities, and upon receipt of such releases,"
"1709","indemnities and refunding agreements as they deem"
"1710","necessary for their protection, the Trustee may"
