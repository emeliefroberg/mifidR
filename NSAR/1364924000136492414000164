"9696","deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund,"
"9697","the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall"

"9699","and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and"

"9706","may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and"
"9707","efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes"
"9708","brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such"
"9709","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such"
"9710","broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act.
