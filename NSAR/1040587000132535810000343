"1541","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1542","To the Shareholders and"
"1543","Board of Trustees of Direxion Funds"
"1544","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Direxion Monthly"
"1545","NASDAQ-100 Bull 2X Fund (formerly NASDAQ-100 Bull 2.5X Fund), Direxion Monthly"
"1546","NASDAQ-100 Bear 2X Fund (formerly NASDAQ-100 Bear 2.5X Fund), Direxion Monthly"
"1547","S&P 500 Bull 2X Fund (formerly S&P 500 Bull 2.5X Fund), Direxion Monthly S&P 500"
"1548","Bear 2X Fund (formerly S&P 500 Bear 2.5X Fund), Direxion Monthly Latin America Bull"
"1549","2X Fund (formerly Latin America Bull 2X Fund), Direxion Monthly Dollar Bull 2X Fund"
"1550","(formerly Dollar Bull 2.5X Fund), and Direxion Monthly Dollar Bear 2X Fund (formerly"
"1551","Dollar Bear 2.5X Fund) (the Funds), seven of the series of the Direxion Funds, as of and"
"1552","for the year ended April 30, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1553","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"1554","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"1555","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1556","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1557","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"1558","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1559","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective"
"1560","internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1561","judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"1562","costs of controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"1563","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"1564","and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1565","generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"1566","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1567","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1568","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1569","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1570","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1571","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1572","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1573","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of"
"1574","a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1575","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not"
"1576","prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"1577","future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"1578","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures"
"1579","may deteriorate."
"1580","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or"
"1581","operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1582","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
"1583","basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1584","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1585","misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1586","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1587","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was for the"
"1588","limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"1589","deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"1590","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1591","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"1592","and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be"
"1593","a material weakness as defined above as of April 30, 2010."
"1594","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the Board"
"1595","of Trustees of Direxion Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"1596","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1638","     As of September 30, 2009, each Fund will seek:"
"1639","      .     Calendar month, leveraged investment results. The Funds currently seek daily leveraged"
"1640","investment results."
"1641","      .     Investment results of 200% of the price performance, or the inverse of the price"
"1642","performance of its benchmark index. Certain Funds currently seek investment results of 250% of"
"1643","the daily price performance of their benchmark indices."
"1644","New Investment Strategy"
"1645","Each Bull Fund seeks calendar month exposure to its target index equal to 200% of its net assets"
"1646","while each Bear Fund seeks calendar month exposure to its target index equal to -200% of its net"
"1647","assets. The term calendar month refers to the period from the close of the markets on the last"
"1648","business day of a month until the close of the markets on the last business day of the subsequent"
"1649","month. The pursuit of calendar month leveraged investment results should not be equated"
"1650","with seeking a leveraged goal for longer or shorter than a calendar month."
"1651","Each Fund will reposition its portfolio on the last business day of each calendar month to ensure"
"1652","that the Fund's exposure to its benchmark index is consistent with the Fund's stated goals."
"1653","Therefore, if an investor purchases Fund shares on the last business day of a calendar month, the"
"1654","investor's exposure to the target index would reflect 200%, or -200% of the performance of the"
"1655","index during the next calendar month, subject to applicable charges and expenses, regardless of"
"1656","whether the investor sells the shares during that calendar month."
"1657","The impact of market movements during the calendar month will determine whether the"
"1658","portfolio needs to be repositioned. If the target index rises from the beginning of a calendar"
"1659","month to the end of the calendar month, a Bull Fund's net assets should rise, meaning the Fund's"
"1660","exposure may need to be increased. Conversely, if the target index falls from the beginning of a"
"1661","calendar month to the end of the calendar month, a Bull Fund's net assets should fall, meaning"
"1662","the Fund's exposure may need to be reduced. If the target index rises from the beginning of a"
"1663","calendar month to the end of the calendar month, a Bear Fund's net assets should fall, meaning"
"1664","the Fund's exposure may need to be reduced. If the target index falls from the beginning of a"
"1665","calendar month to the end of the calendar month, a Bear Fund's net assets should rise, meaning"
"1666","the Fund's exposure may need to be increased. A Fund's portfolio may also need to be changed"
"1667","to reflect changes in the composition of an index. Rafferty increases the Fund's exposure when"
"1668","its assets rise and reduces the Fund's exposure when its assets fall."
"1669","Calendar month rebalancing will impair a Fund's performance if the benchmark experiences"
"1670","volatility. For instance, a hypothetical 2X Bull Fund would be expected to lose 15%, and a"
"1671","hypothetical 2X Bear Fund would be expected to lose 45% if the Funds' benchmark provided no"
"1672","return over a one year period during which its benchmark experienced annualized volatility of"
"1673","40%. At higher ranges of volatility, there is a chance of a near complete loss of Fund value even"
"1674","if the benchmark is flat. For instance, if annualized volatility of the benchmark is 90%, both a"
"1675","Bull and a Bear Fund targeted to the same benchmark would be expected to lose more than 76%"
"1676","and 99% respectively, of their value even if the cumulative benchmark return for the year"
"1677","was0%. An index's volatility rate is a statistical measure of the magnitude of fluctuations in the"
"1678","returns of an index"
"1679","Intra-Calendar Month Purchases"
"1680","An investor who purchases shares on a day other than the last business day of a calendar month"
"1681","will generally receive more, or less, than 200% exposure to the target index, depending on the"
"1682","performance of the target index from the end of the calendar month until the point of purchase. If"
"1683","the target index moves in a direction favorable to the Fund, the investor will receive exposure to"
"1684","the target index less than 200%. Conversely, if the target index moves in a direction adverse to"
"1685","the Fund, the investor will receive exposure to the target index greater than 200%. Investors may"
"1686","consult the Direxion Funds' website at any point during the month to determine how the current"
"1687","value of a Fund's target index relates to the value of the target index at the end of the prior"
"1688","calendar month."
"1689","Shares Held Longer than a Calendar Month"
"1690","The pursuit of calendar month leveraged investment results should not be equated with seeking a"
"1691","leveraged goal for longer than a calendar month. For example, if the S&P 500 Index gains 10%"
"1692","during a year, the Direxion Monthly S&P 500 Bull 2X"
"1693","Fund should not be expected to provide a return of 20% for the year even if it meets its calendar"
"1694","month target throughout the year. This is true because the pursuit of calendar month goals may"
"1695","result in calendar month leveraged compounding, which means that the return of an index over a"
"1696","period of time greater than one calendar month multiplied by 200%, in the case of a Bull Fund,"
"1697","or -200%, in the case of a Bear Fund, generally will not equal a Fund's performance over that"
"1698","same period."
"1699","Risk Factors"
"1700","An investment in the Funds will entail certain risks, including, without limitation:"
"1701","	.    Performance Risk. A Fund's performance for a period of less than a"
"1702","	full calendar    month or a  period of more than a full calendar month may"
"1703","        differ very substantially from 200% of --200% of the performance of the Fund's"
"1704","	benchmark index for the same period."
"1705","      .     Gain Limitation Risk. The Funds' investment adviser, Rafferty Asset"
"1706","      Management, LLC will attempt to position each Fund's portfolio to ensure"
"1707","      that a Fund does not lose more than 90% of its net asset value in a given"
"1708","      calendar month. The cost of such downside protection will be limitations"
"1709","      on a Fund's gains. As a consequence, a Fund's portfolio may not be"
"1710","      responsive to index movements beyond 45% in a given calendar month in a"
"1711","      direction favorable to a Fund."
"1712","      .     Intra-Calendar Month Investment Risk. The Funds seek calendar month"
"1713","      leveraged investment results which should not be equated with seeking a"
"1714","      leveraged goal for shorter than a calendar month. Thus, an investor who"
"1715","      purchases shares on a day other than the last business day of a calendar"
"1716","      month will likely have more, or less, than 200% leveraged investment"
"1717","      exposure to the target index, depending upon the movement of the target"
"1718","      index from the end of the prior calendar month until the point of"
"1719","      purchase."
"1720","      .     Monthly Correlation Risk. There can be no guarantee that a Fund will"
"1721","      achieve a high degree of correlation with its investment objective"
"1722","      relative to its benchmark index. A failure to achieve a high degree of"
"1723","      correlation may prevent a Fund from achieving its investment objective."
"1724","      .     Negative Implications of Monthly Goals in Volatile Markets. Monthly"
"1725","      repositioning will impair a Fund's performance if the benchmark"
"1726","      experiences volatility. For instance, a hypothetical 2X Fund, whether Bull"
"1727","      or Bear, would be expected to lose 1.18% if its benchmark was flat over a"
"1728","      hypothetical one-year period during which its benchmark experienced"
"1729","      annualized volatility of 15%. If the benchmark's annualized volatility was"
"1730","      to rise to 40%, the hypothetical loss for a one-year period would widen to"
"1731","      approximately 12.11%."
"1732","The Funds are not suitable for all investors. The Funds should be utilized only by sophisticated"
"1733","investors who (a) understand the risks associated with the use of leverage, (b) understand the"
"1734","consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results, (c) understand the risk of shorting"
"1735","and (d) intend to actively monitor and manage their investments. Investors who do not"
"1736","understand the Funds or do not intend to actively monitor and manage the Funds should not buy"
"1737","the Funds. There is no assurance that the Funds will achieve their objectives and an investment"
"1738","in a Fund could lose money. No single Fund is a complete investment program."

"1763","The Board of Trustees of Direxion Funds has approved a reverse split of the issued and"
"1764","outstanding shares of the Direxion Monthly Small Cap Bear 2X Fund (Small Cap Bear Fund),"
"1765","Direxion Monthly Emerging Markets Bear 2X Fund (Emerging Markets Bear Fund), Direxion"
"1766","Monthly Developed Markets Bear 2X Fund (Developed Markets Bear Fund), Direxion"
"1767","Monthly NASDAQ-100(r) Bear 2X Fund (NASDAQ-100 Bear Fund), and Direxion Monthly"
"1768","S&P 500(r) Bear 2X Fund (S&P 500 Bear Fund) (collectively, the Funds)."
"1769","Shareholders of record of the Small Cap Bear Fund, the Emerging Markets Bear"
"1770","Fund, the Developed Markets Bear Fund, the NASDAQ-100 Bear Fund and the S&P 500"
"1771","Bear Fund on February 12, 2010 will participate in the reverse split.  After the close of the"
"1772","markets on February 12, 2010, the Small Cap Bear Fund and the Emerging Markets Bear Fund"
"1773","will effect a one for ten reverse split of each Fund's issued and outstanding shares and the"
"1774","Developed Markets Bear Fund, the NASDAQ-100 Bear Fund and the S&P 500 Bear Fund will"
"1775","effect a one for five reverse split of each Fund's issued and outstanding shares."
"1776","As a result of the reverse split, every ten shares of the Small Cap Bear Fund and the Emerging"
"1777","Markets Bear Fund will be exchanged for one share of the applicable Fund.  Accordingly, the"
"1778","number of each Fund's issued and outstanding shares will decrease by 90% and the Fund's per"
"1779","share net asset value (NAV) will increase ten fold.  Similarly, every five shares of the"
"1780","Developed Markets Bear Fund, the NASDAQ-100 Bear Fund and the S&P 500 Bear Fund will"
"1781","be exchanged for one share of the applicable Fund.  Therefore, the number of each Fund's issued"
"1782","and outstanding shares will decrease by approximately 80% and the Fund's per share NAV will"
"1783","increase five fold."
"1784","The shares of each Fund will be offered on a split-adjusted basis on February 16, 2010.  The"
"1785","value of a shareholder's investment will not be affected by a reverse split.  The tables below"
