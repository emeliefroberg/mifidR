"1877","<TEXT>"
"1878","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1879","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1880","Franklin Alternative Strategies Funds:"
"1881","In planning and performing our audits of the (consolidated) financial"
"1882","statements of Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund, Franklin K2"
"1883","Alternative Strategies Fund and Franklin K2 Long Short Credit Fund"
"1884","(three of the Funds comprising Franklin Alternative Strategies Funds)"
"1885","(collectively, the Funds) as of May 31, 2016 and for the year ended"
"1886","May 31, 2016 for Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund and Franklin"
"1887","K2 Alternative Strategies Fund and for the period from September 8, 2015"
"1888","(commencement of operations) through May 31, 2016 for Franklin K2 Long"
"1889","Short Credit Fund, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1890","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"1891","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1892","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"1893","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"1894","to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1895","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control"
"1896","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1897","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"1898","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1899","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"1900","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1901","controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1902","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1903","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1904","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1905","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"1906","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1907","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1908","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"1909","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1910","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"1911","with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1912","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"1913","authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)"
"1914","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"1915","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"1916","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1917","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1918","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"1919","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1920","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1921","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1922","procedures may deteriorate."
"1923","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1924","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1925","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"1926","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"1927","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1928","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1929","possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or"
"1930","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"1931","timely basis."
"1932","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"1933","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"1934","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might"
"1935","be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1936","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"1937","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and"
"1938","its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we"
"1939","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of May 31, 2016."
"1940","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"1941","and Board of Trustees of Franklin Alternative Strategies Funds and the"
"1942","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should"
"1943","not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."
