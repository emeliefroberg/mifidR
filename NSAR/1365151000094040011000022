"1473","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1474","To the Board of Trustees of BHR Institutional Funds"
"1475","and the Shareholders of the AG Small Cap Core Fund,"
"1476","Clarivest International Equity Fund, Clarivest SMid Cap Growth Fund,"
"1477","Mount Lucas U.S. Focused Equity Fund, and Smith Group Large Cap Core"
"1478","Growth Fund"
"1479","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"1480","the AG Small Cap Core Fund, Clarivest International Equity Fund,"
"1481","Clarivest SMid Cap Core Growth Fund, Mount Lucas U.S. Focused Equity"
"1482","Fund, and Smith Group Large Cap Core Growth Fund, each a series of"
"1483","shares of BHR Institutional Funds (the Funds), as of September 30,"
"1484","2008 and for each of the Funds' respective years or periods then"
"1485","ended, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1486","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered their"
"1487","internal control over financial reporting, including control"
"1488","activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1489","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1490","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"1491","SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1492","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1493","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1494","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"1495","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1496","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1497","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"1498","costs of controls. A Fund's internal control over financial"
"1499","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1500","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1501","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1502","accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of"
"1503","America.  A Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"1504","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1505","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1506","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"1507","the Fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1508","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"1509","in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the"
"1510","United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1511","Fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1512","management and trustees of the Fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1513","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1514","acquisition, use or disposition of a Fund's assets that could have a"
"1515","material effect on the financial statements."
"1516","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1517","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"1518","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1519","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"1520","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1521","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1522","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1523","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"1524","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1525","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"1526","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"1527","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1528","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's"
"1529","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1530","detected on a timely basis."
"1531","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1532","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1533","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1534","internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"1535","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1536","States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the internal control"
"1537","over financial reporting and its operations, including controls for"
"1538","safeguarding securities that we consider to be material weaknesses,"
"1539","as defined above, as of September 30, 2008."
"1540","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1541","management and the Board of Trustees of BHR Institutional Funds, the"
"1542","shareholders of AG Small Cap Core Fund, Clarivest International"
"1543","Equity Fund, Clarivest SMid Cap Core Growth Fund, Mount Lucas U.S."
"1544","Focused Equity Fund, and Smith Group Large Cap Core Growth Fund, and"
