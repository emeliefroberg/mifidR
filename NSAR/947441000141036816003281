"441","<DESCRIPTION>AUDITOR LETTER"
"442","<TEXT>"
"443","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING"
"444","FIRM"
"445","To the Board of Directors of Holland Series Fund,"
"446","Inc."
"447","and the Shareholders of Holland Balanced Fund"
"448","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"449","financial statements of the Holland Balanced Fund"
"450","(the"
"451","Fund), a series of shares of beneficial interest"
"452","in the Holland Series Fund, Inc., as of September"
"453","30,"
"454","2016 and for the year then ended, in accordance"
"455","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"456","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we"
"457","considered the Fund's internal control over"
"458","financial"
"459","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"460","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"461","procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"462","opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"463","with the"
"464","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"465","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"466","the"
"467","Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"468","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"469","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"470","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"471","control"
"472","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"473","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"474","management are"
"475","required to assess the expected benefits and"
"476","related costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"477","control over"
"478","financial reporting is a process designed to"
"479","provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"480","reliability of"
"481","financial reporting and the preparation of"
"482","financial statements for external purposes in"
"483","accordance with"
"484","accounting principles generally accepted in the"
"485","United States of America (GAAP).  A company's"
"486","internal control over financial reporting includes"
"487","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"488","the"
"489","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"490","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"491","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"492","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"493","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the"
"494","financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and"
"495","that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"496","being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"497","of"
"498","management and trustees of the company; and (3)"
"499","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"500","or"
"501","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"502","or disposition of a company's assets that could"
"503","have a"
"504","material effect on the financial statements."
"505","Because of inherent limitations, internal control"
"506","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"507","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"508","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"509","the"
"510","risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"511","changes in conditions or that the degree of"
"512","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"513","deteriorate."
"514","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"515","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"516","control"
"517","does not allow management or employees, in the"
"518","normal course of performing their assigned"
"519","functions, to"
"520","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"521","A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination"
"522","of"
"523","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"524","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"525","possibility that a"
"526","material misstatement of the Fund's annual or"
"527","interim financial statements will not be prevented"
"528","or"
"529","detected on a timely basis."
"530","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control"
"531","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"532","purpose"
"533","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"534","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"535","control that"
"536","might be material weaknesses under standards"
"537","established by the PCAOB.  However, we noted no"
"538","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over"
"539","financial reporting and its operation, including"
"540","controls over"
"541","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"542","material weakness, as defined above, as of"
"543","September"
"544","30, 2016."
"545","This report is intended solely for the information"
"546","and use of management, the shareholders of the"
"547","Holland"
"548","Balanced Fund, the Board of Directors of Holland"
"549","Balanced Fund and the Securities and Exchange"
"550","Commission and is not intended to be and should not"
"551","be used by anyone other than these specified"
"552","parties."
