"1004","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1005","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"1006","Franklin California Tax-Free Trust"
"1007","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Franklin"
"1008","California Intermediate-Term Tax-Free Income Fund, Franklin California"
"1009","Insured Tax-Free Income Fund and Franklin California Tax-Exempt Money Fund"
"1010","(constituting portfolios of Franklin California Tax-Free Trust) (the Funds)"
"1011","as of and for the year ended June 30, 2014, in accordance with the standards"
"1012","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1013","considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1014","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1015","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1016","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1017","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"1018","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion"
"1019","on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"1020","The management of the Funds' is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1021","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1022","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1023","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal"
"1024","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1025","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1026","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"1027","with generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control"
"1028","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"1029","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1030","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"1031","of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"1032","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"1033","with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1034","expenditures  of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"1035","authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"1036","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1037","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could"
"1038","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1039","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1040","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"1041","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"1042","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"1043","that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1044","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1045","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1046","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1047","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1048","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1049","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1050","misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not"
"1051","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1052","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"1053","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1054","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"1055","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"1056","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we"
"1057","noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"1058","and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"1059","consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of June 30, 2014."
"1060","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"1061","the Board of Trustees of Franklin California Intermediate-Term Tax-Free"
"1062","Income Fund, Franklin California Insured Tax-Free Income Fund and Franklin"
