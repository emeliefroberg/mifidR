"1415","The Steward Funds have been named as defendants and as putative members of"
"1416","a proposed defendant class in Kirschner v. FitzSimons (In re Tribune Co.),"
"1417","No. 12-2652 (S.D.N.Y.) (the FitzSimons action) and Deutsche Bank Trust Co."
"1418","Americas v. Employees Retirement Fund of the City of Dallas, Texas, No."
"1419","11-9568 (S.D.N.Y.) (the Deutsche Bank action) as a result of the sale by"
"1420","Steward Large Cap Enhanced Index Fund (then known as Steward Domestic All-Cap"
"1421","Equity Fund) and Steward Multi- Manager Equity Fund (a fund that is no longer"
"1422","in existence) of their shares in the Tribune Company (Tribune) in a 2007"
"1423","leveraged buyout transaction (LBO) by which Tribune converted to a"
"1424","privately-held company. Both lawsuits have been consolidated with the majority"
"1425","of the other Tribune-related lawsuits in the multidistrict litigation"
"1426","proceeding In re Tribune Co. Fraudulent Conveyance Litig., No. 11-2296"
"1427","(S.D.N.Y.) (the MDL Proceeding). None of these lawsuits alleges any"
"1428","wrongdoing on the part of the Steward Funds. On September 23, 2013, the Court"
"1429","granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the Deutsche Bank action on the"
"1430","basis that the plaintiffs lacked standing. Both sides appealed the decision to"
"1431","the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On March 29, 2016, the U.S."
"1432","Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued its opinion on the appeal of"
"1433","the Deutsche Bank action and other similar Tribune-related lawsuits. The"
"1434","appeals court affirmed the district court's dismissal of those lawsuits, but"
"1435","on different grounds than the district court. The appeals court held that"
"1436","while the plaintiffs have standing under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (which was"
"1437","the basis for the district court's dismissal), their claims were preempted by"
"1438","Section 546(e) of the Bankruptcy Code - the statutory safe harbor for"
"1439","settlement payments. On April 12, 2016, the plaintiffs in those actions filed"
"1440","a motion seeking an en banc hearing before the appeals court. On July 22, 2016,"
"1441","the appeals court denied the petition. On September 9, 2016, the plaintiffs"
"1442","filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court challenging"
"1443","the Second Circuit's decision that the safe harbor of Section 546(e) applied"
"1444","to their claims. The shareholder defendants, including the Funds, filed a"
"1445","joint brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari on October 24, 2016."
"1446","The plaintiffs filed a reply in support of the petition on November 4, 2016."
"1447","The Supreme Court has not yet granted or denied the petition for certiorari."
"1448","On May 23, 2014, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the Fifth Amended"
"1449","Complaint in the FitzSimons action, including a global motion to dismiss"
"1450","Count I, which is the claim brought against former Tribune shareholders for"
"1451","intentional fraudulent conveyance under U.S. federal law. On January 6, 2017,"
"1452","the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York"
"1453","granted the shareholder defendants' motion to dismiss the intentional"
"1454","fraudulent conveyance claim in the FitzSimons action. The court also denied"
"1455","plaintiff's request to amend the complaint. The court concluded that the"
"1456","plaintiff failed to plead facts showing that the Independent Directors of"
"1457","Tribune possessed actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud Tribune's"
"1458","creditors through the LBO. It also declined to impute the alleged fraudulent"
"1459","intent of certain officers to the corporation. While the District Court's"
"1460","order granting the motion to dismiss is not immediately appealable, the"
"1461","plaintiff has asked the Court to direct entry of a final judgment in order"
"1462","to make the order immediately appealable. On February 23, 2017, the Court"
"1463","issued an order stating that it intends to permit an interlocutory appeal"
"1464","of the dismissal order, but will wait to do so until it has resolved"
"1465","outstanding motions to dismiss filed by other defendants. Accordingly, the"
"1466","timing of the appeal is uncertain. At this state of the proceedings, the"
"1467","Steward Funds are not able to make a reliable prediction as to these"
"1468","lawsuits or the effect, if any, on the net asset value of the Funds."

"1476","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1477","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Steward Funds, Inc."
"1478","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Steward"
"1479","Funds, Inc., comprising Steward Large Cap Enhanced Index Fund, Steward"
"1480","Small-Mid Cap Enhanced Index Fund, Steward International Enhanced Index Fund,"
"1481","Steward Select Bond Fund, and Steward Global Equity Income Fund (the Funds),"
"1482","as of and for the year ended April 30, 2017, in accordance with the standards"
"1483","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1484","considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1485","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1486","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1487","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1488","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"1489","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1490","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1491","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1492","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1493","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"1494","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1495","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1496","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1497","accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A fund's internal control over"
"1498","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"1499","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1500","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"1501","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1502","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that"
"1503","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"1504","authorizations of management and directors of the fund; and (3) provide"
"1505","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1506","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"1507","effect on the financial statements."
"1508","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1509","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1510","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1511","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1512","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1513","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1514","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1515","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1516","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1517","or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1518","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1519","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"1520","on a timely basis."
"1521","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"1522","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1523","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"1524","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1525","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1526","in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1527","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"1528","material weakness as defined above as of April 30, 2017."
"1529","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"1530","the Board of Directors of the Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission"
