"504","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"505","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"506","Aspiriant Risk-Managed Global Equity Fund of the Aspiriant Trust:"
"507","We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities"
"508","of the Aspiriant Risk-Managed Global Equity Fund (the Fund), including"
"509","the schedule of investments, as of February 28, 2015, and the related"
"510","statement of operations for the year then ended, and the statements of"
"511","changes in net assets and the financial highlights for the year then"
"512","ended and the period April 4, 2013 to February 28, 2014. These financial"
"513","statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Funds"
"514","management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these"
"515","financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits."
"516","We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"517","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards"
"518","require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable"
"519","assurance about whether the financial statements and financial"
"520","highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund is not required"
"521","to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal"
"522","control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of"
"523","internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing"
"524","audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not"
"525","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"526","Funds internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"527","express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test"
"528","basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the"
"529","financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and"
"530","significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the"
"531","overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included"
"532","confirmation of securities owned as of February 28, 2015, by"
"533","correspondence with the custodian and brokers; where replies were"
"534","not received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures."
"535","We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion."
"536","In our opinion, such financial statements and financial highlights"
"537","referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the"
"538","financial position of the Fund as of February 28, 2015, the results"
"539","of its operations for the year then ended, and the changes in its"
"540","net assets and the financial highlights for the year then ended and"
"541","the period April 4, 2013 to February 28, 2014, in conformity with"
"542","accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of"
"543","America."
