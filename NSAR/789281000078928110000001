"746","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"747","Management of the Fund is responsible for establi"
"748","shing and maintaining effective internal control"
"749","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this resp"
"750","onsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"751","are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"752"," related costs of controls. A company's internal"
"753","control over financial reporting is a process de"
"754","signed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"755","the reliability of financial reporting and the pre"
"756","paration of financial statements for external"
"757","purposes in accordance with generally accepted acc"
"758","ounting principles. A company's internal"
"759","control over financial reporting includes those pol"
"760","icies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"761","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"762"," accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"763","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) prov"
"764","ide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"765","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of fina"
"766","ncial statements in accordance with generally"
"767","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts a"
"768","nd expenditures of the company are being made"
"769","in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"770","directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"771","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"772","detection of the unauthorized acquisition,"
"773","use, or disposition of the company's assets that cou"
"774","ld have a material affect on the financial"
"775","statements."
"776","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"777"," over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"778","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evalua"
"779","tion of effectiveness to future periods are"
"780","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequat"
"781","e because of changes in conditions, or that"
"782","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedur"
"783","es may deteriorate."
"784","A deficiency in internal control over financial report"
"785","ing exists when the design or operation of a"
"786","control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"787"," normal course of performing their"
"788","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"789"," on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"790","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in intern"
"791","al control over financial reporting, such that"
"792","there is a reasonable possibility that a material miss"
"793","tatement of the Fund's annual or interim"
"794","financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"795"," on a timely basis."
"796","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"797","financial reporting was for the limited"
"798","purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"799"," necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"800","internal control that might be material weaknesses und"
"801","er standards established by the Public"
"802","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). How"
"803","ever, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"804","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and it"
"805","s operation, including controls over"
"806","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a materi"
"807","al weakness as defined above as of"
"808","November 30, 2009."
