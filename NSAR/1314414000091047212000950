"479","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"480","To the Shareholders of Adaptive Allocation Fund and"
"481","Board of Trustees of Northern Lights Fund Trust"
"482","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"483","statements of Adaptive Allocation Fund a series of"
"484","shares of beneficial interest of Northern Lights Fund"
"485","Trust the Fund as of and for the year ended"
"486","January 31 2012 in accordance with the standards"
"487","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"488","United States PCAOB we considered its internal"
"489","control over financial reporting including controls"
"490","over safeguarding securities as a basis for"
"491","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"492","of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"493","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"494","Form N-SAR but not for the purpose of expressing"
"495","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds"
"496","internal control over financial reporting."
"497","Accordingly we express no such opinion."
"498","The management of Northern Lights Fund Trust is"
"499","responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"500","effective internal control over financial"
"501","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility"
"502","estimates and judgments by management are"
"503","required to assess the expected benefits and"
"504","related costs of controls.  A companys"
"505","internal control over financial reporting"
"506","is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"507","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"508","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"509","statements for external purposes in accordance"
"510","with accounting principles generally accepted"
"511","in the United States of America GAAP.  A"
"512","companys internal control over financial"
"513","reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"514","that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records"
"515","that in reasonable detail accurately and"
"516","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"517","of the assets of the company 2 provide"
"518","reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"519","recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"520","of the financial statements in accordance with"
"521","GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of"
"522","the company are being made only in accordance"
"523","with authorizations of management and trustees"
"524","of the company and 3 provide reasonable"
"525","assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"526","detection of unauthorized acquisition use"
"527","or disposition of a companys assets that"
"528","could have a material effect on the financial"
"529","statements."
"530","Because of its inherent limitations internal"
"531","control over financial reporting may not"
"532","prevent or detect misstatements.  Also"
"533","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"
"534","to future periods are subject to the risk"
"535","that controls may become inadequate because"
"536","of changes in conditions or that the degree"
"537","of compliance with the policies or procedures"
"538","may deteriorate."
"539","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"540","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"541","a control does not allow management or employees"
"542","in the normal course of performing their"
"543","assigned functions to prevent or detect"
"544","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"545","weakness is a deficiency or combination of"
"546","deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"547","reporting such that there is a reasonable"
"548","possibility that a material misstatement of"
"549","the Funds annual or interim financial"
"550","statements will not be prevented or detected"
"551","on a timely basis."
"552","Our consideration of the Funds internal"
"553","control over financial reporting was for"
"554","the limited purpose described in the first"
"555","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"556","disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"557","that might be material weaknesses under"
"558","standards established by the PCAOB.  However"
"559","we noted no deficiencies in the internal"
"560","control over financial reporting and its"
"561","operations including controls for"
"562","safeguarding securities that we consider"
"563","to be material weaknesses as defined"
"564","above as of January 31 2012."
"565","This report is intended solely for the"
"566","information and use of management the"
"567","shareholders of Adaptive Allocation Fund"
"568","the Board of Trustees of Northern Lights"
"569","Fund Trust and the Securities and Exchange"
"570","Commission and is not intended to be and"
"571","should not be used by anyone other than"
"572","these specified parties."
