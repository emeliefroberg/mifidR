"590","SETTLED  ENFORCEMENT  ACTIONS  AND  INVESTIGATIONS  RELATED  TO  MARKET  TIMING"
"591","     On  October  8, 2004, Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco), successor by merger"
"592","to  Invesco  Aim Advisors, Inc. and INVESCO Funds Group, Inc. (IFG), both former"
"593","investment  advisers,  along  with  Invesco  Aim  Distributors,  n/k/a  Invesco"
"594","Distributors, Inc. (Invesco Distributors) reached final settlements with certain"
"595","regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York"
"596","Attorney General and the Colorado Attorney General, to resolve civil enforcement"
"597","actions  and/or  investigations related to market timing and related activity in"
"598","the  AIM  Funds  (n/k/a  the Invesco Funds), including those formerly advised by"
"599","IFG.  As  part  of  the  settlements,  a $325 million fair fund ($110 million of"
"600","which  is  civil  penalties)  was  created  to compensate shareholders harmed by"
"601","market  timing  and  related  activity  in  funds  formerly  advised  by  IFG."
"602","Additionally,  Invesco  and Invesco Distributors created a $50 million fair fund"
"603","($30  million  of which is civil penalties) to compensate shareholders harmed by"
"604","market  timing  and related activity in funds advised by Invesco, which was done"
"605","pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the settlement.  The methodology of the fair funds"
"606","distributions  was  determined  by Invesco's independent distribution consultant"
"607","(IDC  Plan),  in  consultation  with Invesco and the independent trustees of the"
"608","Invesco  Funds,  and  approved  by  the  SEC  on  May  23,  2008."
"609","     The IDC Plan provides for distribution to all eligible investors, for the"
"610","periods spanning January 1, 2000 through July 31, 2003 (for the IFG Fair Fund)"
"611","and January 1, 2001 through September 30, 2003 (for the AIM Fair Fund), their"
"612","proportionate share of the applicable Fair Fund to compensate such investors for"
"613","injury they may have suffered as a result of market timing in the affected"
"614","funds. The IDC Plan includes a provision for any residual amounts in the Fair"
"615","Funds to be distributed in the future to the affected funds. Further details"
"616","regarding the IDC Plan and distributions thereunder are available on Invesco's"
"617","Web site, available at http://www.invesco.com/us."
"618","Pending Regulatory Action Alleging Market Timing"
"619","     On  August  30,  2005,  the  West  Virginia  Office  of the State Auditor -"
"620","Securities  Commission  (WVASC)  issued  a Summary Order to Cease and Desist and"
"621","Notice  of  Right  to Hearing to Invesco and Invesco Distributors (collectively,"
"622","Invesco)  (Order  No.  05-1318).  The  WVASC  made findings of fact that Invesco"
"623","allegedly  entered  into  certain  arrangements  permitting market timing of the"
"624","Invesco  Funds and failed to disclose these arrangements in the prospectuses for"
"625","such  Funds, and conclusions of law to the effect that Invesco violated the West"
"626","Virginia  securities  laws.  The  WVASC  ordered  Invesco  to  cease any further"
"627","violations  and  sought  to  impose monetary sanctions, including restitution to"
"628","affected  investors,  disgorgement  of  fees,  reimbursement  of  investigatory,"
"629","administrative  and  legal  costs  and  an  administrative  assessment  to  be"
"630","determined  by the Commissioner.  Invesco is not aware of any further efforts by"
"631","WVASC  to  pursue  the  prosecution  of  this matter.  Invesco settled all other"
"632","regulatory  investigations  related  to market timing, resulting in: 1) affected"
"633","shareholders  receiving  restitution;  2)  Invesco paying disgorgement and civil"
"634","penalties;  and  3)  Invesco  taking  remedial actions to prevent market timing."
"635","Accordingly,  Invesco  considers  this  matter  resolved."
"636","Private  Civil  Actions  Alleging  Market  Timing"
"637","     Multiple  civil  lawsuits, including purported class action and shareholder"
"638","derivative  suits,  were  filed against various parties (including, depending on"
"639","the  lawsuit, certain Invesco Funds, IFG, Invesco, Invesco Aim Management Group,"
"640","Inc., n/k/a Invesco Management Group, Inc. and certain related entities, certain"
"641","of  their  current  and  former officers and/or certain unrelated third parties)"
"642","based  on  allegations  of  improper  market  timing and related activity in the"
"643","Invesco  Funds.  The  lawsuits  were  transferred  to the United States District"
"644","Court  for  the  District  of  Maryland  (the  MDL  Court)  for  consolidated or"
"645","coordinated  pre-trial  proceedings.  Pursuant  to  an  Order  of the MDL Court,"
"646","plaintiffs  in  these  lawsuits  consolidated  their  claims  into three amended"
"647","complaints  against  various  Invesco  -  and  IFG-related parties, as described"
"648","below."

"671","     The  MDL  Court  formally  approved  the  settlements  and  dismissed  with"
