"1244","To the Board of Directors of AllianceBernstein Cap"
"1245","Fund, Inc. and Shareholders of AllianceBernstein"
"1246","International Discovery Equity Portfolio:"
"1247","In planning and performing our audit of"
"1248","the financial statements of AllianceBernstein"
"1249","Cap Fund, Inc.  AllianceBernstein International"
"1250","Discovery Equity Portfolio (the Fund) as of and"
"1251","for the period ended June 30, 2011, in accordance"
"1252","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1253","Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"1254","the Funds internal control over financial reporting,"
"1255","including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"1256","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"1257","the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1258","the financial statements and to comply with"
"1259","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"1260","the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1261","the effectiveness of the Funds internal control"
"1262","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express"
"1263","no such opinion."
"1264","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"1265","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1266","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"1267","this responsibility, estimates and judgments"
"1268","by management are required to assess the expected"
"1269","benefits and related costs of controls. A funds"
"1270","internal control over financial reporting is"
"1271","a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1272","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"1273","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1274","statements for external purposes in accordance"
"1275","with generally accepted accounting principles."
"1276","A funds internal control over financial reporting"
"1277","includes those policies and procedures that"
"1278","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"1279","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1280","reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"1281","the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"1282","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1283","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1284","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"1285","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1286","expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"1287","accordance with authorizations of management"
"1288","and directors of the fund; and (3) provide"
"1289","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"1290","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"1291","or disposition of a funds assets that could"
"1292","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1293","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1294","control over financial reporting may not prevent"
"1295","or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"1296","any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1297","periods are subject to the risk that controls"
"1298","may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1299","conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"1300","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1301","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1302","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"1303","a control does not allow management or employees,"
"1304","in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1305","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1306","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1307","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1308","control over financial reporting, such that there"
"1309","is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1310","misstatement of the funds annual or interim financial"
"1311","statements will not be prevented or detected"
"1312","on a timely basis."
"1313","Our consideration of the Funds internal control"
"1314","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"1315","purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"1316","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"1317","in internal control that might be material"
"1318","weaknesses under standards established by"
"1319","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1320","(United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1321","in the Funds internal control over financial"
"1322","reporting and its operation, including controls"
"1323","over safeguarding securities, that we consider"
"1324","to be a material weakness as defined above"
"1325","as of June 30, 2011."
"1326","This report is intended solely for the information"
