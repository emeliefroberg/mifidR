"610","the Funds' investments in various securities or other assets, in investment"

"628","the industries in which they engage, or the economic, social or political"
"629","conditions prevailing in each country in which a Fund maintains investments. The"
"630","Adviser will also furnish the Board with such statistical and analytical"

"644","the Adviser of its responsibilities or liabilities hereunder and provided"
"645","further that the Adviser shall not have the authority to sub-contract advisory"
"646","responsibilities without the consent of the Trust. The cost of performance of"

"662","Agreement required to be prepared and maintained by the Trust pursuant to the"
"663","rules and regulations of any national, state, or local government entity with"

"670","the Adviser to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives."
"671","     (e) With respect to a Fund, the Adviser shall have no duties or obligations"

"691","Sub-Adviser's employment will be evidenced by a separate written agreement"

"701","terminate any Sub-Adviser and reassume the responsibilities assigned to such"
"702","Sub-Adviser with respect to any Fund without obtaining the approval of the"
"703","shareholders of the Fund."

"731","transaction for a Fund, the Adviser will consider among other things: the best"
"732","net price available, the reliability, integrity and financial condition of the"
"733","broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value"
"734","of the expected contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing"
"735","basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any transaction may be less"
"736","favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the difference is"
"737","reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio execution services"
"738","offered. Subject to such policies as the Board may from time to time determine,"
"739","the Adviser shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any"
"740","duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a"
"741","Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and research services to"
"742","the Adviser an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"743","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would"
"744","have charged for effecting that transaction, if the Adviser determines in good"
"745","faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of"
"746","the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in"
"747","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of"
"748","the Adviser with respect to the Fund and to other clients of the"

"752","on behalf of the Funds to brokers and dealers who also provide brokerage and"
"753","research services within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange"
"754","Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith. Such allocation shall be in such"
"755","amounts and proportions as the Adviser shall determine and the Adviser will"
"756","report on said allocations regularly to the Board, indicating the brokers to"
"757","whom such allocations have been made and the basis therefore."
"758","     SECTION 9. EXPENSES. All of the ordinary business expenses incurred in the"
"759","operations of the Funds and the offering of their shares shall be borne by the"
"760","Funds unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement. The expenses"
"761","borne by the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage commissions,"

"795","investment assets in two or more registered, open-end management investment"

"797","12(d)(1)(G) under the Act, the rules thereunder or an exemptive order"

"813","not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Adviser shall be free to render"
"814","investment advisory or other services to others (including other investment"
"815","companies) and to engage in other activities. It is understood and agreed that"

"849","voting securities, or by the Adviser, on sixty (60) days' written notice to the"

"905","     SECTION 20. AMENDMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. This Agreement supersedes the"

"907","of this Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, but"
"908","only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which enforcement"
"909","of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought. If shareholder"

"916","property right of the parent of the Adviser. The Trust agrees and consents that:"
"917","(i) it will use the words Wells Fargo as a component of its corporate name,"
"918","the name of any series or class, or all of the above, and for no other purpose;"
"919","(ii) it will not grant to any third party the right to use the name Wells
Fargo for any purpose; (iii) the Adviser or any corporate affiliate of the"
"920","Adviser may use or grant to others the right to use the words Wells Fargo, or"
"921","any combination or abbreviation thereof, as all or a portion of a corporate or"
"922","business name or for any commercial purpose, other than a grant of such right to"
"923","another registered investment company not advised by the Adviser or one of its"
"924","affiliates; and (iv) in the event that the Adviser or an affiliate thereof is no"
"925","longer acting as investment adviser to any Fund, the Trust shall, upon request"
"926","by the Adviser, promptly take such action as may be necessary to change its"
"927","corporate name to one not containing the words Wells Fargo and following such"
"928","change, shall not use the words Wells Fargo, or any combination thereof, as a"
"929","part of its corporate name or for any other commercial purpose, and shall use"

"934","performance of the Funds or any specific level of performance, the success of"
"935","any investment decision or strategy that the Adviser may use, or the success of"
"936","the Adviser's overall management of the Funds. The Trust understands that"
"937","investment decisions made for the Funds by the Adviser are subject to various"
"938","market, currency, economic and business risks, and that those investment"
"939","decisions will not always be profitable. The Adviser will manage only the"
"940","securities, cash and other investments for which management responsibility is"
"941","delegated to it and which are held in the Funds' account(s) and, in making"
"942","investment decisions for the Funds, the Adviser will not consider any other"

"1602","for the Trust, for the account of, at the risk of and in the name of the Trust,"

"1655","subject to the direction and control the Trust's Board."

"1676","<PAGE>"
"1677","     SECTION 6. BROKER-DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. The Sub-Adviser is responsible for"
"1678","the purchase and sale of securities for the Funds, broker-dealer selection, and"
"1679","negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Sub-Adviser's primary"
"1680","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain the best"
"1681","price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular"
"1682","transaction for a Fund, the Sub-Adviser will take the following into"
"1683","consideration: the best net price available, the reliability, integrity and"
"1684","financial condition of the broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in"
"1685","executing the order; and the value of the expected contribution of the"
"1686","broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the"
"1687","Fund in any transaction may be less favorable than that available from another"
"1688","broker-dealer if the difference is reasonably justified by other aspects of the"
"1689","portfolio execution services offered. Subject to such policies as the Trust's"
"1690","Board of Trustees may from time to time determine, the Sub-Adviser shall not be"
"1691","deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this"
"1692","Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a Fund to pay a broker"
"1693","or dealer that provides brokerage and research services to the Sub-Adviser an"
"1694","amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in excess"
"1695","of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"1696","effecting that transaction, if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that"
"1697","such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"1698","brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in"
"1699","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of"
"1700","the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund and to other clients of the"
"1701","Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser is further authorized to allocate the orders placed"
"1702","by it on behalf of the Funds to brokers and dealers who also provide research or"
"1703","statistical material, or other services to the Funds or to the Sub-Adviser. Such"
"1704","allocation shall be in such amounts and proportions as the Sub-Adviser shall"
"1705","determine and the Sub-Adviser will report on said allocations regularly to the"
"1706","Board of Trustees of the Trust indicating the brokers to whom such allocations"
"1707","have been made and the basis therefor."
"1708","     SECTION 7. EXPENSES OF THE FUND. All of the ordinary business expenses"
"1709","incurred in the operations of the Funds and the offering of their shares shall"
"1710","be borne by the Funds unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement."
"1711","These expenses borne by the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage"
"1712","commissions, taxes, legal, auditing or governmental fees, the cost of preparing"
"1713","share certificates, custodian, transfer agent and shareholder service agent"
"1714","costs, expense of issue, sale, redemption and repurchase of shares, expenses of"
"1715","registering and qualifying shares for sale, expenses relating to trustees and"
"1716","shareholder meetings, the cost of preparing and distributing reports and notices"
"1717","to shareholders, the fees and other expenses incurred by the Funds in connection"
"1718","with membership in investment company organizations and the cost of printing"
"1719","copies of prospectuses and statements of additional information distributed to"
"1720","the Funds' shareholders."
"1721","     SECTION 8. COMPENSATION. As compensation for the sub-advisory services"
"1722","provided under this Agreement, the Adviser shall pay the Sub-Adviser fees,"
"1723","payable monthly, the annual rates indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such"
"1724","Schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to time. It is understood that"
"1725","the Adviser shall be"
"1726","                                        4"
"1727","<PAGE>"
"1728","responsible for the Sub-Adviser's fee for its services hereunder, and the"
"1729","Sub-Adviser agrees that it shall have no claim against the Trust or the Funds"
"1730","with respect to compensation under this Agreement."
"1731","     SECTION 9. STANDARD OF CARE. The Trust and Adviser shall expect of the"
"1732","Sub-Adviser, and the Sub-Adviser will give the Trust and the Adviser the benefit"
"1733","of, the Sub-Adviser's best judgment and efforts in rendering its services to the"
"1734","Trust, and as an inducement to the Sub-Adviser's undertaking these services at"
"1735","the compensation level specified, the Sub-Adviser shall not be liable hereunder"
"1736","for any mistake in judgment. In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith,"
"1737","negligence or reckless disregard of obligations or duties hereunder on the part"
"1738","of the Sub-Adviser or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents, the"
"1739","Sub-Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Trust or to any"
"1740","shareholders in the Trust for any act or omission in the course of, or connected"
"1741","with, rendering services hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in"
"1742","the purchase, holding or sale of any security."
"1743","     SECTION 10. NON-EXCLUSIVITY. The services of the Sub-Adviser to the Adviser"
"1744","and the Trust are not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Sub-Adviser shall be"
"1745","free to render investment advisory and administrative or other services to"
"1746","others (including other investment companies) and to engage in other activities."
"1747","It is understood and agreed that officers or directors of the Sub-Adviser are"
"1748","not prohibited from engaging in any other business activity or from rendering"
"1749","services to any other person, or from serving as partners, officers, directors"
"1750","or trustees of any other firm or trust, including other investment advisory"
"1751","companies."
"1752","     SECTION 11. RECORDS. The Sub-Adviser shall, with respect to orders the"
"1753","Sub-Adviser places for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities of the"
"1754","Funds, maintain or arrange for the maintenance of the documents and records"
"1755","required pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act as well as trade tickets and"
"1756","confirmations of portfolio trades and such other records as the Adviser or the"
"1757","Funds' Administrator reasonably requests to be maintained. All such records"
"1758","shall be maintained in a form acceptable to the Funds and in compliance with the"
"1759","provisions of Rule 31a-1 or any successor rule. All such records will be the"
"1760","property of the Funds, and will be available for inspection and use by the Funds"
"1761","and their authorized representatives (including the Adviser). The Sub-Adviser"
"1762","shall promptly, upon the Trust's request, surrender to the Funds those records"
"1763","which are the property of the Trust or any Fund. The Sub-Adviser will promptly"
"1764","notify the Funds' Administrator if it experiences any difficulty in maintaining"
"1765","the records in an accurate and complete manner."
"1766","     SECTION 12. TERM AND APPROVAL. This Agreement shall become effective with"
"1767","respect to a Fund after it is approved in accordance with the express"
"1768","requirements of the 1940 Act, and executed by the Trust, Adviser and Sub-Adviser"
"1769","and shall thereafter continue from year to year, provided that the continuation"
