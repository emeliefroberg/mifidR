"2778","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Goldman Sachs Trust:"
"2779","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"2780"," of the following funds of Goldman Sachs Trust: the Goldman Sachs"
"2781"," Balanced Strategy Portfolio, the Goldman Sachs Equity Growth"
"2782"," Strategy Portfolio, the Goldman Sachs Growth and Income"
"2783","Strategy Portfolio, the Goldman Sachs Growth Strategy Portfolio,"
"2784"," the Goldman Sachs Satellite Strategies Portfolio,"

"2786"," the Goldman Sachs Commodity Strategy Fund,"
"2787","the Goldman Sachs Dynamic Allocation Fund,"
"2788","the Goldman Sachs Dynamic Commodity Strategy Fund,"
"2789","the Goldman Sachs Managed Futures Strategy Fund,"
"2790"," the Goldman Sachs Global Real Estate Securities Funds,"
"2791"," the Goldman Sachs International Real Estate Securities Fund,"
"2792"," the Goldman Sachs Real Estate Securities Fund,"
"2793"," the Goldman Sachs U.S. Equity Dividend and Premium Fund,"
"2794"," the Goldman Sachs International Equity Dividend and Premium Fund,"
"2795"," the Goldman Sachs U.S. Tax-Managed Equity Fund,"
"2796"," the Goldman Sachs International Tax-Managed Equity Fund,"
"2797"," and the Goldman Sachs Long Short Fund"
"2798","(collectively, referred to as the Funds)"
"2799","as of and for the periods ended December 31, 2015,"
"2800"," in accordance with the standards of the"
"2801","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"2802"," we considered the Funds internal control over financial reporting,"
"2803","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"2804","basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"2805","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"2806"," statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"2807"," Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"2808"," an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"2809"," control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"2810"," we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness"
"2811"," of the Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"2812","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"2813"," establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"2814"," over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"2815"," estimates and judgments by management are required"
"2816","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"2817","controls. A funds internal control over financial"
"2818"," reporting is a process designed to provide"
"2819","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability"
"2820"," of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"2821","financial statements for external purposes in"
"2822","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"2823"," A funds internal control over financial reporting includes"
"2824","those policies and procedures that"
"2825","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"2826"," in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"2827"," the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"2828"," (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"2829","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"2830","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"2831"," and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"2832","made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"2833","and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"2834"," assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"2835"," unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a funds"
"2836","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2837","statements."
"2838","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"2839","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2840","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2841"," effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"2842","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"2843","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"2844","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2845","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"2846","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
