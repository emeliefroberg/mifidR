"2181","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"2182","To the Trustees and Shareholders of Columbia Funds Series Trust"
"2183","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of the"
"2184","Columbia LifeGoal(R) Growth Portfolio, Columbia Masters International Equity"
"2185","Portfolio, Columbia LifeGoal(R) Income Portfolio, Columbia Capital Allocation"
"2186","Moderate Aggressive Portfolio (formerly known as Columbia LifeGoal(R) Balanced"
"2187","Growth Fund), and Columbia Capital Allocation Moderate Conservative Portfolio"
"2188","(formerly known as Columbia LifeGoal(R) Income and Growth Portfolio) (each a"
"2189","series of Columbia Funds Series Trust and hereafter referred to as the"
"2190","Portfolios) as of and for the year ended January 31, 2013, in accordance with"
"2191","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"2192","we considered the Portfolios' internal control over financial reporting,"
"2193","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"2194","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"2195","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"2196","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Portfolios'"
"2197","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an"
"2198","opinion on the effectiveness of the Portfolios' internal control over financial"
"2199","reporting."
"2200","The management of the Portfolios is responsible for establishing and"
"2201","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"2202","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"2203","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A portfolio's"
"2204","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"2205","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"2206","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"2207","generally accepted accounting principles. A portfolio's internal control over"
"2208","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"2209","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2210","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the portfolio;"
"2211","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"2212","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"2213","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"2214","portfolio are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"2215","and trustees of the portfolio; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"2216","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"2217","of a portfolio's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2218","statements."
"2219","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2220","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2221","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"2222","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"2223","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2224","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"2225","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"2226","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2227","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2228","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"2229","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2230","Portfolios' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"2231","detected on a timely basis."
"2232","Our consideration of the Portfolios' internal control over financial reporting"
"2233","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"2234","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"2235","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"2236","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"2237","deficiencies in the"
"2238","<PAGE>"
"2239","Portfolios' internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"2240","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be"
"2241","material weaknesses as defined above as of January 31, 2013."
"2242","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"2243","the Board of Trustees of the Portfolios and the Securities and Exchange"

"2291","The Fund is intended for investors who have an objective of achieving"
"2292","a high level of total return consistent with a certain level of risk"
"2293","described in its name. The Fund is primarily managed as a fund that"
"2294","invests in other funds (i.e., a fund of funds) that seeks to"
"2295","achieve its investment objective by investing under normal"
"2296","circumstances in a combination of underlying funds for which Columbia"
"2297","Management Investment Advisers, LLC (the Investment Manager) or an"
"2298","affiliate serves as investment adviser or principal underwriter (the"
"2299","affiliated underlying funds). The Fund may also invest up to 20% of"
"2300","its net assets in other funds, including third-party advised"
"2301","(unaffiliated) funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) (collectively"
"2302","with the affiliated underlying funds, the Underlying Funds), equity"
"2303","securities, fixed income securities (including treasury inflation"
"2304","protected securities (TIPS)) and derivative instruments (the 20%"
"2305","Sleeve). The Fund's investment in derivative investments may include"
"2306","forward foreign currency contracts and futures (including currency,"
"2307","equity, fixed income, index and interest rate futures). Derivative"
"2308","positions may be established to seek incremental earnings, hedge"
"2309","existing positions, increase market or credit exposure, increase"
"2310","investment flexibility (including using the derivative position as a"
"2311","substitute for the purchase or sale of the underlying security,"
"2312","currency or other instrument) and/or to change the effective duration"
"2313","of the Fund's portfolio. Collectively, these investments (including"
"2314","through investments in derivatives) provide the Fund with exposure to"
"2315","equity, fixed income, and cash/cash equivalent asset classes. The"
"2316","Fund may also allocate its assets to Underlying Funds that pursue"
"2317","alternative investment strategies (alternative strategies), including"
"2318","those that seek investment returns uncorrelated to the broad equity"
"2319","and fixed income markets, as well as those providing exposure to"
"2320","other markets."
"2321","The Underlying Funds in which the Fund may invest are categorized as"
"2322","equity, fixed income, cash/cash equivalents and alternative
strategies, which may represent indirect investments in various"
"2323","sectors, asset classes, strategies and markets. The Underlying Funds"
"2324","categorized as equity may invest in equity securities representing"
"2325","different investment styles (e.g., growth, value and core/blend),"
"2326","market capitalizations (large-, mid- and small-cap), geographic focus"
"2327","(domestic and international, including emerging markets), and sector"
"2328","focus (e.g., real estate, technology, infrastructure and natural"
"2329","resources). The Underlying Funds categorized as fixed income may"
"2330","invest in fixed income securities, which can include TIPs, U.S."
"2331","treasury bonds and notes, mortgage-backed and asset-backed"
"2332","securities, investment grade corporate bonds, high yield bonds (junk"
"2333","bonds), high yield loans and international bonds (including those of"
"2334","issuers in developed and emerging markets), which may have varying"
"2335","interest rates, terms, duration and credit exposure. The Underlying"
"2336","Funds categorized as alternative strategies include those that employ"
"2337","a variety of investment strategies, techniques and practices,"
"2338","generally intended to have a low correlation to the performance of"
"2339","the broad equity and fixed income markets over a complete market"
"2340","cycle, including but not limited to absolute (positive) return"
"2341","strategies. Subject to the 20% Sleeve limitation described above, the"
"2342","Fund may also invest directly in equity securities, fixed income"
"2343","securities and derivative instruments, including forward foreign"
"2344","currency contracts and futures (including currency, equity, fixed"
"2345","income, and index and interest rate futures). By investing in a"
"2346","combination of Underlying Funds and the other securities described in"
"2347","the 20% Sleeve, the Fund seeks to minimize the risks typically"
"2348","associated with investing in a traditional mutual fund."
"2349","Under normal circumstances, the Fund may invest, directly or"
"2350","indirectly, in each of equity, fixed income and cash/cash equivalent"

"2369","Investment Manager may modify the target allocation ranges only with"

"2371","For the Fund, the Investment Manager uses an asset allocation"
"2372","strategy designed to:"

"2374","       class categories within the target asset allocation ranges set"
"2375","       forth above, based on the Fund's investment objective, global"
"2376","       macro-economic research and historical and projected returns for"
"2377","       each asset class category"
"2378","     * Select Underlying Funds to represent asset class categories and"
"2379","       then to determine the portion of the Fund's assets to be"
"2380","       allocated to each such investment, based on the Underlying"
"2381","       Funds' historical and projected returns under their current"
"2382","       portfolio managers, portfolio manager experience and the"
"2383","       anticipated investment risks associated with investment in these"
"2384","       Underlying Funds"
"2385","     * Determine the Fund's investments in the 20% Sleeve"
"2386","The Investment Manager regularly reviews asset class allocations and"
"2387","allocations to Underlying Funds, as well as security selection within"
"2388","the 20% Sleeve. The Investment Manager may reallocate, including on a"
"2389","daily basis, the Fund's investments in the Underlying Funds and/or"
"2390","the 20% Sleeve to return the Fund to targeted allocations, or to"
"2391","tactically adjust the Fund's market or other exposures based on"
"2392","market or other circumstances. Derivatives, in particular, may be"
"2393","used tactically to increase or decrease the Fund's exposure to the"
"2394","market or a given market segment, industry, or position."
"2395","The Fund may sell Underlying Funds in order to accommodate"
"2396","redemptions of the Fund's shares, to change the percentage of its"
"2397","assets invested in certain Underlying Funds in response to economic"
"2398","or market conditions, and to maintain or modify the proportion of its"
"2399","assets among the various asset classes. The Investment Manager seeks"
"2400","to minimize the impact of the Fund's purchases and redemptions of"
"2401","shares of the affiliated underlying funds by implementing them over a"
"2402","reasonable timeframe. In addition, because the Investment Manager"
"2403","earns different fees from the affiliated underlying funds, in"
"2404","determining the allocation of the Fund among these Underlying Funds,"
"2405","the Investment Manager may have an economic conflict of interest. The"
"2406","Investment Manager will report to the Fund's Board on the steps it"
"2407","has taken to manage any potential conflicts."
"2408","The Fund may hold a significant amount of cash, money market"
"2409","instruments or other high quality, short-term investments, including"
"2410","shares of affiliated money market funds, to cover obligations with"
"2411","respect to, or that may result from, the Fund's derivative"
"2412","transactions. The Fund's use of certain derivatives may create"
"2413","leveraged exposure to the equity and debt markets. Leverage occurs"
"2414","when the investments in derivatives create greater economic exposure"
"2415","than the amount invested. This means that the Fund could lose more"
"2416","than originally invested in the derivative."

"2510","      * Determine the allocation of the Fund's assets among the asset"
"2511","        class categories within the target asset allocation ranges set"
"2512","        forth above, based on the Fund's investment objective, global"
"2513","        macro-economic research and historical and projected returns"
"2514","        for each asset class category"
"2515","      * Select Underlying Funds to represent asset class categories and"
"2516","        then to determine the portion of the Fund's assets to be"
"2517","        allocated to each such investment, based on the Underlying"
"2518","        Funds' historical and projected returns under their current"
"2519","	portfolio managers, portfolio manager experience and the"
"2520","	anticipated investment risks associated with investment in"
"2521","	these Underlying Funds"
"2522","      * Determine the Fund's investments in the 20% Sleeve"
"2523","The Investment Manager regularly reviews asset class allocations and"
"2524","allocations to Underlying Funds, as well as security selection within"
"2525","the 20% Sleeve. The Investment Manager may reallocate, including on a"
"2526","daily basis, the Fund's investments in the Underlying Funds and/or"
"2527","the 20% Sleeve to return the Fund to targeted allocations, or to"
"2528","tactically adjust the Fund's market or other exposures based on"
"2529","market or other circumstances. Derivatives, in particular, may be"
"2530","used tactically to increase or decrease the Fund's exposure to the"
"2531","market or a given market segment, industry, or position."
"2532","The Fund may sell Underlying Funds in order to accommodate"
"2533","redemptions of the Fund's shares, to change the percentage of its"
"2534","assets invested in certain Underlying Funds in response to economic"
"2535","or market conditions, and to maintain or modify the proportion of its"
"2536","assets among the various asset classes. The Investment Manager seeks"
"2537","to minimize the impact of the Fund's purchases and redemptions of"
"2538","shares of the affiliated underlying funds by implementing them over a"
"2539","reasonable timeframe. In addition, because the Investment Manager"
"2540","earns different fees from the affiliated underlying funds, in"
"2541","determining the allocation of the Fund among these Underlying Funds,"
"2542","the Investment Manager may have an economic conflict of interest. The"
"2543","Investment Manager will report to the Fund's Board on the steps it"
"2544","has taken to manage any potential conflicts."
"2545","The Fund may hold a significant amount of cash, money market"
"2546","instruments or other high quality, short-term investments, including"
"2547","shares of affiliated money market funds, to cover obligations with"
"2548","respect to, or that may result from, the Fund's derivative"
"2549","transactions. The Fund's use of certain derivatives may create"
"2550","leveraged exposure to the equity and debt markets. Leverage occurs"
"2551","when the investments in derivatives create greater economic exposure"
"2552","than the amount invested. This means that the Fund could lose more"
"2553","than originally invested in the derivative."

"2573","Item 77E - Legal Proceedings:"
"2574","In December 2005, without admitting or denying the allegations, American"
"2575","Express Financial Corporation (AEFC, which is now known as Ameriprise"
"2576","Financial, Inc. (Ameriprise Financial)) entered into settlement agreements"
"2577","with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Minnesota Department of"
"2578","Commerce (MDOC) related to market timing activities. As a result, AEFC was"
"2579","censured and ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any"
"2580","violations of certain provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the"
"2581","Investment Company Act of 1940, and various Minnesota laws. AEFC agreed to pay"
"2582","disgorgement of $10 million and civil money penalties of $7 million. AEFC also"
"2583","agreed to retain an independent distribution consultant to assist in"
"2584","developing a plan for distribution of all disgorgement and civil penalties"
"2585","ordered by the SEC in accordance with various undertakings detailed at"
"2586","www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/ia-2451.pdf. Ameriprise Financial and its"
"2587","affiliates have cooperated with the SEC and the MDOC in these legal"
"2588","proceedings, and have made regular reports to the funds' Boards of Trustees."
"2589","Ameriprise Financial and certain of its affiliates have historically been"
"2590","involved in a number of legal, arbitration and regulatory proceedings,"
"2591","including routine litigation, class actions, and governmental actions,"
"2592","concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of their business"
"2593","activities. Ameriprise Financial believes that the Funds are not currently the"
"2594","subject of, and that neither Ameriprise Financial nor any of its affiliates"
"2595","are the subject of, any pending legal, arbitration or regulatory proceedings"
"2596","that are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Funds or the ability"
"2597","of Ameriprise Financial or its affiliates to perform under their contracts"
"2598","with the Funds. Ameriprise Financial is required to make 10-Q, 10-K and, as"
"2599","necessary, 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on legal"
"2600","and regulatory matters that relate to Ameriprise Financial and its affiliates."
"2601","Copies of these filings may be obtained by accessing the SEC website at"
"2602","www.sec.gov."
"2603","There can be no assurance that these matters, or the adverse publicity"
"2604","associated with them, will not result in increased fund redemptions, reduced"
"2605","sale of fund shares or other adverse consequences to the Funds. Further,"
"2606","although we believe proceedings are not likely to have a material adverse"
"2607","effect on the Funds or the ability of Ameriprise Financial or its affiliates"
"2608","to perform under their contracts with the Funds, these proceedings are subject"
"2609","to uncertainties and, as such, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or"
"2610","range of loss that may result. An adverse outcome in one or more of these"
"2611","proceedings could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties"
"2612","or other relief that could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated"
"2613","financial condition or results of operations of Ameriprise Financial."
