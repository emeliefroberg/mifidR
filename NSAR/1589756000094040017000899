"1574","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1575","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Virtus Alternative"
"1576","Solutions Trust"
"1577","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1578","statements of Virtus Alternative Solutions Trust (the Trust)"
"1579","as of and for the year ended October 31, 2017, in accordance"
"1580","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1581","Board (United States), we considered the Trust's internal"
"1582","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1583","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1584","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1585","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"1586","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1587","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over"
"1588","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion"
"1589","on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over"
"1590","financial reporting."
"1591","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"1592","maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1593","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1594","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"1595","benefits and related costs of controls.  A trust's internal"
"1596","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1597","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1598","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"1599","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1600","accounting principles.  A trust's internal control over"
"1601","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"1602","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1603","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1604","dispositions of the assets of the trust; (2) provide reasonable"
"1605","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1606","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"1607","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1608","expenditures of the trust are being made only in accordance"
"1609","with authorizations of management and trustees of the trust;"
"1610","and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"1611","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"1612","disposition of a trust's assets that could have a material"
"1613","effect on the financial statements."
"1614","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1615","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1616","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1617","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1618","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"1619","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1620","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1621","exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1622","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1623","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"1624","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1625","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1626","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1627","material misstatement of the Trust's annual or interim"
"1628","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"1629","timely basis."
"1630","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over"
"1631","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"1632","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"1633","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that"
"1634","might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1635","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1636","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trust's internal"
"1637","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"1638","controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be"
"1639","material weaknesses as defined above as of October 31, 2017."
"1640","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1641","management and the Board of Trustees of Virtus Alternative"
"1642","Solutions Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and"
"1643","is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"1644","than these specified parties."

"1691","VIRTUS FUNDS"
"1692"," AMENDED AND RESTATED"
"1693","PLAN PURSUANT TO RULE 18f-3"
"1694","under the"
"1695","INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940"
"1696","INTRODUCTION"
"1697","      The Purpose of this Plan is to specify the attributes of"
"1698","the classes of shares of the funds of Virtus Funds including the"
"1699","expense allocations, conversion features and exchange features"
"1700","of each class, as required by Rule 18f-3 under the Investment"
"1701","Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act).  The Virtus"
"1702","Funds are comprised of several trusts (each a Trust and"
"1703","collectively the Trusts) which in turn are comprised of a"
"1704","number of funds (each a Fund and collectively the Funds)"
"1705","offering various classes of shares, all of which are listed on"
"1706","the attached Schedule A.  In general, shares of each class will"
"1707","have the same rights and obligations except for one or more"
"1708","expense variables (which will result in different yields,"
"1709","dividends and net asset values for the different classes),"
"1710","certain related voting and other rights, exchange privileges,"
"1711","conversion rights and class designation."
"1712","GENERAL FEATURES OF THE CLASSES"
"1713"," 	Shares of each class of a Fund of the Trusts shall"
"1714","represent an equal pro rata interest in such Fund and,"
"1715","generally, shall have identical voting, dividend, liquidation"
"1716","and other rights, preferences, powers, restrictions,"
"1717","limitations, qualifications, designations and terms and"
"1718","conditions, except that: (a) each class shall have a different"
"1719","designation; (b) each class shall bear any class expenses;  (c)"
"1720","each class shall have exclusive voting rights on any matter"
"1721","submitted to shareholders that relates solely to its arrangement"
"1722","and each class shall have separate voting rights on any matter"
"1723","submitted to shareholders in which the interests of one class"
"1724","differ from the interests of any other class; and (d) each class"
"1725","may have different exchange and/or conversion features."
"1726","ALLOCATION OF INCOME AND EXPENSES"
"1727","i.	General."
"1728","	The gross income, realized and unrealized capital gains and"
"1729","losses and expenses (other than Class Expenses, as defined"
"1730","below) of each Fund shall be allocated to each class on the"
"1731","basis of its net asset value relative to the net asset value of"
"1732","the Fund."
"1733","ii.	Class Expenses."
"1734","	Expenses attributable to a particular class (Class
Expenses) shall be limited to Rule 12b-1, shareholder servicing"
"1735","fees, sub-transfer agency fees, certain transfer agency fees and"
"1736","such other expenses as designated by the Trusts' Treasurer,"
"1737","subject to Board approval and/or ratification.  Class Expenses"
"1738","shall be allocated to the class for which they are incurred."
"1739","	In the event that a particular Class Expense is no longer"
"1740","reasonably allocable by class or to a particular class, it shall"
"1741","be treated as a Fund expense and in the event a Fund expense"
"1742","becomes allocable as a Class Expense, it shall be so allocated,"
"1743","subject to compliance with Rule 18f-3 and Board approval or"
"1744","ratification."
"1745","	The initial determination of expenses that will be"
"1746","allocated as Class Expenses and any subsequent changes thereto"
"1747","as set forth in this Plan shall be reviewed by the Board of"
"1748","Trustees and approved by such Board and by a majority of the"
"1749","Trustees who are not interested persons of the Funds, as"
"1750","defined in the 1940 Act (Independent Trustees)."

"1752","	Types of classes of each of the Funds may include: A
