"1090","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"1091","Accounting Firm"
"1092","To the Shareholders and"
"1093","Board of Trustees of DWS Market Trust"
"1094","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"1095","financial statements of DWS Global Income"
"1096","Builder Fund (formerly, DWS Balanced Fund)"
"1097","(the Company) as of and for the year ended"
"1098","October 31, 2012, in accordance with the"
"1099","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1100","Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"1101","the Company's internal control over financial"
"1102","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1103","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1104","procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1105","opinion on the financial statements and to"
"1106","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1107","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"1108","on the effectiveness of the Company's internal"
"1109","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"1110","express no such opinion."
"1111","The management of the Company is"
"1112","responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1113","effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1114","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1115","judgments by management are required to"
"1116","assess the expected benefits and related costs"
"1117","of controls. A company's internal control over"
"1118","financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1119","provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1120","reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1121","preparation of financial statements for external"
"1122","purposes in accordance with generally"
"1123","accepted accounting principles. A company's"
"1124","internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1125","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"1126","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1127","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1128","transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"1129","the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"1130","that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1131","permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1132","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1133","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"1134","the company are being made only in"
"1135","accordance with authorizations of management"
"1136","and trustees of the company; and (3) provide"
"1137","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"1138","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1139","use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"1140","could have a material effect on the financial"
"1141","statements."
"1142","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1143","control over financial reporting may not prevent"
"1144","or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"1145","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"1146","are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1147","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"1148","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1149","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1150","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1151","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"1152","a control does not allow management or"
"1153","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1154","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1155","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"1156","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1157","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1158","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1159","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1160","company's annual or interim financial"
"1161","statements will not be prevented or detected on"
"1162","a timely basis."
"1163","Our consideration of the Company's internal"
"1164","control over financial reporting was for the"
"1165","limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"1166","and would not necessarily disclose all"
"1167","deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"1168","material weaknesses under standards"
"1169","established by the Public Company Accounting"
"1170","Oversight Board (United States). However, we"
"1171","noted no deficiencies in the Company's internal"
"1172","control over financial reporting and its"
"1173","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1174","securities, that we consider to be a material"
"1175","weakness as defined above as of October 31,"
"1176","2012."
"1177","This report is intended solely for the information"
"1178","and use of management and the Board of"

"1193","Item 77E - DWS Global Income Builder Fund (a"
"1194","series of DWS Market Trust)"
"1195","On December 7, 2010, DWS Global Income"
"1196","Builder Fund was named as a defendant in the First"
"1197","Amended Complaint and Objection to Claims filed"
"1198","by the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors"
"1199","in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of"
"1200","Delaware in the lawsuit Tribune Company, et al.,"
"1201","Debtors, Official Committee of Unsecured"
"1202","Creditors v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. et al. (the"
"1203","Lawsuit).  The Lawsuit arises out of a leveraged"
"1204","buyout transaction (LBO) in 2007 by which loans"
"1205","were made to the Tribune Company to fund the"
"1206","LBO (LBO Debt) and shares of the Tribune"
"1207","Company held by shareholders were tendered for or"
"1208","were converted to a right to receive cash."
"1209","Following the completion of the LBO in 2007, the"
"1210","Tribune Company filed for bankruptcy.  The"
"1211","Lawsuit seeks to avoid the obligations on the LBO"
"1212","Debt and to recover payments of principal and"
"1213","interest made by the Tribune Company on the LBO"
"1214","Debt.  The Fund has received approximately"
"1215","$24,151 in interest payments and $3,450 in"
"1216","principal payments from LBO Debt securities as of"
"1217","October 31, 2012.  All proceedings on the Lawsuit"
"1218","were stayed pending a decision by the Bankruptcy"
"1219","Court on which of two proposed plans of"
"1220","reorganization would be confirmed.  One of the"
"1221","plans proposed to settle the litigation, while the"
"1222","other plan proposed to proceed with the litigation."
"1223","The Bankruptcy Court has confirmed the plan of"
"1224","reorganization that provides for settlement of the"
"1225","litigation (the Plan of Reorganization).  As of"
"1226","October 31, 2012, the effective date of the Plan of"
"1227","Reorganization had not yet occurred."
