"2444","Putnam Funds Trust:"
"2445","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"2446","of Putnam Emerging Markets Equity Fund (the Fund), a series of"
"2447","Putnam Funds Trust, as of and for the year ended August 31,"
"2448","2017, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"2449","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"2450","Funds internal control over financial reporting, including"
"2451","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"2452","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"2453","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"2454","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2455","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"2456","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no"
"2457","such opinion."
"2458","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"2459","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"2460","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"2461","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"2462","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"2463","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"2464","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"2465","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"2466","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"2467","A companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"2468","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2469","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"2470","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"2471","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"2472","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"2473","financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"2474","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"2475","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"2476","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"2477","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"2478","or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material"
"2479","effect on the financial statements."
"2480","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2481","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2482","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"2483","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2484","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"2485","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2486","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2487","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"2488","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"2489","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"2490","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2491","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"2492","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"2493","material misstatement of a funds annual or interim financial"
"2494","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2495","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"2496","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2497","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"2498","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"2499","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"2500","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"2501","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"

"2641","Note 7 Acquisition of Putnam Global Energy Fund"
"2642","On June 19, 2017, the fund issued 749,613, 201,408, 398,266,"
"2643","14,629, 109,082 and 197,800 class A, class B, class C,"

"2645","418,649, 844,723, 32,198, 249,977 and 462,587"
"2646","class A, class B, class C, class M, class R and class Y shares"
"2647","of Putnam Global Energy Fund to acquire that funds net"
"2648","assets in a taxfree exchange approved by the shareholders. The"
"2649","purpose of the transaction was to combine two"
"2650","Putnam funds with substantially similar investment objectives"
"2651","and investment strategies into a single Putnam"
"2652","fund with a larger asset base and therefore potentially lower"
"2653","expenses for fund shareholders. The investment"
"2654","portfolio of Putnam Global Energy Fund, with a fair value of"
"2655","$21,118,632 and an identified cost of $24,145,530"
"2656","at June 16, 2017, was the principal asset acquired by the fund."
"2657","The net assets of the fund and Putnam Global"
"2658","Energy Fund on June 16, 2017, were $135,728,267 and $23,531,113,"
"2659","respectively. On June 16, 2017, Putnam Global"
"2660","Energy Fund had distributions in excess of net investment income"
"2661","of $211,689, accumulated net realized loss"
"2662","of $15,341,388 and unrealized depreciation of $3,026,898. The"
"2663","aggregate net assets of the fund immediately following the"
"2664","acquisition were $159,259,380."
"2665","Assuming the acquisition had been completed on September 1, 2016,"
"2666","the funds pro forma results of operations"
"2667","for the reporting period are as follows (unaudited)"
"2668","Net investment Income $1,000,162"
"2669","Net loss on investments $(8,293,984)"
"2670","Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations $(7,293,822)"
"2671","Because the combined investment portfolios have been managed as"
"2672","a single portfolio since the acquisition was"

"2674","revenue and earnings of Putnam Global Energy Fund"

"2912","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"2913","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds"

"2916","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"2917","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"

"2923","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"

"2926","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"2927","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"2928","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"2929","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"2930","A companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"2931","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2932","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"2933","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"2934","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"2935","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"

"2942","effect on the financial statements."
"2943","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"

"2945","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"2946","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"

"2949","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"

"3332","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"3333","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"3334","Putnam Funds Trust:"
"3335","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"3336","statements of Putnam Global Consumer Fund (the Fund), a"
"3337","series of Putnam Funds Trust, as of and for the year ended"
"3338","August 31, 2017, in accordance with the standards of the"
"3339","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"3340","we considered the Funds internal control over financial"
"3341","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"3342","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"3343","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"3344","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"3345","SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"3346","the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"3347","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such"
"3348","opinion."
"3349","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"3350","maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"3351","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"3352","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"3353","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"3354","companys internal control over financial reporting is a"
"3355","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"3356","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"3357","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"3358","with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  A"
"3359","companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"3360","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"3361","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"3362","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"3363","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"3364","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"3365","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"3366","accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"3367","the company are being made only in accordance with"
"3368","authorizations of management and trustees of the company;"
"3369","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"3370","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"3371","disposition of the companys assets that could have a"
"3372","material effect on the financial statements."
"3373","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"3374","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"3375","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"3376","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"3377","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"3378","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"3379","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3380","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"3381","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"3382","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"3383","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3384","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"3385","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"3386","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"3387","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a"
"3388","funds annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"3389","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3390","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"3391","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"3392","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"3393","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"3394","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"3395","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"3396","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal"
"3397","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"3398","including controls over safeguarding securities that we"
"3399","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"3400","August 31, 2017."

"3402","of management and the Board of Trustees of Putnam Funds"
"3403","Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"3404","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
