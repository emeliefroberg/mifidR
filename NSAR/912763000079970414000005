"665","the Public"
"666","Company"
"667","Accounting"
"668","Oversight Board"
"669","(United States),"
"670","we considered the"

"672","control over"
"673","financial"
"674","reporting,"
"675","including controls"

"705","establishing and"

"730","reliability of"
"731","financial reporting"

"736","external purposes"
"737","in accordance"

"740","accounting"
"741","principles.  A"
"742","company?s"
"743","internal control"
"744","over financial"
"745","reporting includes"
"746","those policies and"
"747","procedures that"
"748","(1) pertain to the"
"749","maintenance of"
"750","records that, in"
"751","reasonable detail,"
"752","accurately and"
"753","fairly reflect the"
"754","transactions and"
"755","dispositions of the"
"756","assets of the"
"757","company; (2)"
"758","provide"
"759","reasonable"
"760","assurance that"
"761","transactions are"
"762","recorded as"
"763","necessary to"
"764","permit preparation"
"765","of financial"
"766","statements in"
"767","accordance with"
"768","generally accepted"
"769","accounting"
"770","principles, and"

"773","the company are"
"774","being made only"
"775","in accordance"
"776","with"
"777","authorizations of"
"778","management and"
"779","directors of the"
"780","company; and (3)"
"781","provide"
"782","reasonable"
"783","assurance"

"786","timely detection"
"787","of unauthorized"
"788","acquisition, use or"
"789","disposition of a"
"790","company?s assets"
"791","that could have a"
"792","material effect on"
"793","the financial"
"794","statements."
"795","Because of its"
"796","inherent"
"797","limitations,"
"798","internal control"
"799","over financial"
"800","reporting may not"
"801","prevent or detect"
"802","misstatements."
"803","Also, projections"
"804","of any evaluation"
"805","of effectiveness to"
"806","future periods are"
"807","subject to the risk"
"808","that controls may"
"809","become"
"810","inadequate"
"811","because of"
"812","changes in"
"813","conditions, or that"
"814","the degree of"
"815","compliance with"
"816","the policies or"
"817","procedures may"
"818","deteriorate."
"819","A deficiency in"
"820","internal control"
"821","over financial"
"822","reporting exists"
"823","when the design"
"824","or operation of a"
"825","control does not"
"826","allow"
"827","management or"
"828","employees, in the"
"829","normal course of"
"830","performing their"
"831","assigned"
"832","functions, to"
"833","prevent or detect"
"834","misstatements on"
"835","a timely basis.  A"
"836","material weakness"
"837","is a deficiency, or"
"838","a combination of"
"839","deficiencies, in"
"840","internal control"
"841","over financial"
"842","reporting, such"
"843","that there is a"
"844","reasonable"
"845","possibility that a"
"846","material"
"847","misstatement of"
"848","the company?s"
"849","annual or interim"
