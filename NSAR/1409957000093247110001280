"502","<DESCRIPTION>AUDIT OPINION"
"503","<TEXT>"
"504","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"505","Accounting Firm"
"506","To the Board of Trustees of Vanguard Montgomery"
"507","Funds and the Shareholders of"
"508","Vanguard Market Neutral Fund"
"509","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"510","statements of Vanguard Market Neutral Fund"
"511","(constituting Vanguard Montgomery Funds, hereafter"
"512","referred to as the ?Trust?) as of and for the year"
"513","ended December 31, 2009, in accordance with the"
"514","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"515","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"516","Trust?s internal control over financial reporting,"
"517","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"518","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"519","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"520","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"521","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"522","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust?s internal"
"523","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"524","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"525","Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"526","The management of the Trust is responsible for"
"527","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"528","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"529","estimates and judgments by management are"
"530","required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"531","costs of controls.  A company?s internal control over"
"532","financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"533","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"534","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"535","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"536","generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"537","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"538","includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"539","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"540","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"541","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"542","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"543","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"544","preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"545","with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"546","that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"547","being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"548","management and trustees of the company; and (3)"
"549","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"550","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"551","disposition of a company?s assets that could have a"
"552","material effect on the financial statements."
"553","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"554","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"555","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"556","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"557","risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"558","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"559","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"560","deteriorate."
"561","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"562","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"563","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"564","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"565","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"566","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"567","a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"568","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"569","possibility that a material misstatement of the Trust's"
"570","annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"571","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"572","Our consideration of the Trust?s internal control over"
"573","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"574","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"575","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"576","over financial reporting that might be material"
"577","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"578","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"579","States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"580","Trust?s internal control over financial reporting and its"
"581","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"582","securities, that we consider to be material"
"583","weaknesses as defined above as of December 31,"
"584","2009."
"585","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"586","use of management and the Board of Trustees of"
"587","Vanguard Montgomery Funds and the Securities and"
"588","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"589","should not be used by anyone other than these"
"590","specified parties."

"657","At a meeting held on July 2, 2009, the shareholders of the Vanguard funds"
"658","approved the following changes to the funds:"
"659","TRUSTEES ELECTED TO VANGUARD FUNDS' BOARDS OF TRUSTEES"
"660","Vanguard fund shareholders have elected F. William McNabb III and Peter F."
"661","Volanakis as trustees, effective July 2009. The trustees set broad policies for"
"662","the funds; select investment advisors; monitor fund operations, performance, and"

"668","Vanguard Marketing Corporation; and Managing Director of Vanguard (1995-2008)."
"669","Mr. McNabb is considered an interested trustee of each Vanguard fund because"

"678","STANDARDIZED FUNDAMENTAL POLICIES FOR ALL VANGUARD FUNDS"
"679","The shareholders of the Vanguard funds approved changes to the funds'"
"680","fundamental policies (i.e., policies that cannot be changed without a"
"681","shareholder vote). The newly adopted standardized fundamental policies for each"
"682","of the Vanguard funds are as follows:"
"683","Borrowing. The Fund may borrow money only as permitted by the 1940 Act or other"
"684","governing statute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other regulatory"
"685","agency with authority over the Fund."
"686","Commodities. The Fund may invest in commodities only as permitted by the 1940"
"687","Act or other governing statute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other"
"688","regulatory agency with authority over the Fund."
"689","Industry Concentration."
"690","[For funds, other than index funds and money market funds, that do not"
"691","concentrate.] The Fund will not concentrate its investments in the securities of"
"692","issuers whose principal business activities are in the same industry."
"693","[For index funds that do not concentrate.] The Fund will not concentrate its"
"694","investments in the securities of issuers whose principal business activities are"
"695","in the same industry, except as may be necessary to approximate the composition"
"696","of its target index."
"697","[For funds, other than money market funds, that concentrate.] The Fund will"
"698","concentrate its investments in the securities of issuers whose principal"
"699","business activities are in the ________ industry, as defined in the prospectus"
"700","or Statement of Additional Information (SAI) (the blank to be consistent with"
"701","the fund's name, such as energy, health care, etc.)."
"702","<PAGE>"
"703","[For the Prime Money Market Fund, Vanguard Variable Insurance Fund--Money Market"
"704","Portfolio, and Market Liquidity Fund.] The Fund will concentrate its assets in"
"705","the securities of issuers whose principal business activities are in the"
"706","financial services industry. For the purposes of this policy, the financial"
