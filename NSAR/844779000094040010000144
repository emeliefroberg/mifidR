"2073","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"2074","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"2075","of BlackRock Funds:"
"2076","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"2077","statements of BlackRock Funds (the Fund), including"
"2078","BlackRock Money Market Portfolio, BlackRock U.S. Treasury"
"2079","Money Market Portfolio, BlackRock Municipal Money Market"
"2080","Portfolio, BlackRock New Jersey Municipal Money Market"
"2081","Portfolio, BlackRock North Carolina Municipal Money Market"
"2082","Portfolio, BlackRock Ohio Municipal Money Market Portfolio,"
"2083","BlackRock Pennsylvania Municipal Money Market Portfolio and"
"2084","BlackRock Virginia Municipal Money Market Portfolio, as of"
"2085","and for the period ended March 31, 2009, in accordance with"
"2086","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"2087","Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"2088","control over financial reporting, including control over"
"2089","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"2090","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"2091","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"2092","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2093","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"2094","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"2095","express no such opinion."
"2096","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"2097","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"2098","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"2099","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"2100","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"2101","company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"2102","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"2103","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"2104","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"2105","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"2106","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"2107","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"2108","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"2109","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"2110","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"2111","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2112","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"2113","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"2114","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"2115","accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"2116","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"2117","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"2118","acquisition, use, or disposition of a company's assets that"
"2119","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2120","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2121","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2122","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2123","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"2124","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2125","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"2126","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2127","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"2128","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"2129","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"2130","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2131","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"2132","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2133","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"2134","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2135","company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"2136","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2137","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"2138","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"2139","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"2140","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"2141","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"2142","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"2143","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal"
"2144","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"2145","including controls for safeguarding securities, that we"
"2146","consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as of"
"2147","March 31, 2009."
"2148","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"2149","of management and the Board of Trustees of the Fund and the"
"2150","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to"
"2151","be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
