"1117","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1118","To the Board of Directors of Tweedy, Browne Fund Inc. and the"
"1119","Shareholders of Tweedy, Browne Global Value Fund, Tweedy, Browne"
"1120","Global Value Fund II - Currency Unhedged, Tweedy, Browne Value"
"1121","Fund and Tweedy, Browne Worldwide High Dividend Yield Value Fund"
"1122","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"1123","of Tweedy, Browne Global Value Fund, Tweedy, Browne Global Value"
"1124","Fund II - Currency Unhedged, Tweedy, Browne Value Fund and"
"1125","Tweedy, Browne Worldwide High Dividend Yield Value Fund"
"1126","(constituting the Tweedy, Browne Fund Inc., hereafter referred"
"1127","to as the Fund) as of and for the year ended March 31, 2018,"
"1128","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1129","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1130","Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1131","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"1132","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1133","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1134","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1135","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"1136","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"1137","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"1138","internal control over financial reporting."
"1139","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1140","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1141","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1142","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1143","related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"1144","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1145","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1146","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1147","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1148","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1149","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1150","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1151","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"1152","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1153","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1154","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1155","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"1156","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1157","and directors of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance"
"1158","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1159","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could"
"1160","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1161","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1162","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1163","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1164","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1165","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"1166","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1167","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1168","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1169","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1170","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"1171","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1172","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1173","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1174","material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial"
"1175","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1176","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1177","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1178","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1179","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"1180","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1181","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"1182","no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"1183","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1184","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"1185","consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of March"
"1186","31, 2018."

"1188","management and the Board of Directors of Tweedy, Browne Fund"

"1277","(the Amendment), effective as of October 15, 2017, is made by"
"1278","and between Tweedy, Browne Fund Inc., a Maryland corporation"
"1279","(the Company) (with respect to its series, the Tweedy, Browne"
"1280","Global Value Fund (the Fund)), and Tweedy, Browne Company LLC,"
"1281","a Delaware limited liability company (the Adviser, and,"

"1283","provisions of the Investment Advisory Agreement, dated May 29,"
"1284","1998 by and between the Parties relating to the Fund (the"
"1285","Agreement)."
"1286","            WHEREAS, the Adviser, of its own volition and not at"
"1287","the request or suggestion of the Company, has proposed to amend"
"1288","the Agreement as set forth herein; and"
"1289","            WHEREAS, the exclusive purpose of this Amendment is to"
"1290","effect a reduction in the advisory fee payable by the Company on"
"1291","assets in excess of the amount set forth herein after the"
"1292","effective date hereof and to effect no other change to the"
"1293","Agreement or the services to be rendered by the Adviser"

"1295","            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing"
"1296","preamble and recital, which shall constitute a part of this"
"1297","Amendment, and the mutual promises contained in this Amendment,"
"1298","and intending to be legally bound thereby, the Parties agree as"
"1299","follows."
"1300","1.	Amendment to the Agreement. Section 4(a) to the Agreement"
"1301","is hereby amended to read in its entirety as follows:"
"1302","      (a)	Subject to paragraph 2(a), the Company
agrees to pay to the Adviser out of the Fund's assets,
and the Adviser agrees to accept as full compensation
for all services rendered by or through the Adviser, a
fee computed daily and payable monthly in arrears in
an amount equal on an annualized basis to the sum of
(i) 1.25% on the first $10.3 billion of the Fund's
daily average net asset value, and (ii) 0.75% on the
remaining amount, if any, of the Fund's daily average
net asset value. For any period less than a month
during which this Agreement is in effect, the fee
shall be pro-rated according to the proportion which
such period bears to a full month of 28, 29, 30 or 31
days, as the case may be. Such payments shall be made
in arrears; provided, however, that if the Adviser so
requests, the Company will pay as often as weekly an
amount equal to 75% of the amount of fees then accrued
and not yet paid with the balance at the end of the
month."
"1303","2.	Binding Effect. This Amendment shall inure to the benefit"
"1304","of and be binding upon the Parties and their successors and"
"1305","assigns."

"1307","Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance"
"1308","with its terms."

"1310","obligations of the parties hereunder shall be governed by, and"
"1311","construed and interpreted in accordance with, the internal laws"
"1312","of the State of New York."

"1314","subparagraph or paragraph of this Amendment held by a court of"
"1315","competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or ineffective"
"1316","shall not impair, invalidate or nullify the remainder of this"
"1317","Amendment, but the effect thereof shall be such section, clause,"
"1318","sentence, provision, subparagraph or paragraph so held to be"
"1319","invalid, illegal or ineffective."
"1320","6.	Counterparts.  This Amendment may be executed in multiple"
"1321","counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signature of"
"1322","more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together"
