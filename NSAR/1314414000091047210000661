"531","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"532","To the Board of Trustees of Northern Lights Fund Trust"
"533","and the Shareholders of CMG Absolute Return Strategies Fund"
"534","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"535","of CMG Absolute Return Strategies Fund, a series of shares of"
"536","beneficial interest of Northern Lights Fund Trust, as of April"
"537","30, 2010 and for the year then ended, in accordance with the"
"538","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"539","States) (PCAOB), we considered its internal control over financial"
"540","reporting, including control activities over safeguarding securities,"
"541","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"542","of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"543","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"544","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"545","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such"
"546","opinion."
"547","The management of Northern Lights Fund Trust is responsible for"
"548","establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"549","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments"
"550","by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"551","costs of controls.  A funds internal control over financial reporting"
"552","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"553","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"554","statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles"
"555","generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  A funds"
"556","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"557","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"558","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"559","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"560","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the"
"561","financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"562","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"563","authorizations of"
"564","management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"565","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"566","or disposition of a funds assets that could have a material effect on the"
"567","financial statements."
"568","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"569","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"570","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls"
"571","may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree"
"572","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"573","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"574","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"575","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"576","or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"577","deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"578","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"579","material misstatement of the Funds annual or interim financial statements"
"580","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"581","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial reporting"
"582","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"583","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"584","material weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB.  However, we"
"585","noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal control over financial reporting"
"586","and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"587","consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above, as of April 30, 2010."
"588","This report is intended solely for the information and use of the shareholders"
"589","of CMG Absolute Return Strategies Fund, management and the Board of Trustees of"
"590","Northern Lights Fund Trust, and the Securities and Exchange Commission and"
"591","is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"592","specified parties."
