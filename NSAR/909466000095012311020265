"652","             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"653","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM Tax-Exempt Funds (Invesco"
"654","Tax-Exempt Funds):"
"655","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Invesco"
"656","Tax-Exempt Securities Fund (formerly known as Morgan Stanley Tax-Exempt"
"657","Securities Trust; one of the funds constituting AIM Tax-Exempt Funds (Invesco"
"658","Tax-Exempt Funds), hereafter referred to as the Fund) as of and for the period"
"659","ended December 31, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"660","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"661","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"662","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"663","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"664","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"665","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"666","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"667","internal control over financial reporting."
"668","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"669","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"670","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"671","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"672","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"673","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"674","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"675","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"676","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"677","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"678","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"679","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"680","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"681","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"682","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and"
"683","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"684","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"685","a material effect on the financial statements."
"686","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"687","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"688","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"689","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"690","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"691","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"692","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"693","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"694","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"695","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"696","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"697","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"698","on a timely basis."
"699","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"700","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"701","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"702","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"703","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (country-regionplaceUnited States)."
"704","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"705","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities"
"706","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of December 31,"
"707","2010."

"725","                                LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"726","                 AIM TAX-EXEMPT FUNDS (INVESCO TAX-EXEMPT FUNDS)"
"727","SETTLED ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO MARKET TIMING"
"728","     On October 8, 2004, Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco), successor by merger"
"729","to Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc. and INVESCO Funds Group, Inc. (IFG), both former"
"730","investment advisers, along with Invesco Aim Distributors, n/k/a Invesco"
"731","Distributors, Inc. (Invesco Distributors) reached final settlements with certain"
"732","regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York"
"733","Attorney General and the Colorado Attorney General, to resolve civil enforcement"
"734","actions and/or investigations related to market timing and related activity in"
"735","the AIM Funds (n/k/a the Invesco Funds), including those formerly advised by"
"736","IFG. As part of the settlements, a $325 million fair fund ($110 million of which"
"737","is civil penalties) was created to compensate shareholders harmed by market"
"738","timing and related activity in funds formerly advised by IFG. Additionally,"
"739","Invesco and Invesco Distributors created a $50 million fair fund ($30 million of"
"740","which is civil penalties) to compensate shareholders harmed by market timing and"
"741","related activity in funds advised by Invesco, which was done pursuant to the"
"742","terms of the settlement. The methodology of the fair funds distributions was"
"743","determined by Invesco's independent distribution consultant (IDC Plan), in"
"744","consultation with Invesco and the independent trustees of the Invesco Funds, and"
"745","approved by the SEC on May 23, 2008."
"746","     The IDC Plan provides for distribution to all eligible investors, for the"
"747","periods spanning January 1, 2000 through July 31, 2003 (for the IFG Fair Fund)"
"748","and January 1, 2001 through September 30, 2003 (for the AIM Fair Fund), their"
"749","proportionate share of the applicable Fair Fund to compensate such investors for"
"750","injury they may have suffered as a result of market timing in the affected"
"751","funds. The IDC Plan includes a provision for any residual amounts in the Fair"
"752","Funds to be distributed in the future to the affected funds. Further details"
"753","regarding the IDC Plan and distributions thereunder are available on Invesco's"
"754","Web site, available at http://www.invesco.com/us."
"755","At the present time, management of Invesco and the Invesco Funds are unable to"
"756","estimate the impact, if any, that the outcome of the Pending Litigation and"
"757","Regulatory Inquiries described herein may have on Invesco, Invesco Distributors"
"758","or the Invesco Funds."
"759","Pending Regulatory Action Alleging Market Timing"
"760","     On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Office of the State Auditor -"
"761","Securities Commission (WVASC) issued a Summary Order to Cease and Desist and"
"762","Notice of Right to Hearing to Invesco and Invesco Distributors (Order No."
"763","05-1318). The WVASC makes findings of fact that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"764","entered into certain arrangements permitting market timing of the Invesco Funds"
"765","and failed to disclose these arrangements in the prospectuses for such Funds,"
"766","and conclusions of law to the effect that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"767","violated the West Virginia securities laws. The WVASC orders Invesco and Invesco"
"768","Distributors to cease any further violations and seeks to impose monetary"
"769","sanctions, including restitution to affected investors, disgorgement of fees,"
"770","reimbursement of investigatory, administrative and legal costs and an"
"771","administrative assessment, to be determined by the Commissioner. Initial"
"772","research indicates that these damages could be limited or capped by statute. By"
"773","agreement with the Commissioner of Securities, Invesco's time to respond to that"
"774","Order has been indefinitely suspended."
"775","Private Civil Actions Alleging Market Timing"
"776","     Multiple civil lawsuits, including purported class action and shareholder"
"777","derivative suits, were filed against various parties (including, depending on"
"778","the lawsuit, certain Invesco Funds, IFG, Invesco, Invesco Aim Management Group,"
"779","Inc., n/k/a Invesco Management Group, Inc. and certain related entities, certain"
"780","of their current and former officers and/or certain unrelated third parties)"
"781","based on allegations of improper market timing and related activity in the"
"782","Invesco Funds. The lawsuits were transferred to the United"
"783","<PAGE>"
"784","States District Court for the District of Maryland (the MDL Court) for"
"785","consolidated or coordinated pre-trial proceedings. Pursuant to an Order of the"
"786","MDL Court, plaintiffs in these lawsuits consolidated their claims into three"
"787","amended complaints against various Invesco - and IFG-related parties, as"
"788","described below."
"789","     -    RICHARD LEPERA, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY"
"790","          SITUATED (LEAD PLAINTIFF: CITY OF CHICAGO DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN),"

"793","          District Court for the District of Colorado), filed on September 29,"
"794","          2004."
"795","     -    CYNTHIA ESSENMACHER, ET AL., Derivatively on Behalf of the Mutual"
"796","          Funds, Trusts and Corporations Comprising the Invesco and AIM Family"
"797","          of Mutual Funds v. AMVESCAP, PLC, ET AL., in the MDL Court (Case No."
"798","          04-MD-15864-FPS; No. 04-819), filed on September 29, 2004."
"799","     -    MIRIAM CALDERON, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY"
"800","          SITUATED, V. AVZ, INC., ET AL., in the MDL Court (Case No."
"801","          1:04-MD-15864-FPS), filed on September 29, 2004."
"802","     On January 5, 2008, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle"
"803","both the Lepera and the Essenmacher lawsuits, subject to MDL Court approval. On"
"804","December 15, 2008, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the"
"805","Calderon lawsuit, subject to MDL Court approval. No payments were required under"
"806","the Calderon settlement; however, the parties agreed that certain limited"
"807","changes to benefit plans and participants' accounts would be made."
"808","     The MDL Court formally approved the settlements and dismissed with"
"809","prejudice all claims against the Invesco-related parties on October 25, 2010."
"810","There was a brief period to appeal the MDL Court's approval; however, no appeal"
"811","was filed. This matter is concluded."

"813","above, including the parties to the lawsuits and summaries of the various"
"814","allegations and remedies sought, may be found in the Fund's Statement of"

"857","of the Shareholders is not required for this amendment;"
"858","          NOW, THEREFORE, the Agreement is hereby amended as follows:"
"859","     1. Section 2.6 of the Agreement is amended to add new section 2.6(d) to"
"860","read as follows:"
"861","          (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.6, Class B"
"862","               Shares shall not convert to Class A Shares, if at the time of"
"863","               conversion Class A Shares into which the Class B Shares would"
"864","               convert pay a higher fee under Rule 12b-1 (12b-1 Fee), and such"
"865","               right of conversion shall be suspended until such time as the"
"866","               Class A Shares pay a 12b-1 Fee that is equal to or lower than the"
"867","               12b-1 Fee of suspended Class B Shares (all such suspended Class B"
