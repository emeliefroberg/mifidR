"456","Item 77K - West Shore Real Return Fund for the fiscal"
"457","year ending April 30, 2016"
"458","       On March 30, 2016, KPMG, LLP (KPMG)"
"459","resigned as the independent registered public"
"460","accounting firm to the West Shore Real Return Fund for"
"461","the fiscal year ending April 30, 2016. KPMG issued its"
"462","report on the Fund's financial statements for the fiscal"
"463","year ended April 30, 2015. Such report did not contain"
"464","adverse opinions or disclaimers of opinion, nor were"
"465","they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit"
"466","scope, or accounting principles.  The decision to replace"
"467","KPMG as the Fund's independent registered public"
"468","accounting firm was approved by the Audit Committee"
"469","and Board of Trustees of Two Roads Shared Trust, on"
"470","behalf of the Fund."
"471","       During the Fund's fiscal year ended April 30,"
"472","2015, there were no disagreements with KPMG on any"
"473","matter of accounting principles or practices, financial"
"474","statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure,"
"475","which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG,"
"476","would have caused it to make reference to the subject"
"477","matter of the disagreements in connection with its"
"478","reports nor were there any reportable events as that"
"479","term is described in Item 304 (a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K."
"480","       The Fund has requested that KPMG furnish it"
"481","with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange"
"482","Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the"
"483","above statements. A copy of such letter, dated June 29,"
"484","2016 is filed as an exhibit to this Form N-SAR."
"485","       The Trust's Audit Committee and Board of"
"486","Trustees selected and approved Grant Thornton, LLP"
"487","(Grant Thornton) as the Fund's independent"
"488","registered public accounting firm to audit the Fund's"
"489","financial statements for the fiscal year ended April 30,"
"490","2016 at an in-person meeting on March 30, 2016.. The"
"491","Trust has not, during any subsequent period to such"
"492","firm's engagement, consulted with Grant Thornton"
"493","regarding the application of accounting principles to a"
"494","specified transaction; the type of audit opinion that"
"495","might be rendered on the Fund's financial statements;"
"496","or any matter that was either the subject of a"
"497","disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of"
"498","Regulation S-K or a reportable event (as described in"
"499","Item 304(a)(1) of Regulation S-K)."

"506","date of July 13, 2015, we reported on the financial"

"512","dated June 29, 2016 and we agree with such statements,"
"513","except that we are not in a position to agree or disagree"
"514","with the Company's statement that the change was"

"531","<DESCRIPTION>WEST SHORE AUDIT LETTER"
"532","<TEXT>"
"533","Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"534","West Shore Real Return Fund"
"535","In planning and performing our audit of the consolidated"
"536","financial statements of West Shore Real Return"
"537","Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year ended April 30,"
"538","2016, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"539","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"540","considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"541","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"542","as a basis for designing audit procedures for the purpose"
"543","of expressing an opinion on the consolidated financial"
"544","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"545","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"546","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"547","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such"
"548","opinion."
"549","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"550","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"551","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"552","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"553","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's"
"554","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"555","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"556","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"557","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"558","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's"
"559","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"560","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"561","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"562","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"563","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"564","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"565","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"566","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures"
"567","of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"568","authorizations of management and directors of the fund;"
"569","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"570","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"571","disposition of the fund's assets that could have a material"
"572","effect on the consolidated financial statements."
"573","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"574","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"575","misstatements.  Also projections of any evaluation of"
"576","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"577","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"578","conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies and"
"579","procedures may deteriorate."
"580","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"581","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"582","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"583","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"584","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"585","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"586","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"587","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"588","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"589","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"590","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"591","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"592","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"593","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that"
"594","might be material weaknesses under standards established"
"595","by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"596","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"597","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"598","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"599","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"600","above as of April 30, 2016."
"601","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"602","of management and the Board of Trustees of West Shore"
"603","Real Return Fund and the U.S. Securities and"
"604","Exchange Commission, and is not intended to be and"
"605","should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"606","parties."
