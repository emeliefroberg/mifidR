A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</font></div>"

The complaint was brought derivatively on behalf of the MainStay Large Cap Growth Fund, the MainStay Marketfield Fund and the MainStay High Yield Corporate Bond Fund and alleges that New York Life Investments violated Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act by charging excessive investment management fees. The plaintiffs seek monetary damages and other relief from New York Life Investments. New York Life Investments believes the case has no merit, and intends to vigorously defend the matter.</font></div>"
