"1314","ended October 31, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the"

"1318","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"1319","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"

"1326","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"

"1330","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1331","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1332","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"1333","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1334","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1335","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"1336","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1337","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1338","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"

"1353","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"

"1355","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
