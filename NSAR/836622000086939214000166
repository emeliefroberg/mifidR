"537","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"538","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"539","Putnam Master Intermediate Income Trust:"
"540","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"541","of Putnam Master Intermediate Income Trust (the Fund), as of and"
"542","for the year ended September 30, 2014, in accordance with the"
"543","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"544","(United States), we considered the Funds internal control over"
"545","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"546","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"547","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"548","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"549","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"550","Funds internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"551","express no such opinion."
"552","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"553","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"554","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"555","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"556","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"557","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"558","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"559","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"560","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"561","A companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"562","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"563","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"564","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"565","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"566","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"567","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"568","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"569","with authorizations of management and trustees of the company;"
"570","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"571","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"572","of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the"
"573","financial statements."
"574","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"575","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"576","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"577","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"578","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"579","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"580","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"581","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"582","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"583","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"584","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"585","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"586","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"587","material misstatement of a Funds annual or interim financial"
"588","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"589","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"590","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"591","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"592","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"593","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"594","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"595","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"596","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"597","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"598","September 30, 2014."
"599","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"600","management and the Board of Trustees of Putnam Master"
"601","Intermediate Income Trust and the Securities and Exchange"
"602","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by"

"658","shall be subject to the Agreement and Declaration of Trust, as"
"659","from time to time in effect (the Declaration of Trust), of the"
"660","Massachusetts business trust established by the Declaration of"
"661","Trust (the Trust).  Capitalized terms used but not defined in"

"669","ARTICLE 2"
"670","Meetings of Trustees"
"671","      2.1  Regular Meetings.  Regular meetings of the Trustees"
"672","may be held without call or notice at such places and at such"
"673","times as the Trustees may from time to time determine, provided"
"674","that notice of the first regular meeting following any such"
"675","determination shall be given to absent Trustees."
"676","      2.2  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Trustees"
"677","may be held at any time and at any place designated in the call"
"678","of the meeting when called by the Chair of the Trustees, the"
"679","President, the Executive Vice President or the Treasurer or by"
"680","two or more Trustees, sufficient notice thereof being given to"
"681","each Trustee by the Clerk or an Assistant Clerk or by the"
"682","officer or the Trustees calling the meeting."
"683","      2.3  Notice of Special Meetings.  It shall be sufficient"
"684","notice to a Trustee of a special meeting: (a) to send notice (i)"
"685","by mail at least forty-eight hours before the meeting, (ii) by"
"686","courier at least forty-eight hours before the meeting, (iii) by"
"687","electronic mail (e-mail), facsimile or other electronic means at"
"688","least twenty-four hours before the meeting, in each case,"
"689","addressed to the Trustee at his or her usual or last known"
"690","business or residence address (or e-mail address, facsimile"
"691","number or other appropriate address); or (b) to give notice to"
"692","him or her in person or by telephone at least twenty-four hours"
"693","before the meeting.  Notice of a special meeting need not be"
"694","given to any Trustee if a written waiver of notice, executed by"
"695","him or her before or after the meeting, is filed with the"
"696","records of the meeting, or to any Trustee who attends the"
"697","meeting without protesting before or at its commencement the"
"698","lack of notice to him or her.  Any written waiver of notice may"
"699","be provided and delivered to the Trust by mail, courier, e-mail,"
"700","facsimile or other electronic means. Neither notice of a meeting"
"701","nor a waiver of a notice need specify the purposes of the"
"702","meeting.  All notices shall be deemed to be given when sent."
"703","      2.4  Quorum.  At any meeting of the Trustees a majority of"
"704","the Trustees then in office shall constitute a quorum.  Once a"
"705","quorum has been validly established for a meeting, it cannot be"
"706","broken by Trustees withdrawing from the meeting.  Any meeting"
"707","may be adjourned from time to time by a majority of the votes"

"709","the meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice."
"710","      2.5  Telephone Meeting; Action Without a Meeting.  Except"
"711","as otherwise provided in the Declaration of Trust and these"
"712","Bylaws, any action to be taken by the Trustees may be taken by a"
"713","majority of the Trustees present at the meeting of the Trustees"
"714","(a quorum being present), including any meeting held by means of"
"715","a conference telephone or other communications equipment by"
"716","means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear"
"717","each other at the same time and participation by such means"
"718","shall constitute presence in person at a meeting. Any action to"
"719","be taken by the Trustees may also be taken without a meeting if"
"720","one or more written consents thereto are signed by a majority of"
"721","the Trustees.  Any written consent may be given by mail,"
"722","courier, e-mail, facsimile or other electronic means.  Copies of"
"723","such written consents shall be filed with the minutes of the"
"724","proceedings of the Trustees.  Such consents shall be treated for"
"725","all purposes as a vote taken at a meeting of the Trustees.  If"
"726","in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Trust"
"727","and these Bylaws any action is taken by the Trustees by written"
"728","consents of less than all of the Trustees, then prompt notice of"
"729","any such action shall be furnished to each Trustee who did not"
"730","execute such written consent, provided that the effectiveness of"
"731","such action shall not be impaired by any delay or failure to"
"732","furnish such notice."

"737","officers (including Vice President, which shall include the"
"738","office of Executive Vice President), if any, as the Trustees"

"1575","relating to the Trust as may be required by this Declaration of"
"1576","Trust, the Bylaws or any registration of the Trust with the"
"1577","Securities and Exchange Commission (or any successor agency) or"
"1578","any state, or as the Trustees may consider necessary or"
"1579","desirable.  Each whole Share shall be entitled to one vote as to"
"1580","any matter on which it is entitled to vote and each fractional"
"1581","Share shall be entitled to a proportionate fractional vote.  On"
"1582","any matter submitted to a vote of Shareholders, all Shares of"
"1583","the Trust then entitled to vote shall, except as otherwise"
"1584","provided in the Bylaws, be voted in the aggregate as a single"
"1585","class without regard to series or classes of shares, except (1)"
"1586","when required by the 1940 Act or when the Trustees shall have"
"1587","determined that the matter affects one or more series or classes"
"1588","of Shares materially differently, Shares shall be voted by"
"1589","individual series or class; and (2) when the Trustees have"
"1590","determined that the matter affects only the interests of one or"
"1591","more series or classes, only Shareholders of such series or"
"1592","classes shall be entitled to vote thereon.  There shall be no"
"1593","cumulative voting in the election of Trustees.  Shares may be"
"1594","voted in person or by proxy.  A proxy with respect to Shares"
"1595","held in the name of two or more persons shall be valid if"
"1596","executed by any one of them unless at or prior to exercise of"
"1597","the proxy the Trust receives a specific written notice to the"
"1598","contrary from any one of them.  A proxy purporting to be"
"1599","executed by or on behalf of a Shareholder shall be deemed valid"
"1600","unless challenged at or prior to its exercise and, in the case"
"1601","of a challenge by any person other than the Trust, the burden of"
"1602","proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger.  Until Shares"
"1603","of any series or class are issued, the Trustees may exercise all"
"1604","rights of Shareholders and may take any action required by law,"
"1605","this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws to be taken by"
"1606","Shareholders as to such series or class."
"1607","Voting Power and Meetings"
"1608","      Section 2.	Meetings of Shareholders of any or all series or"
"1609","classes may be called by the Trustees from time to time for the"
"1610","purpose of taking action upon any matter requiring the vote or"
"1611","authority of the Shareholders of such series or classes as"
"1612","herein provided or upon any other matter deemed by the Trustees"
"1613","to be necessary or desirable.  Written notice of any meeting of"
"1614","Shareholders shall be given or caused to be given by the"
"1615","Trustees by mailing such notice at least seven days before such"
"1616","meeting, postage prepaid, stating the time, place and purpose of"
"1617","the meeting, to each Shareholder entitled to vote at such"
"1618","meeting at the Shareholders address as it appears on the records"
"1619","of the Trust.  If the Trustees shall fail to call or give notice"
"1620","of any meeting of Shareholders for a period of 30 days after"
"1621","written application by Shareholders holding at least 10% of the"
"1622","then outstanding shares of all series and classes entitled to"
"1623","vote at such meeting requesting a meeting to be called for a"
"1624","purpose requiring action by the Shareholders as provided herein"
"1625","or in the Bylaws, then Shareholders holding at least 10% of the"
"1626","then outstanding Shares of all series and classes entitled to"
"1627","vote at such meeting may call and give notice of such meeting,"
"1628","and thereupon the meeting shall be held in the manner provided"
"1629","for herein in case of call thereof by the Trustees.  Notice of a"
"1630","meeting need not be given to any Shareholder if a written waiver"
"1631","of notice, executed by him or her before or after the meeting,"
"1632","is filed with the records of the meeting, or to any Shareholder"
"1633","who attends the meeting without protesting prior thereto or at"
"1634","its commencement the lack of notice to him or her."
"1635","Quorum and Required Vote"
"1636","      Section 3.	Thirty percent of Shares entitled to vote on a"
"1637","particular matter shall be a quorum for the transaction of"
"1638","business on that matter at a Shareholders meeting, except that"
"1639","where any provision of law or of this Declaration of Trust or"
"1640","the Bylaws requires that holders of any series or class shall"
"1641","vote as an individual series or class, then thirty percent of"
"1642","the aggregate number of Shares of that series or class entitled"
"1643","to vote shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the"
"1644","transaction of business by that series or class.  Any lesser"
"1645","number shall be sufficient for adjournments.  Any adjourned"
"1646","session or sessions may be held, within a reasonable time after"
"1647","the date set for the original meeting, without the necessity of"
"1648","further notice.  Except when a larger vote is required by any"
"1649","provision of law or of this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws,"
"1650","a majority of the Shares voted shall decide any questions and a"
"1651","plurality shall elect a Trustee, provided that where any"
"1652","provision of law or of this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws"
"1653","requires that the holders of any series or class shall vote as"
"1654","an individual series or class then a majority of the Shares of"
"1655","that series or class voted on the matter (or a plurality with"
"1656","respect to the election of a Trustee) shall decide that matter"
"1657","insofar as that series or class is concerned."
"1658","Action by Written Consent"
"1659","      Section 4.	Any action taken by Shareholders may be taken"
"1660","without a meeting if a majority of Shareholders entitled to vote"
"1661","on the matter (or such larger proportion thereof as shall be"
"1662","required by any express provision of this Declaration of Trust"
"1663","or the Bylaws) consent to the action in writing and such written"
"1664","consents are filed with the records of the meetings of"
"1665","Shareholders.  Such consent shall be treated for all purposes as"
"1666","a vote taken at a meeting of Shareholders."
"1667","Additional Provisions"
"1668","      Section 5.	The Bylaws may include further provisions, not"
"1669","inconsistent with this Declaration of Trust, regarding"
"1670","Shareholders voting powers, the conduct of meetings and related"
"1671","matters."
"1672","ARTICLE VI"
"1673","Distributions, Redemptions and Repurchases"
"1674","Distributions"
"1675","      Section 1.	The Trustees may each year, or more frequently if"
"1676","they so determine, distribute to the Shareholders of each series"
"1677","out of the assets of such series such amounts as the Trustees"
"1678","may determine.  Any such distribution to the Shareholders of a"
"1679","particular series shall be made to said Shareholders pro rata in"
"1680","proportion to the number of Shares of such series held by each"
"1681","of them, except to the extent otherwise required or permitted by"
"1682","the preferences and special or relative rights and privileges of"
"1683","any classes of Shares of that Series, and any distribution to"
"1684","the Shareholders of a particular class of Shares shall be made"
"1685","to such Shareholders pro rata in proportion to the number of"
"1686","Shares of such class held by each of them.  Such distributions"
"1687","shall be made in cash, Shares or other property, or a"
"1688","combination thereof, as determined by the Trustees.  Any such"
"1689","distribution paid in Shares will be paid at the net asset value"
"1690","thereof as determined in accordance with the Bylaws."
"1691","Redemptions and Repurchases"
"1692","      Section 2.	The Trust shall purchase such Shares as are offered"
"1693","by any Shareholder for redemption, upon the presentation of any"
"1694","certificate for the Shares to be purchased, a proper instrument"
"1695","of transfer and a request directed to the Trust or a person"
"1696","designated by the Trust that the Trust purchase such Shares, or"
"1697","in accordance with such other procedures for redemption as the"
"1698","Trustees may from time to time authorize; and the Trust will pay"
"1699","therefor the net asset value thereof, as next determined in"
"1700","accordance with the Bylaws, less any redemption charge fixed by"
"1701","the Trustees.  Payment for said Shares shall be made by the"
"1702","Trust to the Shareholder within seven days after the date on"
"1703","which the request is made.  The obligation set forth in this"
"1704","Section 2 is subject to the provision that in the event that at"
"1705","any time the New York Stock Exchange is closed for other than"
"1706","customary weekends or holidays, or, if permitted by rules of the"
"1707","Securities and Exchange Commission, during periods when trading"
"1708","on the Exchange is restricted or during any emergency which"
"1709","makes it impractical for the Trust to dispose of its investments"
"1710","or to determine fairly the value of its net assets, or during"
"1711","any other period permitted by order of the Securities and"
"1712","Exchange Commission for the protection of investors, such"
"1713","obligation may be suspended or postponed by the Trustees.  The"
"1714","Trust may also purchase or repurchase Shares at a price not"
"1715","exceeding the net asset value of such Shares in effect when the"
"1716","purchase or repurchase or any contract to purchase or repurchase"
"1717","is made.  Payment for any redemption, purchase or repurchase may"
"1718","be made in cash or, except to the extent prohibited by the laws"
"1719","of any jurisdiction in which Shares are registered for sale, in"
"1720","other property, or any combination thereof.  The composition of"
"1721","any such payment shall be determined by the Trust in its sole"
"1722","discretion, and the Trust shall have no obligation to effect a"
"1723","pro rata division of cash or other property in making any such"
"1724","payment.  In no event shall the Trust be liable for any delay of"
"1725","any other person in transferring securities or other property"
"1726","selected for delivery as all or part of any such payment."
"1727","Redemption at the Option of the Trust"
"1728","      Section 3.	The Trust shall have the right at its option and at"
"1729","any time to redeem Shares of any Shareholder at the net asset"
"1730","value thereof as determined in accordance with the Bylaws: (i)"
"1731","if at such time such Shareholder owns fewer Shares than, or"
"1732","Shares having an aggregate net asset value of less than, an"
"1733","amount determined from time to time by the Trustees, in which"
"1734","case the Trust may redeem all Shares owned by such Shareholder"
"1735","or only so many of such Shares as may be required to compensate"
"1736","the Trust for any fee fixed from time to time by the Trustees"
"1737","for the maintenance of small accounts; (ii) to the extent that"
"1738","such Shareholder owns Shares of a particular series of Shares"
"1739","equal to or in excess of a percentage of the outstanding Shares"
"1740","of that series determined from time to time by the Trustees;"
"1741","(iii) to the extent that such Shareholder owns Shares of the"
"1742","Trust representing a percentage equal to or in excess of such"
"1743","percentage of the aggregate number of outstanding Shares of the"
"1744","Trust or the aggregate net asset value of the Trust determined"
"1745","from time to time by the Trustees; (iv) if such Shareholder"
"1746","fails to supply appropriate personal and tax identification"
"1747","information requested by the Trust; (v) if such Shareholder"
"1748","fails to meet or maintain the qualifications for ownership of a"
"1749","particular series or class; or (vi) if the Trustees determine"
"1750","for any other reason, in their sole discretion, that the"
"1751","ownership of Shares by a Shareholder is not in the best"
"1752","interests of the remaining Shareholders of the Trust or of the"
"1753","applicable series or class."

"1755","Compensation and Limitation of Liability of Trustees"
"1756","Compensation"
"1757","      Section 1.	The Trustees as such shall be entitled to reasonable"
"1758","compensation from the Trust; they may fix the amount of their"
"1759","compensation.  Nothing herein shall in any way prevent the"
"1760","employment of any Trustee for advisory, management, legal,"

"1762","the same by the Trust."
"1763","Limitation of Liability"
"1764","      Section 2.	A Trustee shall be liable for his or her own willful"
"1765","misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard"
"1766","of the duties involved in the conduct of the office of Trustee,"

"1768","liable in any event for any neglect or wrongdoing of any"
"1769","officer, agent, employee, manager or principal underwriter of"
"1770","the Trust, nor shall any Trustee be responsible for the act or"
"1771","omission of any other Trustee. The appointment, designation or"
"1772","identification of a Trustee as an officer of the Trustees or of"
"1773","any committee of the Trustees, or as an expert with respect to"
"1774","certain matters (including without limitation identification of"
"1775","a Trustee as an audit committee financial expert) shall not"
"1776","impose on that person any duty, obligation or liability that is"
"1777","greater than the duties, obligations and liabilities imposed on"
"1778","that person as a Trustee in the absence of such appointment,"
"1779","designation or identification, and no Trustee who has special"
"1780","skills or expertise or who is appointed, designated of"
"1781","identified as aforesaid, shall be held to a higher standard of"
"1782","care by virtue thereof or be limited in any way with respect to"
"1783","any right or privilege to which such person would otherwise be"
"1784","entitled as a Trustee hereunder, including without limitation"
"1785","the right of indemnification. Nothing herein contained shall"
"1786","protect any Trustee against any liability to which he or she"
"1787","would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad"
"1788","faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties"
"1789","involved in the conduct of his or her office."
"1790","ARTICLE VIII"
"1791","Indemnification"
"1792","Trustees, Officers, etc."
"1793","      Section 1.	The Trust shall indemnify each of its Trustees and"
"1794","officers (including persons who serve at the Trusts request as"
"1795","directors, officers or trustees of another organization in which"
"1796","the Trust has any interest as a shareholder, creditor or"
"1797","otherwise) (hereinafter referred to as a Covered Person) against"
"1798","all liabilities and expenses, including but not limited to"
"1799","amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromise or as"
"1800","fines and penalties, and counsel fees reasonably incurred by any"
"1801","Covered Person in connection with the defense or disposition of"
"1802","any threatened, pending, or contemplated action, suit, or"
"1803","proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,"
"1804","arbitrative, or investigative and whether formal or informal"
"1805","before any court or administrative or legislative or other body,"
"1806","in which such Covered Person may be or may have been involved as"
"1807","a party or otherwise or with which such Covered Person may be or"
"1808","may have been threatened, while in office or thereafter, by"
"1809","reason of being or having been such a Covered Person except with"
"1810","respect to any matter as to which such Covered Person shall have"
"1811","been finally adjudicated in any such action, suit or other"
"1812","proceeding (a) not to have acted in good faith, (b) not to have"
"1813","acted in the reasonable belief that such Covered Persons action"
"1814","was in the best interests of the Trust or at least was not"
"1815","opposed to the best interests of the Trust, (c) in the case of a"
"1816","criminal proceeding, to have had reasonable cause to believe his"
"1817","or her action was unlawful or (d) to be liable to the Trust or"
"1818","its Shareholders by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith,"
"1819","gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in"
"1820","the conduct of such Covered Persons office (each of such"
"1821","exceptions being referred to hereinafter as Disabling Conduct)."
"1822","Expenses, including counsel fees so incurred by any such Covered"
"1823","Person (but excluding amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments,"
"1824","in compromise or as fines or penalties), shall be paid from time"
"1825","to time by the Trust in advance of the final disposition of any"
"1826","such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking"
"1827","by or on behalf of such Covered Person to repay amounts so paid"
"1828","to the Trust if it is ultimately determined that indemnification"
"1829","of such expenses is not authorized under this Article, provided,"
"1830","however, that either (a) such Covered Person shall have provided"
"1831","appropriate security for such undertaking, (b) the Trust shall"
"1832","be insured against losses arising from any such advance payments"
"1833","or (c) either a majority of the disinterested Trustees acting on"
"1834","the matter (provided that a majority of the disinterested"
"1835","Trustees then in office act on the matter), or independent legal"
"1836","counsel in a written opinion, shall have determined, based upon"
"1837","a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial"
"1838","type inquiry) that there is reason to believe that such Covered"
"1839","Person will be found entitled to indemnification under this"
"1840","Article. In making any such determination, the disinterested"
"1841","Trustees or such counsel, as the case may be, shall afford the"
"1842","Covered Person a rebuttable presumption that the Covered Person"
"1843","did not engage in Disabling Conduct."
"1844","Compromise Payment"
"1845","      Section 2.	As to any matter disposed of (whether by a"
"1846","compromise payment, pursuant to a consent decree or otherwise)"
"1847","without an adjudication by a court, or by any other body before"
"1848","which the action, suit, or proceeding was brought, that such"
"1849","Covered Person engaged in Disabling Conduct, indemnification"
"1850","shall be provided if (a) approved as in the best interests of"
"1851","the Trust, after notice that it involves such indemnification,"
"1852","by at least a majority of the disinterested Trustees acting on"
"1853","the matter (provided that a majority of the disinterested"
"1854","Trustees then in office act on the matter) upon a determination,"
"1855","based upon a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a"
"1856","full trial type inquiry) that such Covered Person did not engage"
"1857","in Disabling Conduct, or (b) there has been obtained an opinion"
"1858","in writing of independent legal counsel, based upon a review of"
"1859","readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial type"
"1860","inquiry) to the effect that such Covered Person did not engage"
"1861","in Disabling Conduct.  Any approval pursuant to this Section"
"1862","shall not prevent the recovery from any Covered Person of any"
"1863","amount paid to such Covered Person in accordance with this"
"1864","Section as indemnification if such Covered Person is"
"1865","subsequently adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction"
"1866","not to have engaged in Disabling Conduct."
"1867","Right Not Exclusive"
"1868","      Section 3.	The right of indemnification hereby provided shall"
"1869","not be exclusive of or affect any other rights to which such"
"1870","Covered Person may be entitled.  As used in this Article VIII,"
"1871","the term Covered Person shall include such persons heirs,"
"1872","executors and administrators and a disinterested Trustee is a"
"1873","Trustee who is not an interested person of the Trust as defined"
"1874","in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (or who has been exempted"
"1875","from being an interested person by any rule, regulation or order"
"1876","of the Securities and Exchange Commission) and against whom none"
"1877","of such actions, suits or other proceedings or another action,"
"1878","suit or other proceeding on the same or similar grounds is then"
"1879","or has been pending.  Nothing contained in this Article shall"
"1880","affect any rights to indemnification to which personnel of the"
"1881","Trust, other than Trustees or officers, and other persons may be"
"1882","entitled by contract or otherwise under law, nor the power of"
"1883","the Trust to purchase and maintain liability insurance on behalf"
"1884","of any such person."
"1885","Shareholders"
"1886","      Section 4.	In case any Shareholder or former Shareholder shall"
"1887","be held to be personally liable solely by reason of his or her"
"1888","being or having been a Shareholder and not because of his or her"
"1889","acts or omissions or for some other reason, the Shareholder or"
"1890","former Shareholder (or his or her heirs, executors,"
"1891","administrators or other legal representative or in the case of a"
"1892","corporation or other entity, its corporate or other general"
"1893","successor) shall be entitled to be held harmless from and"
"1894","indemnified against all loss and expense arising from such"
"1895","liability, but only out of the assets of the particular series"
"1896","of Shares of which he or she is or was a Shareholder."

"2090","PUTNAM DIVERSIFIED INCOME TRUST"
"2091","MANAGEMENT CONTRACT"
"2092","      This Management Contract is dated as of February 27, 2014"
"2093","between PUTNAM DIVERSIFIED INCOME TRUST, a Massachusetts"
"2094","business trust (the Fund), and PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, LLC,"
"2095","a Delaware limited liability company (the Manager)."
"2096","      In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained,"
"2097","it is agreed as follows:"
"2098","1. 	SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BY MANAGER TO FUND."
"2099","      (a) 	The Manager, at its expense, will furnish continuously"
"2100","an investment program for the Fund or, in the case of a Fund"
"2101","that has divided its shares into two or more series under"
"2102","Section 18(f)(2) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as"
"2103","amended (the 1940 Act), each series of the Fund identified from"
"2104","time to time on Schedule A to this Contract (each reference in"
"2105","this Contract to a Fund or to the Fund is also deemed to be a"
"2106","reference to any existing series of the Fund, as appropriate in"
"2107","the particular context), will determine what investments will be"
"2108","purchased, held, sold or exchanged by the Fund and what portion,"
"2109","if any, of the assets of the Fund will be held uninvested and"
"2110","will, on behalf of the Fund, make changes in such investments."
"2111","Subject always to the control of the Trustees of the Fund and"
"2112","except for the functions carried out by the officers and"
"2113","personnel referred to in Section 1(d), the Manager will also"
"2114","manage, supervise and conduct the other affairs and business of"
"2115","the Fund and matters incidental thereto. In the performance of"
"2116","its duties, the Manager will comply with the provisions of the"
"2117","Agreement and Declaration of Trust and By-Laws of the Fund and"
"2118","the stated investment objectives, policies and restrictions of"
"2119","the Fund, will use its best efforts to safeguard and promote the"
"2120","welfare of the Fund and to comply with other policies which the"
"2121","Trustees may from time to time determine and will exercise the"
"2122","same care and diligence expected of the Trustees."
"2123","      (b) 	The Manager, at its expense, except as such expense is"
"2124","paid by the Fund as provided in Section 1(d), will furnish (1)"
"2125","all necessary investment and management facilities, including"
"2126","salaries of personnel, required for it to execute its duties"
"2127","faithfully; (2) suitable office space for the Fund; and (3)"
"2128","administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical"
"2129","personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of"
"2130","the affairs of the Fund, including determination of the net"
"2131","asset value of the Fund, but excluding shareholder accounting"
"2132","services. Except as otherwise provided in Section 1(d), the"
"2133","Manager will pay the compensation, if any, of the officers of"
"2134","the Fund."
"2135","      (c) 	The Manager, at its expense, will place all orders for"
"2136","the purchase and sale of portfolio investments for the Funds"
"2137","account with brokers or dealers selected by the Manager. In the"
"2138","selection of such brokers or dealers and the placing of such"
"2139","orders, the Manager will use its best efforts to obtain for the"
"2140","Fund the most favorable price and execution available, except to"
"2141","the extent it may be permitted to pay higher brokerage"
"2142","commissions for brokerage and research services as described"
"2143","below. In using its best efforts to obtain for the Fund the most"
"2144","favorable price and execution available, the Manager, bearing in"
"2145","mind the Funds best interests at all times, will consider all"
"2146","factors it deems relevant, including by way of illustration,"
"2147","price, the size of the transaction, the nature of the market for"
"2148","the security, the amount of the commission, the timing of the"
"2149","transaction taking into account market prices and trends, the"
"2150","reputation, experience and"
"2151","financial stability of the broker or dealer involved and the"
"2152","quality of service rendered by the broker or dealer in other"
"2153","transactions. Subject to such policies as the Trustees of the"
"2154","Fund may determine, the Manager will not be deemed to have acted"
"2155","unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this Contract"
"2156","or otherwise solely by reason of its having caused the Fund to"
"2157","pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and research"
"2158","services to the Manager an amount of commission for effecting a"
"2159","portfolio investment transaction in excess of the amount of"
"2160","commission another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"2161","effecting that transaction, if the Manager determines in good"
"2162","faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation"
"2163","to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by"
"2164","such broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular"
"2165","transaction or the Managers overall responsibilities with"
"2166","respect to the Fund and to other clients of the Manager as to"
"2167","which the Manager exercises investment discretion. The Manager"
"2168","agrees that in connection with purchases or sales of portfolio"
"2169","investments for the Funds account, neither the Manager nor any"
"2170","officer, director, employee or agent of the Manager shall act as"
"2171","a principal or receive any commission other than as provided in"
"2172","Section 3."
"2173","      (d) 	The Fund will pay or reimburse the Manager for the"
"2174","compensation in whole or in part of such officers of the Fund"
"2175","and persons assisting them as may be determined from time to"
"2176","time by the Trustees of the Fund. The Fund will also pay or"
"2177","reimburse the Manager for all or part of the cost of suitable"
"2178","office space, utilities, support services and equipment"
"2179","attributable to such officers and persons as may be determined"
"2180","in each case by the Trustees of the Fund. The Fund will pay the"
"2181","fees, if any, of the Trustees of the Fund."
"2182","      (e) 	The Manager will not be obligated to pay any expenses"
"2183","of or for the Fund not expressly assumed by the Manager pursuant"
"2184","to this Section 1 other than as provided in Section 3."
"2185","      (f) 	Subject to the prior approval of a majority of the"
"2186","Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who are not"
"2187","interested persons and, to the extent required by the 1940 Act"
"2188","and the rules and regulations under the 1940 Act, subject to any"
"2189","applicable guidance or interpretation of the Securities and"
"2190","Exchange Commission or its staff, by the shareholders of the"
"2191","Fund, the Manager may, from time to time, delegate to a sub-"
"2192","adviser or sub-administrator any of the Managers duties under"
"2193","this Contract, including the management of all or a portion of"
"2194","the assets being managed. In all instances, however, the Manager"
"2195","must oversee the provision of delegated services, the Manager"
"2196","must bear the separate costs of employing any sub-adviser or"
"2197","sub-administrator, and no delegation will relieve the Manager of"
"2198","any of its obligations under this Contract."
"2199","2. 	OTHER AGREEMENTS, ETC."
"2200","      It is understood that any of the shareholders, Trustees,"
"2201","officers and employees of the Fund may be a shareholder,"
"2202","director, officer or employee of, or be otherwise interested in,"
"2203","the Manager, and in any person controlled by or under common"
"2204","control with the Manager, and that the Manager and any person"
"2205","controlled by or under common control with the Manager may have"
"2206","an interest in the Fund. It is also understood that the Manager"
"2207","and any person controlled by or under common control with the"
"2208","Manager may have advisory, management, service or other"
"2209","contracts with other organizations and persons and may have"
"2210","other interests and business."
"2211","3. 	COMPENSATION TO BE PAID BY THE FUND TO THE MANAGER."
"2212","      The Fund will pay to the Manager as compensation for the"
"2213","Managers services rendered, for the facilities furnished and for"
"2214","the expenses borne by the Manager pursuant to paragraphs (a),"
"2215","(b), and (c) of Section 1, a fee, based on the Funds Average Net"
"2216","Assets, computed and paid monthly at the annual rates set forth"
"2217","on Schedule B attached to this Contract, as from time to time"
"2218","amended. The Funds Average Net Assets means the average of all"
"2219","of the determinations of the Funds net asset value at the close"
"2220","of business on each business day during each month while this"
"2221","Contract is in effect. The fee is payable for each month within"
"2222","15 days after the close of the month."
"2223","      The fees payable by the Fund to the Manager pursuant to"
"2224","this Section 3 will be reduced by any commissions, fees,"
"2225","brokerage or similar payments received by the Manager or any"
"2226","affiliated person of the Manager in connection with the purchase"
"2227","and sale of portfolio investments of the Fund, less any direct"
"2228","expenses approved by the Trustees incurred by the Manager or any"
"2229","affiliated person of the Manager in connection with obtaining"
"2230","such payments."
"2231","      In the event that expenses of the Fund for any fiscal year"
"2232","exceed the expense limitation on investment company expenses"
"2233","imposed by any statute or regulatory authority of any"
"2234","jurisdiction in which shares of the Fund are qualified for offer"
"2235","or sale, the compensation due the Manager for such fiscal year"
"2236","will be reduced by the amount of excess by a reduction or refund"
"2237","thereof. In the event that the expenses of the Fund exceed any"
"2238","expense limitation which the Manager may, by written notice to"
"2239","the Fund, voluntarily declare to be effective subject to such"
"2240","terms and conditions as the Manager may prescribe in such notice,"
"2241","the compensation due the Manager will be reduced, and if"
"2242","necessary, the Manager will assume expenses of the Fund, to the"
"2243","extent required by the terms and conditions of such expense"
"2244","limitation."
"2245","      If the Manager serves for less than the whole of a month,"
"2246","the foregoing compensation will be prorated."
"2247","4. 	ASSIGNMENT TERMINATES THIS CONTRACT; AMENDMENTS OF THIS"
"2248","CONTRACT."
"2249","      This Contract will automatically terminate, without the"
"2250","payment of any penalty, in the event of its assignment, provided"
"2251","that no delegation of responsibilities by the Manager pursuant"
"2252","to Section 1(f) will be deemed to constitute an assignment. No"
"2253","provision of this Contract may be changed, waived, discharged or"
"2254","terminated orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed"
"2255","by the party against which enforcement of the change, waiver,"
"2256","discharge or termination is sought. No amendment of this"
"2257","Contract is effective until approved in a manner consistent with"
"2258","the 1940 Act, the rules and regulations under the 1940 Act and"
"2259","any applicable guidance or interpretation of the Securities and"
"2260","Exchange Commission or its staff."
"2261","5. 	EFFECTIVE PERIOD AND TERMINATION OF THIS CONTRACT."
"2262","      This Contract is effective upon its execution and will"
"2263","remain in full force and effect as to a Fund continuously"
"2264","thereafter (unless terminated automatically as set forth in"

"2457","SUB-MANAGEMENT CONTRACT"
"2458","      This Sub-Management Contract is dated as of February 27, 2014"
"2459","between PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, LLC, a Delaware limited"
"2460","liability company (the Manager) and PUTNAM INVESTMENTS LIMITED, a"
"2461","company organized under the laws of England and Wales (the Sub-"
"2462","Manager)."
"2463","      WHEREAS, the Manager is the investment manager of each of the"
"2464","investment companies registered under the United States Investment"
"2465","Company Act of 1940, as amended, that are identified on Schedule A"
"2466","hereto, as it may from time to time be amended by the Manager (the"
"2467","Funds), and a registered investment adviser under the United"
"2468","States Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended;"
"2469","      WHEREAS, the Sub-Manager is licensed as an investment manager"
"2470","by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom (the"
"2471","FCA); and"
"2472","      WHEREAS, the Manager desires to engage the Sub-Manager from"
"2473","time to time to manage a portion of certain of the Funds:"
"2474","      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants"
"2475","herein contained, it is agreed as follows:"
"2476","1.	SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BY SUB-MANAGER."
"2477","      (a)	The Sub-Manager, at its expense, will furnish"
"2478","continuously an investment program for that portion of any Fund"
"2479","the management of which is allocated from time to time by the"
"2480","Manager to the Sub-Manager (an Allocated Sleeve). The Manager"
"2481","shall, in its sole discretion, determine which Funds will have an"
"2482","Allocated Sleeve and the amount of assets allocated from time to"
"2483","time to each such Allocated Sleeve; provided that, with respect to"
"2484","any Fund, the Trustees of such Fund must have approved the use of"
"2485","the Sub-Manager prior to the creation of an Allocated Sleeve for"
"2486","such Fund. The Sub-Manager will determine what investments shall"
"2487","be purchased, held, sold or exchanged by any Allocated Sleeve and"
"2488","what portion, if any, of the assets of the Allocated Sleeve shall"
"2489","be held uninvested and shall, on behalf of the Fund, make changes"
"2490","in the Funds investments held in such Allocated Sleeve."
"2491","      (b)	The Manager may also, at its discretion, request the"
"2492","Sub-Manager to provide assistance with purchasing and selling"
"2493","securities for any Fund, including the placement of orders with"
"2494","broker-dealers selected in accordance with Section 1(d), even if"
"2495","the Manager has not established an Allocated Sleeve for such Fund."
"2496","      (c)	The Sub-Manager at its expense will furnish all"
"2497","necessary investment and management facilities, including salaries"
"2498","of personnel, required for it to execute its duties faithfully."
"2499","      (d)	The Sub-Manager shall place all orders for the purchase"
"2500","and sale of portfolio investments for any Allocated Sleeve with"
"2501","brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Manager. In the selection"
"2502","of such brokers or dealers and the placing of such orders, the"
"2503","Sub-Manager shall use its best efforts to obtain for the related"
"2504","Fund the most favorable price and execution available, except to"
"2505","the extent it may be permitted to pay higher brokerage commissions"
"2506","for brokerage and research services as described below. In using"
"2507","its best efforts to obtain for the Fund the most favorable price"
"2508","and execution available, the Sub-Manager, bearing in mind the"
"2509","Funds best interests at all times, shall consider all factors it"
"2510","deems relevant, including by way of illustration, price, the size"
"2511","of the transaction, the nature of the market for the security, the"
"2512","amount of the commission, the timing of the transaction taking"
"2513","into account market prices and trends, the reputation, experience"
"2514","and financial stability of the broker or dealer involved and the"
"2515","quality of service rendered by the broker or dealer in other"
"2516","transactions. Subject to such policies as the Trustees of the"
"2517","Funds may determine, the Sub-Manager shall not be deemed to have"
"2518","acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this"
"2519","Contract or otherwise solely by reason of its having caused a Fund"
"2520","to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and research"
"2521","services to the Manager or the Sub-Manager an amount of commission"
"2522","for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in excess of the"
"2523","amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged"
"2524","for effecting that transaction, if the Sub-Manager determines in"
"2525","good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in"
"2526","relation to the value of the brokerage and research services"
"2527","provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that"
"2528","particular transaction or its overall responsibilities with"
"2529","respect to the Fund and to other clients of the Manager or the"
"2530","Sub-Manager as to which the Manager or the Sub-Manager exercises"
"2531","investment discretion. The Sub-Manager agrees that in connection"
"2532","with purchases or sales of portfolio investments for any Fund,"
"2533","neither the Sub-Manager nor any officer, director, employee or"
"2534","agent of the Sub-Manager shall act as a principal or receive any"
"2535","commission other than as provided in Section 3."
"2536","      (e)	The Sub-Manager shall not be obligated to pay any"
"2537","expenses of or for the Manager or any Fund not expressly assumed"
"2538","by the Sub-Manager pursuant to this Section 1."
"2539","      (f)	In the performance of its duties, the Sub-Manager will"
"2540","comply with the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of"
"2541","Trust and By-Laws of each applicable Fund and such Funds stated"
"2542","investment objectives, policies and restrictions, and will use its"
"2543","best efforts to safeguard and promote the welfare of such Fund and"
"2544","to comply with other policies which the Manager or the Trustees"
"2545","may from time to time determine and shall exercise the same care"
"2546","and diligence expected of the Manager."
"2547","2.	OTHER AGREEMENTS, ETC."
"2548","      It is understood that any of the shareholders, Trustees,"
"2549","officers and employees of a Fund may be a shareholder, director,"
"2550","officer or employee of, or be otherwise interested in, the Sub-"
"2551","Manager, and in any person controlled by or under common control"
"2552","with the Sub-Manager, and that the Sub-Manager and any person"
"2553","controlled by or under common control with the Sub-Manager may"
"2554","have an interest in such Fund. It is also understood that the Sub-"
"2555","Manager and any person controlled by or under common control with"
"2556","the Sub-Manager have and may have advisory, management, service or"
"2557","other contracts with other organizations and persons, and may have"
"2558","other interests and business."
"2559","3.	COMPENSATION."
"2560","      Except as provided below, the Manager will pay to the Sub-"
"2561","Manager as compensation for the Sub-Managers services rendered, a"
"2562","fee, computed and paid quarterly at the annual rate of 0.35% per"
"2563","annum of average aggregate net asset value of the assets in equity"
"2564","and asset allocation Allocated Sleeves and 0.40% per annum of"
"2565","average aggregate net asset value of the assets in fixed income"
"2566","Allocated Sleeves, except for fixed income Allocated Sleeves in"
"2567","certain fixed income Funds enumerated as follows (with the per"
"2568","annum fee provided in parentheses): Putnam Money Market Liquidity"
"2569","Fund (0.20%), Putnam Short Term Investment Fund (0.20%), Putnam"
"2570","Money Market Fund (0.25%), Putnam Tax Exempt Money Market Fund"
"2571","(0.25%), Putnam VT Money Market Fund (0.25%), Putnam Short"
"2572","Duration Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income"
"2573","Fund (0.25%), Putnam American Government Income Fund (0.25%),"
"2574","Putnam Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam U.S. Government Income Trust"
"2575","(0.25%), Putnam VT American Government Income Fund (0.25%), and"
"2576","Putnam VT Income Fund (0.25%)."
"2577","      Such average net asset value shall be determined by taking an"
"2578","average of all of the determinations of such net asset value"
"2579","during a quarter at the close of business on each business day"
"2580","during such quarter while this Contract is in effect. Such fee"
"2581","shall be payable for each quarter within 30 days after the close"
"2582","of such quarter. The Sub-Manager shall look only to the Manager"
"2583","for payment of its fees. No Fund shall have any responsibility for"
"2584","paying any fees due the Sub-Manager."
"2585","      With respect to each of Putnam High Income Securities Fund,"
"2586","Putnam Master Intermediate Income Trust and Putnam Premier Income"
"2587","Trust, the Manager will pay to the Sub-Manager as compensation for"
"2588","the Sub-Managers services rendered, a fee, computed and paid"
"2589","quarterly at the annual rate of 0.40% of Average Weekly Assets in"
"2590","Allocated Sleeves. Average Weekly Assets means the average of the"
"2591","weekly determinations of the difference between the total assets"
"2592","of the Fund (including any assets attributable to leverage for"
"2593","investment purposes) attributable to an Allocated Sleeve and the"
"2594","total liabilities of the Fund (excluding liabilities incurred in"
"2595","connection with leverage for investment purposes) attributable to"
"2596","such Allocated Sleeve, determined at the close of the last"
"2597","business day of each week, for each week which ends during the"
"2598","quarter. Such fee shall be payable for each quarter within 30 days"
"2599","after the close of such quarter. As used in this Section 3,"
"2600","leverage for investment purposes means any incurrence of"
"2601","indebtedness the proceeds of which are to be invested in"
"2602","accordance with the Funds investment objective. For purposes of"
"2603","calculating Average Weekly Assets, liabilities associated with any"
"2604","instruments or transactions used to leverage the Funds portfolio"
"2605","for investment purposes (whether or not such instruments or"
"2606","transactions are covered within the meaning of the Investment"
"2607","Company Act of 1940 and the rules and regulations thereunder,"
"2608","giving effect to any interpretations of the Securities and"
"2609","Exchange Commission and its staff) are not considered liabilities."
"2610","For purposes of calculating Average Weekly Assets, the total"
"2611","assets of the Fund will be deemed to include (a) any proceeds from"
"2612","the sale or transfer of an asset (the Underlying Asset) of the"
"2613","Fund to a counterparty in a reverse repurchase or dollar roll"
"2614","transaction and (b) the value of such Underlying Asset as of the"
"2615","relevant measuring date."
"2616","      In the event that the Managers management fee from any of"
"2617","Putnam High Income Securities Fund, Putnam Master Intermediate"
"2618","Income Trust or Putnam Premier Income Trust is reduced pursuant to"
"2619","the investment management contract between such Fund and the"
"2620","Manager because during any Measurement Period (as defined below)"
"2621","the amount of interest payments and fees with respect to"
"2622","indebtedness or other obligation of the Fund incurred for"
"2623","investment leverage purposes, plus additional expenses"
"2624","attributable to any such leverage for investment purposes, exceeds"
"2625","the portion of the Funds net income and net short-term capital"
"2626","gains (but not long-term capital gains) accruing during such"
"2627","Measurement Period as a result of the fact that such indebtedness"
"2628","or other obligation was outstanding during the Measurement Period,"
"2629","the fee payable to  the Sub-Manager with respect to such Fund"
"2630","shall be reduced in the same proportion as the fee paid to the"
"2631","Manager with respect to such Fund is so reduced. Measurement"
"2632","Period shall be any period for which payments of interest or fees"
"2633","(whether designated as such or implied) are payable in connection"
"2634","with any indebtedness or other obligation of the Fund incurred for"
"2635","investment purposes."
"2636","      If the Sub-Manager shall serve for less than the whole of a"
"2637","quarter, the foregoing compensation shall be prorated."
"2638","4.	ASSIGNMENT TERMINATES THIS CONTRACT; AMENDMENTS OF THIS"
"2639","CONTRACT."
"2640","      This Contract shall automatically terminate without the"
"2641","payment of any penalty, in the event of its assignment; and this"
