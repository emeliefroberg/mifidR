"1042","To the Trustees of Eaton Vance Growth"
"1043","Trust and Shareholders of Eaton Vance"
"1044","Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap Fund:"
"1045","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"1046","financial statements of Eaton Vance Atlanta"
"1047","Capital SMID-Cap Fund (the Fund) (one"
"1048","of the funds constituting Eaton Vance"
"1049","Growth Trust) as of and for the year ended"
"1050","September 30, 2012,  in accordance with the"
"1051","standards of the Public Company"
"1052","Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1053","States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"1054","control over financial reporting, including"
"1055","controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"1056","basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"1057","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1058","the financial statements and to comply with"
"1059","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"1060","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1061","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"1062","control over financial reporting."
"1063","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1064","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"1065","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"1066","internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"1067","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1068","judgments by management are required to"
"1069","assess the expected benefits and related"
"1070","costs of controls.  A fund's internal control"
"1071","over financial reporting is a process designed"
"1072","to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1073","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1074","preparation of financial statements for"
