"913","To the Shareholders and"
"914","Board of Trustees of"
"915","Federated Stock and Bond Fund"
"916","In planning and performing"
"917","our audit of the financial"
"918","statements of Federated"
"919","Stock and Bond"
"920","Fund (the Fund) as of and"
"921","for the year ended November"
"922","30, 2009, in accordance with the"
"923","standards of the Public"
"924","Company Accounting Oversight"
"925","Board (United States), we considered the"
"926","Fund's internal control"
"927","over financial reporting,"
"928","including controls over"
"929","safeguarding securities,"
"930","as a basis for designing"
"931","our auditing procedures"
"932","for the purpose of expressing"
"933","our opinion on the"
"934","financial statements and"
"935","to comply with the requirements"
"936","of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"937","purpose"
"938","of expressing an opinion"
"939"," on the effectiveness of"
"940","the Fund's internal control"
"941","over financial"
"942","reporting. Accordingly,"
"943","we express no such opinion."
"944","Management of the Fund is"
"945","responsible for establishing"
"946","and maintaining effective internal"
"947","control"
"948","over financial reporting."
"949","In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"950","estimates and judgments"
"951","by management"
"952","are required to assess"
"953","the expected benefits and"
"954","related costs of controls."
"955"," A company's internal"
"956","control over financial"
"957","reporting is a process designed"
"958","to provide reasonable assurance"
"959"," regarding"
"960","the reliability of financial"
"961","reporting and the preparation"
"962","of financial statements for"
"963"," external"
"964","purposes in accordance with"
"965","generally accepted accounting"
"966"," principles. A company's internal"
"967","control over financial reporting"
"968"," includes those policies and"
"969"," procedures that (1) pertain to"
"970","the"
"971","maintenance of records that,"
"972","in reasonable detail, accurately"
"973","and fairly reflect the transactions"
"974"," and"
"975","dispositions of the assets of the"
"976","company; (2) provide reasonable"
"977","assurance that transactions are"
"978","recorded as necessary to permit"
"979","preparation of financial statements"
"980","in accordance with generally"
"981","accepted accounting principles,"
"982","and that receipts and expenditures"
"983","of the company are being made"
"984","in accordance with authorizations"
"985"," of management and directors of"
"986","the company; and (3) provide"
"987","reasonable assurance regarding"
"988","prevention or timely detection of"
"989","the unauthorized acquisition,"
"990","use, or disposition of the"
"991","company's assets that could have a"
"992","material affect on the financial"
"993","statements."
"994","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"995","internal control over financial"
"996","reporting may not prevent or"
"997","detect misstatements. Also,"
"998","projections of any evaluation of"
"999","effectiveness to future periods are"
"1000","subject to the risk that controls"
"1001","may become inadequate because of"
"1002","changes in conditions, or that"
"1003","the degree of compliance with the"
"1004","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1005","A deficiency in internal control"
"1006","over financial reporting exists"
"1007","when the design or operation of a"
"1008","control does not allow management"
"1009","or employees, in the normal course"
"1010","of performing their"
"1011","assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1012","detect misstatements on a timely"
"1013","basis. A material weakness is a"
"1014","deficiency, or a combination of"
"1015","deficiencies, in internal control"
"1016","over financial reporting, such that"
"1017","there is a reasonable possibility"
"1018","that a material misstatement of"
"1019","the Fund's annual or interim"
"1020","financial statements will not be"
"1021","prevented or detected on a timely"
"1022","basis."
"1023","Our consideration of the Fund's"
"1024","internal control over financial"
"1025","reporting was for the limited"
"1026","purpose described in the first"
"1027","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"1028","disclose all deficiencies in"
"1029","internal control that might be"
"1030","material weaknesses under standards"
"1031"," established by the Public"
"1032","Company Accounting Oversight"
"1033","Board (United States). However,"
"1034","we noted no deficiencies in the"
"1035","Fund's internal control over"
"1036","financial reporting and its"
"1037","operation, including controls"
"1038","over"
"1039","safeguarding securities that"
"1040","we consider to be a material"
"1041","weakness as defined above as of"
"1042","November 30, 2009."
"1043","This report is intended solely"

"1063","LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"1064","Since October 2003,"
"1065"," Federated and related"
"1066"," entities (collectively,"
"1067"," Federated), and various"
"1068","Federated funds (Funds),"
"1069","have been"
"1070","named as defendants in"
"1071","several class action"
"1072","lawsuits now pending in"
"1073","the United States District"
"1074","Court for the District of"
"1075"," Maryland. The"
"1076","lawsuits were purportedly"
"1077","filed on behalf of people"
"1078","who purchased, owned and/or"
"1079","redeemed shares of Federated-sponsored"
"1080","mutual"
"1081","funds during specified periods"
"1082","beginning November 1, 1998."
"1083","The suits are generally similar"
"1084","in alleging that Federated engaged in"
"1085","illegal and improper trading"
"1086","practices including market timing"
"1087","and late trading in concert with"
"1088","certain institutional traders, which"
"1089","allegedly caused financial injury"
"1090"," to the mutual fund shareholders."
"1091","These lawsuits began to be filed"
"1092","shortly after Federated's first public"
"1093","announcement that it had received"
"1094","requests for information on shareholder"
"1095","trading activities in the Funds from"
"1096","the SEC, the Office of"
"1097","the New York State Attorney General"
"1098","(NYAG), and other authorities."
"1099","In that regard, on November 28, 2005,"
"1100","Federated announced"
"1101","that it had reached final settlements"
"1102","with the SEC and the NYAG with respect"
"1103","to those matters. Specifically, the SEC"
"1104","and NYAG"
"1105","settled proceedings against three"
"1106","Federated subsidiaries involving"
"1107","undisclosed market timing arrangements"
"1108","and late trading. The SEC"
"1109","made findings: that Federated"
"1110","Investment Management Company (FIMC),"
"1111"," an SEC-registered investment adviser to"
"1112","various Funds,"
"1113","and Federated Securities Corp.,"
"1114","an SEC-registered broker-dealer and"
"1115","distributor for the Funds, violated"
"1116","provisions of the Investment"
"1117","Advisers Act and Investment Company"
"1118","Act by approving, but not disclosing,"
"1119","three market timing arrangements,"
"1120","or the associated"
"1121","conflict of interest between FIMC and"
"1122","the funds involved in the arrangements,"
"1123","either to other fund shareholders or to"
"1124","the funds' board;"
"1125","and that Federated Shareholder Services"
"1126","Company, formerly an SEC-registered transfer"
"1127","agent, failed to prevent a customer and a"
"1128","Federated employee from late trading in"
"1129"," violation of provisions of the Investment"
"1130","Company Act. The NYAG found that such conduct"
"1131","violated provisions of New York State law."
"1132","Federated entered into the settlements without"
"1133","admitting or denying the regulators'"
"1134","findings. As Federated previously reported"
"1135","in 2004, it has already paid approximately"
"1136","$8.0 million to certain funds as determined"
"1137","by"
"1138","an independent consultant. As part of these"
"1139","settlements, Federated agreed to pay"
"1140","disgorgement and a civil money penalty"
"1141","in the"
"1142","aggregate amount of an additional $72"
"1143","million and, among other things, agreed"
"1144","that it would not serve as investment"
"1145","adviser to any"
"1146","registered investment company unless (i)"
"1147"," at least 75% of the fund's directors are"
"1148","independent of Federated, (ii) the chairman"
"1149"," of each"
"1150","such fund is independent of Federated, (iii)"
"1151","no action may be taken by the fund's board or"
"1152","any committee thereof unless approved by a"
"1153","majority of the independent trustees of the"
"1154","fund or committee, respectively, and (iv)"
"1155","the fund appoints a senior officer who"
"1156","reports to"
"1157","the independent trustees and is responsible"
"1158","for monitoring compliance by the fund with"
"1159","applicable laws and fiduciary duties and for"
"1160","managing the process by which management fees"
"1161","charged to a fund are approved. The settlements"
"1162","are described in Federated's"
"1163","announcement which, along with previous press"
"1164","releases and related communications on those"
"1165"," matters, is available in the About Us"
"1166","section of Federated's website at"
"1167","FederatedInvestors.com."
"1168","Federated entities have also been named as"
"1169","defendants in several additional lawsuits"
"1170","that are now pending in the United States"
"1171","District"
"1172","Court for the Western District of"
"1173","Pennsylvania, alleging, among other"
"1174","things, excessive advisory and Rule 12b-1 fees."
"1175","The Board of the Funds retained the"
"1176","law firm of Dickstein Shapiro LLP to"
"1177","represent the Funds in each of the lawsuits"
"1178","described in the"
"1179","preceding two paragraphs. Federated and the"
"1180","Funds, and their respective counsel, have"
"1181"," been defending this litigation, and none"
"1182","of the"
"1183","Funds remains a defendant in any of the"
"1184","lawsuits (though some could potentially"
"1185","receive any recoveries as nominal defendants)."
"1186","Additional lawsuits based upon similar"
"1187","allegations may be filed in the future."
"1188","The potential impact of these lawsuits,"
"1189","all of which seek"
"1190","unquantified damages, attorneys' fees,"
"1191","and expenses, and future potential similar"
"1192","suits is uncertain. Although we do not believe"
"1193","that"
"1194","these lawsuits will have a material"
"1195","adverse effect on the Funds, there can be no"
"1196"," assurance that these suits, ongoing"
"1197","adverse publicity"
"1198","and/or other developments resulting from the"
"1199","regulatory investigations will not result in"
"1200","increased Fund redemptions, reduced sales of"
"1201","Fund shares, or other adverse consequences"
"1202","for the Funds."
