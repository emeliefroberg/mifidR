"2244","Company, et al., v. Fitzsimons et al."
"2245","(the Lawsuit).  The Lawsuit arises"

"2255","Company filed for bankruptcy.  The"
"2256","Lawsuit seeks to recover all"

"2395","accordance with the standards of the"

"2401","designing our auditing procedures for the"

"2408","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion"
"2409","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"2410","control over financial reporting."
"2411","The management of the Fund is"

"2413","maintaining effective internal control over"
"2414","financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"2415","responsibility, estimates and judgments"
"2416","by management are required to assess the"
"2417","expected benefits and related costs of"
"2418","controls.  A fund's internal control over"

"2421","the reliability of financial reporting and"
"2422","the preparation of financial statements for"
"2423","external purposes in accordance with"
"2424","generally accepted accounting principles."
"2425","A fund's internal control over financial"

"2442","prevention or timely detection of"
"2443","unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"2444","disposition of a fund's assets that could"

"2457","A deficiency in internal control over"

"2466","control over financial reporting, such that"
"2467","there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"2468","material misstatement of the Fund's"

"2470","will not be prevented or detected on a"

"2472","Our consideration of the Fund's internal"
