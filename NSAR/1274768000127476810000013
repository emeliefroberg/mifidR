"825","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"826","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIG Series"
"827","Trust"
"828","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"829","statements of"
"830","each of the two funds constituting AIG Series Trust"
"831","(hereafter referred"
"832","to as the  Funds ) as of and for the year ended October"
"833","31, 2008, in"
"834","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"835","Accounting"
"836","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"837","Funds  internal"
"838","control over financial reporting, including controls"
"839","over safeguarding"
"840","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"841","procedures for the"
"842","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"843","statements and to"
"844","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"845","the purpose"
"846","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"847","Funds  internal"
"848","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"849","not express an"
"850","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds  internal"
"851","control over"
"852","financial reporting."
"853","The management of the Series is responsible for"
"854","establishing and"
"855","maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"856","reporting.  In"
"857","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments"
"858","by management"
"859","are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"860","costs of"
"861","controls.  A fund s internal control over financial"
"862","reporting is a process"
"863","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"864","reliability of"
"865","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"866","statements for"
"867","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"868","accounting"
"869","principles.  A fund s internal control over financial"
"870","reporting includes"
"871","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"872","maintenance of"
"873","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"874","fairly reflect the"
"875","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"876","Funds; (2) provide"
"877","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"878","necessary to"
"879","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"880","with generally"
"881","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"882","expenditures of"
"883","the Funds are being made only in accordance with"
"884","authorizations of"
"885","management and Trustees of the Funds; and (3)  provide"
"886","reasonable"
"887","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"888","unauthorized"
"889","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund s assets that"
"890","could have a"
"891","material effect on the financial statements."
"892","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"893","over financial"
"894","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"895","Also, projections"
"896","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"897","subject to the"
"898","risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"899","changes in"
"900","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"901","policies or"
"902","procedures may deteriorate."
"903","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"904","reporting exists when the"
"905","design or operation of a control does not allow"
"906","management or"
"907","employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"908","assigned"
"909","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"910","timely basis.  A"
"911","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"912","deficiencies, in"
"913","internal control over financial reporting, such that"
"914","there is a reasonable"
"915","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds"
"916","annual or interim"
"917","financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"918","on a timely"
"919","basis."
"920","Our consideration of the Funds  internal control over"
"921","financial reporting"
"922","was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"923","paragraph and would"
"924","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"925","control over financial"
"926","reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"927","standards"
"928","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"929","Board"
"930","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"931","the Funds"
"932","internal control over financial reporting and its"
"933","operation, including"
"934","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider"
"935","to be material"
"936","weaknesses as defined above as of October 31, 2008."
"937","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"938","use of"

"955","AIG Series Trust  NSAR Responses"
"956","SUB ITEM 77I: Terms of new or amended securities"
"957","On June 3, 2008, the Board of Trustees (the  Board ) of"
"958","AIG Series Trust (the  Trust ), approved amendments to"
"959","the Trust s Declaration of Trust to (i) establish and"
"960","designate additional series of shares of beneficial"
"961","interest of a new series of the Trust, the Alternative"
"962","Strategies Fund (the  Fund ) and (ii) establish and"
"963","designate additional classes of shares of beneficial"
"964","interest of the Fund to be known as Class A, Class C and"
"965","Class W Shares."
"966"," In the future, the Trustees may authorize the creation"
"967","of additional series of shares which may have fee"
"968","structures different from existing classes and/or may be"
"969","offered only to certain qualified investors so as to be"
"970","able to offer to investors additional investment funds"
"971","within the Trust that would operate independently from"
"972","the Trust s present portfolios, or to distinguish among"
"973","shareholders, as may be necessary, to comply with future"
"974","regulations or other unforeseen circumstances.  Each"
"975","class of shares of the Trust represents the interests of"
"976","the shareholders of that series in a particular"
"977","portfolio of Trust assets."
"978","Shareholders are entitled to a full vote for each full"
"979","share held.  The Trustees have terms of unlimited"
"980","duration (subject to certain removal procedures) and"
"981","have the power to alter the number of Trustees, and"
"982","appoint their own successors, provided that at all times"
"983","at least a majority of the Trustees have been elected by"
"984","shareholders.  In the event that less than the majority"
"985","of the Trustees holding office have been elected by the"
"986","shareholders, the Trustees then in office shall call a"
"987","shareholders  meeting for the election of"
"988","Trustees.  There shall be no cumulative voting in the"
"989","election of Trustees, so that holders of more than 50%"
"990","of the shares voting can, if they choose, elect all"
"991","Trustees being elected, while the holders of the"
"992","remaining shares would be unable to elect any"
"993","Trustees.  Although the Trust need not hold annual"
"994","meetings of shareholders, the Trustees may call special"
"995","meetings of shareholders for action by shareholder vote"
"996","as may be required by the Investment Company Act of"
"997","1940, as amended, the Declaration of Trust or upon any"
"998","other matter as to which such vote or authority is"
"999","deemed by the Trustees to be necessary or"
"1000","desirable.  Also, a shareholders  meeting must be"
"1001","called, if so requested in writing by the holders of"
"1002","record of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of the"
"1003","Trust.  In addition, the Trustees may be removed by the"
"1004","action of the holders of record of two-thirds or more of"
"1005","the outstanding shares.  All series of shares will vote"
"1006","with respect to certain matters, such as election of"
"1007","Trustees.  When all series of shares are not affected by"
"1008","a matter to be voted upon, such as approval of"
"1009","investment advisory agreements or changes in the Fund s"
"1010","policies, only shareholders of the series affected by"
"1011","the matter may be entitled to vote."
"1012","All classes of shares of the Fund are identical in all"
"1013","respects, except that:  (i) each class may bear"
"1014","differing amounts of certain class-specific expenses,"
"1015","(ii) Class A shares are subject to an initial sales"
"1016","charge, an ongoing account maintenance and service fee,"
"1017","(iii) Class C shares are subject to a CDSC, a"
"1018","distribution fee and an ongoing account maintenance and"
"1019","service fee, (iv) Class W shares have a $50,000 minimum"
"1020","investment requirement, (v) each class has voting rights"
"1021","on matters that pertain to the Rule l2b-1 plan adopted"
"1022","with respect to such class, and (vi) each class of"
"1023","shares will be exchangeable only into the same class of"
"1024","shares of any of the other SunAmerica mutual funds, not"
"1025","including SunAmerica Senior Floating Rate Fund, Inc."
"1026","(where exchanges are only permitted for Class A"
"1027","shares).  All shares of the Fund issued and outstanding"
"1028","and all shares offered by the Prospectus when issued are"
"1029","fully paid and non-assessable.  Shares have no"
"1030","preemptive or other subscription rights and are freely"
"1031","transferable on the books of the Trust.  In addition,"
"1032","shares have no conversion rights, except as described"
"1033","above."
"1034","The Declaration of Trust provides that no Trustee,"
"1035","officer, employee or agent of the Trust is liable to the"
"1036","Trust or to a shareholder, nor is any Trustee, officer,"
"1037","employee or agent liable to any third persons in"
"1038","connection with the affairs of the Trust, except as such"
"1039","liability may arise from his or its own willful"
"1040","misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless"
"1041","disregard of his duties. It also provides that all third"
"1042","persons shall look solely to the Trust s property for"
"1043","satisfaction of claims arising in connection with the"
"1044","affairs of the Trust.  With the exceptions stated, the"
"1045","Declaration of Trust provides that a Trustee, officer,"
"1046","employee or agent is entitled to be indemnified against"
"1047","all liability in connection with the affairs of the"
"1048","Trust.  The Trust shall continue, without limitation of"
"1049","time, subject to the provisions in the Declaration of"
"1050","Trust concerning termination by action of the"
"1051","shareholders."
