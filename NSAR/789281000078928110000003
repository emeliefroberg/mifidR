"793","ITEM 77E - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"794","Since October 2003, Federated and related"
"795","entities (collectively, Federated) and various"
"796","Federated-sponsored mutual funds (Funds) have"
"797","been named as defendants in several class"
"798","action lawsuits now pending in the United States"
"799","District Court for the District of Maryland. The"
"800","lawsuits were purportedly filed on behalf of people"
"801","who purchased, owned and/or redeemed"
"802","shares of certain Funds during specified periods"
"803","beginning November 1, 1998. The suits are"
"804","generally similar in alleging that Federated engaged"
"805","in illegal and improper trading practices"
"806","including market timing and late trading in concert"
"807","with certain institutional traders, which"
"808","allegedly caused financial injury to the mutual fund"
"809","shareholders. Federated without admitting the"
"810","validity of any claim has reached a preliminary"
"811","settlement with the Plaintiffs in these cases. Any"
"812","settlement would have to be approved by the Court."
"813","     Federated entities have also been named as defendants"
"814","in several additional lawsuits that"
"815","are now pending in the United States District Court for"
"816","the Western District of Pennsylvania."
"817","These lawsuits have been consolidated into a single"
"818","action alleging excessive advisory fees"
"819","involving one of the Funds."
"820","     The Board of the Funds retained the law firm of"
"821","Dickstein Shapiro LLP to represent the"
"822","Funds in each of the lawsuits described in the"
"823","preceding two paragraphs. Federated and the"
"824","Funds, and their respective counsel, have been"
"825","defending this litigation, and none of the Funds"
"826","remains a defendant in any of the lawsuits. Additional"
"827","lawsuits based upon similar allegations"
"828","may be filed in the future. The potential impact of"
"829","these lawsuits, all of which seek monetary"
"830","damages, attorneys' fees and expenses, and future"
"831","potential similar suits is uncertain. Although"
"832","we do not believe that these lawsuits will have a"
"833","material adverse effect on the Funds, there can"
"834","be no assurance that these suits, ongoing adverse"
"835","publicity and/or other developments resulting"
"836","from the allegations in these matters will not result"
"837","in increased redemptions, or reduced sales of"
"838","shares of the Funds or other adverse"
"839","consequences for the Funds."

"847","Report of Independent Registered"
"848","Public Accounting Firm"
"849","To the Shareholders and"
"850","Board of Trustees of"
"851","Federated Income Securities Trust:"
"852","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"853","financial statements of Federated Fund for"
"854","U.S. Government Securities and Federated Real"
"855","Return Bond Fund (collectively the"
"856","Funds), two of the portfolios comprising"
"857","Federated Income Securities Trust, (the"
"858","Trust) as of and for the year ended"
"859","March 31, 2010, in accordance with the standards of"
"860","the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"861","Board (United States), we considered the"
"862","Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"863","including controls over safeguarding"
"864","securities, as a basis for designing our"
"865","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"866","our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"867","comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"868","SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"869","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"870","internal control over financial reporting."
"871","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"872","The management of the Funds is responsible"
"873","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"874","internal control over financial reporting. In"
"875","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"876","judgments by management are required to assess"
"877","the expected benefits and related costs"
"878","of controls. A company's internal control over"
"879","financial reporting is a process designed to"
"880","provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"881","reliability of financial reporting and the"
"882","preparation of financial statements for external"
"883","purposes in accordance with generally"
"884","accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"885","internal control over financial reporting"
"886","includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"887","pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"888","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"889","the transactions and dispositions of the"
"890","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"891","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"892","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"893","statements in accordance with generally"
"894","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"895","and expenditures of the company are"
"896","being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"897","of management and directors of the"
"898","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"899","regarding prevention or timely detection"
"900","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"901","of a company's assets that could have a"
"902","material effect on the financial statements."
"903","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"904","control over financial reporting may not"
"905","prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"906","of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"907","future periods are subject to the risk that"
"908","controls may become inadequate because of"
"909","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"910","compliance with the policies or procedures"
"911","may deteriorate."
"912","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"913","reporting exists when the design or"
"914","operation of a control does not allow management"
"915","or employees, in the normal course of"
"916","performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"917","or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"918","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"919","combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"920","over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"921","reasonable possibility that a material"
"922","misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"923","financial statements will not be"
"924","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"925","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control"
"926","over financial reporting was for the"
"927","limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"928","and would not necessarily disclose all"
"929","deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"930","material weaknesses under standards"
"931","established by the Public Company Accounting"
"932","Oversight Board (United States)."
"933","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"934","internal control over financial reporting"
"935","and its operation, including controls over"
"936","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"937","material weakness as defined above"
"938","as of March 31, 2010."
"939","This report is intended solely for the"
"940","information and use of"
"941","management and the Board"
"942","of Trustees of the Funds and the"
"943","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"944","intended to be, and should not be,"
"945","used by anyone other than these specified parties."
