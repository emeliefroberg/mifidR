"1385","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1386","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1387","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"

"1389","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"

"1391","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"1392","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1393","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"1394","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"1395","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required"

"1397","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"1398","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1399","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1400","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's"
"1401","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1402","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1403","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1404","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"1405","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1406","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1407","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made"
"1408","only in accordance with authorizations of management of the fund and"
"1409","trustees of the trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1410","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"1411","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1412","financial statements."
"1413","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"

"1416","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"1417","that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1418","deteriorate."
"1419","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1420","design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1421","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"1422","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"1423","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1424","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"1425","that a material misstatement of a fund's annual or interim financial"
"1426","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1427","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
