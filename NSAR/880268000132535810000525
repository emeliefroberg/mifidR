"537","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"538","To the Trustees of the American Century International Bond Funds and"
"539","Shareholders of the American Century International Bond Fund:"
"540","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of the"
"541","American Century International Bond Funds (&#147;the Fund&#148;) as of and for the"
"542","year ended June 30, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"543","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"544","Fund&#146;s internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"545","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"546","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"547","to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"548","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund&#146;s internal control"
"549","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"550","the effectiveness of the Fund&#146;s internal control over financial reporting."
"551","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"552","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"553","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"554","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund&#146;s internal"
"555","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"556","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"557","and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"558","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund&#146;s"
"559","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"560","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"561","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"562","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"563","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"564","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"565","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"566","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"567","of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"568","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of"
"569","a fund&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"570","statements."
"571","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"572","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"573","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"574","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"575","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"576","deteriorate."
"577","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"578","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"579","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"580","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"581","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"582","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"583","possibility that a material misstatement of the fund&#146;s annual or"
"584","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on"
"585","a timely basis."
"586","Our consideration of the Fund&#146;s internal control over financial"
"587","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"588","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"589","in internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"590","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"591","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"592","no deficiencies in the Fund&#146;s internal control over financial"
"593","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"594","securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"595","above as of June 30, 2010."
"596","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"597","management and Trustees of the American Century International"
"598","Bond Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"599","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"600","these specified parties."

"1526","Complex Assets to the Complex Fee Schedule for the class as shown in"
"1527","Schedule C."
"1528","(10)	The &#147;Per Annum Complex Fee Rate&#148; for a class of a Fund is the"
"1529","percentage rate that results from dividing the Per Annum Complex Fee"

"1536","class of each Fund shall accrue a fee calculated by multiplying the Per"

"1539","(366 in leap years)."
"1540","(d)	Monthly Management Fee Payment. On the first business day of"
"1541","each month, each class of each series Fund shall pay the management fee"
"1542","to the Investment Manager for the previous month. The fee for the previous"

"1774","Section 2.  Call of Meeting"
"1775","A meeting of the shareholders shall be held whenever called by the Trustees"

"1779","meeting is a meeting of the shareholders of one or more series or classes"

"1807","Trust&#146;s principal executive office, or if published at least once"
"1808","in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where that"
"1809","office is located.  Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the"
"1810","time when delivered personally or deposited in the mail or sent"
"1811","by telegram or other means of written communication."
"1812","If any notice addressed to a shareholder at the address of that"
"1813","shareholder appearing on the books of the Trust is returned to the"
"1814","Trust by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that"
"1815","the Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice to the shareholder"
"1816","at the address, all future notices or reports shall be deemed to have"
"1817","been duly given without further mailing if these shall be available"
"1818","to the shareholder on written demand of the shareholder at the principal"
"1819","executive office of the Trust for a period of one year from the date of"
"1820","the giving of the notice."
"1821","An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any"
"1822","shareholder&#146;s meeting shall be executed by the Secretary, an Assistant"
"1823","Secretary or any transfer agent of the Trust giving the notice and"
"1824","shall be filed and maintained in the minute book of the Trust."
"1825","Section 5.  Adjourned Meeting; Notice"
"1826","Any shareholder&#146;s meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may be"
"1827","adjourned from time to time by the vote of the majority of the shares"
"1828","represented at that meeting, either in person or by proxy."
"1829","When any meeting of shareholders is adjourned to another time or place,"
"1830","notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting at which the"
"1831","adjournment is taken, unless a new record date of the adjourned"
"1832","meeting is fixed or unless the adjournment is for more than ninety (90)"
"1833","days from the date set for the original meeting, in which case the Board"
"1834","of Trustees shall set a new record date.  Where required, notice of"
"1835","any such adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record"
"1836","entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance with the"

"1838","meeting, the Trust may transact any business which might have been"
"1839","transacted at the original meeting."
"1840","Section 6.  Voting"
"1841","The shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders shall be"
"1842","determined in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Trust,"
"1843","as in effect at such time.  The shareholders' vote may be by voice"
"1844","vote or by ballot, provided, however, that any election for"
"1845","trustees must be by ballot if demanded by any shareholder before the"
"1846","voting has begun.  On any matter other than elections of trustees,"
"1847","any shareholder may vote part of the shares in favor of the proposal"
"1848","and refrain from voting the remaining shares or vote them against"
"1849","the proposal, but if the shareholder fails to specify the number of"
"1850","shares which the shareholder is voting affirmatively, it will be"
"1851","conclusively presumed that the shareholder&#146;s approving vote is"
"1852","with respect to the total shares that the shareholder is entitled"
"1853","to vote on such proposal."
"1854","Section 7.  Waiver of Notice by Consent of Absent Shareholders"
"1855","The transactions of the meeting of shareholders, however called and"
"1856","noticed and wherever held, shall be as valid as though had at a meeting"
"1857","duly held after regular call and notice if a quorum be present either"
"1858","in person or by proxy and if either before or after the meeting,"
"1859","each person entitled to vote who was not present in person or by proxy"
"1860","signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to a holding of the"
"1861","meeting or an approval of the minutes.  The waiver of notice or"
"1862","consent need not specify either the business to be transacted or"
"1863","the purpose of any meeting of shareholders."
"1864","Attendance by a person at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver"
"1865","of notice of that meeting, except when the person objects at the"
"1866","beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because"
"1867","the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that attendance"
"1868","at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration"
"1869","of matters not included in the notice of the meeting if that objection"
"1870","is expressly made at the beginning of the meeting."
"1871","Section 8.  Shareholder Action by Written Consent without a Meeting"
"1872","Any action which may be taken at any meeting of shareholders may be"
"1873","taken without a meeting and without prior notice if a consent in"
"1874","writing setting forth the action so taken is signed by the holders of"
"1875","outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes"
"1876","that would be necessary to authorize or take that action at a meeting"
"1877","at which all shares entitled to vote on that action were present and"
"1878","voted.  All such consents shall be filed with the Secretary of the"
"1879","Trust and shall be maintained in the Trust&#146;s records.  Any shareholder"
"1880","giving a written consent or the shareholder&#146;s proxy holders or"
"1881","a transferee of the shares or a personal representative of the"
"1882","shareholder or their respective proxy holders may revoke the"
"1883","consent by a writing received by the Secretary of the Trust"
"1884","before written consents of the number of shares required to authorize"
"1885","the proposed action have been filed with the Secretary."
"1886","If the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote have not been"
"1887","solicited in writing and if the unanimous written consent of all"
"1888","such shareholders shall not have been received, the Secretary shall"
"1889","give prompt notice of the action approved by the shareholders without"
"1890","a meeting.  This notice shall be given in the manner specified in"
"1891","Section 4 of this Article II.  In the case of approval of (i)"
"1892","contracts or transactions in which a trustee has a direct or indirect"
"1893","financial interest, (ii) indemnification of agents of the Trust, and"
"1894","(iii) a reorganization of the Trust, the notice shall be given at"
"1895","least ten (10) days before the consummation of any action authorized"
"1896","by that approval."
"1897","Section 9.  Record Date for Shareholder Notice, Voting and Giving Consents"
"1898","For purposes of determining the shareholders entitled to notice of any"
"1899","meeting or to vote or entitled to give consent to action without"
"1900","a meeting, the Board of Trustees may fix in advance a record date"
"1901","which shall not be more than ninety (90) days nor less than ten (10) days"
"1902","before the date of any such meeting as provided in the Declaration"
"1903","of Trust."
"1904","If the Board of Trustees does not so fix a record date:"
"1905","(a)	The record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice"
"1906","of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of"
"1907","business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice"
"1908","is given or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the"
"1909","business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held."
"1910","(b)	The record date for determining shareholders entitled to"
"1911","give consent to action in writing without a meeting, (i) when no prior"
"1912","action by the Board of Trustees has been taken, shall be the day on"
"1913","which the first written consent is given, or (ii) when prior action"
"1914","of the Board of Trustees has been taken, shall be at the close of"
"1915","business on the day on which the Board of Trustees adopt the"
"1916","resolution relating to that action or the seventy-fifth day before"
"1917","the date of such other action, whichever is later."
"1918","Section 10.  Proxies"
