"4764","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"4765","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Loomis Sayles"
"4766","Funds I:"
"4767","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"4768","statements of Loomis Sayles Bond Fund, Loomis Sayles Fixed"
"4769","Income Fund, Loomis Sayles Global Bond Fund, Loomis Sayles"
"4770","High Income Opportunities Fund, Loomis Sayles Inflation"

"4772","Income Fund, Loomis Sayles Intermediate Duration Bond Fund,"
"4773","Loomis Sayles Investment Grade Fixed Income Fund, Loomis"
"4774","Sayles Securitized Asset Fund, and Loomis Sayles Small Cap"
"4775","Value Fund, each a series of Loomis Sayles Funds I (the"
"4776","?Funds?) as of and for the year ended September 30, 2015,"
"4777","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"4778","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"4779","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"4780","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"4781","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"4782","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"4783","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"4784","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"4785","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"4786","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"4787","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"4788","reporting."
"4789","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"4790","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"4791","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"4792","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"4793","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's"
"4794","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"4795","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"4796","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"4797","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"4798","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's"
"4799","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"4800","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"4801","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"4802","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"4803","assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"4804","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"4805","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"4806","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"4807","and expenditures of the fund is being made only in"
"4808","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"4809","of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance"
"4810","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"4811","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that"
"4812","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"4813","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"4814","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"4815","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"4816","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"4817","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"4818","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"4819","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"4820","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"4821","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"4822","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"4823","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"4824","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"4825","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"4826","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"4827","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"4828","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"4829","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"4830","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"4831","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"4832","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"4833","all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"4834","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"4835","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"4836","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies"
"4837","in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and"
"4838","its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"4839","securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as"
"4840","defined above as of September 30, 2015."
"4841","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"4842","of management and the Board of Trustees of Loomis Sayles"
"4843","Funds I and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
