"548","             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"549","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"550","MFS Series Trust XIII"
"551","In  planning  and performing our audit of the financial statements of MFS Global"
"552","Real Estate Fund (the Fund) (one of the portfolios comprising MFS Series Trust"
"553","XIII) as of and  for  the  period  ended August 31, 2015, in accordance with the"
"554","standards of the Public Company Accounting  Oversight  Board (United States), we"
"555","considered  the  Fund's  internal  control  over financial reporting,  including"
"556","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis  for  designing  our  auditing"
"557","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"558","and  to  comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose  of"
"559","expressing  an  opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"560","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"561","The management of  the  Fund  is  responsible  for  establishing and maintaining"
"562","effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.   In  fulfilling  this"
"563","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"564","expected  benefits and related costs of controls. A company's  internal  control"
"565","over financial  reporting  is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"566","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"567","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"568","accounting principles. A company's  internal  control  over  financial reporting"
"569","includes  those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the  maintenance  of"
"570","records  that,   in   reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the"
"571","transactions  and dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide"
"572","reasonable assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary to permit"
"573","preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with generally  accepted"
"574","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures  of  the  company  are"
"575","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"576","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"577","detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"578","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"579","Because of its  inherent  limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"580","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"581","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"582","inadequate because of changes in conditions,  or  that  the degree of compliance"
"583","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"584","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"585","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,  in the normal"
"586","course   of   performing   their   assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"587","misstatements on a timely basis. A material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or  a"
"588","combination  of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"589","that there is  a  reasonable  possibility  that  a  material misstatement of the"
"590","company's  annual  or  interim financial statements will  not  be  prevented  or"
"591","detected on a timely basis."
"592","Our consideration of the  Fund's  internal  control over financial reporting was"
"593","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in  the first  paragraph  and  would  not"
"594","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that"
"595","might be material weaknesses under standards  established  by the Public Company"
"596","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"597","the  Fund's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  its  operation,"
"598","including  controls  over  safeguarding  securities  that  we consider to  be  a"
"599","material weakness as defined above as of August 31, 2015."
"600","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"601","Board  of  Trustees  of  MFS Series Trust XIII and the Securities  and  Exchange"
"602","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"603","these specified parties."
