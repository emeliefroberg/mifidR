"2967","<TEXT>"
"2968","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2969","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of GE Institutional Funds:"
"2970","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"2971","GE Institutional Funds (the Trust), comprising U.S. Equity Fund, S&P"
"2972","500 Index Fund, U.S. Large-Cap Core Equity Fund, Premier Growth Equity"
"2973","Fund, Small-Cap Equity Fund, International Equity Fund, Strategic"
"2974","Investment Fund, and U.S. Equity Fund, as of and for the year ended"
"2975","September 30, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"2976","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"2977","Trusts internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"2978","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"2979","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"2980","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"2981","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"2982","Trusts internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express"
"2983","no such opinion."
"2984","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"2985","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"2986","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"2987","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"2988","A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed"
"2989","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"2990","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"2991","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys"
"2992","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"2993","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"2994","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"2995","the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"2996","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2997","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"2998","and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"2999","authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"3000","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"3001","acquisition, use or disposition of a companys assets that could have a material"
"3002","effect on the financial statements."
"3003","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"3004","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"3005","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"3006","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"3007","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A deficiency"
"3008","in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation"
"3009","of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"3010","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"3011","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"3012","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there"
"3013","is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys"
"3014","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"3015","on a timely basis. Our consideration of the Trusts internal control over"
"3016","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"3017","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"3018","control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"3019","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However,"
"3020","we noted no deficiencies in the Trusts internal control over financial"
"3021","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"3022","that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"3023","September 30, 2016."
"3024","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"3025","and the Board of Trustees of GE Institutional Funds and the Securities and"
"3026","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"3027","anyone other than these specified parties."

"3204","its best good faith judgment to vote or not vote such proxies in a manner which"
"3205","best serves the interests of the Trust's shareholders. The Trust has received"
"3206","and reviewed the proxy guidelines of SSGA FM, which indicate how SSGA FM will"

"3208","Section 3. Execution of Transactions."
"3209","       Unless otherwise set forth in the Registration Statement or directed by"
"3210","the Trust, SSGA FM will, in selecting brokers or dealers to effect transactions"
"3211","on behalf of the Funds, seek the best overall terms available. In so doing,"
"3212","SSGA FM may consider the breadth of the market for the investment, the price of"
"3213","the security, the size and difficulty of the order, the willingness of the"
"3214","broker or dealer to position, the reliability, financial condition and"
"3215","execution and operational capabilities of the broker or dealer, and the"
"3216","reasonableness of the commission or size of the dealer's spread, if any, for"
"3217","the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. SSGA FM may also consider"
"3218","brokerage and research services provided to the Funds and/or other accounts"
"3219","over which SSGA FM or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The Trust"
"3220","recognizes the desirability of SSGA FM's having access to supplemental"
"3221","investment and market research and security and economic analyses provided by"
"3222","brokers and that those brokers may execute brokerage transactions at a higher"
"3223","cost to a Fund than would be the case if the transactions were executed on the"
"3224","basis of the most favorable price and efficient execution. To the extent"
"3225","permitted"

"3228","by applicable law and regulations, SSGA FM shall not be deemed to have acted"
"3229","unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this Agreement or otherwise"
"3230","solely by reason of its having caused a Fund to pay a broker or dealer that"
"3231","provides brokerage and research services to SSGA FM an amount of commission for"
"3232","effecting a portfolio investment transaction in excess of the amount of"
"3233","commission that another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that"
"3234","transaction, if SSGA FM determines in good faith that such amount of commission"
"3235","was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services"
"3236","provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular"
"3237","transaction or SSGA FM's overall responsibilities with respect to the Fund and"
"3238","to other clients of SSGA FM as to which SSGA FM exercises investment"
"3239","discretion. The Trust hereby agrees that any entity or person associated with"
"3240","SSGA FM which is a member of a national securities exchange is authorized to"
"3241","effect any transaction on such exchange for the account of any Fund which is"
"3242","permitted by Section 11(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended."
"3243","       In any case in which there are two or more sub-advisers responsible for"
"3244","providing investment advice to a Fund, SSGA FM may enter into a transaction on"
"3245","behalf of the Fund with a sub-adviser of the Fund (or an affiliated person of"
"3246","such sub-adviser) in reliance on Rule 10f-3, Rule 17a-10, or Rule 12d3-1 under"
"3247","the 1940 Act, only if (i) SSGA FM is responsible for providing investment"
"3248","advice with respect to a portion of the portfolio of the Fund, the assets of"
"3249","which portion are involved in the contemplated transaction, and (ii) the"
"3250","sub-adviser is responsible for providing investment advice with respect to a"
"3251","separate portion of the portfolio of the Fund."

"3253","       SSGA FM will bear the cost of rendering the services it is obligated to"
"3254","provide under this Agreement and will provide the Trust with all executive,"

"3498","Fund for the period and on the terms set forth in this Agreement. The"
"3499","Sub-Adviser accepts that appointment and agrees to render the services herein"

"3502","the Fund is limited to those Fund assets allocated to the Sub-Adviser by SSGA"
"3503","FM, which may be changed from time to time at the sole discretion of SSGA FM"

"3506","<PAGE>"
"3507","independent contractor and shall, except as expressly provided or authorized,"
"3508","have no authority to act for or represent the Trust, the Fund or SSGA FM in any"
"3509","way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Trust, the Fund or SSGA FM."
"3510","   2. Duties as Sub-Adviser."
"3511","   (a) Subject to the oversight and supervision of SSGA FM and the Board of"
"3512","Trustees of the Trust (the Board), the Sub-Adviser will provide a continuous"
"3513","investment program for the Fund with respect to the Sub-Adviser's Allocated"
"3514","Assets, including investment research and management. The Sub-Adviser will"
"3515","determine from time to time what investments will be purchased, retained or"
"3516","sold by the Fund with respect to such Allocated Assets. The Sub-Adviser will be"
"3517","responsible for placing purchase and sell orders for the Allocated Assets. The"
"3518","Sub-Adviser will consult with SSGA FM from time to time regarding matters"
"3519","pertaining to the Fund, including market strategy and portfolio"
"3520","characteristics. The Sub-Adviser will provide services under this Agreement in"
"3521","accordance with the Fund's investment objective, policies and restrictions as"
"3522","stated in the Registration Statement (as defined below), the Constituent"
"3523","Documents (as defined below), the Investment Guidelines (as defined below), and"
"3524","applicable law. In this connection and in connection with the further duties"
"3525","set forth in this Section 2 as provided below, the Sub-Adviser shall provide"
"3526","SSGA FM and the Board with such periodic reports and documentation as SSGA FM"
"3527","or the Board shall reasonably request regarding the Sub-Adviser's management of"
"3528","the Fund's Allocated Assets, compliance with applicable laws and rules and the"
"3529","Registration Statement and all requirements hereunder. The Sub-Adviser"
"3530","acknowledges that copies of the Trust's current registration statement on"
"3531","Form N-1A and any amendments or supplements thereto (Registration Statement),"
"3532","and the Trust's Agreement and Declaration of Trust and By-Laws, if any"
"3533","(Constituent Documents), each as currently in effect, have been delivered to"
"3534","the Sub-Adviser."
"3535","   (b) The Sub-Adviser shall carry out its responsibilities under this"
"3536","Agreement in compliance with: (i) the Fund's investment objective, policies and"
"3537","restrictions as set forth in the Registration Statement, (ii) the Constituent"
"3538","Documents, (iii) all investment guidelines, policies, procedures or directives"
"3539","of the Trust or SSGA FM as provided to the Sub-Adviser (Investment
Guidelines), (iv) the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, (v) the"
"3540","Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (Advisers Act), and the rules"
"3541","promulgated thereunder, and (vi) other applicable federal and state laws and"
"3542","related regulations. To the extent that the Investment Guidelines applicable to"
"3543","the Sub-Adviser's Allocated Assets are inconsistent with the investment"
"3544","restrictions applicable to the Fund's total assets as set forth in the"
"3545","Registration Statement, the Sub-Adviser shall comply with the policies,"
"3546","procedures and directives as set forth in the Investment Guidelines. SSGA FM"
"3547","shall promptly notify the Sub-Adviser of changes to (i), (ii) or (iii) above"
"3548","and shall consult with Sub-Adviser before making any changes relating solely to"
"3549","the Fund's investment objective, policies and restrictions as set forth in the"
"3550","Registration Statement, as well as to the policies, procedures and directives"
"3551","set forth in the Investment Guidelines. In particular, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"3552","take all actions necessary with respect to the Allocated Assets, as if they"
"3553","were the Fund's only assets, to ensure that the Fund: (A) satisfies the asset"
"3554","diversification and gross income qualification requirements as set forth under"
"3555","sub-chapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code),"
"3556","and (B) complies with the diversification requirements of Section 817(h) of the"
"3557","Code and regulations thereunder [as these"
"3558","                                      2"
"3559","<PAGE>"
"3560","apply to separate accounts through which variable life insurance contracts and"
"3561","variable annuity contracts are issued]."
"3562","   (c) The Sub-Adviser shall take all actions which it considers necessary to"
"3563","implement the investment objectives and policies of the Fund, and in"
"3564","particular, to place all orders for the purchase or sale of securities or other"
"3565","investments for the Fund's Allocated Assets with brokers or dealers selected by"
"3566","it. For that limited purpose, the Sub-Adviser is authorized as the agent of the"
"3567","Trust to give instructions to the Trust's custodian(s) as to deliveries of"
"3568","securities or other investments and payments of cash for the account of the"
"3569","Fund. In connection with the selection of brokers or dealers and the placing of"
"3570","purchase and sale orders with respect to investments of the Fund, the"
"3571","Sub-Adviser is directed at all times to seek to obtain best execution and price"
"3572","within the policy guidelines determined by the Board and set forth in the"
"3573","Registration Statement."
"3574","   In addition to seeking the best price and execution, to the extent covered"
"3575","by Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934
Act), and applicable guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the"
"3576","SEC) or the staff thereof, the Sub-Adviser is also authorized to take into"
"3577","consideration other relevant factors which may include, without limitation:"
"3578","(i) the execution capabilities of such brokers and dealers, (ii) research,"
"3579","brokerage and other services provided by brokers and dealers which the"
"3580","Sub-Adviser believes will enhance its general portfolio management"
"3581","capabilities, (iii) the size of the transaction, (iv) the difficulty of"
"3582","execution, (v) the operational facilities of such brokers and dealers, (vi) the"
"3583","risk to such a broker or dealer of positioning a block of securities, and"
"3584","(vii) the overall quality of brokerage and research services provided by such"
"3585","brokers and dealers. The Sub-Adviser is also authorized to effect individual"
"3586","securities transactions at commission rates in excess of the minimum commission"
"3587","rates available, if it determines in good faith that such amount of commission"
"3588","is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services"
"3589","provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular"
"3590","transaction or the Sub-Adviser's overall responsibilities with respect to the"
"3591","Fund. The policies with respect to brokerage allocation, determined from time"
"3592","to time by the Board, are those disclosed in the Registration Statement. The"
"3593","Sub-Adviser will periodically evaluate the statistical data, research and other"
"3594","investment services provided to it by brokers and dealers. Such services may be"
"3595","used by the Sub-Adviser in connection with the performance of its obligations"
"3596","under this Agreement or in connection with other advisory or investment"
"3597","operations including using such information in managing its own accounts."
"3598","Whenever the Sub-Adviser simultaneously places orders to purchase or sell the"
"3599","same security on behalf of the Fund and one or more other accounts advised by"
"3600","the Sub-Adviser, the orders will be allocated as to price and amount among all"
"3601","such accounts in a manner believed to be equitable by the Sub-Adviser to each"
"3602","account and otherwise in accordance with the Sub-Adviser's procedures approved"
"3603","by the Board."
"3604","   (d) Only with prior written consent from SSGA FM and subject to: (i) the"
"3605","requirement that the Sub-Adviser seek to obtain best execution and price within"
"3606","the policy guidelines determined by the Board and set forth in the Registration"
"3607","Statement, (ii) the provisions of the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act, (iii) the"
"3608","provisions of the 1934 Act, and (iv) other applicable provisions of law, the"
"3609","Sub-Adviser or an affiliated person of the Sub-Adviser or of SSGA FM may act as"
"3610","broker for the Fund in connection with the purchase or sale of securities or"
"3611","other investments for the Fund. Such brokerage services are not within the"
"3612","scope of the duties of the Sub-Adviser under this Agreement. Subject to the"
"3613","requirements of applicable law and any"
"3614","                                      3"
"3615","<PAGE>"
"3616","procedures adopted by the Board, the Sub-Adviser or its affiliated persons may"
"3617","receive brokerage commissions, fees or other remuneration from the Fund or the"
"3618","Trust for such services in addition to the Sub-Adviser's fees for services"
"3619","under this Agreement."
"3620","   (e) The Sub-Adviser shall maintain, in the form and for the periods required"
"3621","by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act, all records relating to the Fund's"
"3622","investments that are required to be maintained by the Trust pursuant to the"
"3623","requirements of Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act. The Sub-Adviser agrees that all"
"3624","books and records which it maintains for the Fund or the Trust are the property"
"3625","of the Trust and further agrees to surrender the same to SSGA FM or the Trust"
"3626","upon SSGA FM's or the Trust's request (provided, however, that Sub-Adviser may"
"3627","retain copies of such records). The Sub-Adviser agrees to furnish the Board and"
"3628","SSGA FM with such periodic and special reports regarding the Fund's investments"
"3629","and records relating to the same as the Board or SSGA FM reasonably may"
"3630","request. Further, the Sub-Adviser shall permit the books and records maintained"
"3631","with respect to the Fund to be inspected and audited by the Trust, SSGA FM or"
"3632","their respective agents at all reasonable times during normal business hours"
"3633","upon reasonable notice."
"3634","   (f) At such times as shall reasonably be requested, the Sub-Adviser will"
"3635","provide to the Board and SSGA FM economic and investment analyses and reports,"
"3636","information required in the Registration Statement and information necessary"
"3637","for SSGA FM and the Board to review the Fund or discuss the management of it."
"3638","The Sub-Adviser will provide quarterly reports setting forth the Fund's"
"3639","performance with respect to the Allocated Assets and the Sub-Adviser's private"
"3640","account composite performance and will complete on a quarterly basis the"
"3641","checklist provided to it by SSGA FM regarding the Fund's investments and"
"3642","transactions. The Sub-Adviser shall make available to the Board and SSGA FM any"
"3643","economic, statistical and investment services normally available to"
"3644","institutional or other customers of the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser will make"
"3645","available its officers and employees to meet with the Board on reasonable"
"3646","notice to review the Fund's investments."
"3647","   (g) In accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, as amended from time"
"3648","to time, the Sub-Adviser is responsible for assisting the Board in determining"
"3649","the fair valuation of any illiquid portfolio securities held within the"
"3650","Allocated Assets and will assist the Trust's accounting services agent or SSGA"
"3651","FM to obtain independent sources of market value for all other portfolio"
"3652","securities."
"3653","   Further, the Sub-Adviser shall be responsible to ensure that the Fund and/or"
"3654","SSGA FM is notified promptly, but in any event on the same day and prior to the"
"3655","earlier of (1) the release of the Fund's net asset value or (2) 6:00pm Eastern"
"3656","Time, of any and all instances in which the Sub-Adviser knows or should have"
"3657","reason to know that the available price or value of a portfolio security does"
"3658","not represent the fair value of the instrument, or that there is no price or"
"3659","value available from any source with respect to a particular instrument and"
"3660","that such instrument should accordingly be subject to a fair valuation"
"3661","determination in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, as amended"
"3662","from time to time."
"3663","   (h) At such times as shall be reasonably requested by SSGA FM, the"
"3664","Sub-Adviser shall review and certify in writing that the information stated in"
"3665","the Trust's Registration Statement relating to the Sub-Adviser, its management"
"3666","of the Fund with respect to the Allocated"
"3667","                                      4"
"3668","<PAGE>"
"3669","Assets, including investment objectives, strategies and related risks, and its"
"3670","performance history is and will continue to be true, correct and complete to"
"3671","the best of its knowledge."
"3672","   (i) The Sub-Adviser will promptly notify SSGA FM of any change of control of"
"3673","the Sub-Adviser, including any change of its general partners or 25%"
"3674","shareholders or members, as applicable, and any changes in the key personnel of"
"3675","the Sub-Adviser, including without limitation, any change in the portfolio"
"3676","management personnel responsible for the Allocated Assets of the Fund, in each"
"3677","case prior to or promptly after such change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the"
"3678","Sub-Adviser will promptly notify SSGA FM of any existing agreement, or upon"
"3679","entering into any agreement, that may result in a change of control of the"
"3680","Sub-Adviser, including without limitation the retention of an agent to assist"
"3681","in the sale of all, or a significant portion, of the business of the"
"3682","Sub-Adviser."
"3683","   (j) The Sub-Adviser will calculate its private account composite performance"
"3684","in compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards of the CFA"
"3685","Institute Centre for Financial Market Integrity and such performance will be"
"3686","reviewed or verified at least annually by an independent accounting firm."
"3687","   (k) Unless SSGA FM gives the Sub-Adviser written instructions to the"
"3688","contrary, the Sub-Adviser shall, in a prudent and diligent manner, vote proxies"
"3689","in the best interests of the Fund as may be necessary or advisable in"
"3690","connection with any matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of an"
"3691","issuer held by the Fund and shall provide SSGA FM with its proxy voting"
"3692","procedures and guidelines and any amendments thereto."
"3693","   3. Expenses."
"3694","   During the term of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will bear all expenses"
"3695","incurred by it in connection with its investment sub-advisory services under"
"3696","this Agreement."
"3697","   4. Supplemental Arrangements"
"3698","   The Sub-Adviser may enter into arrangements with other persons affiliated"
"3699","with the Sub-Adviser to better enable it to fulfill its obligations under this"
"3700","Agreement for the provision of certain personnel and facilities to the"
"3701","Sub-Adviser, other than the brokerage services provided in Section 2(d) herein."
"3702","   5. Prohibited Conduct"
"3703","   In providing the services described in this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will"
"3704","not consult with any other investment advisory firm that provides investment"

"3706","Fund, regarding transactions in portfolio securities or other portfolio"
"3707","investments of the Fund."
"3708","   6. Compensation."
"3709","   For the services rendered, the facilities furnished and the expenses assumed"
"3710","by the Sub-Adviser, SSGA FM shall pay the Sub-Adviser no later than the"
"3711","ninetieth (90th) day following the end of each calendar quarter, a fee based on"
"3712","the net assets attributable to the aggregate Allocated"

"4090","   (a) Subject to the oversight and supervision of SSGA FM and the Board of"
"4091","Trustees of the Trust (the Board), the Sub-Adviser will provide a continuous"
"4092","investment program for the Fund with respect to the Sub-Adviser's Allocated"

"4101","stated in the Registration Statement (as defined below), the Constituent"
"4102","Documents (as defined below), the Investment Guidelines (as defined below), and"

"4104","set forth in this Section 2 as provided below, the Sub-Adviser shall provide"
"4105","SSGA FM and the Board with such periodic reports and documentation as SSGA FM"
"4106","or the Board shall reasonably request regarding the Sub-Adviser's management of"
"4107","the Fund's Allocated Assets, compliance with applicable laws and rules and the"
"4108","Registration Statement and all requirements hereunder. The Sub-Adviser"
"4109","acknowledges that copies of the Trust's current registration statement on"

"4111","and the Trust's Agreement and Declaration of Trust and By-Laws, if any"
"4112","(Constituent Documents), each as currently in effect, have been delivered to"
"4113","the Sub-Adviser."
"4114","   (b) The Sub-Adviser shall carry out its responsibilities under this"
"4115","Agreement in compliance with: (i) the Fund's investment objective, policies and"
"4116","restrictions as set forth in the Registration Statement, (ii) the Constituent"

"4130","set forth in the Investment Guidelines. In particular, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"4131","take all actions necessary with respect to the Allocated Assets, as if they"
"4132","were the Fund itself, to ensure that the Allocated Assets, if they were the"
"4133","Fund, would: (A) satisfy the asset diversification requirements set forth under"
"4134","Section 851(b)(3) of sub-chapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"
"4135","amended (Code), and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (Regulations),"

"4140","with the diversification requirements of Section 817(h) of the Code and"
"4141","Regulations [as these apply to separate accounts through which variable life"
"4142","insurance contracts and variable annuity contracts are issued]. For purposes of"
"4143","determining whether the Allocated Assets satisfy the requirements set forth in"
"4144","the preceding sentence, the Allocated Assets will be deemed not to be a member"
"4145","of any controlled group or otherwise to have any affiliates, and the"
"4146","Sub-Adviser shall have no obligation to consider the holdings or investments of"
"4147","any of the Fund's or its affiliates' assets or accounts other than the"
"4148","Allocated Assets."
"4149","   (c) The Sub-Adviser shall take all actions which it considers necessary to"
"4150","implement the investment objectives and policies of the Fund, and in"
"4151","particular, to place all orders for the purchase or sale of securities or other"
"4152","investments for the Fund's Allocated Assets with brokers or dealers selected by"
"4153","it. For that limited purpose, the Sub-Adviser is authorized as the agent of the"
"4154","Trust to give instructions to the Trust's custodian(s) as to deliveries of"
"4155","securities or other investments and payments of cash for the account of the"
"4156","Fund. In connection with the selection of brokers or dealers and the placing of"
"4157","purchase and sale orders with respect to investments of the Fund, the"
"4158","Sub-Adviser is directed at all times to seek to obtain best execution and price"
"4159","within the policy guidelines determined by the Board and set forth in the"
"4160","Registration Statement."
"4161","   In addition to seeking the best price and execution, to the extent covered"
"4162","by Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934
Act), and applicable guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the"
"4163","SEC), the Sub-Adviser is also authorized to take into consideration other"
"4164","relevant factors which may include, without limitation: (i) the execution"
"4165","capabilities of such brokers and dealers, (ii) research, brokerage and other"
"4166","services provided by brokers and dealers which the Sub-Adviser believes will"
"4167","enhance its general portfolio management capabilities, (iii) the size of the"
"4168","transaction, (iv) the difficulty of execution, (v) the operational facilities"
"4169","of such brokers and dealers, (vi) the risk to such a broker or dealer of"
"4170","positioning a block of securities, and (vii) the overall quality of brokerage"
"4171","and research services provided by such brokers and dealers. The Sub-Adviser is"
"4172","also authorized to effect individual securities transactions at commission"
"4173","rates in excess of the minimum commission rates available, if it determines in"
"4174","good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the"
"4175","value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer,"
"4176","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the Sub-Adviser's"
"4177","overall responsibilities with respect to the Fund. The policies with respect to"
"4178","brokerage allocation, determined from time to time by the Board, are those"
"4179","disclosed in the Registration Statement. The Sub-Adviser will periodically"
"4180","evaluate the statistical data, research and other investment services provided"
"4181","to it by brokers and dealers. Such services may be used by the Sub-Adviser in"
"4182","connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement or in"
"4183","connection with other advisory or investment operations including using such"
"4184","information in managing its own accounts. Whenever the Sub-Adviser"
"4185","simultaneously places orders to purchase or sell the same security on behalf of"
"4186","the Fund and one or more other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser, the orders"
"4187","will, to the extent practicable, be allocated as to price and amount among all"
"4188","such accounts in a manner believed to be equitable by the Sub-Adviser to each"
"4189","account and otherwise in accordance with the Sub-Adviser's procedures approved"
"4190","by the Board."
"4191","   (d) Only with prior written consent from SSGA FM and subject to: (i) the"

"4194","Statement, (ii) the"
"4195","                                      3"

"4199","affiliated person of the Sub-Adviser or of SSGA FM may act as broker for the"
"4200","Fund in connection with the purchase or sale of securities or other investments"
"4201","for the Fund. Such brokerage services are not within the scope of the duties of"
"4202","the Sub-Adviser under this Agreement. Subject to the requirements of applicable"
"4203","law and any procedures adopted by the Board, the Sub-Adviser or its affiliated"
"4204","persons may receive brokerage commissions, fees or other remuneration from the"
"4205","Fund or the Trust for such services in addition to the Sub-Adviser's fees for"
"4206","services under this Agreement."

"4209","investments that are required to be maintained by the Trust pursuant to the"
"4210","requirements of Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act. The Sub-Adviser agrees that all"
"4211","books and records which it maintains for the Fund or the Trust are the property"
"4212","of the Trust and further agrees to surrender the same to SSGA FM or the Trust"
"4213","upon SSGA FM's or the Trust's request (provided, however, that Sub-Adviser may"

"4699","   (a) Subject to the oversight and supervision of SSGA FM and the Board of"
"4700","Trustees of the Trust (the Board), the Sub-Adviser will provide a continuous"
"4701","investment program for the Fund with respect to the Sub-Adviser's Allocated"

"4706","Sub-Adviser will consult with SSGA FM from time to time regarding matters"
"4707","pertaining to the Fund, including market strategy and portfolio"
"4708","characteristics. The Sub-Adviser will provide services under this Agreement in"

"4710","stated in the Registration Statement (as defined below), the Constituent"
"4711","Documents (as defined below), the Investment Guidelines (as defined below), and"

"4713","set forth in this Section 2 as provided below, the Sub-Adviser shall provide"
"4714","SSGA FM and the Board with such periodic reports and documentation as SSGA FM"
"4715","or the Board shall reasonably request regarding the Sub-Adviser's management of"
"4716","the Fund's Allocated Assets, compliance with applicable laws and rules and the"
"4717","Registration Statement and all requirements hereunder. The Sub-Adviser"

"4721","(Constituent Documents), each as currently in effect, have been delivered or"
"4722","will be delivered to the Sub-Adviser."
"4723","   (b) The Sub-Adviser shall carry out its responsibilities under this"
"4724","Agreement in compliance with: (i) the Fund's investment objective, policies and"
"4725","restrictions as set forth in the Registration Statement, (ii) the Constituent"

"4740","take all actions necessary with respect to the Allocated Assets, as if they"
"4741","were the Fund's only assets, to ensure that the Fund: (A) satisfies the asset"
"4742","diversification and gross income qualification requirements as set forth under"
"4743","sub-chapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code),"
"4744","and (B) complies with the diversification requirements of Section 817(h) of the"

"4747","<PAGE>"
"4748","   (c) The Sub-Adviser shall take all actions which it considers necessary to"
"4749","implement the investment objectives and policies of the Fund, and in"
"4750","particular, to place all orders for the purchase or sale of securities or other"
"4751","investments for the Fund's Allocated Assets with brokers or dealers selected by"
"4752","Sub-Adviser. For that limited purpose, the Sub-Adviser is authorized as the"
"4753","agent of the Trust to give instructions to the Trust's custodian(s) as to"
"4754","deliveries of securities or other investments and payments of cash for the"
"4755","account of the Fund. In connection with the selection of brokers or dealers and"
"4756","the placing of purchase and sale orders with respect to investments of the"
"4757","Fund, the Sub-Adviser is directed at all times to seek to obtain best execution"
"4758","and price within the policy guidelines determined by the Board and set forth in"
"4759","the Registration Statement."
"4760","   In addition to seeking the best price and execution, to the extent covered"
"4761","by Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934
Act), and applicable guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the"
"4762","SEC), the Sub-Adviser is also authorized to take into consideration other"
"4763","relevant factors which may include, without limitation: (i) the execution"
"4764","capabilities of such brokers and dealers, (ii) research, brokerage and other"
"4765","services provided by brokers and dealers which the Sub-Adviser believes will"
"4766","enhance its general portfolio management capabilities, (iii) the size of the"
"4767","transaction, (iv) the difficulty of execution, (v) the operational facilities"
"4768","of such brokers and dealers, (vi) the risk to such a broker or dealer of"
"4769","positioning a block of securities, and (vii) the overall quality of brokerage"
"4770","and research services provided by such brokers and dealers. The Sub-Adviser is"
"4771","also authorized to effect individual securities transactions at commission"
"4772","rates in excess of the minimum commission rates available, if it determines in"
"4773","good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the"
"4774","value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer,"
"4775","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the Sub-Adviser's"
"4776","overall responsibilities with respect to the Fund. The policies with respect to"
"4777","brokerage allocation, determined from time to time by the Board are those"
"4778","disclosed in the Registration Statement. The Sub-Adviser will periodically"
"4779","evaluate the statistical data, research and other investment services provided"
"4780","to it by brokers and dealers. Such services may be used by the Sub-Adviser in"
"4781","connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement or in"
"4782","connection with other advisory or investment operations including using such"
"4783","information in managing its own accounts. Whenever the Sub-Adviser"
"4784","simultaneously places orders to purchase or sell the same security on behalf of"
"4785","the Fund and one or more other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser, the orders"
"4786","will be allocated as to price and amount among all such accounts in a manner"
"4787","believed to be equitable by the Sub-Adviser to each account and otherwise in"
"4788","accordance with the Sub-Adviser's procedures approved by the Board."
"4789","   (d) Only with prior written consent from SSGA FM and subject to: (i) the"
"4790","requirement that the Sub-Adviser seek to obtain best execution and price within"
"4791","the policy guidelines determined by the Board and set forth in the Registration"
"4792","Statement, (ii) the provisions of the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act, (iii) the"
"4793","provisions of the 1934 Act, and (iv) other applicable provisions of law, the"
"4794","Sub-Adviser or an affiliated person of the Sub-Adviser or of SSGA FM may act as"
"4795","broker for the Fund in connection with the purchase or sale of securities or"
"4796","other investments for the Fund. Such brokerage services are not within the"
"4797","scope of the duties of the Sub-Adviser under this Agreement. Subject to the"
"4798","requirements of applicable law and any procedures adopted by the Board, the"
"4799","Sub-Adviser or its affiliated persons may receive"

"4807","investments that are required to be maintained by the Trust pursuant to the"
"4808","requirements of Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act. The Sub-Adviser agrees that all"
"4809","books and records which it maintains for the Fund or the Trust are the property"
"4810","of the Trust and further agrees to surrender the same to SSGA FM or the Trust"
"4811","upon SSGA FM's or the Trust's request (provided, however, that Sub-Adviser may"
"4812","retain copies of such records). The Sub-Adviser agrees to furnish the Board and"

"4831","notice to review the Fund's investments."
"4832","   (g) In accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, as amended from time"
"4833","to time, the Sub-Adviser is responsible for assisting the Board in determining"

"4838","   Further, the Sub-Adviser shall be responsible to ensure that the Fund and/or"

"4843","not represent the fair value of the instrument, or that there is no price or"
"4844","value available from any source with respect to a particular instrument and"
"4845","that such instrument should accordingly be subject to a fair valuation"
"4846","determination in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, as amended"

"5309","   (b) The Sub-Adviser shall carry out its responsibilities under this"
"5310","Agreement in compliance with: (i) the Fund's investment objective, policies and"
"5311","restrictions as set forth in the Registration Statement, (ii) the Constituent"

"5327","were the Fund's only assets, to ensure that the Fund: (A) satisfies the asset"
"5328","diversification and gross income qualification requirements as set forth under"
"5329","sub-chapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code),"

"5335","contracts and variable annuity contracts are issued]."
"5336","   (c) The Sub-Adviser shall take all actions which it considers necessary to"
"5337","implement the investment objectives and policies of the Fund, and in"
"5338","particular, to place all orders for the purchase or sale of securities or other"
"5339","investments for the Fund's Allocated Assets with brokers or dealers selected by"
"5340","Sub-Adviser. For that limited purpose, the Sub-Adviser is authorized as the"
"5341","agent of the Trust to give instructions to the Trust's custodian(s) as to"
"5342","deliveries of securities or other investments and payments of cash for the"
"5343","account of the Fund. In connection with the selection of brokers or dealers and"
"5344","the placing of purchase and sale orders with respect to investments of the"
"5345","Fund, the Sub-Adviser is directed at all times to seek to obtain best execution"
"5346","and price within the policy guidelines determined by the Board and set forth in"
"5347","the Registration Statement."
"5348","   In addition to seeking the best price and execution, to the extent covered"
"5349","by Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934

"5352","capabilities of such brokers and dealers, (ii) research, brokerage and other"
"5353","services provided by brokers and dealers which the Sub-Adviser believes will"
"5354","enhance its general portfolio management capabilities, (iii) the size of the"
"5355","transaction, (iv) the difficulty of execution, (v) the operational facilities"
"5356","of such brokers and dealers, (vi) the risk to such a broker or dealer of"
"5357","positioning a block of securities, and (vii) the overall quality of brokerage"
"5358","and research services provided by such brokers and dealers. The Sub-Adviser is"
"5359","also authorized to effect individual securities transactions at commission"
"5360","rates in excess of the minimum commission rates available, if it determines in"
"5361","good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the"
"5362","value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer,"
"5363","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the Sub-Adviser's"
"5364","overall responsibilities with respect to the Fund. The policies with respect to"
"5365","brokerage allocation, determined from time to time by the Board, are those"
"5366","disclosed in the Registration Statement. The Sub-Adviser will periodically"
"5367","evaluate the statistical data, research and other investment services provided"
"5368","to it by brokers and dealers. Such services may be used by the Sub-Adviser in"
"5369","connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement or in"
"5370","connection with other advisory or investment operations including using such"
"5371","information in managing its own accounts. Whenever the Sub-Adviser"
"5372","simultaneously places orders to purchase or sell the same security on behalf of"
"5373","the Fund and one or more other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser, the orders"
"5374","will be allocated as to price and amount among all such accounts in a manner"
"5375","believed to be equitable by the Sub-Adviser to each account and otherwise in"
"5376","accordance with the Sub-Adviser's procedures approved by the Board."
"5377","   (d) Only with prior written consent from SSGA FM and subject to: (i) the"
"5378","requirement that the Sub-Adviser seek to obtain best execution and price within"

"5385","scope of the duties of the Sub-Adviser under this Agreement. Subject to the"

"5397","books and records which it maintains for the Fund or the Trust are the property"
"5398","of the Trust and further agrees to surrender the same to SSGA FM or the Trust"
"5399","upon SSGA FM's or the Trust's request (provided, however, that Sub-Adviser may"

"5419","notice to review the Fund's investments."
"5420","   (g) In accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, as amended from time"
"5421","to time, the Sub-Adviser is responsible for assisting the Board in determining"
"5422","the fair valuation of any illiquid portfolio securities held within the"
"5423","Allocated Assets and will assist the Trust's accounting services agent or SSGA"

"5896","restrictions applicable to the Fund's total assets as set forth in the"
"5897","Registration Statement, the Sub-Adviser shall comply with the policies,"
"5898","procedures and directives as set forth in the Investment Guidelines. SSGA FM"
"5899","shall promptly notify the Sub-Adviser of changes to (i), (ii) or (iii) above"
"5900","and shall consult with Sub-Adviser before making any changes relating solely to"
"5901","the Fund's investment objective, policies and restrictions as set forth in the"
"5902","Registration Statement, as well as to the policies, procedures and directives"
"5903","set forth in the Investment Guidelines. In particular, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"5904","take all actions necessary with respect to the Allocated Assets, as if they"
"5905","were the Fund itself, to ensure that the Allocated Assets, if they were the"
"5906","Fund, would: (A) satisfy the asset diversification requirements set forth under"
"5907","Section 851(b)(3) of sub-chapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"
"5908","amended (Code), and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (Regulations), (B)"

"5910","Section 851(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations, and (C) comply"

"5914","Regulations [as these apply to separate accounts through which variable life"
"5915","insurance contracts and variable annuity contracts are issued]."
"5916","   (c) The Sub-Adviser shall take all actions which it considers necessary to"
"5917","implement the investment objectives and policies of the Fund, and in"
"5918","particular, to place all orders for the purchase or sale of securities or other"
"5919","investments for the Fund's Allocated Assets with brokers or dealers selected by"
"5920","it. For that limited purpose, the Sub-Adviser is authorized as the agent of the"
"5921","Trust to give instructions to the Trust's custodian(s) as to deliveries of"
"5922","securities or other investments and payments of cash for the account of the"
"5923","Fund. In connection with the selection of brokers or dealers and the placing of"
"5924","purchase and sale orders with respect to investments of the Fund, the"
"5925","Sub-Adviser is directed at all times to seek to obtain best execution and price"
"5926","within the policy guidelines determined by the Board and set forth in the"
"5927","Registration Statement."
"5928","   In addition to seeking the best price and execution, to the extent covered"
"5929","by Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934
Act), and applicable guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the"
"5930","SEC), the Sub-Adviser is also authorized to take into consideration other"
"5931","relevant factors which may include, without limitation: (i) the execution"
"5932","capabilities of such brokers and dealers, (ii) research, brokerage and other"
"5933","services provided by brokers and dealers which the Sub-Adviser believes will"
"5934","enhance its general portfolio management capabilities, (iii) the size of the"
"5935","transaction, (iv) the difficulty of execution, (v) the operational facilities"
"5936","of such brokers and dealers, (vi) the risk to such a broker or dealer of"
"5937","positioning a block of securities, and (vii) the overall quality of brokerage"
"5938","and research services provided by such brokers and dealers. The Sub-Adviser is"
"5939","also authorized to effect individual securities transactions at commission"
"5940","rates in excess of the minimum commission rates available, if it determines in"
"5941","good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the"
"5942","value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer,"
"5943","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the Sub-Adviser's"
"5944","overall responsibilities with respect to the Fund. The policies with respect to"
"5945","brokerage allocation, determined from time to time by the Board, are those"
"5946","disclosed in the Registration Statement. The Sub-Adviser will periodically"
"5947","evaluate the statistical data, research and other investment services provided"
"5948","to it by brokers and dealers. Such services may be used by the Sub-Adviser in"
"5949","connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement or in"
"5950","connection with other advisory or investment operations including using such"
"5951","information in managing its own accounts. Whenever the Sub-Adviser"
"5952","simultaneously places orders to purchase or sell the same security on behalf of"
"5953","the Fund and one or more other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser, the orders"
"5954","will be allocated as to price and amount among all such accounts in a manner"
"5955","believed to be equitable by the Sub-Adviser to each account and otherwise in"
"5956","accordance with the Sub-Adviser's procedures approved by the Board."
"5957","   (d) Only with prior written consent from SSGA FM and subject to: (i) the"

"5960","Statement, (ii) the provisions of the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act, (iii) the"
"5961","provisions of the 1934 Act, and (iv) other applicable provisions of law, the"

"5976","requirements of Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act. The Sub-Adviser agrees that all"
"5977","books and records which it maintains for the Fund or the Trust are the property"
"5978","of the Trust and further agrees to surrender the same to SSGA FM or the Trust"
"5979","upon SSGA FM's or the Trust's request (provided, however, that Sub-Adviser may"

"5998","available its officers and employees to meet with the Board on reasonable"
"5999","notice to review the Fund's investments."
"6000","   (g) In accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, as amended from time"
"6001","to time, the Sub-Adviser is responsible for assisting the Board in determining"

"6003","Allocated Assets and will assist the Trust's accounting services agent or SSGA"
