"1311","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"

"1313","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1314","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over"

"1317","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"1318","and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1319","accounting principles.   A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1320","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1321","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"

"1323","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"1324","only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"

"1326","of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1327","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"

"1329","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with"
"1330","the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1331","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does"
"1332","not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"1333","or detect misstatements on a timely basis.   A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"1334","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1335","material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
