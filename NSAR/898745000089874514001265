"23905","the liabilities belonging to that series or class.  The"
"23906","holders of shares of any series or class shall not"

"23911","among such stockholders according to their"

"23929","purposes."
"23930","(5)	Redemption.  All shares of stock of the Corporation"

"25723","or any other year."

"28073","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"28074","research products and/or services provided by such broker"
"28075","or dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and"
"28076","research products and/or services, may be viewed in terms"

"28428","PRINCIPAL MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, an Iowa corporation"
"28429","(hereinafter called the Manager), and ORIGIN ASSET MANAGEMENT"
"28430","LLP, a limited liability partnership organized under the laws of England"

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to each
series of the Principal  Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end
management investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it
with portfolio selection in connection with the investment advisory
services for each series of the Fund identified in Appendix A (hereinafter
called the Series), which the Manager has agreed to provide to the
Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to furnish such services on the terms
and conditions set forth herein;; and

WHEREAS, the Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies
properly certified or authenticated of each of the following :

 	(a)	The Amended and Restated Management Agreement between
the Fund and the Manager (the Management Agreement) with
the Fund;

 	(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

 	(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the
Board of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and
services provided by the Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement,
the Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the
services described in Section 2 below for investment and
reinvestment of the securities and other assets of the Series,
subject to the supervision and direction of the Manager and the
Fund's Board of Directors, for the period and on the terms
hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor accepts such appointment
and agrees to furnish the services hereinafter set forth for the
compensation herein provided. The Sub-Advisor shall provide
such services with respect to the portion of the assets of the
Series allocated to it for management from time to time by the
Manager.  The Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes herein be
deemed to be an independent contractor and shall, except as
expressly provided or authorized herein, have no authority to act
for or represent the Fund or the Manager in any way or
otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

 		The Sub-Advisor will:
(i)    Provide investment advisory services, including but not
limited to research, advice and supervision for the
Series.

(ii)	Furnish to the Board of Directors  for approval (or any
appropriate committee of such Board of Directors), and
revise from time to time as economic conditions require,
a recommended investment program for the Series
consistent with the Series' written investment objective
and policies.
(iii)	Implement the approved investment program by placing
orders for the purchase, sale and exchange of securities,
commodity interests (as defined in the Commodity
Exchange Act, as amended) and other financial
instruments  without prior consultation with the Manager
and without regard to the length of time the securities
and other financial instruments have been held, the
resulting rate of portfolio turnover or any tax
considerations, subject always to  (i) the provisions of
the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and (ii)
the requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same
shall be from time to time in effect.

(iv)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as reasonably
requested by the officers, in taking such steps as are
reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the
decisions of its Board of Directors, and any appropriate
committees of such Board, regarding the general
conduct of the investment business of the Series.

(v)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's
investment advisory services provided to the Series, its
compliance with the 1940 Act and the regulations
adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) thereunder and the Series' investment strategies
and restrictions as stated in the Fund's prospectus and
statement of additional information (together , the
Registration Statement), subject to receipt of such
additional information as may be required from the
Manager and provided in accordance with Section 11(d)
of this Agreement.

(vi)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such
times and in such detail as the Board of Directors may
reasonably deem appropriate in order to enable it to
determine that the investment policies, procedures and
approved investment program of the Series are being
observed.

(vii)	Upon request, provide reasonable assistance in the
determination of the fair value of certain securities when
reliable market quotations are not readily available for
purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance
with procedures and methods established by the Board
of Directors.

(viii)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment
and management facilities, including salaries of clerical
and other personnel required for it to execute its duties
faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including
bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment
necessary for the efficient conduct of its duties under this
Agreement.

(ix)	Open accounts with broker-dealers,  futures commission
merchants, banks and other financial institutions
(collectively broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to
effect all transactions for the Series, place all necessary
orders with broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated
broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if
applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law,
purchase or sell orders for the Series may be
aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell
orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event
allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as
the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by
the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor
considers to be the most equitable and consistent with
its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients
of the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates over time.  The
Manager recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure
may limit the size of the position that may be acquired or
sold for the Series and that aggregation of orders may
not result in more favorable pricing or lower brokerage
commissions in all instances. At the Manager's request,
the Sub-Advisor will provide the Manager with the
information required pursuant to Rule 31a-1(b)(9) of the
1940 Act.   The Sub-Advisor will effect transactions with
those broker-dealers which it believes provide favorable
net prices and are capable of providing efficient
executions, taking into consideration, among other
things, order size, difficulty of execution, the operational
capabilities, facilities and financial condition of the
broker-dealer involved, whether that broker-dealer has
risked its own capital in positioning a block of securities
or other assets, and the prior experience of the broker-
dealer in effecting transactions of the relevant types. The
Sub-Advisor's primary objective will be to obtain best
execution with respect to all transactions for the Series.
However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers-dealers
on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or
other services or products to the Sub-Advisor or its
affiliates. To the extent consistent with applicable law,
the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount
of commission for effecting a securities transaction in
excess of the amount of commission or dealer spread
another broker- dealer would have charged for effecting
that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good
faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in
relation to the value of the brokerage and research
products and/or services provided by such broker-
dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage
and research products and/or services, may be viewed
in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall
responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates
have with respect to the Series and other accounts over
which they exercise investment discretion. Not all such
services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in
managing the Series. In addition, joint repurchase or
other accounts may not be utilized by the Series except
to the extent permitted under any exemptive order
obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions
of such order are complied with.

(x)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to
the Series as are required of an investment adviser of a
registered investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act
and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended
(the Investment Advisers Act), and the rules
thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with
such periodic and special reports as the Fund or
Manager may reasonably request.  In compliance with
the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the
Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it
maintains for the Series are the property of the Fund,
agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule
31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains
for the Fund and that are required to be maintained by
Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to
surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it
maintains for the Series upon request by the Fund or the
Manager. The Sub-Advisor may retain copies of any
such records.

(xi)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act
and the Sub-Advisor's code of ethics (the Code of"
"28432","Ethics) adopted pursuant to Rule 17j-1 as the same
may be amended from time to time.  The Manager
acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-Advisor's current
Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to
the Manager a copy of any material amendment to the
Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics.

(xii)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may
request, furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio
transactions and reports on investments held by the
Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the Fund
may reasonably request.  The Sub-Advisor will make
available its personnel to meet with the Fund's Board of
Directors at the Fund's principal place of business on
reasonable prior notice to review the investments of the
Series.

(xiii)	Provide such additional information in the possession of
the Sub-Advisor or its affiliates may be required for the
Fund or the Manager to comply with their respective
obligations under applicable laws, including, without
limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment
Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and
any rule or regulation thereunder.  Sub-Advisor will
advise Manager of any changes in Sub-Advisor's Senior
Management (i.e. Chief Investment Officer and/or Chief
Executive Officer) within a reasonable time after any
such change.  Manager acknowledges receipt of Sub-
Advisor's Form ADV more than 48 hours prior to the
execution of this Agreement.

(xiv)	Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies
solicited by, or with respect to, the issuers of securities
held in the Series in accordance with the Sub-Advisor's
proxy voting policy as most recently provided to the
Manager. The Sub-Advisor's obligations in the previous
sentence are contingent upon its timely receipt of such
proxy solicitation materials from the Manager.  The
Manager shall cause to be forwarded to Sub-Advisor all
proxy solicitation materials that it receives and shall
assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to conduct the proxy
voting process.


    3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-
Advisor will not consult with any other investment advisory firm
that provides investment advisory services to any investment
company sponsored by Principal Life Insurance Company
regarding transactions for the Fund in securities or other assets.
The Manager agrees to provide a list of such other investment
advisory firms to the Sub-Advisor, such list to be promptly
updated by the Manager upon any changes thereto.

    4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations
assumed by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the
Fund, the Manager shall pay the compensation specified in
Appendix A to this Agreement.

    5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its partners, members,
directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable
to the Manager, the Board of Directors, the Fund or its
shareholders for any claim, expense or other  loss suffered by
the Manager or the Fund resulting from any error of judgment
made in the good faith exercise of the Sub-Advisor's duties
under this Agreement or as a result of the failure by the Manager
or any of its affiliates to comply with the terms of this Agreement
except for losses resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or
gross negligence of, or from reckless disregard of, the duties of
the Sub-Advisor or any of its partners, members, directors,
officers, employees, agents (excluding any broker-dealer
selected by the Sub-Advisor), or affiliates.

      6.   Trade Errors

The Sub-Advisor will notify the Manager of any Trade Error(s),
regardless of materiality, promptly upon the discovery such
Trade Error(s) by the Sub-Advisor. Notwithstanding Section 5,
the Sub-Advisor will be liable to the Manager, the Fund or its
shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or the Fund
resulting from Trade Errors. Any gains which occur due to a
Trade Error shall be retained by the Fund. For purposes under
this Section, Trade Errors are defined as errors (regardless of
cause, and including, but not limited to errors caused, at least in
part, by manual error or systems-related issues such as coding,
unauthorized access, or security breach)  due to (i) erroneous
orders by the Sub-Advisor for the Series that result in the
purchase or sale of securities that were not intended to be
purchased or sold; (ii) erroneous orders by the Sub-Advisor that
result in the purchase or sale of securities for the Series in an
unintended amount or price; or (iii) purchases or sales of
financial instruments which violate the investment limitations or
restrictions disclosed in  the Registration Statement and/or
imposed by  applicable law or regulation (calculated at the Sub-
Advisor's portfolio level), unless otherwise agreed to in writing.

    7.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other
persons affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third
parties to better enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations
under this Agreement for the provision of certain personnel and
facilities to the Sub- Advisor, subject to written notification to and
approval of the Manager and, where required by applicable law,
the Board of Directors.

    8.	Regulation

The Sub-Advisor shall submit to all regulatory and administrative
bodies having jurisdiction over the services provided pursuant to
this Agreement any information, reports or other material which
any such body require pursuant to applicable laws and
regulations.

    9.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement

This Agreement shall become effective as of the date of its
execution and, unless otherwise terminated, shall continue in
effect for a period of two years and thereafter from year to year
provided that the continuance is specifically approved at least
annually either by the Board of Directors of the Fund or by a vote
of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Series
and in either event by a vote of a majority of the Board of
Directors  who are not interested persons of the Manager,
Principal Life Insurance Company, the Sub-Advisor or the Fund
cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on
such approval.

If the Board of Directors or the shareholders of a Series fail to
approve the Agreement or any continuance of the Agreement in
accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Sub-
Advisor will continue to act as Sub-Advisor with respect to the
Series pending the required approval of the Agreement or its
continuance or of any contract with the Sub-Advisor or a different
manager or Sub-Advisor or other definitive action; provided, that
the compensation received by the Sub-Advisor in respect to the
Series during such period is in compliance with Rule 15a-4 under
the 1940 Act.

This Agreement may be terminated at any time without the
payment of any penalty by the Board of Directors of the Fund or
by the Sub-Advisor, or the Manager or by vote of a majority of
the outstanding voting securities of the Series, in each case, on
sixty days written notice. This Agreement shall automatically
terminate in the event of its assignment. In interpreting the
provisions of this Section 9, the definitions contained in Section
2(a) of the 1940 Act (particularly the definitions of interested"
"28433","person, assignment and voting security) shall be applied.

    10.	Amendment of this Agreement

No material amendment of this Agreement shall be effective until
approved, if required by the 1940 Act or the rules, regulations,
interpretations or orders issued thereunder, by vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the
Series and by vote of a majority of the Board of Directors  who
are not interested persons of the Manager, the Sub-Advisor,
Principal Life Insurance Company or the Fund cast in person at a
meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval, and
such amendment is signed by both parties.

    11.	General Provisions

further documents as are necessary to effectuate the purposes
hereof. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Iowa.
The captions in this Agreement are included for convenience
only and in no way define or delimit any of the provisions hereof
or otherwise affect their construction or effect.

(b) Any notice under this Agreement shall be in writing, addressed
and delivered or mailed postage pre-paid to        the other party

receipt of such notices. Until               further notice to the other
party, it is agreed that the address of the Manager for this
purpose shall be                  Principal Financial Group, Des
Moines, Iowa 50392-0200, and the address of the Sub-Advisor
shall be               Origin Asset Management LLP, One Carey
Lane, London, EC2V 8AE, United Kingdom.

(c)	The Sub-Advisor will promptly notify the Manager in writing of the
occurrence of any of the following events:

(1)	the Sub-Advisor fails to be registered as an investment
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act or under the
laws of any jurisdiction in which the Sub-Advisor is
required to be registered as an investment advisor in
order to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

(2)	the Sub-Advisor is served or otherwise receives notice of
any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, at
law or in equity, before or by any court, public board or
body, specifically naming the Fund or involving the
affairs of the Fund.

(d)	The Manager shall provide (or cause the Series custodian to
provide) timely information to the Sub-Advisor regarding such

requirements and cash available for investment in the Series,
and all other reasonable information as may be necessary for the
Sub-Advisor to perform its duties and responsibilities hereunder.

(e)  The Sub-Advisor represents that it will not enter into any
agreement, oral or written, or other understanding under which
the Fund directs or is expected to direct portfolio securities
transactions, or any remuneration, to a broker or dealer in
consideration for the promotion or sale of Fund shares or shares
issued by any other registered investment company. Sub-
Advisor further represents that it is contrary to the Sub-Advisor's
policies to permit those who select brokers or dealers for
execution of fund portfolio securities transactions to take into
account the broker or dealer's promotion or sale of Fund shares
or shares issued by any other registered investment company.

(f)   The Sub-Advisor acknowledges that the Series is relying on the
exclusion from the definition of                     commodity pool"
"28434","operator under Section 4.5 of the General Regulations under
the Commodity                     Exchange Act (Rule 4.5). The Sub-
Advisor will not exceed the de minimis trading limits set forth in

in any way refer directly or indirectly to its relationship with the
Fund, the Series, or the Manager or any of their respective
affiliates in offering, marketing or other promotional materials
without the express written consent of the Manager; provided,
however, that the Manager consents to the Sub-Advisor's use of
the Manager's name and the Fund name in the Sub-Advisor's
representative client list that may be distributed to potential and
existing clients so long as this Agreement is in effect.

(h)	The Manager shall promptly notify the Sub-Advisor of the
occurrence of any event that would disqualify        the Manager
from serving as an investment adviser of an investment company
pursuant to Section 9(a)       of the 1940 Act or other applicable

PRINCIPAL FUNDS, INC.
AMENDED AND RESTATED SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT
PRINCIPAL GLOBAL INVESTORS SUB-ADVISED SERIES


AGREEMENT effective as of June 11, 2014, by and between PRINCIPAL
MANAGEMENT CORPORATION (hereinafter called the Manager), and
PRINCIPAL GLOBAL INVESTORS, LLC (hereinafter called the"
"28435","Sub-Advisor).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to each
Series of Principal Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end management
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the 1940 Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it with
portfolio selection and related research and statistical services in
connection with the investment advisory services for each Series of the
Fund identified in Appendix A hereto (hereinafter called Series), which the
Manager has agreed to provide to the Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to
furnish such services; and

WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies
properly certified or authenticated of each of the following and will promptly
provide the Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or authenticated of
any amendment or supplement thereto:
(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement) with the
Fund;
(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission;
(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;
(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the
Board of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and services
to be provided by the Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor
In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the
Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the services
described in Section 2 below for investment and reinvestment of the
securities and other assets of each Series, subject to the control and
direction of the Manager and the Fund's Board of Directors, for the
period and on the terms hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor accepts
such appointment and agrees to furnish the services hereinafter set
forth for the compensation herein provided. The Sub-Advisor shall for
all purposes herein be deemed to be an independent contractor and
shall, except as expressly provided or authorized, have no authority to
act for or represent the Fund or the Manager in any way or otherwise
be deemed an agent of the Fund or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor
The Sub-Advisor will:
(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited to
research, advice and supervision for each Series.
(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval (or any
appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from time to
time as conditions require, a recommended investment program
for each Series consistent with each Series investment objective
and policies.
(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing orders for
the purchase and sale of securities without prior consultation with
the Manager and without regard to the length of time the securities
have been held, the resulting rate of portfolio turnover or any tax
considerations, subject always to the provisions of the Fund's
registration statement, Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and
the requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same shall be
from time to time in effect.
(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the
officers, in taking such steps as are necessary or appropriate to
carry out the decisions of its Board of Directors, and any
appropriate committees of such Board, regarding the general
conduct of the investment business of each Series.
(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment
advisory services obligations, compliance with the 1940 Act and
the regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission thereunder and the Series' investment strategies and
restrictions as stated in the Fund's prospectus and statement of
additional information.
(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and in
such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem
appropriate in order to enable it to determine that the investment
policies, procedures and approved investment program of each
Series are being observed.
(g)	Upon request, provide assistance and recommendations for the
determination of the fair value of certain securities when reliable
market quotations are not readily available for purposes of
calculating net asset value in accordance with procedures and
methods established by the Fund's Board of Directors.
(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and
management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other
personnel required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii)
administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical personnel
and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of the
investment advisory affairs of each Series.
(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission
merchants (broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all
transactions for each Series, place all necessary orders with
broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated broker-dealers), and
negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the extent consistent with
applicable law, purchase or sell orders for each Series may be
aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of
other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation of
securities so sold or purchased, as well as the expenses incurred
in the transaction, will be made by the Sub-Advisor in the manner
the Sub-Advisor considers to be the most equitable and consistent
with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients.  The
Sub-Advisor will report on such allocations at the request of the
Manager, the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors providing
such information as the number of aggregated trades to which
each Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades
were directed and the basis for the allocation for the aggregated
trades.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain
execution of transactions for each Series at prices which are
advantageous to the Series and at commission rates that are
reasonable in relation to the benefits received. However, the Sub-
Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the basis that they
provide brokerage, research or other services or products to the
Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the
Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission
for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount of
commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would have
charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor
determines in good faith that such amount of commission is
reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research
products and/or services provided by such broker or dealer. This
determination, with respect to brokerage and research products
and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either that particular
transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor
and its affiliates have with respect to each Series as well as to
accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Not all
such services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in
managing the Series.  In addition, joint repurchase or other
accounts may not be utilized by the Series except to the extent
permitted under any exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor
provided that all conditions of such order are complied with.
(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to each
Series as are required of an investment advisor of a registered
investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisers Act), and the
rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with such
periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager may
reasonably request.  In compliance with the requirements of Rule
31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all
records that it maintains for each Series are the property of the
Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2
under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains for the Series and
that are required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940
Act, and further agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any
records that it maintains for a Series upon request by the Fund or
the Manager.  The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility for the
maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is directly related
to the services the Sub-Advisor provides to a Series.
(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the
Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as the
same may be amended from time to time.  The Manager
acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-Advisor's current Code of
Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to the Manager a copy
of any material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics
along with certification that the Sub-Advisor has implemented
procedures for administering the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics.
(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request,
furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio transactions and
reports on investments held by a Series, all in such detail as the
Manager or the Fund may reasonably request.  The Sub-Advisor
will make available its officers and employees to meet with the
Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's principal place of business
on due notice to review the investments of a Series.
(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-
advisor and may be required for the Fund or the Manager to
comply with their respective obligations under applicable laws,
including, without limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers
Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act),
and any state securities laws, and any rule or regulation
thereunder.
(n)	Vote proxies received on behalf of the Series in a manner
consistent with Sub-Advisor's proxy voting policies and procedures
and provide a record of votes cast containing all of the voting
information required by Form N-PX in an electronic format to
enable the Series to file Form N-PX as required by SEC rule.
(o)	Respond to tender offers, rights offerings and other voluntary
corporate action requests affecting securities held by the Fund
and complete and file notices of claims in connection with class
action lawsuits concerning securities owned by the Fund.
3.	Prohibited Conduct
In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-Advisor
will not consult with any other investment advisory firm that provides
investment advisory services to any investment company sponsored by
Principal Life Insurance Company regarding transactions for the Fund
in securities or other assets.
4.	Compensation
As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations assumed
by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to each Series, the Manager
shall pay the compensation specified in Appendix A to this Agreement.
5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor
Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers, employees,
agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager, the Fund or its
shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or the Fund resulting
from any error of judgment made in the good faith exercise of the
Sub-Advisor's investment discretion in connection with selecting
investments for a Series or as a result of the failure by the Manager or
any of its affiliates to comply with the terms of this Agreement, except
for losses resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence of, or from reckless disregard of, the duties of the
Sub-Advisor or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, or
affiliates.
6.	Supplemental Arrangements
The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other persons
affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third parties to better
enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement for
the provision of certain personnel and facilities to the Sub- Advisor,
subject to written notification to and approval of the Manager and,
where required by applicable law, the Board of Directors of the Fund.
7.	Regulation
The Sub-Advisor shall submit to all regulatory and administrative bodies
having jurisdiction over the services provided pursuant to this
Agreement any information, reports or other material which any such
body may request or require pursuant to applicable laws and
regulations.
8.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement
This Agreement shall become effective on the latest of (i) the date of its
execution, (ii) the date of its approval by a majority of the Board of
Directors of the Fund, including approval by the vote of a majority of the
Board of Directors of the Fund who are not interested persons of the
Manager, the Sub-Advisor, Principal Life Insurance Company or the
Fund cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on
such approval or (iii) if required by the 1940 Act, the date of its approval
by a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Series. It shall
continue in effect thereafter from year to year provided that the
continuance is specifically approved at least annually either by the
Board of Directors of the Fund or by a vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Series and in either event by a vote
of a majority of the Board of Directors of the Fund who are not
interested persons of the Manager, Principal Life Insurance Company,
the Sub-Advisor or the Fund cast in person at a meeting called for the
purpose of voting on such approval.

If the shareholders of a Series fail to approve the Agreement or any
continuance of the Agreement in accordance with the requirements of
the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor will continue to act as Sub-Advisor with
respect to the Series pending the required approval of the Agreement
or its continuance or of any contract with the Sub-Advisor or a different
manager or sub-advisor or other definitive action; provided, that the
compensation received by the Sub-Advisor in respect to the Series
during such period is in compliance with Rule 15a-4 under the 1940
Act.

This Agreement may be terminated at any time without the payment of
any penalty by the Board of Directors of the Fund or by the
Sub-Advisor, the Manager or by vote of a majority of the outstanding
voting securities of the Series on sixty days written notice. This
Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event of its assignment.
In interpreting the provisions of this Section 8, the definitions contained
in Section 2(a) of the 1940 Act (particularly the definitions of interested"
"28436","person, assignment and voting security) shall be applied.

majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Series and by vote of
a majority of the Board of Directors of the Fund who are not interested

fund pooled investment vehicles (identified below as Other"
"28437","Aggregated Fixed Income Pools), as

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it with
portfolio selection and related research and statistical services in
connection with the investment advisory services for each Series of the
Fund identified in Appendix A hereto (hereinafter called Series), which the
Manager has agreed to provide to the Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to

WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies

(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;
(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the
Board of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and services
to be provided by the Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor
In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the
Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the services
described in Section 2 below for investment and reinvestment of the
securities and other assets of each Series, subject to the control and
direction of the Manager and the Fund's Board of Directors, for the
period and on the terms hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor accepts
such appointment and agrees to furnish the services hereinafter set
forth for the compensation herein provided. The Sub-Advisor shall for
all purposes herein be deemed to be an independent contractor and
shall, except as expressly provided or authorized, have no authority to
act for or represent the Fund or the Manager in any way or otherwise
be deemed an agent of the Fund or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor
The Sub-Advisor will:
(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited to
research, advice and supervision for each Series.
(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval (or any
appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from time to
time as conditions require, a recommended investment program
for each Series consistent with each Series investment objective
and policies.
(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing orders for
the purchase and sale of securities without prior consultation with
the Manager and without regard to the length of time the securities
have been held, the resulting rate of portfolio turnover or any tax
considerations, subject always to the provisions of the Fund's
registration statement, Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and
the requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same shall be
from time to time in effect.
(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the
officers, in taking such steps as are necessary or appropriate to
carry out the decisions of its Board of Directors, and any
appropriate committees of such Board, regarding the general
conduct of the investment business of each Series.
(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment
advisory services obligations, compliance with the 1940 Act and
the regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission thereunder and the Series' investment strategies and
restrictions as stated in the Fund's prospectus and statement of
additional information.
(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and in
such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem
appropriate in order to enable it to determine that the investment
policies, procedures and approved investment program of each
Series are being observed.
(g)	Upon request, provide assistance and recommendations for the
determination of the fair value of certain securities when reliable
market quotations are not readily available for purposes of
calculating net asset value in accordance with procedures and
methods established by the Fund's Board of Directors.
(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and
management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other
personnel required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii)
administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical personnel
and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of the
investment advisory affairs of each Series.
(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers, swap dealers, clearinghouses
and futures commission merchants (broker-dealers), select
broker-dealers to effect all transactions for each Series, place all
necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers (including
affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if
applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law, purchase
or sell orders for each Series may be aggregated with
contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of other clients of the
Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation of securities or swaps so
sold or purchased, as well as the expenses incurred in the
transaction, will be made by the Sub-Advisor in the manner the
Sub-Advisor considers to be the most equitable and consistent
with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients.  The
Sub-Advisor will report on such allocations at the request of the
Manager, the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors providing
such information as the number of aggregated trades to which
each Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades
were directed and the basis for the allocation for the aggregated
trades.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain
execution of transactions for each Series at prices which are
advantageous to the Series and at commission rates that are
reasonable in relation to the benefits received. However, the Sub-
Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the basis that they
provide brokerage, research or other services or products to the
Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the
Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission
for effecting a securities or derivatives transaction in excess of the
amount of commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer
would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-
Advisor determines in good faith that such amount of commission
is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and
research products and/or services provided by such broker or
dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and
research products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of
either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities
which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to each
Series as well as to accounts over which they exercise investment
discretion. Not all such services or products need be used by the
Sub-Advisor in managing the Series.  In addition, joint repurchase
or other accounts may not be utilized by the Series except to the
extent permitted under any exemptive order obtained by the Sub-
Advisor provided that all conditions of such order are complied
with.
(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to each
Series as are required of an investment advisor of a registered
investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisers Act), and the
rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with such
periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager may
reasonably request.  In compliance with the requirements of Rule
31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all
records that it maintains for each Series are the property of the
Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2
under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains for the Series and
that are required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940
Act, and further agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any
records that it maintains for a Series upon request by the Fund or
the Manager.  The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility for the
maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is directly related
to the services the Sub-Advisor provides to a Series.
(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the
Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as the
same may be amended from time to time.  The Manager
acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-Advisor's current Code of
Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to the Manager a copy
of any material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics
along with certification that the Sub-Advisor has implemented
procedures for administering the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics.
(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request,
furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio transactions and
reports on investments held by a Series, all in such detail as the
Manager or the Fund may reasonably request.  The Sub-Advisor
will make available its officers and employees to meet with the
Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's principal place of business
on due notice to review the investments of a Series.
(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-
advisor and may be required for the Fund or the Manager to
comply with their respective obligations under applicable laws,
including, without limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act, the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Commodity Exchange
Act, as amended,  and any state securities laws, and any rule or
regulation thereunder.
(n)	Vote proxies received on behalf of the Series in a manner
consistent with Sub-Advisor's proxy voting policies and procedures
and provide a record of votes cast containing all of the voting
information required by Form N-PX in an electronic format to
enable the Series to file Form N-PX as required by SEC rule.
(o)	Respond to tender offers, rights offerings and other voluntary
corporate action requests affecting securities held by the Fund.
3.	Prohibited Conduct
In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-Advisor
will not consult with any other investment advisory firm that provides
investment advisory services to any investment company sponsored by
Principal Life Insurance Company regarding transactions for the Fund
in securities or other assets.
4.	Compensation
As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations assumed
by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to each Series, the Manager
shall pay the compensation specified in Appendix A to this Agreement.
5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor
Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers, employees,
agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager, the Fund or its
shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or the Fund resulting
from any error of judgment made in the good faith exercise of the
Sub-Advisor's investment discretion in connection with selecting
investments for a Series or as a result of the failure by the Manager or
any of its affiliates to comply with the terms of this Agreement, except
for losses resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence of, or from reckless disregard of, the duties of the
Sub-Advisor or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, or
affiliates.
6.	Supplemental Arrangements
The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other persons
affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third parties to better
enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement for
the provision of certain personnel and facilities to the Sub- Advisor,
subject to written notification to and approval of the Manager and,
where required by applicable law, the Board of Directors of the Fund.
7.	Regulation
The Sub-Advisor shall submit to all regulatory and administrative bodies
having jurisdiction over the services provided pursuant to this
Agreement any information, reports or other material which any such
body may request or require pursuant to applicable laws and
regulations.
8.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement
This Agreement shall become effective on the latest of (i) the date of its
execution, (ii) the date of its approval by a majority of the Board of
Directors of the Fund, including approval by the vote of a majority of the

Fund cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on
such approval or (iii) if required by the 1940 Act, the date of its approval

of a majority of the Board of Directors of the Fund who are not
interested persons of the Manager, Principal Life Insurance Company,
the Sub-Advisor or the Fund cast in person at a meeting called for the
purpose of voting on such approval.

If the shareholders of a Series fail to approve the Agreement or any
continuance of the Agreement in accordance with the requirements of
the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor will continue to act as Sub-Advisor with
respect to the Series pending the required approval of the Agreement
or its continuance or of any contract with the Sub-Advisor or a different
manager or sub-advisor or other definitive action; provided, that the
compensation received by the Sub-Advisor in respect to the Series
during such period is in compliance with Rule 15a-4 under the 1940
Act.

This Agreement may be terminated at any time without the payment of
any penalty by the Board of Directors of the Fund or by the
Sub-Advisor, the Manager or by vote of a majority of the outstanding
voting securities of the Series on sixty days written notice. This

APPENDIX A

PGI shall serve as investment sub-advisor for each Series
identified below.  The Manager will pay
PGI, as full compensation for all services provided under
this Agreement, a fee, computed and paid
monthly, at an annual rate determined as described below
of the Fund's net assets as of the first
day of each month allocated to PGI's management.

In calculating the fee for a Series included in Table A,
assets of all other Series included in Table A,
 assets of any unregistered separate account of Principal
Life Insurance Company or other non-
fund pooled investment vehicles (identified below as Other"
"28440","Aggregated Fixed Income Pools), as
well as any other future fixed income investment pools which
may be added, as agreed, from time
to time,  will be combined with the assets of the relevant
Series to arrive at net assets for fee
breakpoint purposes.

In calculating the fee for a Series included in Table B,
assets of any unregistered separate account
of Principal Life Insurance Company or any investment
company sponsored by Principal Life
Insurance Company to which PGI provides investment advisory
services and which have the same
investment mandate (e.g. MidCap Value) as the Series for
which the fee is calculated (identified
below as Other Aggregated Pools in Style), as well as
any other future investment pools in the
same style which may be added, as agreed, from time to
time, will be combined with the assets of
the relevant Series to arrive at net assets for fee
breakpoint purposes.


If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates before
the end of any month, the fee (if any) for

the period from the effective date to the end of such month or
from the beginning of such month to
the date of termination, as the case may be, shall be
prorated according to the proportion which
such period bears to the full month in which such
effectiveness or termination occurs.

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management
Agreement, the Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to
perform the services described in Section 2 below for
investment and reinvestment of the securities and other
assets of each Series, subject to the control and direction of
the Manager and the Fund's Board of Directors, for the
period and on the terms hereinafter set forth. The
Sub-Advisor accepts such appointment and agrees to furnish
the services hereinafter set forth for the compensation herein
provided. The Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes herein be
deemed to be an independent contractor and shall, except as
expressly provided or authorized, have no authority to act for
or represent the Fund or the Manager in any way or
otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or the Manager.





2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

		The Sub-Advisor will:

(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not
limited to research, advice and supervision for each
Series.
 (b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for
approval (or any appropriate committee of such Board),
and revise from time to time as conditions require, a
recommended investment program for each Series
consistent with each Series investment objective and
policies.

(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing
orders for the purchase and sale of securities without
prior consultation with the Manager and without regard
to the length of time the securities have been held, the
resulting rate of portfolio turnover or any tax
considerations, subject always to the provisions of the
Fund's registration statement, Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws and the requirements of the 1940 Act, as
each of the same shall be from time to time in effect.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested
by the officers, in taking such steps as are necessary or
appropriate to carry out the decisions of its Board of
Directors, and any appropriate committees of such
Board, regarding the general conduct of the investment
business of each Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's
investment advisory services obligations, compliance
with the 1940 Act and the regulations adopted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder and
the Series' investment strategies and restrictions as
stated in the Fund's prospectus and statement of
additional information.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such
times and in such detail as the Board of Directors may
reasonably deem appropriate in order to enable it to
determine that the investment policies, procedures and
approved investment program of each Series are being
observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide assistance and recommendations
for the determination of the fair value of certain
securities when reliable market quotations are not
readily available for purposes of calculating net asset
value in accordance with procedures and methods
established by the Fund's Board of Directors.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment
and management facilities, including salaries of clerical
and other personnel required for it to execute its duties
faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including
bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment
necessary for the efficient conduct of the investment
advisory affairs of each Series.

(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures
commission merchants (broker-dealers), select broker-
dealers to effect all transactions for each Series, place
all necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers
(including affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate
commissions, if applicable. To the extent consistent with
applicable law, purchase or sell orders for each Series
may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or
sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such
event allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as
well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be
made by the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor
considers to be the most equitable and consistent with
its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients.
The Sub-Advisor will report on such allocations at the
request of the Manager, the Fund or the Fund's Board of
Directors providing such information as the number of
aggregated trades to which each Series was a party, the
broker-dealers to whom such trades were directed and
the basis for the allocation for the aggregated trades.
The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain
execution of transactions for each Series at prices which
are advantageous to the Series and at commission rates
that are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.
However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers
on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or
other services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the
extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor
may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission for
effecting a securities transaction in excess of the
amount of commission or dealer spread another broker
or dealer would have charged for effecting that
transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith
that such amount of commission is reasonable in
relation to the value of the brokerage and research
products and/or services provided by such broker or
dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage
and research products and/or services, may be viewed
in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall
responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates
have with respect to each Series as well as to accounts
over which they exercise investment discretion. Not all
such services or products need be used by the Sub-
Advisor in managing the Series.  In addition, joint
repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized by the
Series except to the extent permitted under any
exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided
that all conditions of such order are complied with.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to
each Series as are required of an investment advisor of
a registered investment company pursuant to the 1940
Act and Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the
Investment Advisers Act), and the rules thereunder,
and furnish the Fund and the Manager with such
periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager
may reasonably request.  In compliance with the
requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the
Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it
maintains for each Series are the property of the Fund,
agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule
31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains
for the Series and that are required to be maintained by
Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to
surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it
maintains for a Series upon request by the Fund or the
Manager.  The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility for the
maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is
directly related to the services the Sub-Advisor provides
to a Series.

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act
and the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant
to that Rule as the same may be amended from time to
time.  The Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy of
Sub-Advisor's current Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall
promptly forward to the Manager a copy of any material
amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics along
with certification that the Sub-Advisor has implemented
procedures for administering the Sub-Advisor's Code of
Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may
request, furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio
transactions and reports on investments held by a
Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the Fund
may reasonably request.  The Sub-Advisor will make
available its officers and employees to meet with the
Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's principal place
of business on due notice to review the investments of a
Series.

(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a
sub-advisor and may be required for the Fund or the
Manager to comply with their respective obligations
under applicable laws, including, without limitation, the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act, the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act),
and any state securities laws, and any rule or regulation
thereunder.
(n)	Vote proxies received on behalf of the Series in a manner
consistent with Sub-Advisor's proxy voting policies and
procedures and provide a record of votes cast containing all of
the voting information required by Form N-PX in an electronic
format to enable the Series to file Form N-PX as required by
SEC rule.

(o)	Respond to tender offers, rights offerings and other voluntary
corporate action requests affecting securities held by the Fund
and complete and file notices of claims in connection with
class action lawsuits concerning securities owned by the
Fund.


   3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the
Sub-Advisor will not consult with any other investment
advisory firm that provides investment advisory services to
any investment company sponsored by Principal Life
Insurance Company regarding transactions for the Fund in
securities or other assets.

   4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations
assumed by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to each
Series, the Manager shall pay the compensation specified in
Appendix A to this Agreement.

   5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers,
employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager,
the Fund or its shareholders for any loss suffered by the
Manager or the Fund resulting from any error of judgment
made in the good faith exercise of the Sub-Advisor's
investment discretion in connection with selecting
investments for a Series or as a result of the failure by the
Manager or any of its affiliates to comply with the terms of
this Agreement and/or insurance laws and rules except for
losses resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence of, or from reckless disregard of, the duties of the
Sub-Advisor or any of its directors, officers, employees,
agents, or affiliates.

   6.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other
persons affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated
third parties to better enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement for the provision of certain
personnel and facilities to the Sub- Advisor, subject to written
notification to and approval of the Manager and, where
required by applicable law, the Board of Directors of the
Fund.

   7.	Regulation

The Sub-Advisor shall submit to all regulatory and

provided pursuant to this Agreement any information, reports
or other material which any such body may request or require
pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.

to act as Sub-Advisor with respect to the Series pending the
required approval of the Agreement or its continuance or of

sub-advisor or other definitive action; provided, that the
compensation received by the Sub-Advisor in respect to the

APPENDIX A


   The Sub-Advisor shall serve as investment sub-advisor for the

First $100,000,000 of assets	0.3427%

Next $150,000,000 of assets	0.2937

Assets over $250,000,000	0.1958

Series
Sub-Advisor Percentage Fee

   The Sub-Advisor Percentage Fee shall be accrued for each
calendar day and the sum of the daily fee accruals shall be paid
monthly to the Sub-Advisor. The daily fee accruals will be computed
by multiplying the fraction of one over the number of calendar days in
the year by the applicable annual rate described above and
multiplying this product by the net assets of the Series, as
determined in accordance with the Series' Prospectus and
Statement of Additional Information as of the close of business on
the previous business day on which the Series was open for
business.

   In calculating the fee for a series included in the table (with the
exception of the Capital Securities Fund), assets of any unregistered
separate account of Principal Life Insurance Company and any
investment company sponsored by Principal Life Insurance
Company to which Spectrum Asset Management, Inc. provides
investment advisory services and which have the same investment
mandate as the series for which the fee is calculated, will be
combined with the assets of the series to arrive at net assets.

   If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates before the end
of any month, the fee (if any) for the period from the effective date to
the end of such month or from the beginning of such month to the
date of termination, as the case may be, shall be prorated according
to the proportion which such period bears to the full month in which
such effectiveness or termination occurs.

"28555","The Manager recognizes that, in some cases, this"

"28579","products and/or services provided by such broker or"
"28580","dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage"
"28581","and research products and/or services, may be viewed"

"28913","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"28914","The Shareholders and Board of Directors"
"28915","Principal Funds, Inc."
"28916","In planning and performing our audits of"
"28917","the financial statements of each of the"
"28918","Principal Funds, Inc. listed in Exhibit A"
"28919","attached hereto (the Funds) as of and"
"28920","for the period ended October 31, 2014, in"
"28921","accordance with the standards of the"
"28922","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"28923","(United States), we considered"
"28924","the Funds' internal controls over financial"
"28925","reporting, including controls over"
"28926","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"28927","our auditing procedures for the"
"28928","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"28929","statements and to comply"
"28930","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"28931","purpose of expressing an"
"28932","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'  internal"
"28933","control over financial"
"28934","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"28935","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"28936","establishing and maintaining"
"28937","effective internal control over financial reporting."
"28938","In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"28939","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"28940","assess the expected"
"28941","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"28942","internal control over"
"28943","financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"28944","reasonable assurance"
"28945","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"28946","preparation of financial"
"28947","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"28948","generally accepted"
"28949","accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"28950","over financial reporting"
"28951","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"28952","to the maintenance of"
"28953","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"28954","reflect the transactions"
"28955","and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"28956","(2) provide reasonable assurance"
"28957","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"28958","preparation of financial"
"28959","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"28960","accounting principles, and that"
"28961","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"28962","only in accordance"
"28963","with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and"
"28964","(3)"
"28965","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"28966","detection of"
"28967","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"28968","assets that could"
"28969","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"28970","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"28971","financial reporting may"
"28972","not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"28973","any evaluation of"
"28974","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"28975","that controls may become"
"28976","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"28977","degree of compliance"
"28978","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"28979","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"28980","exists when the design"
"28981","or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"28982","employees, in the"
"28983","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"28984","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is"
"28985","a deficiency, or a"
"28986","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"28987","financial reporting, such"
"28988","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"28989","misstatement of the"
"28990","company's annual or interim financial statements will"
"28991","not be prevented or"
"28992","detected on a timely basis."
"28993","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"28994","financial reporting was for"
"28995","the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"28996","would not necessarily"
"28997","disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might"
"28998","be material weaknesses"
