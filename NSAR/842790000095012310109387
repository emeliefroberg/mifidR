"648","             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"649","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM Investment Securities Fund"
"650","(Invesco Investment Securities Fund):"
"651","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Invesco Van"
"652","Kampen Government Securities Fund (formerly known as Van Kampen Government"
"653","Securities Fund; one of the funds constituting AIM Investment Securities Fund"
"654","(Invesco Investment Securities Fund), hereafter referred to as the Fund) as of"
"655","and for the period ended September 30, 2010, in accordance with the standards of"
"656","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"657","Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"658","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"659","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"660","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"661","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"662","reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"663","Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"664","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"665","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"666","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"667","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"668","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"669","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"670","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"671","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"672","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"673","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"674","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"675","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"676","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"677","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"678","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and"
"679","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"680","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"681","a material effect on the financial statements."
"682","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"683","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"684","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"685","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"686","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"687","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"688","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"689","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"690","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"691","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"692","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"693","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"694","on a timely basis."
"695","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"696","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"697","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"698","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"699","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"700","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"701","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to"
"702","be material weaknesses as defined above as of September 30, 2010."
"703","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"704","Board of Trustees of the Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"705","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"706","parties."

"789","     On December 1, 2009, the Board of Trustees of AIM Investment Securities"
"790","Funds (Invesco Investment Securities Funds) (formerly known as AIM Investment"
"791","Securities Funds) (AIS) approved an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the"
"792","Agreement). On May 11, 2010, at a Special Meeting for shareholders of Van"
"793","Kampen Government Securities Fund (the Fund), shareholders approved the"
"794","Agreement that provided for the combination of the Fund with Invesco Van Kampen"
"795","Government Fund, (the Acquiring Fund), an investment portfolio of AIS (the"
"796","Reorganization). Pursuant to the Agreement, on June 1, 2010, all of the assets"
"797","of the Fund were transferred to the Acquiring Fund. The Acquiring Fund assumed"
"798","all of the liabilities of the Fund, and AIS issued Class A shares of the"
"799","Acquiring Fund to the Fund's Class A shareholders, Class B shares of the"
"800","Acquiring Fund to the Fund's Class B shareholders, Class C shares of Acquiring"
"801","Fund to the Fund's Class C shareholders and Class Y shares of the Acquiring Fund"
"802","to the Fund's Class I shareholders. The value of each Fund's shareholder account"
"803","with the Acquiring Fund immediately after the Reorganization was the same as the"
"804","value of such shareholder's account with the Fund immediately prior to the"
"805","Reorganization. The Reorganization was structured as a tax-free transaction. No"

"2629","      1.1. It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Reorganization"
"2630","described herein shall be conducted separately of the others, and a party that"
"2631","is not a party to a Reorganization shall incur no obligations, duties or"
"2632","liabilities with respect to such Reorganization by reason of being a party to"
"2633","this Agreement. If any one or more Reorganizations should fail to be"
"2634","consummated, such failure shall not affect the other Reorganizations in any way."
"2635","<PAGE>"
"2636","      1.2. Provided that all conditions precedent to a Reorganization set forth"
"2637","herein have been satisfied as of the Closing Date (defined in Section 3.1), and"
"2638","based on the representations and warranties each party provides to the others,"
"2639","each Target Entity and its corresponding Acquiring Entity agree to take the"
"2640","following steps with respect to their Reorganization(s), the parties to which"
"2641","and classes of shares to be issued in connection with which are set forth in"
"2642","Exhibit A:"
"2643","            (a) The Target Fund shall transfer all of its Assets, as defined and"
"2644","      set forth in Section 1.2(b), to the Acquiring Fund, and the Acquiring Fund"
"2645","      in exchange therefor shall assume the Liabilities, as defined and set"
"2646","      forth in Section 1.2(c), and deliver to the Target Fund the number of full"
"2647","      and fractional Acquiring Fund shares determined in the manner set forth in"
"2648","      Section 2."
"2649","            (b) The assets of the Target Fund to be transferred to the Acquiring"
"2650","      Fund shall consist of all assets and property, including, without"
"2651","      limitation, all cash, securities, commodities and futures interests,"
"2652","      claims (whether absolute or contingent, known or unknown, accrued or"
"2653","      unaccrued and including, without limitation, any interest in pending or"
"2654","      future legal claims in connection with past or present portfolio holdings,"
"2655","      whether in the form of class action claims, opt-out or other direct"
"2656","      litigation claims, or regulator or government-established investor"
"2657","      recovery fund claims, and any and all resulting recoveries) and dividends"
"2658","      or interest receivable that are owned by the Target Fund and any deferred"
"2659","      or prepaid expenses shown as an asset on the books of the Target Fund on"
"2660","      the Closing Date, except for cash, bank deposits or cash equivalent"
"2661","      securities in an amount necessary to pay the estimated costs of"
"2662","      extinguishing any Excluded Liabilities (as defined in Section 1.2(c)) and"
"2663","      cash in an amount necessary to pay any distributions pursuant to Section"
"2664","      7.1(g) (collectively, Assets)."
"2665","            (c) The Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the liabilities of the"
"2666","      Target Fund, whether accrued or contingent, known or unknown, existing at"
"2667","      the Closing Date, except for the Target Fund's Excluded Liabilities (as"
"2668","      defined below), if any, pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, with"
"2669","      respect to each Target Fund separately, Liabilities). Each Target Fund"
"2670","      will use its best efforts to discharge all known Liabilities prior to or"
"2671","      at the Valuation Date (as defined in Section 2.1(a)) to the extent"
"2672","      possible and consistent with its own investment objectives and policies"
"2673","      and normal business operations. If prior to the Closing Date the Acquiring"
"2674","      Entity identifies a liability that the Acquiring Entity and the Target"
"2675","      Entity mutually agree should not be assumed by the Acquiring Fund, such"
"2676","      liability shall be excluded from the definition of Liabilities hereunder"
"2677","      and shall be listed on a Schedule of Excluded Liabilities to be signed by"
"2678","      the Acquiring Entity and the Target Entity at Closing and attached to this"
"2679","      Agreement as Schedule 1.2(c) (the Excluded Liabilities). The Assets"
"2680","      minus the Liabilities of a Target Fund shall be referred to herein as the"
"2681","      Target Fund's Net Assets."
"2682","            (d) As soon as is reasonably practicable after the Closing, the"
"2683","      Target Fund will distribute to its shareholders of record (Target Fund
      Shareholders) the shares of the Acquiring Fund of the corresponding class"
"2684","      received by the Target Fund pursuant to Section 1.2(a), as set forth in"
"2685","      Exhibit A, on a pro rata basis within that class, and without"
"2686","                                      -2-"
"2687","<PAGE>"
"2688","      further notice the outstanding shares of the Target Fund will be redeemed"
"2689","      and cancelled as permitted by its charter and applicable law, and the"
"2690","      Target Fund will as promptly as practicable completely liquidate and"
"2691","      dissolve. Such distribution and liquidation will be accomplished, with"
"2692","      respect to each class of the Target Fund's shares, by the transfer of the"
"2693","      Acquiring Fund shares of the corresponding class then credited to the"
"2694","      account of the Target Fund on the books of the Acquiring Fund to open"
"2695","      accounts on the share records of the Acquiring Fund in the names of the"
"2696","      Target Fund Shareholders of the class. The aggregate net asset value of"
"2697","      the Acquiring Fund shares to be so credited to the corresponding Target"
"2698","      Fund Shareholders shall be equal to the aggregate net asset value of the"
"2699","      corresponding Target Fund's shares owned by the Target Fund Shareholders"
"2700","      on the Valuation Date. The Acquiring Fund shall not issue certificates"
"2701","      representing shares in connection with such exchange."
"2702","            (e) Ownership of Acquiring Fund shares will be shown on its books,"
"2703","      as such are maintained by the Acquiring Fund's transfer agent."
"2704","2. VALUATION"
"2705","      2.1. With respect to each Reorganization:"
"2706","            (a) The value of the Target Fund's Assets shall be the value of such"
"2707","      Assets computed as of immediately after the close of regular trading on"
"2708","      the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which shall reflect the declaration"
"2709","      of any dividends, on the business day next preceding the Closing Date (the"
"2710","      Valuation Date), using the Target Fund's valuation procedures"
"2711","      established by the Target Entity's Board of Trustees, which shall be"
"2712","      provided to the Acquiring Fund prior to the Valuation Date."
"2713","            (b) The net asset value per share of each class of the Acquiring"
"2714","      Fund shares issued in connection with the Reorganization shall be the net"
"2715","      asset value per share of the corresponding class of the Target Fund as of"
"2716","      the close of business on the Valuation Date, provided that, if more than"
"2717","      one class of shares of the Target Fund is being exchanged for a single"
"2718","      class of shares of the Acquiring Fund, then the net asset value per share"
"2719","      of such class of shares of the Acquiring Fund issued in connection with"
"2720","      the Reorganization shall be the net asset value per share of the"
"2721","      corresponding class of the Target Fund having attributes most consistent"
"2722","      with the Acquiring Fund share class, as determined by the Acquiring Fund"
"2723","      (the Primary Share Class), or the net asset value of such other class of"
"2724","      shares of the Target Fund as the parties may mutually agree."
"2725","            (c) The number of shares issued of each class of the Acquiring Fund"
"2726","      (including fractional shares, if any, rounded to the nearest thousandth)"
"2727","      in exchange for the Target Fund's Net Assets shall equal the number of"
"2728","      shares of the corresponding class of the Target Fund outstanding as of the"
"2729","      Valuation Time, provided that if two or more classes of shares of the"
"2730","      Target Fund are exchanged for a single class of shares of the Acquiring"
"2731","      Fund, then the number of Acquiring Fund shares issued with respect to each"
"2732","      such Target Fund class, other than the Primary Share Class, shall equal"
"2733","      the quotient of the"
"2734","                                      -3-"
"2735","<PAGE>"
"2736","      net asset value of such class divided by the net asset value per share of"
"2737","      the Primary Share Class, all as of the Valuation Time."
"2738","            (d) All computations of value shall be made by the Target Fund's"
"2739","      designated recordkeeping agent using the valuation procedures described in"
"2740","      this Section 2 and shall be subject to review by the Acquiring Fund's"
"2741","      recordkeeping agent and, if requested by either the Target Entity or the"
"2742","      Acquiring Entity, by the independent registered public accountant of the"
"2743","      requesting party."
"2744","3. CLOSING AND CLOSING DATE"
"2745","      3.1. Each Reorganization shall close on June 1, 2010 or such other date as"
"2746","the parties may agree with respect to any or all Reorganizations (the Closing

"2749","Reorganization unless otherwise agreed to by the parties (the Closing Time)."
"2750","The Closing of each Reorganization shall be held in person, by facsimile, email"

"2766","      Custodian by wire transfer of federal funds or other appropriate means on"
"2767","      the Closing Date. If the Target Fund is unable to make such delivery on"
"2768","      the Closing Date in the manner contemplated by this Section for the reason"
"2769","      that any of such securities or other investments purchased prior to the"
"2770","      Closing Date have not yet been delivered to the Target Fund or its broker,"
"2771","      then the Acquiring Fund may, in its sole discretion, waive the delivery"
