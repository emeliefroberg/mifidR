"560","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"561","To the Shareholders of Zeo Strategic Income Fund"
"562","and Board of Trustees of Northern Lights Fund Trust"
"563","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"564","statements of Zeo Strategic Income Fund, a series of"
"565","shares of beneficial interest of Northern Lights Fund"
"566","Trust (the Fund), as of and for the period ended"
"567","April 30, 2012, in accordance with the standards of"
"568","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"569","States) (PCAOB), we considered its internal control"
"570","over financial reporting, including controls over"
"571","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"572","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"573","opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"574","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"575","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"576","of the Funds internal control over financial"
"577","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"578","The management of Northern Lights Fund Trust is"
"579","responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"580","effective internal control over financial reporting."
"581","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"582","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"583","expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"584","A companys internal control over financial"
"585","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"586","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"587","reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"588","for external purposes in accordance with accounting"
"589","principles generally accepted in the United States"
"590","of America (GAAP).  A companys internal control"
"591","over financial reporting includes those policies"
"592","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"593","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"594","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"595","of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"596","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"597","as necessary to permit preparation of the financial"
"598","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that"
"599","receipts and expenditures of the company are being"
"600","made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"601","management and trustees of the company; and (3)"
"602","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"603","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"604","use or disposition of a companys assets that could"
"605","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"606","Because of inherent limitations, internal control"
"607","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"608","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"609","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"610","the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"611","because of changes in conditions or that the degree"
"612","of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"613","deteriorate."
"614","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"615","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"616","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"617","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"618","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"619","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"620","or combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"621","control over financial reporting, such that there"
"622","is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"623","misstatement of the Funds annual or interim"
"624","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"625","detected on a timely basis."
"626","Our consideration of the Funds internal control"
"627","over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"628","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"629","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"630","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"631","standards established by the PCAOB.  However, we"
"632","noted no deficiencies in the internal control over"
"633","financial reporting and its operations, including"
"634","controls for safeguarding securities that we"
"635","consider to be material weaknesses, as defined"
"636","above, as of April 30, 2012."
"637","This report is intended solely for the information"
"638","and use of management, the shareholders of Zeo"
"639","Strategic Income Fund, the Board of Trustees of"
"640","Northern Lights Fund Trust and the Securities and"
"641","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"642","should not be used by anyone other than these"
"643","specified parties."
