"1021","Variable Funds, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1022","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Portfolio&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"1023","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1024","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"

"1028","of the Portfolio is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"1029","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"1030","A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability"
"1031","of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1032","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"1033","to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1034","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1035","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being"
"1036","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1037","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material"
"1038","effect on the financial statements.</P>"

"1040","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 2.1pt 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.5pt>Because"
"1041","of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"1042","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes"
"1043","in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"

"1046","in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"1047","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness"
"1048","is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1049","possibility that a material misstatement of the Portfolio&rsquo;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented"
"1050","or detected on a timely basis.</P>"
