"465","Shareholders and"

"467","The Saratoga"
"468","Advantage Trust"
"469","Goodyear, Arizona"
"470","In planning and"
"471","performing our audit of"
"472","the financial statements"
"473","of James Alpha"
"474","Yorkville MLP"
"475","Portfolio, a series of"
"476","shares of The Saratoga"
"477","Advantage Trust as of"
"478","and for the year ended"
"479","November 30, 2016, in"
"480","accordance with the"
"481","standards of the Public"
"482","Company Accounting"
"483","Oversight Board"
"484","(United States), we"
"485","considered their internal"
"486","control over financial"
"487","reporting, including"
"488","control activities for"
"489","safeguarding securities,"
"490","as a basis for designing"
"491","our auditing procedures"
"492","for the purpose of"
"493","expressing our opinion"
"494","on the financial"
"495","statements and to"
"496","comply with the"
"497","requirements of Form"
"498","N-SAR, but not for the"
"499","purpose of expressing"
"500","an opinion on the"
"501","effectiveness of the"
"502","Fund's internal control"
"503","over financial reporting."
"504","Accordingly, we"
"505","express no such"
"506","opinion."
"507","The management of the"
"508","Fund is responsible for"
"509","establishing and"
"510","maintaining effective"
"511","internal control over"
"512","financial reporting.   In"
"513","fulfilling this"
"514","responsibility, estimates"
"515","and judgments by"
"516","management are"
"517","required to assess the"
"518","expected benefits and"
"519","related costs of controls."
"520","A company's internal"
"521","control over financial"
"522","reporting is a process"
"523","designed to provide"
"524","reasonable assurance"
"525","regarding the reliability"
"526","of financial reporting"
"527","and the preparation of"
"528","financial statements for"
"529","external purposes in"
"530","accordance with"
"531","generally accepted"
"532","accounting principles."
"533","A company's internal"
"534","control over financial"
"535","reporting includes those"
"536","policies and procedures"
"537","that (1) pertain to the"
"538","maintenance of records"
"539","that, in reasonable"
"540","detail, accurately and"
"541","fairly reflect the"
"542","transactions and"
"543","dispositions of the"
"544","assets of the company;"
"545","(2) provide reasonable"
"546","assurance that"
"547","transactions are"
"548","recorded as necessary to"
"549","permit preparation of"
"550","financial statements in"
"551","accordance with"
"552","generally accepted"
"553","accounting principles,"
"554","and that receipts and"
"555","expenditures of the"
"556","company are being"
"557","made only in"
"558","accordance with"
"559","authorizations of"
"560","management and"
"561","directors of the"
"562","company; and (3)"
"563","provide reasonable"
"564","assurance regarding"
"565","prevention or timely"
"566","detection of"
"567","unauthorized"
"568","acquisition, use or"
"569","disposition of a"
"570","company's assets that"
"571","could have a material"
"572","effect on the financial"
"573","statements."
"574","Because of inherent"
"575","limitations, internal"
"576","control over financial"
"577","reporting may not"
"578","prevent or detect"
"579","misstatements.   Also,"
"580","projections of any"
"581","evaluation of"
"582","effectiveness to future"
"583","periods are subject to"
"584","the risk that controls"
"585","may become inadequate"
"586","because of changes in"
"587","conditions, or that the"
"588","degree of compliance"
"589","with the policies or"
"590","procedures may"
"591","deteriorate."
"592","A deficiency in internal"
"593","control over financial"
"594","reporting exists when"
"595","the design or operation"
"596","of a control does not"
"597","allow management or"
"598","employees, in the"
"599","normal course of"
"600","performing their"
"601","assigned functions, to"
"602","prevent or detect"
"603","misstatements on a"
"604","timely basis.   A"
"605","material weakness is a"
"606","deficiency, or"
"607","combination of"
"608","deficiencies, in internal"
"609","control over financial"
"610","reporting, such that"
"611","there is a reasonable"
"612","possibility that a"
"613","material misstatement"
"614","of the company's"
"615","annual or interim"
"616","financial statements will"
"617","not be prevented or"
"618","detected on a timely"
"619","basis."

"625","Our consideration of the"
"626","Fund's internal control"
"627","over financial reporting"
"628","was for the limited"
"629","purpose described in the"
"630","first paragraph and"
"631","would not necessarily"
"632","disclose all deficiencies"
"633","in internal control that"
"634","might be material"
"635","weaknesses under"
"636","standards established by"
"637","the Public Company"
"638","Accounting Oversight"
"639","Board (United States)."
"640","However, we noted no"
"641","deficiencies in the"
"642","Fund's internal control"
"643","over financial reporting"
"644","and its operation,"
"645","including controls for"
"646","safeguarding securities,"
"647","which we consider to be"
"648","material weaknesses, as"
"649","defined above, as of"
"650","November 30, 2016."
