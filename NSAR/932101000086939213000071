"948","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"949","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"950","Putnam Investment Funds:"
"951","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"952","of Putnam Multi-Cap Value Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year"
"953","ended April 30, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the"
"954","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"955","considered the Funds internal control over financial reporting,"
"956","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"957","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"958","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"959","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"960","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control"
"961","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"962","opinion."
"963","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"964","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"965","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"966","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"967","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"968","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"969","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"970","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"971","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"972","companys internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"973","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"974","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"975","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"976","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"977","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"978","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"979","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only"
"980","in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"981","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"982","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,"
"983","or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material"
"984","effect on the financial statements."
"985","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"986","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"987","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"988","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"989","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"990","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"991","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"992","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"993","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"994","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"995","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"996","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"997","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"998","material misstatement of a Funds annual or interim financial"
"999","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1000","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"1001","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1002","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1003","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1004","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1005","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"1006","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1007","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"1008","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"1009","April 30, 2013."
"1010","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1011","management and the Board of Trustees of Putnam Multi-Cap Value"
"1012","Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"1013","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"1014","specified parties."

"1079","Regulatory matters and litigation"
"1080","In late 2003 and 2004, Putnam Management settled charges brought"
"1081","by the SEC and the Massachusetts Securities"
"1082","Division in connection with excessive short-term trading in"
"1083","Putnam funds. In July 2011, the fund recorded a receivable"
"1084","of $162,416 related to restitution amounts in connection with a"
"1085","distribution plan approved by the SEC. This"
"1086","amount, which was received by the fund in December 2011, is"
"1087","reported as part of Increase in capital from settlement"
"1088","payments on the Statement of changes in net assets. These"

"1091","action lawsuits against Putnam Management and, in"
"1092","a limited number of cases, some Putnam funds. In May 2011, the"
"1093","fund received a payment of $4,860 related to the"

"1095","of Increase in capital from settlement payments on"

"1111","as of and for the year ended April 30, 2013, in accordance"
"1112","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1113","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds"
"1114","internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1115","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1116","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1117","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"1118","comply with the requirements of Form N SAR, but not for the"
"1119","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1120","Funds internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"1121","we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1122","Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"1123","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"1124","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1125","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1126","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"1127","benefits and related costs of controls.  A funds internal"
"1128","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1129","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1130","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1131","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1132","generally accepted accounting principles.  A funds internal"
"1133","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1134","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"1135","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"1136","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"1137","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"1138","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1139","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1140","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"1141","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1142","management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide"
"1143","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1144","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of"
"1145","a funds assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1146","financial statements."
"1147","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1148","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1149","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"1150","future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1151","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"1152","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1153","deteriorate."
"1154","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1155","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1156","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1157","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1158","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1159","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1160","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1161","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1162","Funds annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1163","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1164","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"1165","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"1166","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"1167","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting"
"1168","that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"1169","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1170","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"1171","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1172","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"1173","consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of"
"1174","April 30, 2013."
