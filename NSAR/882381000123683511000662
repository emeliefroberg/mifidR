"827","       If this Agreement becomes effective subsequent to the first day of"
"828","a month or shall terminate before the last day of a month, compensation for"
"829"," that part of the month this Agreement is in effect shall be prorated in a"
"830","manner consistent with the calculation of the fees as set forth in Schedule A."
"831","Subject to the provisions of paragraph 8 hereof, payment of the Adviser's"
"832","compensation for the preceding month shall be made as promptly as possible"
"833","after completion of the computation contemplated by paragraph 8 hereof."
"834","       8.	This section is applicable only to those Funds listed on"

"838","paragraph 7 hereof and the amounts payable by the Funds under the"
"839","Administration Agreement, for any fiscal year ending on a date on which this"
"840","Agreement is in effect, exceed the expense limitations applicable to a Fund"
"841","imposed by state securities laws or regulations thereunder, as such"
"842","limitations may be raised or lowered from time to time, the Adviser shall"
"843","reduce its advisory fee to the extent of such excess and, if required,"
"844","pursuant to any such laws or regulations, will reimburse a Fund for annual"
"845","operating expenses in excess of any expense limitation that may be"
"846","applicable; provided, however, there shall be excluded from such expenses"
"847","the amount of any interest, taxes, brokerage commissions and extraordinary"
"848","expenses (including but not limited to legal claims and liabilities and"
"849","litigation costs and any indemnification related thereto) paid or payable"
"850","by a Fund.  Such reduction, if any, shall be computed and accrued daily"
"851","(and in the case of the closed-end funds, weekly), shall be settled on a"
"852","monthly basis, and shall be based upon the expense limitation applicable"
"853","to a Fund as at the end of the last business day of the month.  Should two"
"854","or more such expense limitations be applicable as at the end of the last"
"855","business day of the month (and in the case of the closed-end funds, as at"
"856","the end of the last full week of the month), that expense limitation which"
"857","results in the largest reduction in the Adviser's fee shall be applicable."
"858","       9.	The Adviser will use its best efforts in the supervision"

"860","absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless"
"861","disregard of its obligations hereunder, the Adviser shall not be liable"
"862","to a Fund or any of its investors for any error of judgment or mistake of"
"863","law or for any act or omission by the Adviser or for any losses sustained"
"864","by a Fund or its investors."
"865","       10.	Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the"
"866","Adviser or any affiliated person of the Adviser from acting as investment"
"867","adviser or manager for any other person, firm or corporation and shall not"
"868","in any way bind or restrict the Adviser or any such affiliated person from"
"869","buying, selling or trading any securities or commodities for their own"
"870","accounts or for the account of others for whom they may be acting.  Nothing"
"871","in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any trustee/director,"
"872","officer or employee of the Adviser to engage in any other business or to"
"873","devote his or her time and attention in part to the management or other"
"874","aspects of any other business whether of a similar or dissimilar nature."
"875","       11.	This Agreement shall continue in effect with respect to each"
"876","Fund for a period of up to one year from the effective date hereof (except"
"877","with respect to any Fund added to Schedule A of this Agreement after the"
"878","date hereof, for an initial period of two years from the date that such"
"879","Fund is added) and thereafter provided such continuance is approved at least"
"880","annually by the vote of holders of a majority (as defined in the Act) of the"
"881","outstanding voting securities of each Fund or by the Board of"
"882","Trustees/Directors of such Fund; provided that in either event such"
"883","continuance is also approved annually by the vote of a majority of the"
"884","Trustees/Directors of such Fund who are not parties to this Agreement or"
"885","interested persons (as defined in the Act) of any such party, which vote"
"886","must be cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such"
"887","approval; provided, however, that (a) each Fund may, at any time and without"
"888","the payment of any penalty, terminate this Agreement upon thirty days' written"
"889","notice to the Adviser, either by majority vote of the Board of"
"890","Trustees/Directors of such Fund or by the vote of a majority of the"
"891","outstanding voting securities of such Fund; (b) this Agreement shall"
"892","immediately terminate in the event of its assignment (within the meaning of"
"893","the Act) unless such automatic termination shall be prevented by an exemptive"
"894","order of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (c) the Adviser may"
"895","terminate this Agreement without payment of penalty on thirty days' written"
"896","notice to such Fund.  Any notice under this Agreement shall be given in"
"897","writing, addressed and delivered, or mailed post-paid, to the other party at"
"898","the principal office of such party."
"899","       Any approval of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the"
"900","outstanding voting securities of any portfolio/series of a Fund shall be"
"901","effective to continue this Agreement with respect to such portfolio/series"
"902","notwithstanding (a) that this Agreement has not been approved by the holders"
"903","of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of any other"
"904","portfolio/series or (b) that this Agreement has not been approved by the"
"905","vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund of"
"906","which it is a portfolio/series unless such approval shall be required by"
"907","any other applicable law or otherwise."
"908","       12.	This Agreement may be amended by the parties without"
"909","the vote or consent of shareholders of a Fund to supply any omission,"
"910","to cure, correct or supplement any ambiguous, defective or inconsistent"
"911","provision hereof, or if they deem it necessary to conform this Agreement"
"912","to the requirements of applicable federal laws or regulations, but"
"913","neither the Funds nor the Adviser shall be liable for failing to do so."
"914","       13.	This Agreement shall be construed in accordance"
"915","with the law of the State of New York and the applicable provisions"
"916","of the Act.  To the extent the applicable law of the State of New"
"917","York, or any of the provisions herein, conflicts with the applicable"
"918","provisions of the Act, the latter shall control."
"919","       14.	With respect to those Funds that are Massachusetts"
"920","business trusts, the Declaration of Trust, together with all"
"921","amendments thereto establishing each Fund identified in Schedule A"

"924","provides that the name of such Funds refers to the Trustees under the"
"925","Declaration collectively as Trustees, but not as individuals or"
"926","personally; and no Trustee, shareholder, officer, employee or agent"
"927","of such Funds shall be held to any personal liability, nor shall"
"928","resort be had to their private property for the satisfaction of any"
"929","obligation or claim or otherwise, in connection with the affairs of"
"930","such Funds, but the Trust Estate only shall be liable."
"931","       15.	The Adviser and each Fund agree that the name Morgan"

"1765","<TEXT>"
"1766","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1767","To the Stockholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1768","Morgan Stanley Flexible Income Trust:"
"1769","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"1770","of Morgan Stanley Flexible Income Trust (the Fund) as of and"
"1771","for the year ended October 31, 2011, in accordance with the standards"
"1772","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"1773","we considered its internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1774","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1775","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1776","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1777","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"1778","of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"1779","we express no such opinion."
"1780","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1781","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1782","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"1783","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"1784","A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed"
"1785","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"1786","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1787","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's"
"1788","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1789","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1790","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1791","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"1792","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1793","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1794","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being"
"1795","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"1796","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"1797","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"1798","company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1799","statements."
"1800","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1801","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"1802","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1803","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"1804","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1805","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1806","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"1807","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1808","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1809","or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1810","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"1811","the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented"
"1812","or detected on a timely basis."
"1813","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"1814","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1815","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"1816","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1817","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1818","in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1819","including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"1820","material weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2011."
"1821","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"1822","the Board of Trustees of the Morgan Stanley Flexible Income Trust and the"
"1823","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not"
"1824","be used by anyone other than these specified parties."
