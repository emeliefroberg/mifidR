"10203","To the Shareholders and"
"10204","Board of Directors of"
"10205","Hartford Series Fund, Inc."
"10206","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Hartford Series Fund, Inc. (the Funds) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"10207","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A fund&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that recei"
"10208","pts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"10209","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"10210","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the fund&#146;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"10211","Our consideration of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of December 31, 2009."
"10212","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the Board of Directors of Hartford Series Fund, Inc. and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"10432","WHEREAS, the Adviser has agreed to furnish investment advisory services to the Company, an open-end management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act) and each Portfolio; and"

The Adviser shall, in all matters, give to the Company and its Board of Directors the benefit of its best judgment, effort, advice and recommendations and shall at all times conform to, and use its best efforts to enable the Company to conform to (i) the provisions of the 1940 Act and any rules or regulations thereunder, (ii) any other applicable provisions of state or federal law; (iii) the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company as amended from time to time; (iv) the policies and determinations of the Board of Directors of the Company; (v) the fundamental policies and investment restrictions of the Company and Portfolios as reflected "

Such sub-adviser or sub-advisers shall assume such responsibilities and obligations of the Adviser pursuant to this Investment Management Agreement as shall be delegated to the sub?adviser or sub-advisers, and the Adviser will supervise and oversee the activities of any such sub-adviser or sub-advisers.

Subject to and in accordance with any directions that the Board of Directors may issue from time to time the Adviser or the sub-adviser, if applicable, may also be authorized to effect individual securities transactions at commission rates in excess of the minimum commission rates available, if the Adviser or the sub-adviser, if applicable, determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage or research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the Adviser's or the sub-adviser's overall responsibilities with respect to a Portfolio and other advisory clients.  The execution of such transactions shall not be deemed to represent an unlawful act or breach of any duty created b"
"10452","y this Agreement or otherwise.  The Adviser or the sub-adviser will promptly communicate to the Board of Directors such information relating to portfolio transactions as the Board may reasonably request."
"10453","	6.	Expenses"

"10456","	7.	Compensation of the Adviser"
"10457","	As compensation for the services rendered by the Adviser, each Portfolio shall pay to the Adviser as promptly as possible after the last day of each month during the term of this Agreement, a fee accrued daily and paid monthly, as set forth in Schedule B to this Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time:"
"10458","	The Adviser, or an affiliate of the Adviser, may agree to subsidize any of the Portfolios to any level that the Adviser, or any such affiliate, may specify. Any such undertaking may be modified or discontinued at any time except to the extent the Adviser explicitly agrees to maintain such undertaking for a specified period."
"10459","	If it is necessary to calculate the fee for a period of time that is less than a month, then the fee shall be (i) calculated at the annual rates provided in Schedule B but prorated for the number of days elapsed in the month in question as a percentage of the total number of days in such month, (ii) based upon the average of the Portfolio's daily net asset value for the period in question, and (iii) paid within a reasonable time after the close of such period."
"10460","	8. 	Liability of the Adviser"
"10461","(a)	The Adviser shall not be liable for any loss or losses sustained by reason of any investment including the purchase, holding or sale of any security, or with respect to the administration of the Company, as long as the Adviser shall have acted in good faith and with due care; provided, however, that no provision in this Agreement shall be deemed to protect the Adviser against any liability to the Company or its shareholders by reason of its willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (or, alternatively, in respect of any Portfolio for which the sub-adviser at the time of such loss is Hartford Investment Management Company, its negligence) in the performance of its duties or by reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"10462","(b)	The rights of exculpation and indemnification are not to be construed so as to provide for exculpation or indemnification provided under 8(a) of any person for any liability (including liability under U.S. federal securities laws that, under certain circumstances, impose liability even on persons that act in good faith) to the extent (but only to the extent) that exculpation or indemnification would be in violation of applicable law, but will be construed so as to effectuate the applicable provisions of this section to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law."
"10463","	9.	Duration of Agreement"
"10464","(a)	This Agreement shall be effective on November 1, 2009.

"10466","(c) 	As used in this Agreement, the terms assignment, interested person and vote of majority of the Company's outstanding voting securities shall have the meanings set forth for such terms in the 1940 Act, as amended."
"10467","(d) 	Any notice under this Agreement shall be given in writing, addressed and delivered, or mailed postpaid, to the other party to this Agreement to whom such notice is to be given at such party's current address."
