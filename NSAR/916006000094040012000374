"3672","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"3673","To the Shareholders and Directors of Bridgeway Funds, Inc."
"3674","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"3675","statements of Aggressive Investors 1 Fund, Ultra-Small Company"
"3676","Fund, Ultra-Small Company Market Fund, Small-Cap Momentum"
"3677","Fund, Small-Cap Growth Fund, Small-Cap Value Fund, Large-Cap"
"3678","Growth Fund, Blue Chip 35 Index Fund, Managed Volatility Fund,"
"3679","Omni Tax-Managed Small-Cap Value Fund, and Omni Small-Cap"
"3680","Value Fund, each a series of Bridgeway Funds, Inc. (the"
"3681","Funds), as of June 30, 2012 and for the year or period then"
"3682","ended, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"3683","Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we"
"3684","considered their internal control over financial reporting,"
"3685","including control activities for safeguarding securities, as a"
"3686","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"3687","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"3688","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"3689","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"3690","Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"3691","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3692","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"3693","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"3694","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"3695","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"3696","benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"3697","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"3698","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"3699","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"3700","statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting"
"3701","principles generally accepted in the United States of America"
"3702","(GAAP). A company's internal control over financial"
"3703","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"3704","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"3705","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"3706","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"3707","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"3708","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"3709","accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"3710","the company are being made only in accordance with"
"3711","authorizations of management and directors of the company; and"
"3712","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"3713","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"3714","disposition of the company's assets that could have a material"
"3715","effect on the financial statements."
"3716","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over"
"3717","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"3718","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"3719","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3720","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"3721","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"3722","deteriorate."
"3723","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"3724","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"3725","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"3726","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3727","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"3728","deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control"
"3729","over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"3730","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds' annual"
"3731","or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"3732","detected on a timely basis."
"3733","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"3734","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"3735","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"3736","deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"3737","weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB."
"3738","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal"
"3739","control over financial reporting or its operations, including"
"3740","controls for safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"3741","material weakness as defined above as of June 30, 2012."
"3742","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"3743","management, shareholders and the Board of Directors of"
"3744","Bridgeway Funds, Inc., and the Securities and Exchange"
"3745","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"3746","anyone other than these specified parties."

"4381","Fund: Aggressive Investors 1 Fund (the Fund)"
"4382","Fund Inception Date: 08/05/1994"
"4383","Effective Date of Exhibit: 2/10/2012"
"4384","General Provisions"
"4385","The Fund's Advisory Fee will be accrued daily by the"
"4386","Fund's Accountants on the books of the Fund.  The"
"4387","Advisory Fee consists of a Base Advisory Fee that is"
"4388","subject to a Performance Adjustment, as described below."
"4389","Base Advisory Fee"
"4390","As compensation for services rendered and the charges and"
"4391","expenses assumed and to be paid by the Adviser, the Fund"
"4392","will pay the Adviser a Base Advisory Fee computed"
"4393","quarterly and accrued daily at the following annual rate"
"4394","(the Base Advisory Fee Rate):"
"4395","(1)  0.90% of the value of the Fund's average daily net"
"4396","assets up to $250,000,000;"
"4397","(2)  0.875% of the next $250,000,000 of such assets; and"
"4398","(3)  0.85% of such assets over $500,000,000."
"4399","(4)  0.80% of such assets over $1,000,000,000."
"4400","For purposes of calculating the Base Advisory Fee, the"
"4401","Fund's average daily net assets shall be computed by"
"4402","adding the Fund's total daily asset values less"
"4403","liabilities during the quarter and dividing the resulting"
"4404","total by the number of days in the quarter. The Fund's"
"4405","expenses and fees, including the Base Advisory Fee, will"
"4406","be accrued daily based on prior day net assets and taken"
"4407","into account in determining daily net asset value.  For"
"4408","any period less than a full calendar quarter, the Base"
"4409","Advisory Fee shall be prorated according to the"
"4410","proportion such period bears to a full calendar quarter."
"4411","Performance Period"
"4412","The Performance Period shall consist of the most recent"
"4413","five-year period ending on the last day of the quarter"
"4414","(March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31) that"
"4415","the New York Stock Exchange was open for trading.  For"
"4416","example, on December 15, 2002, the relevant five-year"
"4417","period would be from January 1, 1998 through December 31,"
"4418","2002."
"4419","Calculation of Average Net Assets"
"4420","Prior to quarter-end, an estimate of the assets (for"
"4421","purposes of calculating the performance fee) through the"
"4422","end of the quarter will be calculated based on the last"
"4423","day's net assets of the most recent month-end for the"
"4424","daily accrual amount.  Using the example in the paragraph"
"4425","above, the net assets used in the month of December 2002"
"4426","will be the last day's net assets of November 2002, until"
"4427","the end of the month at which time actual net assets will"
"4428","be used."
"4429","The Performance Adjustment Rate"
"4430","The Performance Adjustment Rate shall vary with the"
"4431","Fund's performance as compared to the performance of the"
"4432","Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index as"
"4433","published after the close of the market on the last day"
"4434","of the Performance Period (hereinafter Index or S&P
500 Index) with dividends reinvested and will range from"
"4435","an annual rate of -0.70% to +0.70%. The Performance"
"4436","Adjustment Rate will be calculated at an annualized rate"
"4437","of 4.67% of the cumulative difference between the"
"4438","performance of the Fund and that of the Index over the"
"4439","Performance Period, except that there will be no"
"4440","performance adjustment if the cumulative difference"
"4441","between the Fund's performance and that of the Index is"
"4442","less than or equal to 2.00% (over the Performance"
"4443","Period).  The factor of 4.67% assumes that the Adviser"
"4444","will achieve the maximum or minimum of the Performance"
"4445","Adjustment Rate with a cumulative total return difference"
"4446","between the Fund and the Index of plus or minus"
"4447","approximately 15% over the Performance Period (0.70%"
"4448","divided by 15.00% = 4.67%)."
"4449","For example; assume that the Fund had a cumulative total"
"4450","return of 27.63% for the five-year period through"
"4451","December 31, 2002.  During the same period, assume the"
"4452","Index with dividends reinvested had a cumulative total"
"4453","return of 21.21%.  Then the Performance Adjustment Rate"
"4454","would be 4.67% times the difference in returns, or 4.67%"
"4455","times (27.63% - 21.21%) = 0.30%."
"4456","Calculation of Performance"
"4457","The Fund's performance will be the cumulative percentage"
"4458","increase (or decrease) in its net asset value per share"
"4459","over the Performance Period and will be calculated as the"
"4460","sum of: (1) the change in the Fund's net asset value per"
"4461","share during such period and (2) the value per share of"
"4462","the Fund distributions from income or capital gains"
"4463","(long- or short-term) having an ex-dividend date"
"4464","occurring within the Performance Period and assumed to"
"4465","have been reinvested at the net asset value on ex-date."
"4466","Thus, the Fund's performance will be calculated in"
"4467","accordance with the SEC's standardized total return"
"4468","formula."
"4469","Performance Adjustment"
"4470","The Performance Adjustment to be paid to the Adviser will"
"4471","be accrued daily during the last quarter of the"
"4472","Performance Period and paid shortly after the last day of"
"4473","the Performance Period.  To determine the Performance"
"4474","Adjustment, the Performance Adjustment Rate shall be"
"4475","multiplied by the value of the Fund's average daily net"
"4476","assets in the most recent Performance Period."
"4477","The Fund's Accountants will calculate the Fund's"
"4478","performance adjustment after the end of each month to"
"4479","estimate the following month's daily accrual.  This"
"4480","accrual is also calculated by the Adviser.  Any"
"4481","differences are rectified and the accrual is adjusted by"
"4482","the Fund's Accountants.  The performance adjustment is"
"4483","paid based on the actual performance adjustment"
"4484","calculated shortly after the last day of the performance"
"4485","period rather than the amount accrued and any over or"
"4486","under accrual is accounted for in the following quarter."
"4487","Expenses in excess of any maximum expense limitation"
"4488","assumed by the Adviser, if any, shall not be included for"
"4489","the purpose of computing the daily net asset value of a"
"4490","Fund share."
"4491","The Base Fee will be accrued daily, as explained above,"
"4492","and will be paid monthly to the Adviser during the"
"4493","quarter.  However, in a period where a negative"
"4494","Performance Adjustment is applied, the Base Fee paid to"
"4495","the Adviser shall be the Base Fee adjusted for the"
"4496","negative Performance Adjustment."
"4497","Continuing with the example above, the adjusted Advisory"
"4498","Fee applied to the period of time from October 1, 2002,"
"4499","through December 31, 2002, would be a Base Advisory Fee"
"4500","equal to an annualized rate of 0.90% (the Base Advisory"
"4501","Fee Rate) times the value of the Fund's average daily net"
"4502","assets in the calendar quarter plus a Performance"
"4503","Adjustment equal to an annualized rate of 0.30% (the"
"4504","Performance Adjustment Rate) times the value of the"
"4505","Fund's average daily net assets in the Performance"
"4506","Period."
"4507","Fund Expenses & Limitations"
"4508","Fund expenses for the existing class of shares shall in"
"4509","no case exceed the maximum annual operating expense"
"4510","limitation of 1.75% of the value of its average net"
"4511","assets for the fiscal year."
"4512","The Adviser will waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses, if"
"4513","necessary, to ensure the Fund's expense ratio does not"
"4514","exceed the maximum operating expense limitation for the"
"4515","fiscal year."
"4516","New classes of shares of the Fund may carry a different"
"4517","operating expense limitation."

"4529","General Provisions"
"4530","The Fund's Advisory Fee will be accrued daily by the"
"4531","Fund's Accountants on the books of the Fund."
"4532","Advisory Fee"
"4533","As compensation for services rendered, the Fund will pay"
"4534","the Adviser an Advisory Fee accrued daily and payable"
"4535","monthly at the following annual rate:"
"4536","(1)  0.90% of the value of the Fund's average daily"
"4537","net assets up to $250,000,000;"
"4538","(2)  0.875% of the next $250,000,000 of such assets; and"
"4539","(3)  0.85% of such assets over $500,000,000."
"4540","However, during the period that the Ultra-Small Company"
"4541","Fund's net assets range from $27,500,000 to $55,000,000"
"4542","the Advisory Fee will be paid as if the Fund had"
"4543","$55,000,000 under management (that is, $55 million times"
"4544","0.009 equals $495,000). This is limited to a maximum"
"4545","annualized expense ratio of 1.49% of average net assets."
"4546","For purposes of calculating the Advisory Fee each month,"
"4547","the Fund's average daily net asset value shall be"
"4548","computed by adding the Fund's total daily asset values"
"4549","less liabilities, for the month and dividing the"
"4550","resulting total by the number of days in the month. The"
"4551","Fund's expenses and fees, including the Advisory Fee,"
"4552","will be accrued daily based on prior day net assets and"
"4553","taken into account in determining daily net asset value."
"4554","For any period less than a full month, the Advisory Fee"
"4555","shall be prorated according to the proportion such period"
"4556","bears to a full month."
"4557","Fund Expenses & Limitations"
"4558","Fund expenses for the existing class of shares shall in"
"4559","no case exceed the maximum annual operating expense"
"4560","limitation of 1.85% of the value of its average net"
