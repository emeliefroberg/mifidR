"4634","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"4635","Accounting Firm"
"4636","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"4637","Hartford Series Fund, Inc."
"4638","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"4639","statements of Hartford Series Fund, Inc. (the"
"4640","Company) as of and for the year ended December"
"4641","31, 2017, in accordance with the standards of the"
"4642","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"4643","(United States), we considered the Company's"
"4644","internal control over financial reporting, including"
"4645","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"4646","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"4647","expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"4648","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"4649","SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"4650","opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's"
"4651","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"4652","we express no such opinion."
"4653","The management of the Company is responsible for"
"4654","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"4655","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"4656","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"4657","management are required to assess the expected"
"4658","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"4659","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"4660","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"4661","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"4662","preparation of financial statements for external"
"4663","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"4664","accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"4665","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"4666","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"4667","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"4668","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"4669","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"4670","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"4671","to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"4672","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"4673","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"4674","company are being made only in accordance with"
"4675","authorizations of management and directors of the"
"4676","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"4677","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"4678","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"4679","company's assets that could have a material effect on"
"4680","the financial statements."
"4681","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"4682","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"4683","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"4684","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"4685","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"4686","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"4687","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"4688","deteriorate."
"4689","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"4690","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"4691","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"4692","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"4693","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"4694","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"4695","a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"4696","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"4697","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"4698","company's annual or interim financial statements will"
"4699","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"4700","Our consideration of the Company's internal control"
"4701","over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"4702","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"4703","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"4704","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"4705","standards established by the Public Company"
"4706","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"4707","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Company's"
"4708","internal control over financial reporting and its"
"4709","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"4710","securities that we consider to be a material weakness"
"4711","as defined above as of December 31, 2017."
"4712","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"4713","use of management and the Board of Directors of"
"4714","Hartford Series Fund, Inc. and the Securities and"
"4715","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"

"5082","      3.	Brokerage.  The Sub-Adviser may"
"5083","place orders pursuant to its investment"
"5084","determinations for each Fund directly with the"
"5085","issuers of the securities, or with brokers or dealers"
"5086","selected by the Sub-Adviser. Neither the Sub-"
"5087","Adviser, nor any of its partners, members, directors,"
"5088","officers, or employees, as applicable, may act as"
"5089","principal or agent or receive any commissions in"
"5090","connection with the foregoing transactions.  The"
"5091","Sub-Adviser may, in respect of the Portfolio, open"
"5092","and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on"
"5093","behalf of and in the name of a Fund. The Sub-"
"5094","Adviser may enter into standard customer"
"5095","agreements with brokers and direct payments of"
"5096","cash, cash equivalents and securities and other"
"5097","property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-"
"5098","Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting"
"5099","brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf"
"5100","of a Fund, the Sub-Adviser shall seek best
execution.  In assessing best execution, the Sub-"
"5101","Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant,"
"5102","including, but not limited to, the breadth of the"
"5103","market in the security, the price of the security, the"
"5104","financial condition and execution capability of the"
"5105","broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the"
"5106","commission, if any, for the specific transaction and"
"5107","on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to"
"5108","execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the"
"5109","best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is"
"5110","authorized to consider the brokerage and research"
"5111","services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e)"
"5112","of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended"
"5113","(the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other"
"5114","accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates"
"5115","exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto"
"5116","acknowledge that it is desirable for the Company"
"5117","that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental"
"5118","investment and market research and security and"
"5119","economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who"
"5120","may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost"
"5121","to a Fund than may result when allocating brokerage"
"5122","to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most"
"5123","favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore,"
"5124","the Sub-Adviser may cause such Fund to pay a"
"5125","broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research"
"5126","services a higher commission than that which might"
"5127","be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the"
"5128","same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser"
"5129","determines in good faith that such commission is"
"5130","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage"
"5131","and research services provided by such broker-"
"5132","dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular"
"5133","transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-"
"5134","Adviser to such Fund in compliance with Section"
"5135","28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the"
"5136","services provided by such brokers may be useful to"
"5137","the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-"
"5138","Adviser's services to other clients.  The Sub-Adviser"
"5139","may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or"
"5140","bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for"
"5141","any Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i)"
"5142","such aggregation or bunching of orders is not"
"5143","inconsistent with such Fund's investment objectives,"
"5144","policies and procedures and (ii) the allocation of the"
"5145","securities so purchased or sold, as well as the"
"5146","allocation of expenses incurred in any such"
"5147","transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a"
"5148","manner that complies with the Sub-Adviser's trade"
"5149","allocation policies and procedures and is fair and"
"5150","equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is"
"5151","consistent with the Sub-Adviser's fiduciary"
"5152","obligations to such Fund and each of its other clients."
"5153","Broker or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser for the"
"5154","purchase and sale of securities or other investment"
"5155","instrument for the Fund may include brokers or"
"5156","dealers affiliated with the Sub-Adviser, provided"
"5157","such orders comply with Rule 17e-1 and Rule 10f-3"
"5158","under the 1940 Act and the Company's Rule 17e-1"
"5159","and Rule 10f-3 Procedures."
"5160","      4.	Books, Records and Regulatory"
"5161","Filings."
"5162","            (a)	The Sub-Adviser agrees to"
"5163","maintain and to preserve for the applicable periods"
"5164","any such records as are required to be maintained"
"5165","by the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund by the"
"5166","1940 Act and rules adopted thereunder, and by any"
"5167","other applicable laws, rules and regulations. The"
"5168","Sub-Adviser further agrees that all records that it"
"5169","maintains for the Funds are the property of the"
"5170","Funds and it will promptly surrender any of such"
"5171","records upon request; provided, however, that the"
"5172","Sub-Adviser may retain copies of such records for"
"5173","the applicable periods they are required by law to be"
"5174","retained, and thereafter shall make all reasonable"
"5175","efforts to destroy such records."
"5176","            (b)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that"
"5177","it shall furnish to regulatory authorities having the"
"5178","requisite authority any information or reports in"
"5179","connection with its services hereunder that may be"
"5180","requested in order to determine whether the"
"5181","operations of a Fund are being conducted in"
"5182","accordance with applicable laws, rules and"
"5183","regulations."
"5184","            (c)	The Sub-Adviser shall make"
"5185","all filings with the SEC required of it pursuant to"
"5186","Section 13 of the 1934 Act with respect to its duties"
"5187","as are set forth herein, provided however, that the"
"5188","Adviser shall make Form 13F notice filings and"
"5189","Schedule 13G filings in respect of the Portfolios as"
"5190","may be required by the Funds. The Sub-Adviser"
"5191","also shall make all required filings on Schedule 13D"

"5970","On February 25, 2011, Jennifer L. Kasilag, Louis Mellinger,"
"5971","Judith M. Menendez, Jacqueline M. Robinson, and Linda A."
"5972","Russell filed a derivative lawsuit against Hartford Investment"
"5973","Financial Services, LLC (HIFSCO) (now known as Hartford"
"5974","Funds Distributors, LLC) on behalf of six Hartford retail mutual"
"5975","funds in the United States District Court for the District of New"
"5976","Jersey, alleging that HIFSCO received excessive advisory and"
"5977","distribution fees in violation of its statutory fiduciary duty under"
"5978","Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act when serving as investment"
"5979","manager and principal underwriter, respectively, to the Hartford"
"5980","retail mutual funds. Although this action was purportedly filed"
"5981","on behalf of certain of the Hartford Funds, none of the Hartford"
"5982","Funds is itself a defendant to the suit. HIFSCO moved to dismiss"
"5983","and, in September 2011, the motion was granted in part and"
"5984","denied in part, with leave to amend the complaint. In November"
"5985","2011, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on behalf of certain"
"5986","Hartford retail mutual funds, The Hartford Global Health Fund"
"5987","(now known as The Hartford Healthcare Fund), The Hartford"
"5988","Conservative Allocation Fund, The Hartford Growth"
"5989","Opportunities Fund, The Hartford Inflation Plus Fund, The"
"5990","Hartford Advisers Fund (now known as The Hartford Balanced"
"5991","Fund), and The Hartford Capital Appreciation Fund. Plaintiffs"
"5992","seek to rescind the investment management agreements and"
"5993","distribution plans between HIFSCO and these funds and to"
"5994","recover the total fees charged thereunder or, in the alternative, to"
"5995","recover any improper compensation HIFSCO received, in"
"5996","addition to lost earnings. HIFSCO filed a partial motion to"
"5997","dismiss the amended complaint and, in December 2012, the"
"5998","court dismissed without prejudice the claims regarding"
"5999","distribution fees and denied the motion with respect to the"
"6000","advisory fees claims. In March 2014, the plaintiffs filed a new"
"6001","complaint that, among other things, added as new plaintiffs The"
"6002","Hartford Floating Rate Fund and The Hartford Small Company"
"6003","Fund and named as a defendant Hartford Funds Management"
"6004","Company, LLC (HFMC), which assumed the role as"
"6005","investment manager to the funds as of January 2013. In June"
"6006","2015, HFMC and HIFSCO moved for summary judgment, and"
"6007","plaintiffs cross-moved for partial summary judgment with"
"6008","respect to The Hartford Capital Appreciation Fund. In March"
"6009","2016, the court, in large part, denied summary judgment for all"
"6010","parties. The court granted judgment for HFMC and HIFSCO"
"6011","with respect to all claims made by The Hartford Small Company"
"6012","Fund and certain claims made by The Hartford Floating Rate"
"6013","Fund. The court further ruled that the appropriate measure of"
"6014","damages on the surviving claims is the difference, if any,"
"6015","between the actual advisory fees paid through trial and those that"
"6016","could have been paid under the applicable legal standard. A"
"6017","bench trial on the issue of liability was held in November 2016."
"6018","On February 28, 2017, the court granted judgment for HIFSCO"
"6019","and HFMC as to all claims. On March 23, 2017, plaintiffs"
"6020","appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third"
"6021","Circuit."
