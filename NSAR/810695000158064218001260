"820","Rational Dividend Capture"
"821","VA Fund (formerly,"

"846","Fund (the Funds), each"
"847","a series of the Mutual"
"848","Fund and Variable"
"849","Insurance Trust, as of and"
"850","for the year or period"
"851","ended December 31,"
"852","2017, in accordance with"
"853","the standards of the"
"854","Public Company"
"855","Accounting Oversight"
"856","Board (United States), we"
"857","considered the Funds'"
"858","internal control over"
"859","financial reporting,"
"860","including controls over"
"861","safeguarding securities, as"
"862","a basis for designing our"
"863","auditing procedures for"
"864","the purpose of expressing"
"865","our opinion on the"
"866","financial statements and"
"867","to comply with the"
"868","requirements of Form N-"
"869","SAR, but not for the"
"870","purpose of expressing an"
"871","opinion on the"
"872","effectiveness of the"
"873","Funds' internal control"
"874","over financial reporting."
"875","Accordingly, we express"
"876","no such opinion."
"877","The management of the"
"878","Funds are responsible for"
"879","establishing and"
"880","maintaining effective"
"881","internal control over"
"882","financial reporting.  In"
"883","fulfilling this"
"884","responsibility, estimates"
"885","and judgments by"
"886","management are required"
"887","to assess the expected"
"888","benefits and related costs"
"889","of controls.  A fund's"
"890","internal control over"
"891","financial reporting is a"
"892","process designed to"
"893","provide reasonable"
"894","assurance regarding the"
"895","reliability of financial"
"896","reporting and the"
"897","preparation of financial"
"898","statements for external"
"899","purposes in accordance"
"900","with generally accepted"
"901","accounting principles"
"902","(GAAP).  A fund's internal"
"903","control over financial"
"904","reporting includes those"
"905","policies and procedures"
"906","that (1) pertain to the"
"907","maintenance of records"
"908","that, in reasonable detail,"
"909","accurately and fairly"
"910","reflect the transactions"
"911","and dispositions of the"
"912","assets of the fund; (2)"
"913","provide reasonable"
"914","assurance that"
"915","transactions are recorded"
"916","as necessary to permit"
"917","preparation of financial"
"918","statements in accordance"
"919","with GAAP, and that"
"920","receipts and expenditures"
"921","of the fund are being"
"922","made only in accordance"
"923","with authorizations of"
"924","management and trustees"
"925","of the fund; and (3)"
"926","provide reasonable"
"927","assurance regarding"
"928","prevention or timely"
"929","detection of unauthorized"
"930","acquisition, use or"
"931","disposition of a fund's"
"932","assets that could have a"
"933","material effect on the"
"934","financial statements."
"935","Because of its inherent"
"936","limitations, internal"
"937","control over financial"
"938","reporting may not prevent"
"939","or detect misstatements."
"940","Also, projections of any"
"941","evaluation of"
"942","effectiveness to future"
"943","periods are subject to the"
"944","risk that controls may"
"945","become inadequate"
"946","because of changes in"
"947","conditions, or that the"
"948","degree of compliance"
"949","with the policies or"
"950","procedures may"
"951","deteriorate."
"952","A deficiency in internal"
"953","control over financial"
"954","reporting exists when the"
"955","design or operation of a"
"956","control does not allow"
"957","management or"
"958","employees, in the normal"
"959","course of performing their"
"960","assigned functions, to"
"961","prevent or detect"
"962","misstatements on a timely"
"963","basis.  A material"
"964","weakness is a deficiency,"
"965","or combination of"
"966","deficiencies, in internal"
"967","control over financial"
"968","reporting, such that there"
"969","is a reasonable possibility"
"970","that a material"
"971","misstatement of the"
"972","Funds' annual or interim"
"973","financial statements will"
"974","not be prevented or"
"975","detected on a timely"
"976","basis."
"977","Our consideration of the"
"978","Funds' internal control"
"979","over financial reporting"
"980","was for the limited"
"981","purpose described in the"
"982","first paragraph and would"
"983","not necessarily disclose all"
"984","deficiencies in internal"
"985","control that might be"
"986","material weaknesses"
"987","under standards"
"988","established by the Public"
"989","Company Accounting"
"990","Oversight Board (United"
"991","States).  However, we"
"992","noted no deficiencies in"
"993","the Funds' internal control"
"994","over financial reporting"
"995","and its operation,"
"996","including controls over"
"997","safeguarding securities"
"998","that we consider to be a"
"999","material weakness as"
"1000","defined above as of"
"1001","December 31, 2017."
"1002","This report is intended"
"1003","solely for the information"
"1004","and use of management"
"1005","and the Board of Trustees"
"1006","of the Funds and the"
"1007","Securities and Exchange"
"1008","Commission and is not"
"1009","intended to be and should"
"1010","not be used by anyone"
"1011","other than these specified"
"1012","parties."
