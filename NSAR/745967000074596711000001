"530","PROCEEDINGS"
"531","Since February 2004,"
"532","Federated and related"
"533","entities (collectively,"
"534","Federated) have been named"
"535","as"
"536","defendants in several"
"537","lawsuits that are now"
"538","pending in the United States"
"539","District Court for the Western"
"540","District of Pennsylvania."
"541","These lawsuits have been"

"545","one of the Federated-sponsored"
"546","mutual funds (Funds)."
"547","       Federated and its"
"548"," counsel have been defending"
"549","this litigation. Additional"

"551","similar allegations may be"
"552","filed in the future."
"553","The potential impact of these"

"556","fees and expenses, and future"
"557"," potential similar suits is"
"558","uncertain. Although"

"580","Report of"
"581"," Independent"
"582"," Registered"
"583","Public Accounting Firm"
"584","To the Shareholders"
"585","and Board of Trustees of"
"586","Federated High Yield"
"587"," Trust:"
"588","In planning and performing"
"589"," our audit of the financial"
"590","statements of Federated High Yield"
"591","Trust (the Fund) as of"
"592","and for the year ended"
"593","February 28, 2011, in"
"594","accordance with the"
"595","standards of the Public"
"596"," Company Accounting Oversight"
"597","Board (United States), we"
"598","considered the Fund's"
"599","internal control over"
"600","financial reporting,"
"601","including controls over"
"602","safeguarding securities,"
"603","as a basis for designing"
"604","our auditing procedures for"
"605","the purpose"
"606","of expressing our opinion"
"607","on the financial statements"
"608","and to comply with the"
"609","requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"610","but not for the purpose of"
"611","expressing an opinion on the"
"612","effectiveness of the Fund's"
"613","internal control over financial"
"614","reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"615","express no such opinion."
"616","The management of the Fund is"
"617"," responsible for establishing"
"618","and maintaining effective"
"619","internal control over financial"
"620","reporting. In fulfilling this"
"621","responsibility, estimates and"
"622","judgments by management are"
"623"," required to assess the"
"624"," expected benefits and related"
"625","costs"
"626","of controls. A company's"
"627","internal control over"
"628","financial reporting is a"
"629","process designed to"
"630","provide reasonable assurance"
"631","regarding the reliability of"
"632","financial reporting and the"
"633","preparation of financial"
"634","statements for external purposes"
"635","in accordance with generally"
"636","accepted accounting principles."
"637","A company's internal control over"
"638","financial reporting"
"639","includes those policies and"
"640","procedures that (1) pertain to"
"641","the maintenance of records that,"
"642","in reasonable detail, accurately"
"643","and fairly reflect the transactions"
"644","and dispositions of the"
"645","assets of the company; (2) provide"
"646","reasonable assurance that"
"647","transactions are recorded as"
"648","necessary to permit preparation of"
"649","financial statements in accordance"
"650","with generally"
"651","accepted accounting principles,"
"652","and that receipts and expenditures"
"653","of the company are"
"654","being made only in accordance with"
"655","authorizations of management and"
"656","directors of the"
"657","company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"658","assurance regarding prevention or"
"659","timely detection"
"660","of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"661","disposition of a company's assets"
"662","that could have a"
"663","material effect on the financial"
"664","statements."
"665","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"666","internal control over financial"
"667","reporting may not"
"668","prevent or detect misstatements."
"669"," Also,"
"670","projections of any evaluation of"
"671","effectiveness to"
"672","future periods are subject to the"
"673"," risk that controls may become"
"674","inadequate because of"
"675","changes in conditions, or that the"
"676","degree of compliance with the"
"677","policies or procedures"
"678","may deteriorate."
"679","A deficiency in internal control"
"680"," over financial reporting exists"
"681","when the design or"
"682","operation of a control does not"
"683","allow management or employees,"
"684","in the normal course of"
"685","performing their assigned functions,"
"686","to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"687","a timely basis."
"688","A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"689"," or a combination of deficiencies,"
"690","in internal control"
"691","over financial reporting, such that"
"692","there is a reasonable possibility"
"693","that a material"
"694","misstatement of the company's annual"
"695","or interim financial statements will"
"696"," not be"
"697","prevented or detected on a timely"
"698"," basis."
"699","Our consideration of the Fund's"
"700","internal control over financial"
"701","reporting was for the"
"702","limited purpose described in the"
"703"," first paragraph and would not"
"704","necessarily disclose all"
"705","deficiencies in internal control"
"706"," that might be material weaknesses"
"707","under standards"
"708","established by the Public Company"
"709","Accounting Oversight Board"
"710","(United States)."
"711","However, we noted no deficiencies"
"712","in the Fund's internal control over"
"713","financial reporting"
"714","and its operation, including controls"
"715","over safeguarding securities that"
"716","we consider to be a"
"717","material weakness as defined above"
"718","as of February 28, 2011."
"719","This report is intended solely"
"720","for the information and use of"
"721","management and the Board"
