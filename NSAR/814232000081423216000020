      		NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of
		the covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the
		parties hereto covenant and agree as follows:


1.	TRANSFER OF ASSETS OF THE ACQUIRED FUND IN EXCHANGE FOR
ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES AND THE ACQUIRING FUND SHARES AND
LIQUIDATION OF THE ACQUIRED FUND.

1.1.	Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and on the basis of
	the representations and warranties contained herein:

   (a)  The Acquired Fund will sell, assign, convey, transfer and
	deliver to the Acquiring Fund, and the Acquiring Fund will
	acquire, on the Closing Date, all of the properties and
	assets of the Acquired Fund as set forth in Section 1.2.

   (b)	In consideration therefor, the Acquiring Fund shall, on the
	Closing Date, (i) issue and deliver to the Acquired Fund,
	as applicable, shares of a corresponding class of the
	Acquiring Fund (including fractional shares of any),
	having a net asset value equal to the net asset
	value of, as applicable, the corresponding Acquiring Fund
	Class, computed in the manner and as of the time and date
	set forth in Section
	2.2., as follow:

	Acquired Fund Class         Acquiring Fund Class
		A			A
		C			C
		R			K
		Y			Y

	and and (ii) assume all of the liabilities of the Acquired
	Fund as of the Closing Date (as defined in Section 3.1).
	Such transactions shall take place at the closing provided
	for in Section 3 (the Closing).

   (c)	Upon consummation of the transactions described in subsections
	(a) and (b) above, the Acquired Fund in complete liquidation
	shall distribute to its shareholders of record as of the
	Closing Date the Acquiring Fund Shares received by it, each
	shareholder being entitled to receive that number of, as
	applicable, Class A Acquisition Shares, Class C Acquisition
	Shares, Class R Acquisition Shares or Class Y Acquisition
	Shares equal to the total of (i) the number of Class A,
	Class C, Class K or Class Y shares, as applicable, of the
	Acquired Fund (the Acquired Fund Shares) held by
	such shareholder divided by the number of such Class A,
	Class C, Class K shares or Class Y shares, as applicable, of
	the Acquired Fund outstanding on such date multiplied by (ii)
	the total number of Class A Acquisition Shares, Class C
	Acquisition Shares, Class R Acquisition Shares, or Class
	Y Acquisition Shares, as applicable, as of the Closing Date.


1.2.	The assets of the Acquired Fund to be acquired by the
Acquiring Fund shall consist of all cash, securities, dividends and
interest receivable, receivables for shares sold and all other
properties and assets which are owned by the Acquired Fund on the
Closing Date and any deferred expenses, other than any unamortized
organizational expenses, shown as an asset on the books of the
Acquired Fund on the Closing Date.

1.3.	As provided in Section 3.4, as soon after the Closing Date
as is conveniently practicable (the Liquidation Date), the
Acquired Fund will liquidate and distribute pro rata, as applicable,
to its Class A shareholders of record the Class A Acquisition Shares
received by the Acquired Fund as contemplated by Section 1.1; to its
Class C shareholders of record the Class C Acquisition Shares received
by the Acquired Fund as contemplated by Section 1.1; to its Class K
shareholders of record the Class R Acquisition Shares received by the
Acquired Fund as contemplated by Section 1.1.; and to its Class Y
shareholders of record the Class Y Acquisition Shares received by the
Acquired Fund as contemplated by Section 1.1.  Such liquidation and
distribution will be accomplished by the transfer of the Acquiring
Fund Shares then credited to the account of the Acquired Fund on the
books of the Acquiring Fund to open accounts on the share records of
the Acquiring Fund in the names of Acquired Fund shareholders and
representing the respective pro rata number of the Acquiring Fund
Shares due to such shareholders.  The Acquiring Fund shall not be
obligated to issue certificates representing the Acquiring Fund
Shares in connection with such exchange.

1.4.	With respect to the Acquiring Fund Shares distributable
pursuant to Section 1.3 to an Acquired Fund shareholder holding a
certificate or certificates for shares of the Acquired Fund, if any,
on the Valuation Date, the Acquiring Fund will not permit such
shareholder to receive Acquiring Fund Share certificates therefor,
exchange such Acquiring Fund Shares for shares of other series of
the Acquiring Trust, effect an account transfer of such Acquiring Fund
Shares, or pledge or redeem such Acquiring Fund Shares until the
Acquiring Fund has been notified by the Acquired Fund or its agent
that such Acquired Fund shareholder has surrendered all his or her
outstanding certificates for Acquired Fund Shares or, in the event of
lost certificates, posted adequate bond.

1.5.	As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the Acquired
Fund shall make all filings and take all other steps as shall be
necessary and proper to effect its complete liquidation.  As promptly
as practicable after the liquidation of the Acquired Fund and the
liquidation of all other outstanding series of shares of the Acquired
Trust, the Acquired Trust shall be dissolved pursuant to the provisions
of the Acquired Trust's Declaration of Trust and Bylaws, as amended,
and applicable law, and its legal existence terminated.  Any reporting
responsibility of the Acquired Fund is and shall remain the
responsibility of the Acquired Fund up to and including the Closing
Date and thereafter.

1.6.	Any and all obligations or liabilities arising under or in
respect of this Agreement shall be those of the Acquired Fund or the
Acquiring Fund, as the case may be, and shall not otherwise be
obligations or liabilities of the Acquired Trust or the Acquiring
Trust, and, for clarity, under no circumstances will any other series
of the Acquired Trust or the Acquiring Trust have any obligation or
liability under or in respect of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

2.	VALUATION.

2.1.	On the Closing Date, the Acquiring Fund will deliver to
the Acquired Fund a number of, as applicable, Class A Acquisition
Shares, Class C Acquisition Shares, Class R Acquisition Shares and
Class Y Acquisition Shares (including fractional shares, if any)
having a net asset value equal to the value of the assets acquired
by the Acquiring Fund on the Closing Date attributable to, as
applicable, the Class A, Class C, Class K and Class Y shares,
respectively, of the Acquired Fund, less the value of the
liabilities of the Acquired Fund attributable to, as applicable,
the Class A, Class C, Class K shares and Class Y shares,
respectively, of the Acquired Fund, determined as hereafter
provided in this Section 2.

2.2.	The value of the Acquired Fund's net assets will be computed
as of the Valuation Date using the valuation procedures for the
Acquiring Fund set forth in the Acquiring Trust's currently-effective
Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the Acquiring Trust's Trust"
"7837","Instrument) and the Acquiring Fund's then current prospectus or
prospectuses and statement of additional information (collectively,
as amended or supplemented from time to time, the Acquiring Fund"
"7838","Prospectus).

2.3.	The Valuation Date shall be 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on the
Closing Date, or such other date and time as may be mutually agreed
upon in writing by the parties hereto (the Valuation Date).

2.4.	The Acquiring Fund shall issue the Acquiring Fund Shares
to the Acquired Fund on one share deposit receipt registered in
the name of the Acquired Fund.  The Acquired Fund shall distribute
in liquidation, as applicable, the Class A Acquisition Shares, Class
C Acquisition Shares, Class R Acquisition Shares and Class Y
Acquisition Shares received by it hereunder pro rata to, as
applicable, its Class A, Class C, Class K and Class Y shareholders,
respectively, by redelivering such share deposit receipt to the
Acquiring Trust's transfer agent which will as soon as practicable
set up open accounts for Acquired Fund shareholders in
accordance with written instructions furnished by the Acquired Fund.

2.5.	The Acquired Fund will pay or cause to be paid to the
Acquiring Fund any interest, cash or such dividends, rights and
other payments received by it on or after the Closing Date with
respect to the Investments and other properties and assets of the
Acquired Fund, whether accrued or contingent, received by it on or
after the Closing Date.  Any such distribution shall be deemed
included in the assets transferred to the Acquiring Fund at the
Closing Date and shall not be separately valued unless the securities
in respect of which such distribution is made shall have gone
ex-dividend prior to the Valuation Date, in which case any such
distribution which remains unpaid at the Closing Date shall be
included in the determination of the value of the assets of the
Acquired Fund acquired by the Acquiring Fund.

2.6.	All computations of value shall be made by the pricing
agent for the Acquiring Fund, in accordance with its regular
practice in pricing the shares and assets of the Acquiring Fund
using the valuation procedures set forth in the Acquiring Trust's
Trust Instrument and the Acquiring Fund Prospectus.

3.	CLOSING AND CLOSING DATE.

3.1.	The Closing Date shall be July 29, 2016, at such time after

held at the offices of Victory Capital or at such other place as
the parties may agree.

3.2.	The portfolio securities of the Acquired Fund shall be

and all the Acquired Fund's cash shall be delivered by the
Acquired Fund to the Custodian for the account of the Acquiring

The cash delivered shall be in the form of currency or certified
or official bank checks, payable to the order of State"
"7839","Street Bank and Trust Company custodian for [?] Fund.

3.3.	In the event that on the Valuation Date (a) the New York
Stock Exchange shall be closed to trading or trading thereon

Acquiring Fund is impracticable, the Closing Date shall be postponed
until the first business day after the day when trading shall have
been fully resumed and reporting shall have been restored; provided
that if trading shall not be fully resumed and reporting restored

may be terminated by the Acquiring Fund or the Acquired Fund upon
the giving of written notice to the other parties.

and the number of outstanding shares of the Acquired Fund owned by
each Acquired Fund shareholder, all as of the close of business on
the Valuation Date, certified by any duly elected officer of the
Acquired Trust on behalf of the Acquired Fund.  The Acquiring Fund
will provide to the Acquired Fund evidence reasonably satisfactory
to the Acquired Fund that the Acquiring Fund Shares issuable
pursuant to Section 1.1 have been credited to the Acquired Fund's
account on the books of the Acquiring Fund.  On the Liquidation
Date, the Acquiring Fund will provide to the Acquired Fund evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Acquired Fund that such Acquiring Fund
Shares have been credited pro rata to open accounts in the names of
Acquired Fund shareholders as provided in Section 1.3.

3.5.	At the Closing, each party shall deliver to the other such
bills of sale, instruments of assumption of liabilities, checks,

4.	REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

4.1.	Representations and Warranties of the Acquired Trust, on
behalf of the Acquired Fund.

The Acquired Trust, on behalf of the Acquired Fund, represents and
warrants the following to the Acquiring Fund as of the date hereof
and agrees to confirm the continuing accuracy and completeness in
all material respects of the following on the
Closing Date:

   (a)	The Acquired Trust is a business trust duly organized and
        validly existing under the laws of The Commonwealth of
        Massachusetts and has power to own all of its properties
        and assets and to carry out its obligations under this
        Agreement.  The Acquired Trust is not required to qualify as
        a foreign entity in any jurisdiction where it is not so
        qualified and the failure to so qualify would have a material
        adverse effect on the Acquired Fund.  The Acquired Fund has
        all necessary federal, state and local authorizations to
        carry on its business as now being conducted.

   (b)	The Acquired Trust is duly registered under the 1940 Act, as
        a management company of the open-end type, and such
        registration has not been revoked or rescinded and is in full
        force and effect, and the Acquired Fund is a separate series
        thereof duly designated in accordance with the applicable
        provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Acquired Trust,
        as amended, and the 1940 Act.

   (c)	The Acquired Fund is not in violation in any material respect
        of any provisions of the Acquired Trust's Declaration of Trust
        or Bylaws, each as amended, or any agreement, indenture,
        instrument, contract, lease or other undertaking to which the
        Acquired Fund is a party or by which the Acquired Fund or its
        assets are bound, and the execution, delivery and performance of
        this Agreement will not result in any such violation.

   (d)	The Acquired Fund's current prospectuses and statements of
        additional information (collectively, as amended or supplemented
        from time to time, the Acquired Fund Prospectus) conform in
        all material respects to the applicable requirements of the
        Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act), and the
        1940 Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and
        Exchange Commission (the Commission) thereunder and do not
        include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
        any material fact relating to either the Acquired Trust or the
        Acquired Fund required to be stated therein or necessary to make
	the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
	they were made, not misleading.

   (e)	At the Closing Date, the Acquired Fund will have good and
	marketable title to the Acquired Fund's assets to be transferred
	to the Acquiring Fund pursuant to Section 1.2.

   (f)	No material litigation, administrative or other proceedings or
	investigation is presently pending or, to the knowledge of the
	Acquired Trust or the Acquired Fund, threatened as to the
	Acquired Fund or any of its properties or assets or any
	person whom the Acquired Fund may be obligated to directly or
	indirectly indemnify in connection with such 	litigation,
	proceedings or investigation. Neither the Acquired Trust nor
	the Acquired Fund knows of any 	facts which might form the
	basis for the institution of such proceedings and neither the
	Acquired Trust nor the Acquired Fund is a party to or subject
	to the provisions of any order, decree or judgment of any
	court or governmental body, which materially and adversely
	affects its business or its ability to consummate the
	transactions contemplated hereby.

   (g)	The statements of assets and liabilities, statements of
	operations, statements of changes in net assets and
	schedules of portfolio investments (indicating their market
	values) of the Acquired Fund at, as of and for the
	fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, audited by
	PricewaterhouseCoopers, independent registered public
	accounting firm to the Acquired Fund, copies of which have
	been furnished to the Acquiring Fund, fairly reflect the
	financial condition and results of operations of the
	Acquired Fund as of such date and for the period then ended
	in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
	in the United States consistently applied, and the Acquired
	Fund has no known liabilities of a material amount,
	contingent or otherwise, other than those shown on the
	statements of assets and liabilities referred to above or
	those incurred in the ordinary course of its business since
	December 31, 2015.  Prior to the Closing Date, the Acquired
	Fund will endeavor to quantify and reflect on its statements
	of assets and liabilities all of its material known
	liabilities and will advise the Acquiring Fund of all material
	liabilities, contingent or otherwise, incurred by it subsequent
	to December 31, 2015, whether or not incurred in the ordinary
	course of business.

   (h)	Since December 31, 2015, there has not been any material
	adverse change in the Acquired Fund's financial condition,
	assets, liabilities or business  (other than changes occurring
	in the ordinary course of business).

   (i)	As of the Closing Date, all federal and other tax returns and
	reports of the Acquired Fund required by law to have been
	filed by such date (giving effect to extensions) shall have
	been timely filed and were true, correct and complete in all
	material respects as of the time of their filing, and all
	taxes of the Acquired Fund which are due and payable shall
	have been timely paid.  The Acquired Fund is not liable for
	taxes of any person other than itself and is not a party to
	any tax sharing or allocation agreement. All of the Acquired
	Fund's tax liabilities will have been adequately provided
	for on its books.  To the best of the Acquired Trust's or the
	Acquired Fund's knowledge, the Acquired Fund has not had any
	tax deficiency or liability asserted against it or question
	with respect thereto raised, and it is not under audit by the
	Internal Revenue Service or by any state or local tax
	authority for taxes in excess of those already paid.

   (j)	The Acquired Fund has met the requirements of subchapter M of
	the Code for treatment as a regulated investment company
	within the meaning of Section 851 of the Code in respect of
	each taxable year since the commencement of operations, and
	will continue to meet such requirements at all times through
	the Closing Date treating the Closing Date as the close of
	its tax year if the year does not otherwise close on such
	date.  The Acquired Fund has not at any time since its
	inception been liable for nor is now liable for any material
	income or excise tax pursuant to Section 852 or 4982 of the
	Code.  There is no other tax liability (foreign, state, local)
	except as accrued on the Acquired Fund's books. The Acquired
	Fund has no earnings and profits accumulated with respect
	to any taxable year in which the provisions of Subchapter M
	of the Code did not apply.  The Acquired Fund will not be
	subject to corporate-level taxation on the sale of any assets
	currently held by it as a result of the application of Section
	337(d) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. All
	dividends paid by the Acquired Fund at any time prior to the
	Closing Date shall have been deductible pursuant to the
	dividends paid deduction under Section 562 of the Code.
	Except as otherwise disclosed in writing to the Acquiring Fund,
	the Acquired Fund is in compliance in all material
	respects with applicable regulations of the Internal Revenue
	Service pertaining to the reporting of dividends and other
	distributions on and redemptions of its capital stock and has
	withheld in respect of dividends and other distributions and
	paid to the proper taxing authority all taxes required to be
	withheld, and is not liable for any penalties which could be
	imposed thereunder.

   (k)	The Acquired Fund has not received written notification from
	any tax authority that asserts a position contrary to any of
	the above representations.

   (l)	The authorized capital of the Acquired Trust consists of an
	unlimited number of shares of beneficial interest, no par
	value, of such number of different series as the Board of
	Trustees of the Acquired Trust may authorize from time to
	time.  The outstanding shares of beneficial interest of the
	Acquired Fund are divided into, as applicable, Class A,
	Class C, Class K, and Class Y each having the
	characteristics described in the Acquired Fund Prospectus and
	will, at the time of the Closing Date, be held by the persons
	and in the amounts set forth in the records of the transfer
	agent as provided in Section 3.4.  All issued and outstanding
	shares of the Acquired Fund are, and at the Closing Date will
	be, duly and validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and
	non-assessable by the Acquired Fund (except as set forth in
	the Acquired Fund Prospectus), and will have been issued in
	compliance with all applicable registration or qualification
	requirements of federal and state securities laws.  No options,
	warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase, or
	securities convertible into, any shares of the Acquired Fund
	are outstanding.

   (m)	The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
	have been duly authorized by the Board of Trustees of the
	Acquired Trust and by all other necessary trust action on the
	part of the Acquired Trust and the Acquired Fund, other than
	shareholder approval as required by Section 8.1 hereof, and
	subject to such shareholder approval, this Agreement
	constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Acquired
	Trust and the Acquired Fund enforceable in accordance with its
	terms, except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy,
	insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the
	enforcement of creditors' rights generally and other equitable
	principles.

   (n)	The Acquiring Fund Shares to be issued to the Acquired Fund
	pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will not be acquired
	for the purpose of making any distribution thereof other than
	to Acquired Fund shareholders as provided in Section 1.1(c).

   (o)	The information relating to the Acquired Trust and the
	Acquired Fund furnished in writing by the Acquired Trust and
	the Acquired Fund to the Acquiring Trust for use in no-action
	letters, applications for orders, registration statements,

4.2.	Representations and Warranties of the Acquiring Trust and
the Acquiring Fund.

The Acquiring Trust, on behalf of the Acquiring Fund, represents and
warrants the following to the Acquired Fund as of the date hereof and
agrees to confirm the continuing accuracy and completeness in all
material respects of the following on the Closing Date:

   (a)	The Acquiring Trust is a statutory trust duly organized and
	validly existing under the laws of the state of Delaware and
	has power to own all of its properties and assets and to
	carry out its obligations under this Agreement. The Acquiring
	Trust is not required to qualify as a foreign entity in any
	jurisdiction where it is not so qualified and the failure so
	to qualify would have a material adverse effect on the
	Acquiring Fund.  The Acquiring Fund has all necessary federal,
	state and local authorizations to carry on its business as
	now being conducted.

   (b)	The Acquiring Trust is duly registered under the 1940 Act, as
	a management company of the open-end type, and such
	registration has not been revoked or rescinded and is in full
	force and effect, and the Acquiring Fund is a separate series
	thereof duly designated in accordance with the applicable
	provisions of the Acquiring Trust's Trust Instrument and the
	1940 Act.

   (c)	The Acquiring Fund is not in violation in any material respect
	of any provisions of the Acquiring Trust's Trust Instrument or
	Bylaws, each as amended, or any agreement, indenture,
	instrument, contract, lease or other undertaking to which the
	Acquiring Fund is a party or by which the Acquiring Fund or
	its assets are bound, and the execution, delivery and
	performance of this Agreement will not result in any such
	violation.

   (d)	As of the Closing Date, the Acquiring Fund Prospectus will
	conform in all material respects to the applicable
	requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act and the rules
	and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not
	include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
	state any material fact relating to the Acquiring Trust or
	the Acquiring Fund required to be stated therein or necessary
	to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
	under which they were made, not misleading.

   (e)	No material litigation, administrative or other proceedings
	or investigation is presently pending or, to the knowledge
	of the Acquiring Trust or the Acquiring Fund, threatened as
	to the Acquiring Fund or any of its properties or assets or
	any person whom the Acquiring Fund may be obligated to
	directly or indirectly indemnify in connection with such
	litigation, proceedings or investigation.  Neither the
	Acquiring Trust nor the Acquiring Fund knows of any facts
	which might form the basis for the institution of such
	proceedings and neither the Acquiring Trust nor the
	Acquiring Fund is a party to or subject to the provisions
	of any order, decree or judgment of any court or governmental
	body, which materially and adversely affects its business or
	its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
	hereby.

   (f)	The Acquiring Fund has not yet commenced investment
	operations and has no known liabilities of a material nature,
	contingent or otherwise.

   (g)	The Acquiring Fund was established in order to effect the
	transactions described in this Agreement, and, prior to the
	Closing Date, will not have carried on any business activities
	(other than such activities as are customary to the
	organization of a new series of a registered investment
	company prior to its commencement of operations).  It has not
	yet filed its first federal income tax return and, thus, has
	not yet elected to be treated as a regulated investment"
"7841","	company for federal income tax purposes.  However, upon filing
	its first federal income tax return following the completion of
	its first taxable year, the Acquiring Fund will elect to be a
	regulated investment company and until such time will take all
	steps necessary to ensure that it qualifies for treatment as a
	regulated investment company under Sections 851 and 852 of the
	Code.

   (h)	The authorized capital of the Acquiring Trust consists of an
	unlimited number of shares of beneficial interest, $0.001 par
	value, of such number of different series as the Board of
	Trustees of the Acquiring Trust may authorize from time to time.
	As of the date of this Agreement, the Acquiring Fund has no
	outstanding shares of any class.  As of the Closing Date, the
	outstanding shares of beneficial interest of the Acquiring Fund
	will be divided into, as applicable, Class A, Class C, Class R
	and Class Y shares, each having the characteristics
	described in the Acquiring Fund Prospectus.  No options,
	warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase, or
	securities convertible into, any shares of the Acquiring Fund
	are outstanding.

   (i)	The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement has
	been duly authorized by the Board of Trustees of the Acquiring
	Trust and by all other necessary trust action on the part of
	the Acquiring Trust and the Acquiring Fund, and constitute the
	valid and binding obligation of the Acquiring Trust and the
	Acquiring Fund enforceable in accordance with its terms,
	except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
	reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement
	of creditors'rights generally and other equitable principles.

   (j)	The Acquiring Fund Shares to be issued and delivered to the
	Acquired Fund pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will at
	the Closing Date have been duly authorized and, when so issued
	and delivered, will be duly and validly issued, as applicable,
	Class A, Class C, Class R and Class Y shares of beneficial
	interest in the Acquiring Fund, and will be fully paid and
	non-assessable (except as set forth in the Acquiring Fund
	Prospectus) by the Acquiring Fund and will have
	been issued in compliance with all applicable registration or
	qualification requirements of federal and state securities laws,
	and no shareholder of the Acquiring Fund will have any
	preemptive right of subscription or purchase in respect thereof.

   (k)	The information furnished by the Acquiring Trust and the
	Acquiring Fund for use in no-action letters, applications for
	orders, registration statements, proxy materials and other
	documents that may be necessary in connection with the
	transactions contemplated hereby is and will be accurate and
	complete in all material respects and complies in all material
	respects with federal securities laws and regulations thereunder
	applicable thereto.

   (l)	As of the effective date of the Registration Statement, the
	date of the meeting of shareholders of the Acquired Fund and
	the Closing Date, the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, including
	the documents contained or incorporated therein by reference,
	insofar as it relates to the Acquiring Trust and the Acquiring
	Fund, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
	or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
	or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
	circumstances under which such statements were made, not
	misleading.

   (m)	There are no material contracts outstanding to which the
	Acquiring Fund is a party, other than as disclosed in the
	Acquiring Fund Prospectus and the Registration Statement.

   (n)	The books and records of the Acquiring Fund made available
	to the Acquired Fund and/or its counsel are substantially
	true and correct and contain no material misstatements or
	omissions with respect to the operations of the Acquiring
	Fund.

   (o)	No consent, approval, authorization or order of any court
	or governmental authority is required for the consummation
	by the Acquiring Fund of the transactions contemplated by
	this Agreement, except such as may be required under the
	1933 Act, the 1934 Act, the 1940 Act, state securities

   (f)	No gain or loss will be recognized by Acquired Fund
	shareholders upon the exchange of all of their Acquired
	Fund Shares for the Acquiring Fund Shares.

   (g)	The aggregate tax basis of the Acquiring Fund Shares to
	be received by each shareholder of the Acquired Fund
	will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of Acquired
	Fund Shares exchanged therefor.

   (h)	An Acquired Fund shareholder's holding period for the
	Acquiring Fund Shares to be received will include the
