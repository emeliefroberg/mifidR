"444","Report of"
"445","Independent"
"446","Registered Public"
"447","Accounting Firm"
"448","To the Audit"
"449","Committee of the"
"450","Board of Trustees of"
"451","Redwood Managed"
"452","Volatility Portfolio"
"453","In planning and"
"454","performing our audit"
"455","of the financial"
"456","statements of"
"457","Redwood Managed"
"458","Volatility Portfolio"
"459","(the Company) as"
"460","of December 31,"
"461","2015 and for the year"
"462","then ended,  in"
"463","accordance  with  the"
"464","standards  of  the"
"465","Public  Company"
"466","Accounting"
"467","Oversight  Board"
"468","(United States), we"
"469","considered the"
"470","Company's internal"
"471","control over financial"
"472","reporting, including"
"473","controls over"
"474","safeguarding"
"475","securities, as a basis"
"476","for  designing our"
"477","auditing procedures"
"478","for the purpose of"
"479","expressing our"
"480","opinion on  the"
"481","financial statements"
"482","and to comply with"
"483","the requirements of"
"484","Form N-SAR, but"
"485","not  for  the  purpose"
"486","of expressing an"
"487","opinion on the"
"488","effectiveness of the"
"489","Company's internal"
"490","control  over"
"491","financial reporting."
"492","Accordingly, we"
"493","express no such"
"494","opinion."
"495","The  management  of"
"496","the  Company  is"
"497","responsible for"
"498","establishing and"
"499","maintaining effective"
"500","internal  control  over"
"501","financial  reporting."
"502","In fulfilling this"
"503","responsibility,"
"504","estimates and"
"505","judgments by"
"506","management are"
"507","required to assess the"
"508","expected benefits and"
"509","related costs of"
"510","controls. A"
"511","company's internal"
"512","control over financial"
"513","reporting  is  a"
"514","process  designed  to"
"515","provide reasonable"
"516","assurance regarding"
"517","the  reliability  of"
"518","financial  reporting"
"519","and  the  preparation"
"520","of financial"
"521","statements for"
"522","external purposes in"
"523","accordance with"
"524","generally accepted"
"525","accounting principles"
"526","(GAAP). A"
"527","company's internal"
"528","control over financial"
"529","reporting includes"
"530","those  policies  and"
"531","procedures that (1)"
"532","pertain to the"
"533","maintenance of"
"534","records   that,   in"
"535","reasonable  detail,"
"536","accurately  and  fairly"
"537","reflect  the"
"538","transactions  and"
"539","dispositions of the"
"540","assets of the"
"541","company; (2) provide"
"542","reasonable assurance"
"543","that  transactions are"
"544","recorded as necessary"
"545","to permit preparation"
"546","of financial"
"547","statements in"
"548","accordance with"
"549","GAAP, and that"
"550","receipts and"
"551","expenditures of  the"
"552","company are being"
"553","made only in"
"554","accordance with"
"555","authorizations of"
"556","management and"
"557","directors  of  the"
"558","company;  and  (3)"
"559","provide reasonable"
"560","assurance regarding"
"561","prevention  or  timely"
"562","detection of"
"563","unauthorized"
"564","acquisition, use or"
"565","disposition of  a"
"566","company's  assets"
"567","that  could  have  a"
"568","material  effect  on"
"569","the financial"
"570","statements."
"571","Because of its"
"572","inherent limitations,"
"573","internal control over"
"574","financial reporting"
"575","may not prevent or"
"576","detect misstatements."
"577","Also, projections of"
"578","any evaluation of"
"579","effectiveness to"
"580","future periods are"
"581","subject to the risk"
"582","that controls may"
"583","become inadequate"
"584","because of changes in"
"585","conditions, or that the"
"586","degree of compliance"
"587","with the policies or"
"588","procedures may"
"589","deteriorate."
"590","A deficiency in"
"591","internal control over"
"592","financial reporting"
"593","exists when the"
"594","design or  operation"
"595","of a control does not"
"596","allow management or"
"597","employees, in the"
"598","normal course   of"
"599","performing   their"
"600","assigned  functions,"
"601","to  prevent  or  detect"
"602","misstatements  on  a"
"603","timely  basis.  A"
"604","material weakness is"
"605","a deficiency, or"
"606","combination of"
"607","deficiencies, in"
"608","internal control over"
"609","financial reporting,"
"610","such that there is"
"611","reasonable possibility"
"612","that a material"
"613","misstatement of the"
"614","company's annual or"
"615","interim financial"
"616","statements will not be"
"617","prevented or detected"
"618","on a timely basis."
"619","Our  consideration"
"620","of  the Company's"
"621","internal control over"
"622","financial reporting"
"623","was for  the  limited"
"624","purpose  described"
"625","in  the  first"
"626","paragraph  and"
"627","would not necessarily"
"628","disclose all"
"629","deficiencies in"
"630","internal control that"
"631","might be material"
"632","weaknesses   under"
"633","standards  established"
"634","by  the  Public"
"635","Company"
"636","Accounting"
"637","Oversight Board"
"638","(United States)."
"639","However, we noted"
"640","no deficiencies in the"
"641","Company's internal"
"642","control over financial"
"643","reporting and its"
"644","operation, including"
"645","controls over"
"646","safeguarding"
"647","securities that we"
"648","consider to be a"
"649","material weakness as"
"650","defined above as of"
"651","December 31, 2015."
