"2361","Total Return Portfolio"
"2362","In planning and performing our audit of the consolidated"

"2364","(the Fund) (formerly AB Balanced Wealth Strategy), one of"
"2365","the series constituting The AB Portfolios, as of and for the year"
"2366","ended August 31, 2017, in accordance with the standards of the"
"2367","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"2368","we considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"2369","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"2370","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2371","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"2372","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2373","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"2374","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"2375","such opinion."
"2376","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"2377","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"2378","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"2379","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"2380","related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over financial"
"2381","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2382","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"2383","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"2384","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal"
"2385","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"2386","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"2387","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"2388","and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"2389","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2390","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"2391","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"2392","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"2393","authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3)"
"2394","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"2395","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"2396","fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2397","statements."
"2398","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2399","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"2400","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"2401","are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"2402","because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"2403","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2404","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2405","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"2406","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"2407","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"2408","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2409","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"2410","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"2411","material misstatement of the fund's annual or interim financial"
"2412","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2413","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"

"2416","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"2417","standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"2418","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"2419","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"

"2761","(the Strategy)"
"2762","The following changes in principal strategy, in substantially"
"2763","the following form, took effect on or about April 24, 2017:"
"2764","Change in Strategy Name"
"2765","The Strategy was renamed AB All Market Total Return Portfolio."
"2766","Changes in Principal Strategies"
"2767","The Adviser allocates the Fund's investments primarily among a"
"2768","number of asset classes, including equity securities, fixed-income"
"2769","securities, and a number of alternative asset classes and alternative"
"2770","investment strategies. The Fund pursues a global strategy,"
"2771","typically investing in securities of issuers located in the United"
"2772","States and in other countries throughout the world, including"
"2773","emerging market countries. Under normal circumstances, at least"
"2774","40% of the Fund's net assets will be invested in securities of non-"
"2775","U.S. issuers."
"2776","Equity securities will primarily be large-capitalization securities,"
"2777","but will include small- and mid-capitalization securities to a lesser"
"2778","extent, and will include derivatives related to equity securities. In"
"2779","selecting equity securities for the Fund, the Adviser will use"
"2780","fundamental and quantitative analysis with the goal of generating"
"2781","returns primarily from security selection rather than price"
"2782","movements in equity securities generally. Fixed-income securities"
"2783","include corporate and sovereign debt securities as well as interest"
"2784","rate derivatives and credit derivatives such as credit default swaps."
"2785","In selecting fixed-income securities for the Fund, the Adviser"
"2786","will attempt to take advantage of inefficiencies that it believes"
"2787","exist in the global fixed-income markets. These inefficiencies"
"2788","arise from investor behavior, market complexity, and the"
"2789","investment limitations to which investors are subject."
"2790","Alternative investments include various instruments the returns on"
"2791","which are expected to have low correlation with returns on equity"
"2792","and fixed-income securities, such as commodities and related"
"2793","derivatives, real  estate-related securities, and inflation-indexed"
"2794","securities. In order to gain exposure to certain alternative"
"2795","investment strategies using various asset classes, the Adviser"
"2796","intends to invest a portion of the Fund's assets in the AB All"
"2797","Market Alternative Return Portfolio, a registered investment"
"2798","company advised by the Adviser.The Adviser will adjust the"
"2799","Fund's asset class exposure utilizing both fundamental analysis and"
"2800","the Adviser's Dynamic Asset Allocation (DAA) approach."
"2801","DAA comprises a series of analytical and forecasting tools"
"2802","employed by the Adviser to gauge fluctuations in the risk/return"
"2803","profile of various asset classes. DAA seeks to adjust the"
"2804","Fund's investment exposure in changing market conditions and"
"2805","thereby reduce overall portfolio volatility by mitigating the"
"2806","effects of market fluctuations, while preserving consistent long-"
"2807","term return potential. For example, the Adviser may seek to"
"2808","reduce the Fund's risk exposure to one or more assets classes when"
"2809","DAA suggests that market risks relevant to those asset classes are"
"2810","rising but return opportunities are declining. In addition to merely"
"2811","increasing or decreasing asset class exposure by buying or selling"
"2812","securities of that asset class, the Adviser may pursue DAA"
"2813","implementation for the Fund by utilizing derivatives."
"2814","The Adviser intends to utilize a variety of derivatives in its"
"2815","management of the Fund. As noted above, the Adviser may use"
"2816","derivatives to gain exposure to various asset classes, and may cause"
"2817","the Fund to enter into derivatives in making the adjustments called"
"2818","for by DAA. As a result of the use of derivatives, the Fund will"
"2819","frequently be leveraged, with net investment exposure substantially"
"2820","in excess of net assets."
"2821","While the Fund may seek to gain exposure to physical"
"2822","commodities traded in the commodities markets through"
"2823","investments in a variety of derivative instruments, the Adviser"
"2824","expects that the Fund will seek to gain such exposure to"
"2825","commodities and commodities-related instruments and derivatives"
"2826","primarily through investments in AB All Market Total Return"
"2827","Portfolio (Cayman), Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the"
"2828","Fund organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the"
"2829","Subsidiary). The Subsidiary is advised by the Adviser and has"
"2830","the same investment objective and substantially similar investment"
"2831","policies and restrictions as the Fund except that the Subsidiary,"
"2832","unlike the Fund, may invest, without limitation, in commodities"
"2833","and commodities-related instruments. The Fund will be subject to"
"2834","the risks associated with the commodities, derivatives and other"
"2835","instruments in which the Subsidiary invests, to the extent of its"
"2836","investment in the Subsidiary. The Fund limits its investment in"
"2837","the Subsidiary to no more than 25% of its total assets. Investment"
"2838","in the Subsidiary is expected to provide the Fund with commodity"
"2839","exposure within the limitations of federal tax requirements that"
"2840","apply to the Fund."
"2841","Currency exchange rate fluctuations can have a dramatic impact"
"2842","on returns. The Fund's foreign currency exposures will come"
"2843","from investment in securities priced or denominated in foreign"
"2844","currencies and from direct holdings  in foreign currencies and"
"2845","currency-related derivatives. The Adviser may seek to hedge all"
"2846","or a portion of the currency exposure resulting from Fund"
"2847","investments or decide not to hedge this exposure. The Adviser"
"2848","may seek investment opportunities by taking long or short"
"2849","positions in currencies through the use of currency-related"
"2850","derivatives."

"2865","(the Fund)"
"2866","The following changes in principal strategy, in substantially the"
"2867","following form, took effect on or about July 10, 2017 (the"
"2868","Effective Date). In addition, in light of the then planned"
"2869","liquidation of AB Multi-Manager Alternative Strategies Fund,"
"2870","an affiliated mutual fund in which the Fund invested (the"
"2871","Underlying Portfolio), the Adviser redeemed the Fund's"
"2872","holdings in the Underlying Portfolio and invested the proceeds"
"2873","in certain other diversification investments in a manner"
"2874","consistent with the Fund's new principal strategies."
"2875","Changes in Principal Strategies"
"2876","The Adviser allocates the Fund's investments among a number"
"2877","of asset classes, including fixed-income securities, equity"
"2878","securities, and alternative asset classes and alternative investment"
"2879","strategies. The Fund seeks to have generally greater exposure to"
"2880","fixed-income securities than equity securities or alternative asset"
"2881","classes and alternative investment strategies. The Fund pursues a"
"2882","global strategy, typically investing in securities of issuers located"
"2883","in the United States and in other countries throughout the world,"
"2884","including emerging market countries. Investments will be made"
"2885","either directly or indirectly through underlying registered"
"2886","investment companies advised by the Adviser (each an"
"2887","Underlying Portfolio), although a majority of the Fund's assets"
"2888","are expected to be invested directly."
"2889","The Fund's investments in fixed-income securities may include"
"2890","corporate and sovereign debt securities as well as interest rate"
"2891","derivatives and credit derivatives such as credit default swaps. In"
"2892","selecting fixed-income securities for the Fund, the Adviser"
"2893","attempts to take advantage of inefficiencies that it believes exist in"
"2894","the global fixed-income markets. These inefficiencies arise from"
"2895","investor behavior, market complexity, and the investment"
"2896","limitations to which investors are subject. The Adviser intends to"
"2897","gain exposure to high-yield debt securities through investment in"
"2898","the AB High Income Fund, an Underlying Portfolio, and may, in"
"2899","the future, gain such exposure through direct investments in high-"
"2900","yield debt securities."
"2901","The Fund's investments in equity securities will consist primarily"
"2902","of securities of large-capitalization companies and derivatives"
"2903","related to such securities. In selecting equity securities for the Fund,"
"2904","the Adviser intends to use fundamental and quantitative analysis"
"2905","with the goal of generating returns primarily from security selection"
"2906","rather than price movements in equity securities generally."
"2907","The Fund may invest in alternative investments the returns on"
"2908","which are expected to have low correlation with returns on equity"
"2909","and fixed-income securities, such as commodities and related"
"2910","derivatives, real estate-related securities, and inflation-indexed"
"2911","securities. In order to gain exposure to certain alternative"
"2912","investment strategies using various asset classes, the Adviser"
"2913","intends to invest a portion of the Fund's assets in the AB All"
"2914","Market Real Return Portfolio and the AB All Market"
"2915","Alternative Return Portfolio, each an Underlying Portfolio."
"2916","The Adviser seeks to adjust the Fund's asset class exposure"
"2917","utilizing both fundamental analysis and the Adviser's Dynamic"
"2918","Asset Allocation (DAA) approach. DAA comprises a series of"
"2919","analytical and forecasting tools employed by the Adviser to gauge"
"2920","fluctuations in the risk/return profile of various asset classes. DAA"
"2921","seeks to adjust the Fund's investment exposure in changing"
"2922","market conditions and thereby reduce overall portfolio volatility"
"2923","by mitigating the effects of market fluctuations, while preserving"
"2924","consistent long-term return potential. For example, the Adviser"
"2925","may seek to reduce the Fund's risk exposure to one or more assets"
"2926","classes when DAA suggests that market risks relevant to those asset"
"2927","classes are rising but return opportunities are declining. In addition"
"2928","to merely increasing or decreasing asset class exposure by buying"
"2929","or selling securities of that asset class, the Adviser may pursue"
"2930","DAA implementation for the Fund by utilizing derivatives."
"2931","The Adviser intends to utilize a variety of derivatives in its"

"2959","THE AB PORTFOLIOS"
"2960","-AB Wealth Appreciation Strategy"
"2961","(the Fund)"
"2962","The following change in principal strategy, in substantially the"
"2963","following form, took effect on or about July 10, 2017 (the"
"2964","Effective Date). In addition, in light of the then planned"
"2965","liquidation of AB Multi-Manager Alternative Strategies Fund,"
"2966","an affiliated mutual fund in which the Fund invested (the"
"2967","Underlying Portfolio), the Adviser redeemed the Fund's"
"2968","holdings in the Underlying Portfolio and invested the proceeds"
"2969","in a manner consistent with the Fund's new principal strategies."
"2970","Changes in Principal Strategies"
"2971","The Fund invests primarily in equity securities, either directly or"
"2972","through underlying investment companies advised by the Adviser"
"2973","(Underlying Portfolios). A majority of the Fund's assets are"
"2974","expected to be invested directly in U.S. large-cap equity"
"2975","securities, primarily common stocks, in accordance with the"
"2976","Adviser's U.S. Strategic Equities investment strategy (U.S.
Strategic Equities), as described below. In addition, the Fund seeks"
"2977","to achieve exposure to international large-cap equity securities"
"2978","through investments in the International Strategic Equities"
"2979","Portfolio of Bernstein Fund, Inc. (Bernstein International
Strategic Equities Portfolio) and the International Portfolio of"
"2980","Sanford C. Bernstein Fund, Inc. (SCB International Portfolio)."
"2981","The Fund also invests in other  Underlying Portfolios to efficiently"
"2982","gain exposure to certain other types of equity securities,"
"2983","including small- and mid-cap and emerging market equity"
"2984","securities. An Underlying Portfolio is selected based on the"
"2985","segment of the equity market to which the Underlying Portfolio"
"2986","provides exposure, its investment philosophy, and how it"
"2987","complements and diversifies the Fund's overall portfolio."
"2988","Under U.S. Strategic Equities, portfolio managers of the"
"2989","Adviser that specialize in various investment disciplines identify"
"2990","high-conviction large-cap equity securities based on their"
"2991","fundamental investment research for potential investment by the"
"2992","Fund. These securities are then assessed in terms of both this"
"2993","fundamental research and quantitative analysis in creating the"
"2994","Fund's portfolio. In applying the quantitative analysis, the"
"2995","Adviser considers a number of metrics that historically have"
"2996","provided some indication of favorable future returns, including"
"2997","metrics related to valuation, quality, investor behavior and"
"2998","corporate behavior."
"2999","Bernstein International Strategic Equities Portfolio and SCB"
"3000","International Portfolio focus on investing in non-U.S. large-cap"
"3001","and mid-cap equity securities. Bernstein International Strategic"
"3002","Equities Portfolio follows a strategy similar to U.S. Strategic"
"3003","Equities, but in the international context. In managing SCB"
"3004","International Portfolio, the Adviser selects stocks by drawing on"
"3005","the capabilities of its separate investment teams specializing in"
"3006","different investment disciplines, including value, growth, stability"
"3007","and others."
"3008","Fluctuations in currency exchange rates can have a dramatic"
"3009","impact on the returns of foreign equity securities. The Adviser"
"3010","may employ currency hedging strategies in the Fund or the"
"3011","Underlying Portfolios, including the use of currency-related"
"3012","derivatives, to seek to reduce currency risk in the Fund or the"
"3013","Underlying Portfolios, but it is not required to do so."
"3014","The Fund is managed without regard to tax considerations."
