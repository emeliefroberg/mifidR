"7079","Net investment income distributions and capital gains distributions are"
"7080","determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from"
"7081","accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  A"
"7082","fund is required to make distributions of any income and gains realized in"
"7083","the prior fiscal year.  If a fund has a net investment loss or realized"
"7084","losses in the current year, such distributions may be in excess of the"
"7085","Fund's cumulative income and/or gains.  However, a distribution in excess"
"7086","of net investment income or a distribution in excess of net realized gain is"
"7087","not a return of capital for tax purposes.  These differences are due to"
"7088","differing treatments for items such as deferral of wash sales, foreign currency"
"7089","transactions, net operating losses and capital loss carryovers.  Permanent"
"7090","items identified in the period ended September 30, 2010, have been reclassified"
"7091","among the components of net assets as follows:"
"7092","        Undistributed           Undistributed           Paid-In"

"8100","Janus Long/Short Fund"
"8101","New Policy:"
"8102","Under normal circumstances,  the Fund generally pursues its investment objective"
"8103","by  taking  both  long  and  short  positions  in domestic  and  foreign  equity"
"8104","securities,  including  those  in emerging markets,  and  exchange-traded  funds"
"8105","(ETFs)  that  invest  primarily  in equity securities.  The  Fund's  portfolio"
"8106","managers  believe  that  a  combination  of long and short positions may provide"
"8107","positive returns regardless of market conditions through a complete market cycle"
"8108","and may offer reduced risk. The Fund will generally buy long securities that the"
"8109","portfolio managers  believe  will  go up in price  and  will sell short ETFs and"
"8110","other equity securities  the portfolio  managers believe  will go down in price."
"8111","The  Fund may,  to  a  lesser  degree,  also  take  long  and short positions in"
"8112","instruments  that  provide additional  exposure to the equity markets, including"
"8113","options, futures, and other index-based instruments.  The Fund's investments may"
"8114","include holdings across different industries, sectors, and regions."
"8115","The  allocation  between long and short positions  is a result  of the portfolio"
"8116","managers'  strategic investment process.  The  Fund does not intend to be market"
"8117","neutral  and anticipates  that it will generally hold a higher percentage of its"
"8118","assets  in  long  positions  than short positions  (i.e.,  the Fund will be net
long).  The portfolio managers will manage the Fund's net exposure between long"
"8119","and  short positions  and will determine that  the Fund's allocation be modified"
"8120","based on certain factors, including changes in market conditions."
"8121","In choosing  long positions,  the Fund's  portfolio  managers  look at companies"
"8122","individually  to determine  if a company is an attractive investment opportunity"
"8123","and  if  it  is  consistent  with  the  Fund's  investment policies.  The Fund's"
"8124","portfolio  managers  emphasize  long  positions  in  companies  with  attractive"
"8125","price/free cash flow, which is the relationship between the price of a stock and"
"8126","the  company's  available cash from operations,  minus capital expenditures. The"
"8127","portfolio  managers  typically  seek  attractively  valued  companies  that  are"
"8128","improving their free cash flow and returns on  invested capital,  which also may"
"8129","include special  situations companies  that are experiencing  management changes"
"8130","and/or are currently out of favor."
"8131","The Fund's portfolio managers will generally target short positions in ETFs. The"
"8132","portfolio   managers   may  also  look  at  companies  with  unsustainable  cash"
"8133","generation,  poor capital structure,  returns  below their cost of capital,  and"
"8134","share  prices  that  reflect  unrealistic  expectations of the company's  future"
"8135","opportunities. The portfolio managers may deploy unique strategies when shorting"
"8136","ETFs and/or securities  to minimize risk.  For example,  some investments may be"
"8137","held  short  to  remove  some  of  the  market  risk  of  a  long position while"
"8138","accentuating the information advantage  the portfolio managers believe they have"
"8139","in a long position in the portfolio. The Fund may invest in or short any type of"
"8140","ETF."
"8141","The Fund intends to also write (sell)  covered call options on individual equity"
"8142","securities  held long in an effort  to generate income and to reduce the overall"
"8143","volatility of the Fund.  A call option is covered  when  the Fund either holds"
"8144","the security subject to the option or an option to purchase the same security at"
"8145","an exercise price equal to or less than the exercise price of  the covered  call"
"8146","option. When the Fund writes a covered call option, the Fund makes an obligation"
"8147","to  deliver  the  security  at  an  agreed-upon  strike  price  on  or  before a"
"8148","predetermined  date in  the future in return for a premium. Although not part of"
"8149","its primary investment strategy,  the Fund  may engage in other types of options"
"8150","transactions in order to achieve its investment objective."
"8151","In addition to taking short positions in ETFs, the Fund's portfolio managers may"
"8152","also  take short  positions  in other  equity  securities.  In  general, a short"
"8153","position  is one where the Fund  has sold at the current market price a security"
"8154","that it  does  not own  in anticipation of  a decline in the market value of the"
"8155","security.  To complete a short sale,  the Fund  must borrow the security to make"
"8156","delivery  to  the buyer.  The  Fund then  is  obligated to  replace the borrowed"
"8157","security  by  purchasing  the  security  at  the  market  price  at  the time of"
"8158","replacement.  The price at such time may be more or less than the price at which"
"8159","the security was sold by the Fund.  Until the borrowed security is replaced, the"
"8160","Fund is required to pay to the lender amounts equal to any dividends or interest"
"8161","that accrue during the period of the loan. To borrow the security, the Fund also"
"8162","may be required to pay a premium to the lender, which would increase the cost of"
"8163","the security sold. The proceeds of the short sale will be retained by the broker"
"8164","to the extent necessary to meet margin requirements, until the short position is"
"8165","closed."
"8166","Until the Fund closes its short position or  replaces the borrowed security, the"
"8167","Fund will designate liquid assets it owns  (other than the short  sale proceeds)"
"8168","as  segregated  assets  in an amount equal  to  its  obligation  to purchase the"
"8169","securities sold short,  as required under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as"
"8170","amended (the 1940 Act). The amount segregated in this manner will be increased"
"8171","or decreased each business day equal to the change in market value of the Fund's"
"8172","obligation to purchase the security sold short.  If the  lending broker requires"
"8173","the Fund to deposit collateral (in addition to the short sales proceeds that the"
"8174","broker holds during the period  of the short sale),  which may be as much as 50%"
"8175","of the value  of  the  securities  sold short,  the  amount  of  the  additional"
"8176","collateral  may be  deducted in  determining the amount of cash or liquid assets"
"8177","the Fund is required to segregate to cover the short sale obligation pursuant to"
"8178","the 1940 Act. The amount segregated must be unencumbered by any other obligation"
"8179","or claim other than the obligation that is being covered. The Fund believes that"
"8180"," short sale obligations that are covered, either by an offsetting asset or right"
"8181","(acquiring the security sold short or having an option to purchase the  security"
"8182","sold  short  at  exercise price  that covers  the obligation),  or by the Fund's"
"8183","segregated  asset  procedures  (or  a  combination  thereof),  are  not   senior"
"8184","securities  under  the  1940 Act  and  are not subject  to the Fund's  borrowing"
"8185","restrictions. This requirement to segregate assets limits the Fund's  leveraging"
"8186","of its investments and the related risk of losses from leveraging. The Fund also"
"8187","is  required  to pay the  lender of the  security any dividends or interest that"
"8188","accrues on a borrowed  security  during the period of the loan. Depending on the"
"8189","arrangements made with the broker or custodian,  the Fund may or may not receive"
"8190","any  payments  (including interest)  on  collateral  it  has  deposited with the"
"8191","broker."
"8192","The Fund  may borrow  money from  banks to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act,"
"8193","including for investment purposes.  Such  borrowings  may  be  on  a secured  or"
"8194","unsecured basis at fixed or variable rates of interest.  The  1940 Act  requires"
"8195","the  Fund  to maintain  continuous  asset  coverage  of not  less than 300% with"
"8196","respect  to all borrowings  that are considered  senior securities  (generally"
"8197","borrowings other than for temporary or emergency purposes). This allows the Fund"
"8198","to  borrow  from  banks  up to 1/3  of its  total assets  (including  the amount"
"8199","borrowed). If such asset coverage should decline to less than 300% due to market"
"8200","fluctuations or  other reasons,  the Fund may be required  to dispose of some of"
"8201","its portfolio holdings within three days in  order to reduce the Fund's debt and"
"8202","restore the 300% asset coverage, even though it  may be disadvantageous  from an"
"8203","investment standpoint to dispose of assets at that time. The Fund's  short sales"
"8204","and  related margin requirements  may reduce  the ability of the  Fund to borrow"
"8205","money."
"8206","The  Fund  may  invest  its  assets  in derivatives (by taking long and/or short"
"8207","positions).  The  Fund  may  use derivatives  for  different purposes, including"

"8399","1. The  following  replaces  the  corresponding  information  under   Principal

"8400","Principal Investment Strategies"
"8401","The Fund invests,  under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets in"
"8402","equity securities.  The  Fund normally invests  in a core group of 60-100 equity"
"8403","securities of  issuers  from different  countries  located throughout the world,"
"8404","excluding the United States.  The Fund may,  under unusual circumstances, invest"

"8408","The portfolio managers apply a bottom up approach in choosing investments.  In"

"8410","if  a  company is an attractive investment  opportunity  and if it is consistent"
"8411","with  the Fund's investment policies.  The  portfolio  managers normally seek to"
"8412","limit  any  sector exposure  and  country  exposure to  plus or minus 10% of the"
"8413","respective weighting of the Fund's primary benchmark index, currently the Morgan"
"8414","Stanley Capital International EAFE(R) Index."
"8415","The  Fund  may  invest its assets in  derivatives  (by taking  long and/or short"

"8419","Perkins Global Value Fund"
"8420","Effective  July 1, 2010,  the  first three paragraphs  of the  Fund's Principal
Investment Strategies  section in the Prospectus are replaced in their entirety"
"8421","as follows:"
"8422","The Fund  pursues its investment  objective  by  investing  primarily  in common"
"8423","stocks of companies of any size located throughout the world, including emerging"
"8424","markets.  The Fund normally invests in issuers from several different countries,"
"8425","which may include the United States.  The Fund may, under unusual circumstances,"
"8426","invest in a single country.  The Fund  may have significant exposure to emerging"
"8427","markets.  The  Fund  may  also  invest  in  U.S.  and  foreign  equity  and debt"
"8428","securities."
"8429","The  Fund focuses on companies that have  fallen out of favor with the market or"
"8430","that  appear to be temporarily  misunderstood by the investment community.  To a"
"8431","lesser  degree,  the Fund  also  invests in  companies  that demonstrate special"
"8432","situations or turnarounds,  meaning companies  that have experienced significant"
"8433","business problems but are believed to have favorable prospects for recovery. The"
"8434","Fund's portfolio manager generally looks for companies with:"
"8435","- - a low  price  relative  to  their  assets,  earnings,  cash flow,  or business"
"8436","franchise"
"8437","- - products and services that give them a competitive advantage"
"8438","- - quality balance sheets and strong management"
"8439","Janus Global Select Fund"
"8440","Effective  September 15, 2010,  the  following  replaces  in  its  entirety  the"
"8441","corresponding  information  under  Principal Investment Strategies in the Fund"
"8442","Summary section of the Prospectus:"
"8443","Principal Investment Strategies"
"8444","The Fund pursues its  investment objective  by normally investing primarily in a"
"8445","core group of 30-50 domestic and foreign common stocks selected for their growth"
"8446","potential and normally investing at least 40% of its net assets in securities of"
"8447","issuers  from  different countries  located throughout the world,  excluding the"
"8448","United States.  The Fund may invest in companies of any size located anywhere in"
"8449","the world,  from larger,  well-established companies to smaller, emerging growth"
"8450","companies.  The Fund  may also  invest in U.S.  and foreign debt securities. The"
"8451","Fund  may have significant exposure to  emerging markets.  As of March 31, 2010,"
"8452","the  Fund  held  stocks  of  55  companies.  Of  these  holdings,  30  comprised"
"8453","approximately 75.55% of  the  Fund's holdings.  Please refer to Availability of
Portfolio  Holdings Information  in the prospectus  to  learn how to access the"
"8454","most recent holdings information."
"8455","The portfolio manager applies a bottom up approach in choosing investments. In"
"8456","other words, the portfolio manager looks at companies one at a time to determine"
"8457","if  a company is  an attractive investment  opportunity  and if it is consistent"
"8458","with the Fund's investment policies."
"8459","The  Fund  may invest its  assets in  derivatives  (by taking  long and/or short"
"8460","positions).  The  Fund  may use  derivatives  for  different purposes, including"
"8461","hedging  (to  offset  risks associated with an investment, currency exposure, or"
"8462","market  conditions)  and  to earn income and enhance returns.  The Fund may also"
"8463","engage in short sales of stocks, structured notes, or other investments."
"8464","Janus Long/Short Fund"
"8465","Effective  November  15,  2010,  the  following  replaces in  its  entirety  the"
"8466","corresponding  information  under  Principal  Investment  Strategies  in   the"
"8467","Risk/Return Summary section of the Prospectus:"
"8468","Principal Investment Strategies"
"8469","Under normal circumstances,  the Fund generally pursues its investment objective"
"8470","by  taking  both  long  and  short  positions  in  domestic  and  foreign equity"
"8471","securities,  including  those in  emerging markets,  and  exchange-traded  funds"
"8472","(ETFs)  that  invest  primarily  in equity  securities.  The  Fund's portfolio"
"8473","managers  believe  that a  combination  of long  and short positions may provide"
"8474","positive returns regardless of market conditions through a complete market cycle"
"8475","and may offer reduced risk. The Fund will generally buy long securities that the"
"8476","portfolio  managers  believe will  go up in  price and will sell  short ETFs and"
"8477","other  equity  securities the portfolio managers  believe will go down in price."
"8478","The  Fund may,  to  a  lesser degree,  also  take  long  and  short positions in"
"8479","instruments  that  provide additional exposure  to the equity markets, including"
"8480","options,  futures, and other index-based instruments. The Fund's investments may"
"8481","include holdings across different industries, sectors, and regions."
"8482","The  allocation  between long and short  positions  is a result of the portfolio"
"8483","managers'  strategic investment process.  The Fund  does not intend to be market"
"8484","neutral and anticipates  that it will generally hold  a higher percentage of its"
"8485","assets  in  long positions  than  short positions  (i.e.,  the Fund will be net
long).  The portfolio managers will manage the Fund's net exposure between long"
"8486","and  short positions  and will determine that  the Fund's allocation be modified"
"8487","based on certain factors, including changes in market conditions."
"8488","In choosing  long  positions,  the Fund's  portfolio  managers look at companies"
"8489","individually  to determine if a  company is an attractive investment opportunity"
"8490","and  if  it is  consistent  with  the  Fund's  investment  policies.  The Fund's"
"8491","portfolio  managers  emphasize  long  positions  in  companies  with  attractive"
"8492","price/free cash flow, which is the relationship between the price of a stock and"
"8493","the company's  available  cash from operations,  minus capital expenditures. The"
"8494","portfolio  managers  typically  seek  attractively  valued  companies  that  are"
"8495","improving  their free cash flow and returns on invested capital,  which also may"
"8496","include special  situations companies  that are experiencing  management changes"
"8497","and/or are currently out of favor."
"8498","The Fund's portfolio managers will generally target short positions in ETFs. The"
"8499","portfolio  managers  may  also  look  at  companies   with  unsustainable   cash"
"8500","generation,  poor  capital structure,  returns  below their cost of capital, and"
"8501","share  prices  that  reflect unrealistic  expectations  of  the company's future"
"8502","opportunities. The portfolio managers may deploy unique strategies when shorting"
"8503","ETFs  and/or securities  to minimize risk.  For example, some investments may be"
"8504","held  short  to  remove  some  of  the  market  risk  of  a  long position while"
"8505","accentuating the information  advantage the portfolio managers believe they have"
"8506","in a long position in the portfolio. The Fund may invest in or short any type of"
"8507","ETF."
"8508","The Fund intends to also write (sell) covered call  options on individual equity"
"8509","securities held long in an effort to generate  income and to  reduce the overall"
"8510","volatility of the Fund.  A call option is  covered  when the Fund either holds"
"8511","the security subject to the option or an option to purchase the same security at"
"8512","an exercise price  equal to or less than the  exercise price of the covered call"
"8513","option. When the Fund writes a covered call option, the Fund makes an obligation"
"8514","to  deliver  the  security  at  an  agreed-upon  strike  price  on  or  before a"
"8515","predetermined date  in the future in return for a premium.  Although not part of"
"8516","its primary investment strategy,  the Fund may engage in other  types of options"
"8517","transactions in order to achieve its investment objective."
"8518","In addition to taking short positions in ETFs, the Fund's portfolio managers may"
"8519","also take short positions  in  other  equity  securities.  In general,  a  short"
"8520","position is  one where the Fund has  sold at the current market price a security"
"8521","that  it does not own  in anticipation  of a decline  in the market value of the"
"8522","security.  To complete a short sale,  the Fund must borrow the  security to make"
"8523","delivery to the buyer.  The Fund  then  is  obligated  to  replace  the borrowed"
"8524","security  by  purchasing  the  security  at  the  market  price  at  the time of"
"8525","replacement.  The price at such time may be more or less than the price at which"
"8526","the security was sold by the Fund.  Until the borrowed security is replaced, the"
"8527","Fund is required to pay to the lender amounts equal to any dividends or interest"
"8528","that accrue during the period of the loan. To borrow the security, the Fund also"
"8529","may be required to pay a premium to the lender, which would increase the cost of"
"8530","the security sold. The proceeds of the short sale will be retained by the broker"
"8531","to the extent necessary to meet margin requirements, until the short position is"
"8532","closed."
"8533","Until the Fund closes its short position  or replaces the borrowed security, the"
"8534","Fund will designate  liquid assets it  owns (other than the short sale proceeds)"
"8535","as  segregated  assets in  an amount  equal  to  its  obligation to purchase the"
"8536","securities sold short,  as required under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as"
"8537","amended (the 1940 Act). The amount segregated in this manner will be increased"
"8538","or decreased each business day equal to the change in market value of the Fund's"
"8539","obligation to purchase the  security sold short.  If the lending broker requires"
"8540","the Fund to deposit collateral (in addition to the short sales proceeds that the"
"8541","broker holds  during the period of the short sale),  which may be as much as 50%"
"8542","of  the value  of the  securities  sold short,  the  amount  of  the  additional"
"8543","collateral  may be deducted in  determining  the amount of cash or liquid assets"
"8544","the Fund is required to segregate to cover the short sale obligation pursuant to"
"8545","the 1940 Act. The amount segregated must be unencumbered by any other obligation"
"8546","or claim other than the obligation that is being covered. The Fund believes that"
"8547","short sale obligations that are covered,  either by an offsetting asset or right"
"8548","(acquiring the security sold short or having an option to purchase  the security"
"8549","sold  short  at exercise  price  that covers the obligation),  or  by the Fund's"
"8550","segregated  asset  procedures  (or  a  combination  thereof),   are  not  senior"
"8551","securities  under  the  1940 Act  and  are  not subject to the  Fund's borrowing"
"8552","restrictions.  This requirement to segregate assets limits the Fund's leveraging"
"8553","of its investments and the related risk of losses from leveraging. The Fund also"
"8554","is required  to pay the lender of  the  security  any dividends or interest that"
"8555","accrues  on  a borrowed security during the period of the loan. Depending on the"
"8556","arrangements made with the broker or custodian,  the Fund may or may not receive"
"8557","any  payments  (including  interest)  on  collateral  it has  deposited with the"
"8558","broker."
"8559","The Fund may  borrow money from banks  to the  extent permitted by the 1940 Act,"
"8560","including  for  investment purposes.  Such  borrowings  may  be  on a secured or"
"8561","unsecured  basis at fixed or variable  rates of interest.  The 1940 Act requires"
"8562","the  Fund to maintain  continuous  asset  coverage  of not  less  than 300% with"
"8563","respect  to  all borrowings  that  are considered senior securities (generally"
"8564","borrowings other than for temporary or emergency purposes). This allows the Fund"
"8565","to borrow  from  banks  up  to  1/3  of its  total  assets (including the amount"
"8566","borrowed). If such asset coverage should decline to less than 300% due to market"
"8567","fluctuations  or other reasons,  the Fund  may be required to dispose of some of"
"8568","its portfolio holdings  within three days in order to reduce the Fund's debt and"
"8569","restore the  300% asset coverage,  even though it may be disadvantageous from an"
"8570","investment standpoint  to dispose of assets at that time. The Fund's short sales"
"8571","and  related  margin  requirements may reduce the ability of  the Fund to borrow"
"8572","money."
"8573","The Fund  may  invest its assets  in derivatives  (by  taking  long and/or short"
"8574","positions).  The  Fund may  use  derivatives  for different purposes,  including"
"8575","hedging  (to offset risks  associated with an investment,  currency exposure, or"
"8576","market conditions) and to earn income and enhance returns."

"8585","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"8586","To the Trustees and Shareholders of Janus Investment Fund:"
"8587","In planning  and  performing  our audits of the  financial  statements  of Janus"
"8588","Investment Fund (hereinafter  referred to as the Funds) as of and for the year"
"8589","ended September 30, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"8590","Accounting  Oversight Board (United  States),  we considered the Funds' internal"
"8591","control  over  financial   reporting,   including   controls  over  safeguarding"
"8592","securities,  as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"8593","expressing  our  opinion  on the  financial  statements  and to comply  with the"
"8594","requirements of Form N-SAR,  but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"8595","the  effectiveness  of the Funds'  internal  control over  financial  reporting."
"8596","Accordingly,  we do not  express an opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Funds'"
"8597","internal control over financial reporting."
"8598","Management  of  the  Funds  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining"
"8599","effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.   In  fulfilling  this"
"8600","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"8601","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"8602","financial  reporting  is a process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance"
"8603","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"8604","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"8605","accounting  principles.  A funds'  internal  control  over  financial  reporting"
"8606","includes those policies and  procedures  that (1) pertain to the  maintenance of"
"8607","records  that,  in  reasonable   detail,   accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the"
"8608","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide  reasonable"
"8609","assurance that  transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of"
"8610","financial   statements  in  accordance   with  generally   accepted   accounting"
"8611","principles,  and that  receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"8612","in  accordance with authorizations  of management  and trustees of the fund; and"
"8613","(3)  provide  reasonable assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection of"
"8614","unauthorized acquisition,  use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"8615","a material effect on the financial statements."
"8616","Because of its inherent limitations,  internal control over  financial reporting"
"8617","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"8618","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"8619","inadequate  because  of changes in conditions,  or that the degree of compliance"
"8620","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"8621","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"8622","or operation of a control does not allow management or  employees, in the normal"
"8623","course   of   performing   their  assigned  functions,   to  prevent  or  detect"
"8624","misstatements  on  a  timely  basis.   A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"8625","combination of deficiencies,  in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"8626","that  there is a reasonable  possibility  that  a  material  misstatement of the"
"8627","Funds' annual or interim  financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"8628","on a timely basis."
"8629","Our  consideration of the Funds' internal  control over financial  reporting was"
"8630","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in the  first  paragraph  and  would  not"
"8631","necessarily  disclose  all  deficiencies  in  internal  control  over  financial"
"8632","reporting that might be material  weaknesses under standards  established by the"
"8633","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"8634","deficiencies  in the Funds'  internal  control over financial  reporting and its"
"8635","operation,  including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"8636","be material weaknesses as defined above as of September 30, 2010."
"8637","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"8638","Board of Trustees  of Janus  Investment  Fund and the  Securities  and  Exchange"
"8639","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
