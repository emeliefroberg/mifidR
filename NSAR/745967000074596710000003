"524","Report of Independent"
"525"," Registered Public"
"526"," Accounting Firm"
"527","To the Shareholders"
"528","and Board of Trustees of"
"529","Federated High Yield Trust:"
"530","In planning and performing"
"531","our audit of the financial"
"532","statements of Federated High Yield"
"533","Trust (the Fund) as of"
"534"," and for the year ended"
"535","February 28, 2010, in"
"536","accordance with the"
"537","standards of the Public"
"538"," Company Accounting Oversight"
"539","Board (United States), we"
"540","considered the Fund's internal"
"541"," control over financial"
"542"," reporting, including controls over"
"543","safeguarding securities, as"
"544"," a basis for designing our"
"545","auditing procedures for the purpose"
"546","of expressing our opinion"
"547","on the financial statements"
"548"," and to comply with the"
"549","requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"550"," but not for the purpose of"
"551"," expressing an opinion on the"
"552","effectiveness of the Fund's"
"553","internal control over"
"554"," financial reporting."
"555","Accordingly, we"
"556","express no such opinion."
"557","The management of the Fund"
"558","is responsible for establishing"
"559"," and maintaining effective"
"560","internal control over financial"
"561"," reporting. In fulfilling this"
"562"," responsibility, estimates and"
"563","judgments by management are"
"564","required to assess the"
"565","expected benefits and related costs"
"566","of controls. A company's"
"567","internal control over"
"568","financial reporting is a"
"569","process designed to"
"570","provide reasonable assurance"
"571"," regarding the reliability"
"572"," of financial reporting and the"
"573","preparation of financial"
"574","statements for external"
"575"," purposes in accordance"
"576"," with generally"
"577","accepted accounting principles."
"578"," A company's internal control"
"579"," over financial reporting"
"580","includes those policies and"
"581"," procedures that (1) pertain"
"582","to the maintenance of records"
"583"," that,"
"584","in reasonable detail, accurately"
"585"," and fairly reflect the"
"586","transactions and dispositions"
"587"," of the"
"588","assets of the company; (2)"
"589","provide reasonable assurance"
"590","that transactions are recorded as"
"591","necessary to permit preparation"
"592"," of financial statements"
"593","in accordance with generally"
"594","accepted accounting principles,"
"595"," and that receipts and"
"596"," expenditures of the company are"
"597","being made only in accordance"
"598","with authorizations of"
"599"," management and directors"
"600"," of the"
"601","company; and (3) provide"
"602","reasonable assurance"
"603","regarding prevention or"
"604","timely detection"
"605","of unauthorized acquisition,"
"606"," use or disposition of a"
"607"," company's assets that"
"608"," could have a"
"609","material effect on the"
"610","financial statements."
"611","Because of its inherent"
"612"," limitations, internal"
"613"," control over financial"
"614"," reporting may not"
"615","prevent or detect misstatements."
"616"," Also, projections of any"
"617","evaluation of effectiveness to"
"618","future periods are subject"
"619","to the risk that controls"
"620","may become inadequate"
"621","because of"
"622","changes in conditions, or"
"623","that the degree of compliance"
"624","with the policies or procedures"
"625","may deteriorate."
"626","A deficiency in internal"
"627","control over financial"
"628","reporting exists when the"
"629","design or"
"630","operation of a control does"
"631"," not allow management or"
"632","employees, in the normal"
"633","course of"
"634","performing their assigned"
"635","functions, to prevent or"
"636","detect misstatements on a"
"637","timely basis."
"638","A material weakness is a"
"639","deficiency, or a combination"
"640"," of deficiencies, in internal"
"641","control"
"642","over financial reporting,"
"643","such that there is a"
"644","reasonable possibility"
"645","that a material"
"646","misstatement of the company's"
"647"," annual or interim financial"
"648"," statements will not be"
"649","prevented or detected on a"
"650"," timely basis."
"651","Our consideration of the"
"652"," Fund's internal control"
"653","over financial reporting"
"654"," was for the"
"655","limited purpose described"
"656"," in the first paragraph"
"657","and would not necessarily"
"658","disclose all"
"659","deficiencies in internal"
"660","control that might be"
"661"," material weaknesses under standards"
"662","established by the Public"
"663","Company Accounting Oversight"
"664"," Board (United States)."
"665","However, we noted no"
"666","deficiencies in the Fund's"
"667"," internal control over"
"668"," financial reporting"
"669","and its operation, including"
"670","controls over safeguarding"
"671"," securities that we consider"
"672","to be a"
"673","material weakness as defined"
"674"," above as of February 28, 2010."
"675","This report is intended"
"676","solely for the information"
"677"," and use of management"
"678","and the Board"
"679","of Trustees of the Fund and"
"680","the Securities and Exchange"
"681","Commission and is not intended"

"696","SUB-ITEM 77-E   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"697","Since October 2003, Federated"
"698","and related entities"
"699","(collectively, Federated)"
"700"," and various Federated"
"701","funds (Funds) have been"
"702","named as defendants in"
"703","several class action lawsuits"
"704"," now pending in the United"
"705","States District Court for"
"706","the District of Maryland."
"707","The lawsuits were"
"708","purportedly filed on behalf"
"709","of people"
"710","who purchased, owned and/or"
"711","redeemed shares of"
"712"," Federated-sponsored"
"713"," mutual funds during specified"
"714","periods beginning November"
"715"," 1, 1998. The suits are"
"716","generally similar in"
"717","alleging that Federated engaged"
"718","in illegal and improper"
"719","trading practices"
"720"," including market timing"
"721"," and late trading in"
"722"," concert with certain"
"723","institutional traders,"
"724","which allegedly caused"
"725","financial injury to"
"726"," the mutual fund"
"727","shareholders. Federated"
"728","without admitting the"
"729","validity of any claim"
"730"," has reached a preliminary"
"731"," settlement with the"
"732","Plaintiffs in these"
"733","cases. Any settlement"
"734","would have to be"
"735","approved by the Court."
"736","     Federated entities"
"737"," have also been named"
"738","as defendants in several"
"739"," additional lawsuits"
"740","that are now"
"741","pending in the United"
"742","States District Court"
"743","for the Western District"
"744"," of Pennsylvania."
"745","These lawsuits have"
"746","been consolidated into"
"747"," a single action"
"748"," alleging excessive"
"749","advisory fees involving"
"750","another Federated Fund."
"751","     The Board of the"
"752"," Funds retained the"
"753"," law firm of Dickstein"
"754","Shapiro LLP to represent"
"755","the Funds in"
"756","each of the lawsuits"
"757"," described in the"
"758","preceding two paragraphs."
"759","Federated and the"
"760","Funds, and their"
"761","respective counsel,"
"762","have been defending"
"763","this litigation, and"
"764"," none of the Funds"
"765"," remains a defendant in"
"766","any of the lawsuits"
"767"," (though, the other"
"768","Fund noted above"
"769"," could potentially"
"770","receive a recovery"
"771","in the action"
"772","alleging excessive"
"773","advisory fees)."
"774","Additional lawsuits"
"775"," based upon similar"
"776","allegations may be"
"777","filed in the"
"778","future. The potential"
"779","impact of these lawsuits,"
"780","all of which seek monetary"
"781"," damages, attorneys' fees and"
"782","expenses, and future potential"
"783"," similar suits is uncertain."
"784","Although we do not believe"
"785","that these lawsuits"
"786","will have a material adverse"
"787"," effect on the Funds, there"
"788","can be no assurance that"
"789","these suits, ongoing"
"790","adverse publicity and/or"
"791"," other developments resulting"
"792","from the allegations in"
"793"," these matters will not result"
"794","in increased Fund redemptions,"
"795","reduced sales of Fund Shares"
"796"," or other adverse consequences"
"797"," for the"
"798","Funds."
