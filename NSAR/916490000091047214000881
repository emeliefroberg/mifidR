"744","fulfilling this"

"748","to assess the expected"
"749","benefits and related costs"

"752","financial reporting is a"
"753","process designed to"
"754","provide reasonable"
"755","assurance regarding the"
"756","reliability of financial"
"757","reporting and the"
"758","preparation of financial"
"759","statements for external"
"760","purposes in accordance"
"761","with generally accepted"
"762","accounting principles"
"763","(GAAP).  A funds"
"764","internal control over"
"765","financial reporting"
"766","includes those policies and"

"768","to the maintenance of"
"769","records that, in reasonable"
"770","detail, accurately and"
"771","fairly reflect the"

"777","as necessary to permit"

"780","with GAAP, and that"
"781","receipts and expenditures"
"782","of the fund are being made"
"783","only in accordance with"

"792","disposition of a funds"
"793","assets that could have a"
"794","material effect on the"

"796","Because of its inherent"
"797","limitations, internal"
"798","control over financial"
"799","reporting may not prevent"
"800","or detect misstatements."
"801","Also, projections of any"
"802","evaluation of effectiveness"
"803","to future periods are"
"804","subject to the risk that"
"805","controls may become"
"806","inadequate because of"
"807","changes in conditions, or"
"808","that the degree of"
"809","compliance with the"
"810","policies or procedures"
"811","may deteriorate."
"812","A deficiency in internal"
"813","control over financial"
"814","reporting exists when the"

"818","employees, in the normal"
"819","course of performing their"
"820","assigned functions, to"
"821","prevent or detect"
"822","misstatements on a timely"
"823","basis.  A material"
"824","weakness is a deficiency,"
"825","or a combination of"
"826","deficiencies, in internal"
"827","control over financial"
"828","reporting, such that there"
"829","is a reasonable possibility"
"830","that a material"
"831","misstatement of the"
"832","Funds annual or interim"
"833","financial statements will"
"834","not be prevented or"
"835","detected on a timely basis."
"836","Our consideration of the"
"837","Funds internal control"
"838","over financial reporting"
"839","was for the limited"
