"1991","<TEXT>"
"1992","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1993","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Wells Fargo Funds Trust:"
"1994","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"1995","the Wells Fargo Dow Jones Target Today Fund, Wells Fargo Dow Jones"
"1996","Target 2010 Fund, Wells Fargo Dow Jones Target 2015 Fund, Wells Fargo"
"1997","Dow Jones Target 2020 Fund, Wells Fargo Dow Jones Target 2025 Fund,"
"1998","Wells Fargo Dow Jones Target 2030 Fund, Wells Fargo Dow Jones Target"
"1999","2035 Fund, Wells Fargo Dow Jones Target 2040 Fund, Wells Fargo Dow"
"2000","Jones Target 2045 Fund, Wells Fargo Dow Jones Target 2050 Fund, Wells"
"2001","Fargo Dow Jones Target 2055 Fund, and Wells Fargo Dow Jones Target"
"2002","2060 Fund (collectively, the Funds), twelve of the funds constituting"
"2003","the Wells Fargo Funds Trust, as of and for the year ended February 28,"
"2004","2017, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"2005","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"2006","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"2007","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"2008","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"2009","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2010","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control"
"2011","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2012","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"2013","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"2014","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"2015","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's"
"2016","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"2017","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"2018","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"2019","with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A fund's internal"
"2020","control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"2021","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"2022","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"2023","of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"2024","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"2025","with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made"
"2026","only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"2027","fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"2028","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the fund's"
"2029","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2030","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2031","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"2032","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"2033","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"2034","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2035","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"2036","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"2037","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"2038","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"2039","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"2040","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"2041","misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not"
"2042","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2043","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"2044","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"2045","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"2046","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"2047","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"2048","in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"2049","including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"2050","material weakness as defined above as of February 28, 2017."
"2051","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"2052","the Board of Trustees of Wells Fargo Funds Trust and the Securities and"

"2308","banking laws and regulations."
"2309","In performing all Fund-level administrative services under"
"2310","this Section 2(b), the Manager shall: (a) act in conformity with the"
"2311","Trust's Declaration of Trust (and By-Laws, if any), the 1940 Act,"
"2312","and any other applicable laws as may be amended from time to"

"2326","all relevant rules thereunder. Manager will provide the Trust with"
"2327","a copy of each sub-administration agreement it executes relating to"
"2328","the Trust. Manager will be liable for acts or omissions of any such"
"2329","sub-administrators under the standards of care described herein"
"2330","under Section 11."
"2331","Section 3. Delivery of Documents to the Manager. The"
"2332","Trust has furnished the Manager with true, correct and complete"
"2333","copies of the following documents:"
"2334","(a) The Declaration of Trust, as in effect on the date hereof;"
"2335","(b) The Registration Statement filed with the Commission"
"2336","under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act; and"

"2342","shall furnish the Manager with any further documents, materials or"
"2343","information that the Manager may reasonably request in"
"2344","connection with the performance of its duties hereunder."
"2345","Section 4. Delegation of Responsibilities. The Manager"
"2346","may carry out any of its obligations under this Agreement (other"
"2347","than under Section 2(b) hereof) by employing, subject to"
"2348","supervision by the Manager, one or more Sub-Manager(s) who are"
"2349","registered as investment advisers pursuant to the Investment"
"2350","Advisers Act of 1940 (Sub-Advisers). Each Sub-Adviser's"
"2351","employment will be evidenced by a separate written agreement"
"2352","approved by the Board and, if required under the 1940 Act, by the"
"2353","shareholders of the Fund (unless the Commission or its staff has"
"2354","given authorization or issued an interpretation dispensing with the"
"2355","requirement of shareholder approval). The Manager shall not be"
"2356","liable hereunder for any act or omission of any Sub-Adviser,"
"2357","except for failure to exercise good faith in the employment of the"
"2358","Sub-Adviser and for failure to exercise appropriate supervision of"
"2359","such Sub-Adviser, and as may otherwise be agreed in writing. The"
"2360","Manager shall be solely responsible for compensating any Sub-"
"2361","Adviser for services rendered under any Sub-Advisory Agreement."
"2362","The Manager may, from time to time and at any time, terminate"
"2363","any Sub-Adviser and reassume the responsibilities assigned to such"
"2364","Sub-Adviser with respect to any Fund without obtaining the"
"2365","approval of the shareholders of the Fund."
"2366","Section 5. Control by Board. Any investment"
"2367","management activities undertaken by the Manager pursuant to this"
"2368","Agreement, as well as any other activities undertaken by the"
"2369","Manager on behalf of the Funds, shall at all times be subject to the"
"2370","direction and control of the Board."
"2371","Section 6. Compliance with Applicable Requirements."
"2372","In carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, the Manager"
"2373","shall at all times comply with:"
"2374","(a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"2375","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"2376","(b) the Registration Statement of the Trust, as it may be"
"2377","amended from time to time, filed with the Commission"
"2378","under the Securities Act and the 1940 Act;"
"2379","(c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it"
"2380","may be amended from time to time;"
"2381","(d) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"
"2382","amended, applicable to the Trust or the Funds, and any"
"2383","rules and regulations adopted thereunder; and"
"2384","(e) any other applicable provisions of state or federal law, and"
"2385","any rules and regulations adopted thereunder."
"2386","Section 7. Proxies. The Manager shall have responsibility"
"2387","to vote proxies solicited with respect to issuers of securities in"
"2388","which assets of the Funds are invested in accordance with the"
"2389","Trust's policies on proxy voting."
"2390","Section 8. Broker-Dealer Relationships. In connection"
"2391","with the purchase and sale of securities for the Funds, the Manager"
"2392","is responsible for broker-dealer selection and negotiation of"
"2393","brokerage commission rates. The Manager's primary"
"2394","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain"
"2395","the best price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to"
"2396","execute each particular transaction for a Fund, the Manager will"
"2397","consider among other things: the best net price available, the"
"2398","reliability, integrity and financial condition of the broker-dealer;"
"2399","the size of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value of"
"2400","the expected contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a"
"2401","continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any"
"2402","transaction may be less favorable than that available from another"
"2403","broker-dealer if the difference is reasonably justified by other"
"2404","aspects of the portfolio execution services offered. Subject to such"
"2405","policies as the Board may from time to time determine, the"
"2406","Manager shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have"
"2407","breached any duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely"
"2408","by reason of having caused a Fund to pay a broker or dealer that"
"2409","provides brokerage and research services to the Manager an"
"2410","amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"2411","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker"
"2412","or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if the"
"2413","Manager determines in good faith that such amount of commission"
"2414","was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"2415","research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in"
"2416","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"2417","responsibilities of the Manager with respect to the Fund and to"
"2418","other clients of the Manager. The Manager is further authorized to"
"2419","allocate the orders placed by it on behalf of the Funds to brokers"
"2420","and dealers who also provide brokerage and research services"
"2421","within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange"
"2422","Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith. Such allocation shall be"
"2423","in such amounts and proportions as the Manager shall determine"
"2424","and the Manager will report on said allocations regularly to the"
"2425","Board, indicating the brokers to whom such allocations have been"
"2426","made and the basis therefore."
"2427","Section 9. Expenses. All of the ordinary business"
"2428","expenses incurred in the operations of the Funds and the offering"
"2429","of their shares shall be borne by the Funds unless specifically"
"2430","provided otherwise in this Agreement. The expenses borne by the"
"2431","Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage commissions, taxes,"
"2432","legal, auditing or governmental fees, the cost of preparing share"
"2433","certificates, custodian, transfer agent and shareholder service agent"
"2434","costs, expense of issue, sale, redemption and repurchase of shares,"
"2435","expenses of registering and qualifying shares for sale, expenses"
"2436","relating to trustees and shareholder meetings, the cost of preparing"
"2437","and distributing reports and notices to shareholders, the fees and"
"2438","other expenses incurred by the Funds in connection with"
"2439","membership in investment company organizations and the cost of"
"2440","printing copies of prospectuses and statements of additional"
"2441","information distributed to the Funds' shareholders. In addition to"
"2442","the fees described in Section 10 of this Agreement, the Trust (or its"
"2443","other service providers, as may be provided pursuant to their"
"2444","respective agreements and contracts with the Trust) shall pay all of"
"2445","its Fund-level expenses which are not expressly assumed by the"
"2446","Manager pursuant to Section 2(b) or otherwise hereunder. The"
"2447","Fund-level expenses of legal counsel and accounting experts"
"2448","retained by the Manager, after consulting with the Trust's legal"
"2449","counsel and independent auditors, as may be reasonably necessary"
"2450","or appropriate for the performance by the Manager of its duties"
"2451","under this Agreement, shall be deemed to be Fund-level expenses"
"2452","of, and shall be paid for by, the Trust."
"2453","The Manager shall pay its own expenses in connection with"
"2454","the services to be provided by it pursuant to this Agreement and"
"2455","shall, at its own expense, provide its own office space, facilities"
"2456","and equipment. In addition, the Manager shall be responsible for"
"2457","reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Trust:"
"2458","(a) to amend the Trust's registration statement or supplement the"
"2459","Fund's prospectus, and circulate the same, to reflect a change in"
"2460","the personnel of the Manager responsible for making investment"
"2461","decisions in relation to a Fund; (b) to obtain shareholder approval"
"2462","of a new sub-advisory agreement as a result of a change in
control (as such term in defined in Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940"
"2463","Act) of the Manager, or to otherwise comply with the 1940 Act,"
"2464","the Securities Act, or any other applicable statute, law, rule or"
"2465","regulation, as a result of such change; or (c) to meet other legal or"
"2466","regulatory obligations caused by actions of the Manager."
"2467","Section 10. Compensation."
"2468","(a) As compensation for the investment management services"
"2469","provided under this Agreement, the Trust shall pay the"
"2470","Manager fees, payable monthly, at the annual rates"
"2471","indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such Schedule may be"
"2472","amended or supplemented from time to time. The fees"
"2473","payable pursuant to this Paragraph shall be calculated based"
"2474","on the average daily value (as determined on each business"
"2475","day at the time set forth in the Prospectus for determining"
"2476","net asset value per share) of each Fund's net assets, as"
"2477","appropriate, during the preceding month. If the fee payable"
"2478","to the Manager pursuant to this Paragraph begins to accrue"
"2479","before the end of any month or if this Agreement"
"2480","terminates before the end of any month, the fee for the"
"2481","period from the effective date to the end of that month or"
"2482","from the beginning of that month to the termination date,"
"2483","respectively, shall be prorated according to the proportion"
"2484","that the period bears to the full month in which the"
"2485","effectiveness or termination occurs. For purposes of"
"2486","calculating each such monthly fee, the value of each Fund's"
"2487","net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in that"
"2488","Fund's registration statement as then on file with the SEC"
"2489","for the computation of the value of the Fund's net assets in"
"2490","connection with the determination of the net asset value of"
"2491","Fund shares. For purposes of this Agreement, a business
day for a Fund is any day that the Fund is open for"
"2492","trading;"
"2493","(b) No fee, other than the management fee payable monthly, at"
"2494","the annual rates indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such"
"2495","Schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to"
"2496","time, payable for the Fund-level administrative services set"
"2497","forth in Section 2(b) of this Agreement, shall be payable"
"2498","hereunder with respect to a Fund during any period in"
"2499","which the Fund invests all (or substantially all) of its"
"2500","investment assets in a single registered, open-end"
"2501","management investment company, or a single separate"

"2508","registered, open-end management investment companies,"
"2509","or separate series thereof, in each case, in accordance with"
"2510","Section 12(d)(1)(G) under the Act, the rules thereunder or"
"2511","an exemptive order issued by the Commission exempting"
"2512","the Fund from the provisions of Section 12(d)(1)(A) under"

"2519","Section 11. Standard of Care. The Trust will expect of"
"2520","the Manager, and the Manager will give the Trust the benefit of,"
"2521","the Manager's best judgment and efforts in rendering its services to"
"2522","the Trust, and the Manager shall not be liable hereunder for any"
"2523","mistake in judgment. In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad"

"2525","hereunder on the part of the Manager or any of its officers,"
"2526","directors, employees or agents, the Manager shall not be subject to"
