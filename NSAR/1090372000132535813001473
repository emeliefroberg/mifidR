"1128","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1129","To the Board of Directors of Jacob Funds Inc."
"1130","and the Shareholders of the"
"1131","Jacob Internet Fund,"
"1132","Jacob Micro Cap Growth Fund,"
"1133","Jacob Small Cap Growth Fund and"
"1134","Jacob Wisdom Fund"
"1135","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of the Jacob Internet Fund, Jacob Micro Cap Growth Fund, Jacob Small Cap Growth Fund, and Jacob Wisdom Fund, each a series of shares of Jacob Funds, Inc. (the Funds), as of and for the year or period ended August 31, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1136","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability, of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1137","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1138","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1139","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and their operations, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of August 31, 2013."
"1140","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management, the Board of Directors and the shareholders of Jacob Funds, Inc., and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1159","AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION AND TERMINATION"
"1160","      THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION AND TERMINATION (Agreement) is made as of November 7, 2012, among JACOB FUNDS, INC., a Maryland corporation, with its principal place of business at 653 Manhattan Beach Blvd. #J, Manhattan Beach, California  90266 (Corporation), on behalf of Jacob Small Cap Growth Fund, a segregated portfolio of assets (series) thereof (Acquiring Fund), JACOB FUNDS II (formerly Pinebridge Mutual Funds), a Delaware statutory trust, with its principal place of business also at 653 Manhattan Beach Blvd. #J, Manhattan Beach, California  90266 (Trust), on behalf of its Jacob Small Cap Growth Fund II (formerly PineBridge US Small Cap Growth Fund) series (Target), and, solely for purposes of paragraphs 4.4 and 7.2, Jacob Asset Management of New York LLC (Adviser).  (Each of Corporation and Trust is sometimes referred to herein as an Investment Company, and each of Acquiring Fund and Target is sometimes referred to herein as a Fund.)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (1) the agreements, covenants, representations, warranties, actions, and obligations of and by each Fund, and of and by each Investment Company, as applicable, on its behalf, shall be the agreements, covenants, representations, warranties, actions, and obligations of that Fund only, (2) all rights and benefits created hereunder in favor of a Fund shall inure to and be enforceable by the Investment Company of which that Fund is a series on that Fund's behalf, and (3) in no event shall any other series of an Investment Company or the assets thereof be held liable with respect to the breach or other default by an obligated Fund or Investment Company of its agreements, covenants, representations, warranties, actions, and obligations set forth herein."
"1161","      The Investment Companies wish to effect a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code) (all section references are to the Code, unless otherwise noted), and intend this Agreement to be, and adopt it as, a plan of reorganization within the meaning of the regulations under the Code (Regulations).  The reorganization will consist of (1) the transfer of all of Target's assets to Acquiring Fund in exchange solely for voting shares of common stock in Acquiring Fund and Acquiring Fund's assumption of all of Target's liabilities, (2) the distribution of those shares pro rata to Target's shareholders in exchange for their shares of beneficial interest therein and in complete liquidation thereof, and (3) Target's termination, all on the terms and conditions set forth herein (collectively, Reorganization.)"
"1162","      Each Investment Company's board of directors/trustees (each, a Board), in each case including a majority of its members who are not interested persons (as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (1940 Act)) of either Investment Company, (1) has duly adopted and approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (2) has duly authorized performance thereof by Corporation, on Acquiring Fund's behalf, and by Trust, on Target's behalf, respectively, by all necessary Board action, and (3) has determined that participation in the Reorganization is in the best interests of Acquiring Fund and Target, respectively, and that the interests of the existing shareholders thereof will not be diluted as a result of the Reorganization."
"1163","      Target currently offers two classes of shares of beneficial interest, designated Class R shares and Class I shares (Class R Target Shares and Class I Target Shares, respectively, and, collectively, Target Shares).  Acquiring Fund currently offers two classes of shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, designated Investor Class shares and Institutional Class shares (Investor Class Acquiring Fund Shares and Institutional Class Acquiring Fund Shares, respectively, and, collectively, Acquiring Fund Shares).  The Class R Target Shares and the Investor Class Acquiring Fund Shares are substantially similar to each other, as are the Class I Target Shares and the Institutional Class Acquiring Fund Shares."
"1164","      In consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the parties agree as follows:"
"1165","      1.	PLAN OF REORGANIZATION AND TERMINATION"
"1166","      1.1.	Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Target shall assign, sell, convey, transfer, and deliver all of its assets described in paragraph 1.2 (Assets) to Acquiring Fund.  In exchange therefor, Acquiring Fund shall --"
"1167","      (a)  issue and deliver to Target the number of full and fractional (all references herein to fractional shares meaning fractions rounded to the third decimal place) (1) Investor Class Acquiring Fund Shares determined by dividing Target's net value (computed as set forth in paragraph 2.1) (Target Value) attributable to the Class R Target Shares by the net asset value (NAV) of an Investor Class Acquiring Fund Share (computed as set forth in paragraph 2.2) and (2) Institutional Class Acquiring Fund Shares determined by dividing the Target Value attributable to the Class I Target Shares by the NAV of an Institutional Class Acquiring Fund Share (as so computed); and"
"1168","      (b)  assume all of Target's liabilities described in paragraph 1.3 (Liabilities)."
"1169","Those transactions shall take place at the Closing (as defined in paragraph 3.1)."
"1170","      1.2.	The Assets shall consist of all assets and property of every kind and nature -- including all cash, cash equivalents, securities, commodities, futures interests, receivables (including interest and dividends receivable), claims and rights of action, rights to register shares under applicable securities laws, goodwill, and books and records -- Target owns at the Valuation Time (as defined in paragraph 2.1) and any deferred and prepaid expenses shown as assets on Target's books at that time; and Target has no unamortized or unpaid organizational fees or expenses that have not previously been disclosed in writing to Corporation."
"1171","      1.3.	The Liabilities shall consist of all of Target's liabilities, debts, obligations, and duties of whatever kind or nature existing at the Valuation Time, whether absolute, accrued, contingent, or otherwise, whether known or unknown, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, whether or not determinable at that time, and whether or not specifically referred to in this Agreement, except for Target's Reorganization Expenses (as defined in paragraph 4.3.10) that are borne by Adviser pursuant to paragraph 7.2.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Target shall use its best efforts to discharge all its known liabilities, debts, obligations, and duties before the Effective Time (as defined in paragraph 3.1)."
"1172","      1.4.	If the dividends and/or other distributions Target has paid through the Effective Time for its current taxable year do not equal or exceed the sum of its (a) investment company taxable income (within the meaning of section 852(b)(2)), computed without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, plus (b) net capital gain (as defined in section 1222(11)), after reduction by any capital loss carryovers, for that year through that time, then at or as soon as practicable before that time, Target shall declare and pay to its shareholders of record one or more dividends and/or other distributions so that it will have distributed substantially all of such income and gain -- and in no event less than the sum of 98% of its ordinary income plus 98.2% of its capital gain net income, as such terms are defined in section 4982(e)(1) and (2), respectively -- for all tax periods ending at or before the Effective Time, and treating its current taxable year as ending at that time, such that Target will have no tax liability under sections 852 or 4982 for the current and any prior tax periods."
"1173","      1.5.	At the Effective Time (or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable), Target shall distribute the Acquiring Fund Shares it receives pursuant to paragraph 1.1(a) to its shareholders of record determined at the Effective Time (each a Shareholder), in proportion to their Target Shares then held of record and in constructive exchange therefor, and shall completely liquidate.  That distribution shall be accomplished by Corporation's transfer agent's opening accounts on Acquiring Fund's shareholder records in the names of the Shareholders, except Shareholders in whose names accounts thereon already exist, and transferring those Acquiring Fund Shares thereto.  Pursuant to that transfer, each Shareholder's newly opened or pre-existing account shall be credited with the pro rata number of full and fractional Acquiring Fund Shares due that Shareholder, by class (i.e., the account for each Shareholder that holds Class R Target Shares shall be credited with the pro rata number of full and fractional Investor Class Acquiring Shares due that Shareholder, and the account for each Shareholder that holds Class I Target Shares shall be credited with the pro rata number of full and fractional Institutional Class Acquiring Fund Shares due that Shareholder).  The aggregate NAV of Acquiring Fund Shares to be so credited to each Shareholder's account shall equal the aggregate NAV of the Target Shares that Shareholder holds at the Effective Time.  All issued and outstanding Target Shares, including any represented by certificates, shall simultaneously be canceled on Target's shareholder records.  Corporation shall not issue certificates representing the Acquiring Fund Shares issued in connection with the Reorganization."
"1174","      1.6.	Any transfer taxes payable on issuance and transfer of Acquiring Fund Shares in a name other than that of the registered holder on Target's shareholder records of the Target Shares actually or constructively exchanged therefor shall be paid by the transferee thereof, as a condition of that issuance and transfer."
"1175","      1.7.	Any reporting responsibility of Target to a public authority, including the responsibility for filing regulatory reports, tax returns, and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission), any state securities commission, any federal, state, and local tax authorities, and any other relevant regulatory authority, is and shall remain its responsibility up to and including the date on which it is terminated.  In furtherance of the foregoing, after the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to by the Investment Companies, Trust shall or shall cause its agents to prepare any federal, state, and local tax returns, including any Forms 1099, required to be filed by it with respect to Target's final taxable year ending with its complete liquidation and for any prior periods or taxable years and shall cause those tax returns and Forms 1099 to be duly filed with the appropriate taxing authorities."
"1176","      1.8.	After the Effective Time, Target shall not conduct any business except in connection with its termination.  As soon as reasonably practicable after distribution of the Acquiring Fund Shares pursuant to paragraph 1.5, all actions required to terminate Target as a series of Trust shall be taken -- and in all events Target shall have been terminated as such within six months after the Effective Time -- and Trust shall make all filings and take all other actions in connection therewith as required by applicable law or are necessary and proper to effect that termination.  In addition, as soon as reasonably practicable after the later to occur of that distribution and the distribution of shares pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Termination between the Investment Companies of even date regarding their respective series named Jacob Micro Cap Growth Fund, Trust shall be dissolved as a statutory trust under Delaware law and shall make all filings and take all other actions in connection therewith as required by applicable law or are necessary and proper to effect that dissolution."
"1177","      2.	VALUATION"
"1178","      2.1.	For purposes of paragraph 1.1(a), Target's net value shall be (a) the value of the Assets computed immediately after the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Target's declaration of dividends and/or other distributions, if any, on the date of the Closing (Valuation Time), using the valuation procedures set forth in Trust's then-current prospectus and statement of additional information (Pro/SAI), less (b) the amount of the Liabilities at the Valuation Time."
"1179","      2.2.	For purposes of paragraph 1.1(a), the NAV per share of each class of Acquiring Fund Shares shall be computed at the Valuation Time, using the valuation procedures set forth in Acquiring Fund's then-current Pro/SAI."
"1180","      2.3.	All computations pursuant to paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 shall be made (a) by or under the direction of Adviser or (b) in the case of securities subject to fair valuation, in accordance with the valuation procedures described in paragraph 2.2."
"1181","      3.	CLOSING AND EFFECTIVE TIME"
"1182","      3.1.	Unless the Investment Companies agree otherwise, all acts necessary to consummate the Reorganization (Closing) shall be deemed to occur simultaneously as of immediately before the opening of business (9:30 a.m., Eastern Time) on November 12, 2012 (Effective Time).  If, at or immediately before the Valuation Time, (a) the NYSE or another primary trading market for portfolio securities of either Fund (each, an Exchange) is closed to trading or trading thereon is restricted or (b) trading or the reporting of trading on an Exchange is disrupted, so that accurate appraisal of the Target Value and/or the NAV of an Acquiring Fund Share of either class is impracticable, the date of the Closing (and, therefore, the Valuation Time and the Effective Time) shall be postponed until the first day on which that Exchange is open for regular trading after the day when that trading has been fully resumed and that reporting has been restored.  The Closing shall be held at Adviser's offices, 653 Manhattan Beach Blvd. #J, Manhattan Beach, California  90266, or at such other place as to which the Investment Companies agree."
"1183","      3.2.	Trust shall direct U.S. Bank N.A., which is the custodian of each Fund's assets, to deliver at the Closing a certificate of an authorized officer (Certificate) stating that (a) the Assets it holds will be transferred to Acquiring Fund at the Effective Time and (b) the information (including adjusted basis and holding period, by lot) concerning the Assets, including all portfolio securities, transferred by Target to Acquiring Fund, as reflected on Acquiring Fund's books immediately after the Closing, does or will conform to that information on Target's books immediately before the Closing.  Trust shall deliver to Corporation at the Closing a Certificate stating that all necessary taxes in connection with the delivery of the Assets, including all applicable federal and state stock transfer stamps, if any, have been paid or provision for payment has been made."
"1184","      3.3.	Trust shall direct its transfer agent to deliver to Corporation at the Closing a Certificate stating that its records contain (a) the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each Shareholder, (b) the number of full and fractional shares of each outstanding class of Target Shares each Shareholder owns and which such shares are represented by outstanding certificates and which by book-entry accounts, (c) the dividend reinvestment elections, if any, applicable to each Shareholder, and (d) the backup withholding and nonresident alien withholding certifications, notices, or records on file with Trust with respect to each Shareholder, all at the Effective Time."
"1185","      3.4.	Corporation shall direct its transfer agent to deliver to Trust (a) at the Closing, a confirmation, or other evidence satisfactory to Trust, that the Acquiring Fund Shares to be issued to Target pursuant to paragraph 1.1(a) have been credited to Target's account on Acquiring Fund's shareholder records and (b) at or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, a Certificate as to the opening of accounts on those records in the names of the Shareholders, except Shareholders in whose names accounts thereon already exist."
"1186","      3.5.	If requested by Corporation, Trust shall direct PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audits Target's books (PWC), or other applicable service providers to deliver at the Closing all work papers and supporting statements related to ASC 740-10-25 (formerly, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, FASB Interpretation No. 48, July 13, 2006) pertaining to Target."
"1187","      3.6.	Each Investment Company shall deliver to the other at the Closing (a) a Certificate in form and substance satisfactory to the recipient and dated the Effective Time, to the effect that the representations and warranties it made in this Agreement are true and correct at the Effective Time, except as they may be affected by the transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) bills of sale, checks, assignments, share certificates, receipts, and/or other documents the other Investment Company or its counsel reasonably requests."
"1188","      4.	REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES"
"1189","      4.1.	Trust, on Target's behalf, represents and warrants to Corporation, on Acquiring Fund's behalf, as follows:"
"1190","      4.1.1.	Trust (a) was organized as a business trust under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 28, 1996, became a statutory trust thereunder by operation of law on September 1, 2002, changed its name from Brazos Mutual Funds to PineBridge Mutual Funds on January 29, 2010, and from the latter name to its current name on July 2, 2012, and is duly created, validly existing, and in good standing under those laws, and its Certificate of Trust, dated October 24, 1996, as amended by Certificates of Amendment dated January 29, 2010, and July 2, 2012, has been duly filed in the office of the Secretary of State thereof, (b) is duly registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end management investment company, which registration is in full force and effect, and (c) has the power to own all its properties and assets and to carry on the business described in its current registration statement on Form N-1A;"
"1191","      4.1.2.	Target is a duly established and designated series of Trust;"
"1192","      4.1.3.	The execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement have been duly authorized at the date hereof by all necessary action on the part of Trust's Board, which has made the determinations required by Rule 17a-8(a) under the 1940 Act; and this Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of Trust, with respect to Target, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as they may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, receivership, moratorium, and similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and by general principles of equity;"
"1193","      4.1.4.	At the Effective Time, Trust, on Target's behalf, will have good and marketable title to the Assets and full right, power, and authority to sell, assign, transfer, and deliver the Assets hereunder free of any liens or other encumbrances (except securities that are subject to securities loans, as referred to in section 851(b)(2), or are restricted to resale by their terms); and on delivery and payment for the Assets, Corporation, on Acquiring Fund's behalf, will acquire good and marketable title thereto, subject to no restrictions on the full transfer thereof, including restrictions that might arise under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act);"
"1194","      4.1.5.	Trust, with respect to Target, is not currently engaged in, and its execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Reorganization will not result in, (a) a conflict with or material violation of any provision of Delaware law, Trust's Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust dated as of July 5, 2005 (Declaration), Trust's Bylaws, or any agreement, indenture, instrument, contract, lease, or other undertaking (each, an Undertaking) to which Trust, with respect to Target or on its behalf,  is a party or by which it is bound or (b) the acceleration of any obligation, or the imposition of any penalty, under any Undertaking, judgment, or decree to which Trust, with respect to Target or on its behalf, is a party or by which it is bound;"
"1195","      4.1.6.	At or before the Effective Time, either (a) all material contracts and other commitments of or applicable to Target (other than this Agreement and certain investment contracts, including options, futures, forward contracts, and swap agreements) will terminate or (b) provision for discharge and/or Acquiring Fund's assumption of any liabilities of Target thereunder will be made, without either Fund's incurring any penalty with respect thereto and without diminishing or releasing any rights Trust, on Target's behalf, may have had with respect to actions taken or omitted or to be taken by any other party thereto before the Closing;"
"1196","      4.1.7.	No litigation, administrative proceeding, action, or investigation of or before any court, governmental body, or arbitrator is presently pending or, to Trust's knowledge, threatened against Trust, with respect to Target or any of its properties or assets attributable or allocable to Target, that, if adversely determined, would materially and adversely affect Target's financial condition or the conduct of its business; and Trust, on Target's behalf, knows of no facts that might form the basis for the institution of any such litigation, proceeding, action, or investigation and is not a party to or subject to the provisions of any order, decree, judgment, or award of any court, governmental body, or arbitrator that materially or adversely affects Target's business or Trust's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;"

"1265","      5.11.	It is the Investment Companies' intention that the Reorganization will qualify as a reorganization with the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(D).  Neither Investment Company shall take any action or cause any action to be taken (including the filing of any tax return) that is inconsistent with that treatment or results in the failure of the Reorganization to qualify as such a reorganization."
"1266","      6.	CONDITIONS PRECEDENT"

Each Investment Company, in asserting any rights or claims under this Agreement on its or its Fund's behalf, shall look only to the other Fund's Property in settlement of those rights or claims and not to the property of any other series of the other Investment Company or to those trustees/directors, officers, or shareholders."

"1335","AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION AND TERMINATION"
"1336","      THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION AND TERMINATION (Agreement) is made as of November 7, 2012, among JACOB FUNDS, INC., a Maryland corporation, with its principal place of business at 653 Manhattan Beach Blvd. #J, Manhattan Beach, California 90266 (Corporation), on behalf of Jacob Micro Cap Growth Fund, a segregated portfolio of assets (series) thereof (New Fund), JACOB FUNDS II (formerly Pinebridge Mutual Funds), a Delaware statutory trust, with its principal place of business also at 653 Manhattan Beach Blvd. #J, Manhattan Beach, California  90266 (Trust), on behalf of its Jacob Micro Cap Growth Fund (formerly PineBridge US Micro Cap Growth Fund) series (Old Fund), and, solely for purposes of paragraphs 3.4 and 6.2, Jacob Asset Management of New York LLC (Adviser).  (Each of Corporation and Trust is sometimes referred to herein as an Investment Company, and each of New Fund and Old Fund is sometimes referred to herein as a Fund.)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (1) the agreements, covenants, representations, warranties, actions, and obligations of and by each Fund, and of and by each Investment Company, as applicable, on its behalf, shall be the agreements, covenants, representations, warranties, actions, and obligations of that Fund only, (2) all rights and benefits created hereunder in favor of a Fund shall inure to and be enforceable by the Investment Company of which that Fund is a series on that Fund's behalf, and (3) in no event shall any other series of an Investment Company or the assets thereof be held liable with respect to the breach or other default by an obligated Fund or Investment Company of its agreements, covenants, representations, warranties, actions, and obligations set forth herein."
"1337","      The Investment Companies wish to effect a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code) (all section references are to the Code, unless otherwise noted), and intend this Agreement to be, and adopt it as, a plan of reorganization within the meaning of the regulations under the Code (Regulations).  The reorganization will involve Old Fund's changing its identity, form, and place of organization -- by converting from a series of a Delaware statutory trust to a series of a Maryland corporation -- by (1) transferring all of its assets to New Fund (which is being established solely for the purpose of acquiring those assets and continuing Old Fund's business) in exchange solely for voting shares of common stock in New Fund and New Fund's assumption of all of Old Fund's liabilities, (2) distributing those shares pro rata to Old Fund's shareholders in exchange for their shares of beneficial interest therein and in complete liquidation thereof, and (3) terminating Old Fund, all on the terms and conditions set forth herein (collectively, Reorganization)."
"1338","      Each Investment Company's board of directors/trustees (each, a Board), in each case including a majority of its members who are not interested persons (as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (1940 Act)) (Non-Interested Persons) of either Investment Company, (1) has duly adopted and approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (2) has duly authorized performance thereof by Corporation, on New Fund's behalf, and by Trust, on Old Fund's behalf, respectively, by all necessary Board action, and (3) has determined that participation in the Reorganization is in the best interests of New Fund and Old Fund, respectively, and, in Old Fund's case, that the interests of the existing shareholders thereof will not be diluted as a result of the Reorganization."
"1339","      Old Fund currently offers two classes of shares of beneficial interest, designated Class R shares and Class I shares (Class R Old Fund Shares and Class I Old Fund Shares, respectively, and collectively, Old Fund Shares).  New Fund will offer two classes of shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, designated Investor Class shares and Institutional Class shares (Investor Class New Fund Shares and Institutional Class New Fund Shares, respectively, and collectively, New Fund Shares).  The Class R Old Fund Shares and the Investor Class New Fund Shares are substantially similar to each other, as are the Class I Old Fund Shares and the Institutional Class New Fund Shares."
"1340","      In consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the parties agree as follows:"
"1341","      1.	PLAN OF REORGANIZATION AND TERMINATION"
"1342","      1.1.	Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Old Fund shall assign, sell, convey, transfer, and deliver all of its assets described in paragraph 1.2 (Assets) to New Fund.  In exchange therefor, New Fund shall --"
"1343","(a)	issue and deliver to Old Fund the number of full and fractional (all references herein to fractional shares meaning fractions rounded to the third decimal place) (1) Investor Class New Fund Shares equal to the number of full and fractional Class R Old Fund Shares then outstanding, and (2) Institutional Class New Fund Shares equal to the number of full and fractional Class I Old Fund Shares then outstanding, and"
"1344","(b)	assume all of Old Fund's liabilities described in paragraph 1.3 (Liabilities)."
"1345","Those transactions shall take place at the Closing (as defined in paragraph 2.1)."
"1346","      1.2.	The Assets shall consist of all assets and property of every kind and nature -- including all cash, cash equivalents, securities, commodities, futures interests, receivables (including interest and dividends receivable), claims and rights of action, rights to register shares under applicable securities laws, goodwill, and books and records -- Old Fund owns at the Effective Time (as defined in paragraph 2.1) and any deferred and prepaid expenses shown as assets on Old Fund's books at that time; and Old Fund has no unamortized or unpaid organizational fees or expenses that have not previously been disclosed in writing to Corporation."
"1347","      1.3.	The Liabilities shall consist of all of Old Fund's liabilities, debts, obligations, and duties of whatever kind or nature existing at the Effective Time, whether absolute, accrued, contingent, or otherwise, whether known or unknown, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, whether or not determinable at that time, and whether or not specifically referred to in this Agreement, except for Old Fund's Reorganization Expenses (as defined in paragraph 3.3(f)) that are borne by Adviser pursuant to paragraph 6.2.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Old Fund shall use its best efforts to discharge all its known liabilities, debts, obligations, and duties before the Effective Time."
"1348","      1.4.	At or before the Closing, New Fund shall redeem the Initial Shares (as defined in paragraph 5.5) for the amount at which they are issued pursuant to that paragraph.  At the Effective Time (or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable), Old Fund shall distribute all the New Fund Shares it receives pursuant to paragraph 1.1(a) to its shareholders of record determined at the Effective Time (each, a Shareholder), in proportion to their Old Fund Shares then held of record and in constructive exchange therefor, and shall completely liquidate.  That distribution shall be accomplished by Corporation's transfer agent's opening accounts on New Fund's shareholder records in the Shareholders' names and transferring those New Fund Shares thereto.  Pursuant to that transfer, each Shareholder's account shall be credited with the number of full and fractional New Fund Shares equal to the number of full and fractional Old Fund Shares that Shareholder holds at the Effective Time, by class (i.e., the account for each Shareholder that holds Class R Old Fund Shares shall be credited with the number of full and fractional Investor Class New Fund Shares equal to the number of full and fractional Class R Old Fund Shares that Shareholder then holds, and the account for each Shareholder that holds Class I Old Fund Shares shall be credited with the number of full and fractional Institutional Class New Fund Shares equal to the number of full and fractional Class I Old Fund Shares that Shareholder then holds).  The aggregate net asset value (NAV) of New Fund Shares to be so credited to each Shareholder's account shall equal the aggregate NAV of the Old Fund Shares that Shareholder holds at the Effective Time.  All issued and outstanding Old Fund Shares, including any represented by certificates, shall simultaneously be canceled on Old Fund's shareholder records.  Corporation shall not issue certificates representing the New Fund Shares issued in connection with the Reorganization."
"1349","      1.5.	Any transfer taxes payable on the issuance and transfer of New Fund Shares in a name other than that of the registered holder on Old Fund's shareholder records of the Old Fund Shares actually or constructively exchanged therefor shall be paid by the transferee thereof, as a condition of that issuance and transfer."
"1350","      1.6.	Any reporting responsibility of Old Fund to a public authority, including the responsibility for filing regulatory reports, tax returns, and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission), any state securities commission, any federal, state, and local tax authorities, and any other relevant regulatory authority, is and shall remain its responsibility up to and including the date on which it is terminated."
"1351","      1.7.	After the Effective Time, Old Fund shall not conduct any business except in connection with its termination.  As soon as reasonably practicable after distribution of the New Fund Shares pursuant to paragraph 1.4, all actions required to terminate Old Fund as a series of Trust shall be taken -- and in all events Old Fund shall have been terminated as such within six months after the Effective Time -- and Trust shall make all filings and take all other actions in connection therewith as required by applicable law or are necessary and proper to effect that termination.  In addition, as soon as reasonably practicable after the later to occur of that distribution and the distribution of shares pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Termination between the Investment Companies of even date regarding their respective series named Jacob Small Cap Growth Fund and Jacob Small Cap Growth Fund II, Trust shall be dissolved as a statutory trust under Delaware law and shall make all filings and take all other actions in connection therewith as required by applicable law or are necessary and proper to effect that dissolution."
"1352","      2.	CLOSING AND EFFECTIVE TIME"
"1353","      2.1.	Unless the Investment Companies agree otherwise, all acts necessary to consummate the Reorganization (Closing) shall be deemed to occur simultaneously as of immediately before the opening of business (9:30 a.m., Eastern Time) on November 12, 2012 (Effective Time).  The Closing shall be held at Adviser's offices, 653 Manhattan Beach Blvd. #J, Manhattan Beach, California  90266, or at such other place as to which the Investment Companies agree."
"1354","      2.2.	Trust shall direct U.S. Bank N.A., which is the custodian of Old Fund's assets and will be the custodian of New Fund's assets, to deliver at the Closing a certificate of an authorized officer (Certificate) stating that (a) the Assets it holds will be transferred to New Fund at the Effective Time and (b) the information (including adjusted basis and holding period, by lot) concerning the Assets, including all portfolio securities, transferred by Old Fund to New Fund, as reflected on New Fund's books immediately after the Closing, does or will conform to that information on Old Fund's books immediately before the Closing.  Trust shall deliver to Corporation at the Closing a Certificate stating that all necessary taxes in connection with the delivery of the Assets, including all applicable federal and state stock transfer stamps, if any, have been paid or provision for payment has been made."
"1355","      2.3.	Trust shall direct its transfer agent to deliver to Corporation at the Closing a Certificate stating that its records contain (a) the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each Shareholder, (b) the number of full and fractional shares of each outstanding class of Old Fund Shares each Shareholder owns and which such shares are represented by outstanding certificates and which by book-entry accounts, (c) the dividend reinvestment elections, if any, applicable to each Shareholder, and (d) the backup withholding and nonresident alien withholding certifications, notices, or records on file with Trust with respect to each Shareholder, all at the Effective Time."
"1356","      2.4.	Corporation shall direct its transfer agent to deliver to Trust (a) at the Closing, a confirmation, or other evidence satisfactory to Trust, that the New Fund Shares to be issued to Old Fund pursuant to paragraph 1.1(a) have been credited to Old Fund's account on New Fund's shareholder records and (b) at or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, a Certificate as to the opening of accounts on those records in the names of the Shareholders."
"1357","      2.5.	If requested by Corporation, Trust shall direct PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audits Old Fund's books (PWC), or other applicable service providers to deliver at the Closing all work papers and supporting statements related to ASC 740-10-25 (formerly, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, FASB Interpretation No. 48, July 13, 2006) pertaining to Old Fund."
"1358","      2.6.	Each Investment Company shall deliver to the other at the Closing (a) a Certificate in form and substance satisfactory to the recipient and dated the Effective Time, to the effect that the representations and warranties it made in this Agreement are true and correct at the Effective Time, except as they may be affected by the transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) bills of sale, checks, assignments, share certificates, receipts, and/or other documents the other Investment Company or its counsel reasonably requests."
"1359","      3.	REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES"
"1360","      3.1.	Trust, on Old Fund's behalf, represents and warrants to Corporation, on New Fund's behalf, as follows:"

"1443","      Neither Investment Company has made any representation, warranty, or covenant not set forth herein, and this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties.

"1451","      10.	SEVERABILITY"
"1452","      Any term or provision hereof that is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of that invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms and provisions hereof in any other jurisdiction."
"1453","      11.	MISCELLANEOUS"

"1456","      11.3.	Notice is hereby given that this instrument is executed and delivered on behalf of Trust's trustees solely in their capacities as trustees, and not individually.  Each Investment Company's obligations under this instrument are not binding on or enforceable against any of its trustees/directors, officers, shareholders, or series other than its Fund but are only binding on and enforceable against its property attributable to and held for the benefit of its Fund (Fund's Property) and not its property attributable to and held for the benefit of any other series thereof.  Each Investment Company, in asserting any rights or claims under this Agreement on its or its Fund's behalf, shall look only to the other Fund's Property in settlement of those rights or claims and not to the property of any other series of the other Investment Company or to those trustees/directors, officers, or shareholders."
"1457","      11.4.	This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been executed by each Investment Company and delivered to the other Investment Company.
