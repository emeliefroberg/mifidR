"472","CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS"
"473","       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"474","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"475","Volumetric Fund, Inc."
"476","In  planning and performing our audit of the financial statements  of"
"477","Volumetric  Fund,  Inc., as of and for the year  ended  December  31,"
"478","2010,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company"
"479","Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States),  we  considered   its"
"480","internal   control   over  financial  reporting,  including   control"
"481","activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing  our"
"482","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"483","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of  Form  N-"
"484","SAR,  but  not  for  the  purpose of expressing  an  opinion  on  the"
"485","effectiveness   of  the  Fund's  internal  control   over   financial"
"486","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"487","The   management   of  Volumetric  Fund,  Inc.  is  responsible   for"
"488","establishing   and  maintaining  effective  internal   control   over"
"489","financial  reporting.   In fulfilling this responsibility,  estimates"
"490","and  judgments  by  management are required to  assess  the  expected"
"491","benefits  and  related costs of controls.  A Fund's internal  control"
"492","over  financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"493","assurance  regarding the reliability of financial reporting  and  the"
"494","preparation   of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes   in"
"495","accordance  with  accounting principles  generally  accepted  in  the"
"496","United  States of America (GAAP).  A Fund's internal  control  over"
"497","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures  that  (1)"
"498","pertain  to  the  maintenance of records that, in reasonable  detail,"
"499","accurately  and  fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions  of"
"500","the  assets  of  the  Fund;  (2) provide  reasonable  assurance  that"
"501","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation  of  the"
"502","financial  statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts  and"
"503","expenditures  of  the  Fund are being made only  in  accordance  with"
"504","authorizations  of  management and directors of  the  Fund;  and  (3)"
"505","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"506","of  unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a  Fund's  assets"
"507","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"508","Because  of  inherent  limitations, internal control  over  financial"
"509","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"510","of  any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject  to"
"511","the  risk  that controls may become inadequate because of changes  in"
"512","conditions  or  that the degree of compliance with  the  policies  or"
"513","procedures may deteriorate."
"514","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"515","the  design  or  operation of a control does not allow management  or"
"516","employees,  in  the  normal  course  of  performing  their   assigned"
"517","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely  basis.   A"
"518","material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in"
"519","internal  control  over financial reporting, such  that  there  is  a"
"520","reasonable  possibility that a material misstatement  of  the  Fund's"
"521","annual  or  interim  financial statements will not  be  prevented  or"
"522","detected on a timely basis."
"523","Our  consideration  of  the Fund's internal  control  over  financial"
"524","reporting  was  for  the  limited  purpose  described  in  the  first"
"525","paragraph  and  would  not necessarily disclose all  deficiencies  in"
"526","internal  control that might be material weaknesses  under  standards"
"527","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board  (United"
"528","States).   However, we noted no deficiencies in the internal  control"
"529","over  financial reporting and its operations, including controls  for"
"530","safeguarding  securities that we consider to be material  weaknesses,"
"531","as defined above, as of December 31, 2010."
"532","This  report is intended solely for the information and  use  of  the"
"533","shareholders,  management and the Board of  Directors  of  Volumetric"
"534","Fund,  Inc., and the Securities and Exchange Commission  and  is  not"
"535","intended  to  be  and should not be used by anyone other  than  these"
"536","specified parties."
