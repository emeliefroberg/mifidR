"653","to supervise the investment activities of such Fund as hereinafter set forth."
"654","Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Investment Adviser shall"
"655","obtain and evaluate such information and advice relating to the economy,"
"656","securities, securities markets and commodities markets as it deems necessary or"
"657","useful to discharge its duties hereunder; shall continuously manage the assets"
"658","of each Fund in a manner consistent with the investment objectives and policies"
"659","of a Fund; shall determine the securities to be purchased, sold or otherwise"
"660","disposed of by a Fund and the timing of such purchases, sales and dispositions;"
"661","and shall take such further action, including the placing of purchase and sale"
"662","orders on behalf of a Fund, as the Investment Adviser shall deem necessary or"
"663","appropriate. The Investment Adviser shall also furnish to or place at the"
"664","disposal of each Fund such of the information, evaluations, analyses and"
"665","opinions formulated or obtained by the Investment Adviser in the discharge of"
"666","its duties as each Fund may, from time to time, reasonably request."
"667","     2. In connection with those Funds identified in Annex 1 to this Agreement"
"668","and as permitted in their respective Current Investment Management Agreements,"
"669","and in connection with all Funds added to Schedule A after the date hereof, the"
"670","Investment Adviser may, subject to the approval of the Board of"
"671","Trustees/Directors (and in the case of the Morgan Stanley European Growth Fund"

"676","to certain or all of the securities and commodities to be purchased, sold or"
"677","otherwise disposed of by such Funds and the timing of such purchases, sales and"
"678","dispositions and to take such further action, including the placing of purchase"
"679","and sale orders on behalf of such Funds as the Sub-Advisor, in consultation with"
"680","the Investment Adviser, shall deem necessary or appropriate; provided that the"
"681","Investment Adviser shall be responsible for monitoring compliance by such"
"682","Sub-Advisor with the investment policies and restrictions of such Funds and with"
"683","such other limitations or directions as the Trustees/Directors of the Fund may"
"684","from time to time prescribe."
"685","     3. The Investment Adviser shall, at its own expense, maintain such staff"
"686","and employ or retain such personnel and consult with such other persons as it"
"687","shall from time to time determine to be necessary or useful to the performance"
"688","of its obligations under this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the"
"689","foregoing, the staff and personnel of the Investment Adviser shall be deemed to"
"690","include persons employed or otherwise retained by the Investment Adviser to"
"691","furnish statistical and other factual data, advice regarding economic factors"
"692","and trends, information with respect to technical and scientific developments,"
"693","and such other information, advice and assistance as the Investment Adviser may"
"694","desire."
"695","     4. Each Fund will, from time to time, furnish or otherwise make available"

"706","advisory and supervisory services to be performed by it under this Agreement,"
"707","and shall, at its own expense, pay the"
"708","                                      -2-"

"763","hereinafter set forth, compensation under this Agreement shall be calculated and"

"765","calculations shall be made by applying 1/365ths of the annual rates to each"

"767","the last previous business day."
"768","     In connection with the closed-end funds identified on Schedule A,"

"771","the Fund determined as of the close of the last business day of each week,"
"772","                                      -3-"
"773","except for such closed-end funds as may be specified in Schedule A. At the"

"780","with the calculation of the fees as set forth in Schedule A. Subject to the"
"781","provisions of paragraph 8 hereof, payment of the Investment Adviser's"
"782","compensation for the preceding month shall be made as promptly as possible after"
"783","completion of the computation contemplated by paragraph 8 hereof."
"784","     8. This section is applicable only to those Funds listed on Annex 3 and"

"788","hereof and the amounts payable by the Funds under the Administration Agreement,"
"789","for any fiscal year ending on a date on which this Agreement is in effect,"
"790","exceed the expense limitations applicable to a Fund imposed by state securities"
"791","laws or regulations thereunder, as such limitations may be raised or lowered"
"792","from time to time, the Investment Adviser shall reduce its advisory fee to the"
"793","extent of such excess and, if required, pursuant to any such laws or"
"794","regulations, will reimburse a Fund for annual operating expenses in excess of"
"795","any expense limitation that may be applicable; provided, however, there shall be"
"796","excluded from such expenses the amount of any interest, taxes, brokerage"
"797","commissions and extraordinary expenses (including but not limited to legal"
"798","claims and liabilities and litigation costs and any indemnification related"
"799","thereto) paid or payable by a Fund. Such reduction, if any, shall be computed"
"800","and accrued daily (and in the case of the closed-end funds, weekly), shall be"
"801","settled on a monthly basis, and shall be based upon the expense limitation"
"802","applicable to a Fund as at the end of the last business day of the month. Should"
"803","two or more such expense limitations be applicable as at the end of the last"
"804","business day of the month, (and in the case of the closed-end funds, as at the"
"805","end of the last full week of the month) that expense limitation which results in"
"806","the largest reduction in the Investment Adviser's fee shall be applicable."
"807","     9. The Investment Adviser will use its best efforts in the supervision and"
"808","management of the investment activities of each Fund, but in the absence of"
"809","willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its"
"810","obligations hereunder, the Investment Adviser shall not be liable to a Fund or"
"811","any of its investors for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act"
"812","or omission by the Investment Adviser or for any losses sustained by a Fund or"
"813","its investors."
"814","     10. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Investment"
"815","Adviser or any affiliated person of the Investment Adviser from acting as"
"816","investment adviser or manager for any other person, firm or corporation and"
"817","shall not in any way bind or restrict the Investment Adviser or any such"
"818","affiliated person from buying, selling or trading any securities or commodities"
"819","for their own accounts or for the account of others for whom they may be acting."
"820","Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any"
"821","trustee/director, officer or employee of the Investment Adviser to engage in any"
"822","other business or to devote his or her time and attention in part to the"
"823","management or other aspects of any other business whether of a similar or"

"839","at any time and without the payment of any penalty, terminate this Agreement"
"840","upon thirty days' written notice to the Investment Adviser, either by majority"
"841","vote of the Board of Trustees/Directors of such Fund or by the vote of a"
"842","majority of the outstanding voting securities of such Fund (if applicable,"

"849","be given in writing, addressed and delivered, or mailed post-paid, to the other"
"850","party at the principal office of such party."
"851","     Any approval of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the"
"852","outstanding voting securities of any portfolio/series of a Fund shall be"

"862","deem it necessary to conform this Agreement to the requirements of applicable"

"1800","Exchange Commission; and (vii) monitor the compliance of the Fund's investment"
"1801","policies and restrictions."
"1802","     2. MS Services shall, at its own expense, maintain such staff and employ or"
"1803","retain such personnel and consult with such other persons as it shall from time"
"1804","to time determine to be necessary or useful to the performance of its"
"1805","obligations under this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the"
"1806","foregoing, the staff and personnel of MS Services shall be deemed to include"
"1807","officers of MS Services and persons employed or otherwise retained by MS"
"1808","Services (including officers and employees of the Funds, with the consent of the"
"1809","Funds) to furnish services, statistical and other factual data, information with"

"1817","     3. The Funds will, from time to time, furnish or otherwise make available"
"1818","to MS Services such financial reports, proxy statements and other information"
"1819","relating to the business and affairs of the Fund as MS Services may reasonably"

"1821","Agreement or to comply with any applicable law and regulation or request of the"
"1822","Board of Directors/Trustees of the Fund."
"1823","     4. For the services to be rendered, the facilities furnished, and the"
"1824","expenses assumed by MS Services, the Funds shall pay to MS Services monthly"
"1825","compensation calculated daily (in the case of an open-end Fund) or weekly (in"
"1826","the case of a closed-end Fund) by applying the annual rate or rates set forth on"
"1827","Schedule B to the net assets of each Fund. Except as hereinafter set forth, (i)"
"1828","in the case of an open-end Fund, compensation under this Agreement shall be"
"1829","calculated by applying 1/365th of the annual rate or rates to the Fund's or the"
"1830","Series' daily net assets determined as of the close of business on that day or"
"1831","the last previous business day and (ii) in the case of a closed-end Fund,"
"1832","compensation under this Agreement shall be calculated by applying the annual"
"1833","rate or rates to the Fund's average weekly net assets determined as of the close"
"1834","of the last business day of each week. If this Agreement becomes effective"
"1835","subsequent to the first day of a month or shall terminate before the last day of"
"1836","a month, compensation for that part of the month this Agreement is in effect"
"1837","shall be prorated in a manner consistent with the calculation of the fees as set"
"1838","forth on Schedule B. For the purposes of calculating the administrative fee for"
"1839","the closed-end funds referenced on Annex 2 to the Investment Advisory Agreement,"
"1840","the liquidation preference of any Preferred Shares issued by each of such Funds"
"1841","will not be deducted from the Fund's total assets. In addition, for purposes of"
"1842","this calculation, an amount up to the aggregate amount of any other borrowings"
"1843","may be included in the Fund's administrative fee calculation. Subject to the"
"1844","provisions of paragraph 5 hereof, payment of MS Services' compensation for the"
"1845","preceding month shall be made as promptly as possible after completion of the"
"1846","computations contemplated by paragraph 5 hereof."
"1847","     5. In the event the operating expenses of those Funds identified in Annex 3"
"1848","to the Investment Advisory Agreement, including amounts payable to the"
"1849","Investment Adviser pursuant to paragraph 7 thereof and the amounts payable"
"1850","hereunder, for any fiscal year ending on a date on which this Agreement is in"
"1851","effect, exceed the expense limitations applicable to the Fund and/or any Series"
"1852","thereof imposed by state securities laws or regulations thereunder, as such"
"1853","limitations may be raised or lowered from time to time, the fee payable"
"1854","hereunder shall be reduced on a pro rata basis in the same proportion as the fee"
"1855","payable by the Fund under the Investment Advisory Agreement is reduced."
"1856","     6. MS Services shall bear the cost of rendering the administrative services"
"1857","to be performed by it under this Agreement, and shall, at its own expense, pay"
"1858","the compensation of the officers and employees, if any, of the Funds who are"
"1859","also directors, officers or employees of MS Services, and provide"
"1860","                                       -2-"
"1861","such office space and equipment and such clerical and bookkeeping services as"
"1862","each Fund shall reasonably require in the conduct of its business. MS Services"
"1863","shall also bear the cost of heat, light, power and other utilities provided to"
"1864","each Fund and the cost of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the ordinary course"
"1865","of providing services under this Agreement, such as telephone, fax, system"
"1866","usage, internal controls assurance (such as a Statement on Auditing Standards"
"1867","(SAS) No. 70 report), envelopes, postage and special delivery mail. Each Fund"
"1868","shall reimburse MS Services for any extraordinary expenses and the expenses of"
"1869","one or more independent pricing services, approved from time to time by the"
"1870","Board of Directors of a Fund, to obtain securities prices in connection with"
"1871","determining the net asset value of the Fund. The Fund will reimburse MS Services"
"1872","for its share of the cost of such services based upon its actual use of the"
"1873","services."
"1874","     7. MS Services will use its best efforts in the performance of"
"1875","administrative activities on behalf of each Fund, but in the absence of willful"
"1876","misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its"
"1877","obligations hereunder, MS Services shall not be liable to the Fund or any of its"
"1878","investors for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission"
"1879","by MS Services or for any losses sustained by the Fund or its investors."
"1880","     8. It is understood that any of the shareholders, Directors/Trustees,"
"1881","officers and employees of the Fund may be a shareholder, director, officer or"
"1882","employee of, or be otherwise interested in, MS Services, and in any person"
"1883","controlling, controlled by or under common control with MS Services, and that MS"
"1884","Services and any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with"
"1885","MS Services may have an interest in the Fund. It is also understood that MS"
"1886","Services and any affiliated persons thereof or any persons controlling,"
"1887","controlled by or under common control with MS Services have and may have"
"1888","advisory, management, administration service or other contracts with other"
"1889","organizations and persons, and may have other interests and businesses, and"
"1890","further may purchase, sell or trade any securities or commodities for their own"
"1891","accounts or for the account of others for whom they may be acting."
"1892","     9. This Agreement shall continue unless terminated by either party by"
"1893","written notice delivered to the other party within 30 days. In the event that"
"1894","the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement between any Fund and the"
"1895","Investment Adviser is terminated, this Agreement will automatically terminate"
"1896","with respect to such Fund."
"1897","     10. This Agreement may be amended or modified by the parties in any manner"
"1898","by written agreement executed by each of the parties hereto."
"1899","     11. This Agreement may be assigned by either party with the written consent"
"1900","of the other party."
"1901","     12. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with"
"1902","the laws of the State of New York."

"2164","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"2165","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"2166","Morgan Stanley U.S. Government Securities Trust:"
"2167","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Morgan"
"2168","Stanley U.S. Government Securities Trust (the Fund) as of and for the"
"2169","year ended December 31, 2009, in accordance with the standards of the"
"2170","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"2171","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"2172","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"2173","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"2174","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"2175","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"2176","Fund's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express"
"2177","no such opinion."
"2178","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"2179","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"2180","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"2181","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's"
"2182","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"2183","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"2184","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"2185","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's"
"2186","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"2187","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"2188","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2189","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"2190","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"2191","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2192","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"2193","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"2194","of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"2195","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of"
"2196","a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2197","statements."
"2198","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2199","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"2200","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"2201","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2202","conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"2203","procedures may deteriorate."
"2204","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"2205","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"2206","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"2207","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"2208","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2209","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"2210","possibility that a material misstatement of the fund's annual or interim"
"2211","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2212","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"2213","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"2214","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"2215","that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"2216","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we"
"2217","noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"2218","reporting and its operation, including controls for safeguarding"
"2219","securities, that we consider to be a material weakness, as defined"
"2220","above, as of December 31, 2009."
"2221","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"2222","management and the Board of Trustees of Morgan Stanley U.S. Government"
"2223","Securities Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"2224","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"2225","specified parties."
