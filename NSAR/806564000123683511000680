"802","business day of the month (and in the case of the closed-end funds, as at"
"803","the end of the last full week of the month), that expense limitation which"
"804","results in the largest reduction in the Adviser's fee shall be applicable."

"815","in any way bind or restrict the Adviser or any such affiliated person from"
"816","buying, selling or trading any securities or commodities for their own"

"818","in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any trustee/director,"

"846","       Any approval of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the"

"849","notwithstanding (a) that this Agreement has not been approved by the holders"
"850","of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of any other"
"851","portfolio/series or (b) that this Agreement has not been approved by the"
"852","vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund of"
"853","which it is a portfolio/series unless such approval shall be required by"
"854","any other applicable law or otherwise."
"855","       12.	This Agreement may be amended by the parties without"
"856","the vote or consent of shareholders of a Fund to supply any omission,"
"857","to cure, correct or supplement any ambiguous, defective or inconsistent"
"858","provision hereof, or if they deem it necessary to conform this Agreement"
"859","to the requirements of applicable federal laws or regulations, but"
"860","neither the Funds nor the Adviser shall be liable for failing to do so."
"861","       13.	This Agreement shall be construed in accordance"
"862","with the law of the State of New York and the applicable provisions"
"863","of the Act.  To the extent the applicable law of the State of New"

"875","resort be had to their private property for the satisfaction of any"
"876","obligation or claim or otherwise, in connection with the affairs of"
"877","such Funds, but the Trust Estate only shall be liable."
"878","       15.	The Adviser and each Fund agree that the name Morgan"

"1391","<TEXT>"
"1392","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1393","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1394","Morgan Stanley Mortgage Securities Trust:"
"1395","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"1396","of Morgan Stanley Mortgage Securities Trust (the Fund) as of and"
"1397","for the year ended October 31, 2011, in accordance with the standards"
"1398","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1399","considered its internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1400","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1401","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1402","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1403","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"1404","of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"1405","we express no such opinion."
"1406","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1407","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1408","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"1409","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"1410","A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed"
"1411","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"1412","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1413","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's"
"1414","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1415","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1416","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1417","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"1418","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1419","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1420","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being"
"1421","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"1422","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1423","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1424","of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1425","statements."
"1426","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1427","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"1428","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1429","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"1430","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1431","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1432","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"1433","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"1434","or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1435","or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1436","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"1437","the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1438","detected on a timely basis."
"1439","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"1440","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1441","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"1442","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1443","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1444","in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1445","including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
