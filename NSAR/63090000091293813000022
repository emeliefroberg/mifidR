"549","             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"550","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"551","Massachusetts Investors Growth Stock Fund"
"552","In   planning   and   performing  our  audit  of  the  financial  statements  of"
"553","Massachusetts Investors  Growth  Stock  Fund  (the  Fund) as of and for the year"
"554","ended November 30, 2012, in accordance with the standards  of the Public Company"
"555","Accounting  Oversight Board (United States), we considered the  Fund's  internal"
"556","control  over   financial   reporting,   including  controls  over  safeguarding"
"557","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing  procedures for the purpose of"
"558","expressing  our  opinion  on the financial statements and  to  comply  with  the"
"559","requirements of Form N-SAR,  but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"560","the  effectiveness of the Fund's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting."
"561","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"562","The management  of  the  Fund  is  responsible  for establishing and maintaining"
"563","effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.   In  fulfilling  this"
"564","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"565","expected  benefits and related costs of controls. A company's  internal  control"
"566","over financial  reporting  is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"567","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"568","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"569","accounting principles. A company's  internal  control  over  financial reporting"
"570","includes  those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the  maintenance  of"
"571","records  that,   in   reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the"
"572","transactions  and dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide"
"573","reasonable assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary to permit"
"574","preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with generally  accepted"
"575","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures  of  the  company  are"
"576","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"577","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"578","detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"579","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"580","Because of its  inherent  limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"581","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"582","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"583","inadequate because of changes in conditions,  or  that  the degree of compliance"
"584","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"585","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"586","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,  in the normal"
"587","course   of   performing   their   assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"588","misstatements on a timely basis. A material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or  a"
"589","combination  of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"590","that there is  a  reasonable  possibility  that  a  material misstatement of the"
"591","company's  annual  or  interim financial statements will  not  be  prevented  or"
"592","detected on a timely basis."
"593","Our consideration of the  Fund's  internal  control over financial reporting was"
"594","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in  the first  paragraph  and  would  not"
"595","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"596","weaknesses  under  standards  established  by  the   Public  Company  Accounting"
"597","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"598","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,  including controls"
"599","over  safeguarding  securities, which we consider to be a material  weakness  as"
"600","defined above as of November 30, 2012."
"601","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"602","Board  of  Trustees  of  Massachusetts  Investors  Growth  Stock  Fund  and  the"
"603","Securities and Exchange  Commission  and is not intended to be and should not be"
"604","used by anyone other than these specified parties."
