"852","<TEXT>"
"853","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"854","Accounting Firm"
"855","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"856","Gateway Trust:"
"857","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"858","financial statements of Gateway Fund and"
"859","Gateway Equity Call Premium Fund, each a"
"860","series of Gateway Trust (the Funds) as of"
"861","and for the year ended December 31, 2017, in"
"862","accordance with the standards of the Public"
"863","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"864","States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"865","control over financial reporting, including"
"866","controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"867","basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"868","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"869","the financial statements and to comply with"
"870","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"871","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"872","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control"
"873","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"874","do not express an opinion on the"
"875","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control"
"876","over financial reporting."
"877","The management of the Funds is responsible"
"878","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"879","internal control over financial reporting."
"880","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"881","and judgments by management are required to"
"882","assess the expected benefits and related"
"883","costs of controls.  A fund's internal"
"884","control over financial reporting is a"
"885","process designed to provide reasonable"
"886","assurance regarding the reliability of"
"887","financial reporting and the preparation of"
"888","financial statements for external purposes"
"889","in accordance with generally accepted"
"890","accounting principles.  A fund's internal"
"891","control over financial reporting includes"
"892","those policies and procedures that (1)"
"893","pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"894","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"895","reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"896","the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"897","reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"898","recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"899","of financial statements in accordance with"
"900","generally accepted accounting principles,"
"901","and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"902","fund are being made only in accordance with"
"903","authorizations of management and trustees of"
"904","the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable"
"905","assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"906","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"907","or disposition of a fund's assets that could"
"908","have a material effect on the financial"
"909","statements."
"910","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"911","internal control over financial reporting"
"912","may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"913","Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"914","effectiveness to future periods are subject"
"915","to the risk that controls may become"
"916","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"917","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"918","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"919","A deficiency in internal control over"
"920","financial reporting exists when the design"
"921","or operation of a control does not allow"
"922","management or employees, in the normal"
"923","course of performing their assigned"
"924","functions, to prevent or detect"
"925","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"926","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"927","of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"928","financial reporting, such that there is a"
"929","reasonable possibility that a material"
"930","misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim"
"931","financial statements will not be prevented"
"932","or detected on a timely basis."
"933","Our consideration of the Funds' internal"
"934","control over financial reporting was for the"
"935","limited purpose described in the first"
"936","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"937","all deficiencies in internal control over"
"938","financial reporting that might be material"
"939","weaknesses under standards established by"
"940","the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"941","Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"942","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control"
"943","over financial reporting and its operation,"
"944","including controls over safeguarding"
"945","securities that we consider to be material"
"946","weaknesses as defined above as of December"
"947","31, 2017."
"948","This report is intended solely for the"
"949","information and use of management and the"
"950","Board of Trustees of Gateway Trust and the"
"951","Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"952","not intended to be and should not be used by"
"953","anyone other than these specified parties."

"1202","Class Expenses), not including advisory"
"1203","fees or other expenses related to the"

"1209","The gross income of each Fund generally"

"1214","more specifically) shall be subtracted from"
"1215","gross income on the basis of the net assets of"

"1217","include:"
"1218","*	Expenses incurred by a Trust"
"1219","(including, but not limited to, fees of"
"1220","Trustees, insurance and legal"
"1221","counsel) not attributable to a"

Expenses)."
"1230","Expenses of a Fund shall be apportioned to"

"1240","can no longer be attributed to a class, it will"
"1241","be charged to a Fund for allocation among"
"1242","classes in proportion to the net assets of each"
"1243","such class.  Any additional Class Expenses"
"1244","not specifically identified above that are"

"1247","shall not be so allocated until approved by"
"1248","the Board of Trustees of the Trust in light of"
"1249","the requirements of the 1940 Act and the"
