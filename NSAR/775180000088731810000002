"7143","shall manage (i) the investment operations of the Portfolio,"

"7153","what investments and securities will be purchased, retained or"
"7154","sold by such Portfolio and what portion of such assets will"
"7155","be invested or held uninvested in cash."
"7156","	(2)	In the performance of its duties and"
"7157","obligations under this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall act in"
"7158","conformity with the Trust's Prospectus and with the instructions"
"7159","and directions of the Adviser and of the Board of Trustees and"
"7160","will conform and comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act,"
"7161","the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and all other"
"7162","applicable federal and state laws and regulations, as each is"
"7163","amended from time to time."
"7164","	(3)	The Sub-Adviser shall determine the securities"

"7168","respective Fund's Registration Statement (as defined herein)"
"7169","and Prospectus or as the Board of Trustees or the Adviser may"
"7170","direct from time to time, in conformity with federal securities laws."
"7171","In providing the Portfolio with investment supervision, the Sub-Adviser"

"7174","the Sub-Adviser may consider the financial responsibility,"

"7181","analysis provided by brokers who may execute brokerage"
"7182","transactions at a higher cost to the Portfolio than may result"
"7183","when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of"

"7195","to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, may,"

"8259","asserted in writing by any taxing authority against the Large Cap Growth"
"8260","Fund, and no deficiency has been proposed, assessed or asserted,"
"8261","in writing, where such deficiency would reasonably be expected,"
"8262","individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the"
"8263","condition, financial or otherwise, property, assets or prospects of the"
"8264","Large Cap Growth Fund."
"8265","       7.   Termination. The Trust may terminate this Plan of"
"8266","Reorganization with the approval of its Board at any time prior to the"
"8267","Effective Time, notwithstanding approval thereof by the Reclassified"
"8268","Fund's respective shareholders if, in the judgment of the Board,"
"8269","proceeding with the Plan of Reorganization would be inadvisable."

"9014","OLD MUTUAL FUNDS II"
"9015","ON BEHALF OF THE"
"9016","OLD MUTUAL DEVELOPING GROWTH FUND"
"9017","December 23, 2008Dear Shareholder:"
"9018","The Old Mutual Developing Growth Fund's Board of Trustees"
"9019","(the Board) requests your vote on a proposal to reorganize"
"9020","the Old Mutual Developing Growth Fund (the Developing Growth
Fund) into the Old Mutual Strategic Small Company Fund (the"
"9021","Strategic Small Company Fund and together with the Developing"
"9022","Growth Fund, the Funds).  If the reorganization is approved"
"9023","by shareholders, you will receive shares of the Strategic Small"
"9024","Company Fund equivalent in dollar value to your shares in"
"9025","the Developing Growth Fund at the time of the reorganization."
"9026","The Board's recommendation to reorganize the Developing"
"9027","Growth Fund is based primarily on its compatibility with the"
"9028","Strategic Small Company Fund and economies of scale that"
"9029","may be achieved by combining the Funds. Both Funds are"
"9030","advised by Old Mutual Capital, Inc. and both Funds are sub-advised"
"9031","by Copper Rock Capital Partners, LLC.  Currently, Ashfield Capital"
"9032","Partners, LLC (Ashfield) serves as a sub-adviser to the"
"9033","Developing Growth Fund, and Eagle Asset Management, Inc."
"9034","and Liberty Ridge Capital, Inc. (Liberty Ridge) serve as"
"9035","sub-advisers to the Strategic Small Company Fund.  Old Mutual"
"9036","Capital is proposing to shareholders of the Strategic Small"
"9037","Company Fund, by separate proxy, to replace Liberty Ridge"
"9038","with Ashfield as a sub-adviser to the Strategic Small Company"
"9039","Fund.  If the proposal is approved by Strategic Small Company"
"9040","Fund shareholders, Ashfield will replace Liberty Ridge and will"
"9041","begin providing sub-advisory services to the Strategic Small"
"9042","Company Fund on or about February 28, 2009."
"9043","The Developing Growth Fund seeks to provide investors with"
"9044","long-term capital growth and the Strategic Small Company Fund"
"9045","seeks to provide investors with capital growth.  Both Funds"
"9046","seek to achieve their investment objectives by investing in"
"9047","small capitalization companies, and reorganizing the Developing"
"9048","Growth Fund into the Strategic Small Company Fund will enable"
"9049","you to maintain your exposure to small capitalization companies"
"9050","while also enabling you to potentially benefit from the Strategic"
"9051","Small Company Fund's focus on investments in small capitalization"
"9052","companies with growth and value characteristics."
"9053","In addition to the foregoing, the Board recommends reorganizing"
"9054","the Developing Growth Fund so that shareholders may realize"
"9055","additional benefits such as equal or potentially lower expense"
"9056","ratios than the Developing Growth Fund's current expense"
"9057","ratios.  Importantly, the reorganization is designed to be a"
"9058","tax-free reorganization, so you should not realize a tax gain"
"9059","or loss as a direct result of the reorganization.  Additional"
"9060","details about the proposed reorganization are described in"
"9061","the enclosed Proxy Statement."
"9062","This proposal will be presented to shareholders at a special"
"9063","meeting of shareholders to be held on February 27, 2009 in"
"9064","Denver, Colorado. This package contains important information"
"9065","about the proposal, a proxy, a business reply envelope"
"9066","permitting you to vote by mail and simple instructions on how"
"9067","to vote by phone or via the Internet.  We encourage you to read"
"9068","the entire Proxy Statement, which describes the proposal in detail."
"9069","THE DEVELOPING GROWTH FUND'S BOARD HAS CAREFULLY"
"9070","CONSIDERED THE PROPOSAL, BELIEVES THE PROPOSAL TO"
"9071","BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF DEVELOPING GROWTH FUND"
"9072","SHAREHOLDERS, AND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT"
"9073","YOU VOTE FOR THE PROPOSAL."
"9074","You can vote in one of four ways:"

"9080","on your proxy card; or"
"9081","IN PERSON at the Special Meeting of"
"9082","Shareholders on February 27, 2009."

"9084","you own.  If we do not receive sufficient votes to approve the"
"9085","proposal, we may have to send additional mailings or conduct"
"9086","telephone solicitations.  If you have any questions about the"

"9173","of the issued and outstanding shares of the Developing"
"9174","Growth Fund into shares of the Old Mutual Strategic Small"
"9175","Company Fund (Strategic Small Company Fund or a"
"9176","Fund and together with the Developing Growth Fund,"
"9177","the Funds) based upon the net asset values of the two"
"9178","Funds (the Reorganization).  The Strategic Small"
"9179","Company Fund is also a series portfolio of Old Mutual"
"9180","Funds II.  Upon the consummation of the Reorganization,"
"9181","all of the assets and liabilities of the Developing Growth"
"9182","Fund will become assets and liabilities of the Strategic"
"9183","Small Company Fund, and Class A shares of the Developing"
"9184","Growth Fund will be reclassified as Class A shares of"
"9185","the Strategic Small Company Fund, Class C shares of"
"9186","the Developing Growth Fund will be reclassified as"
"9187","Class C shares of the Strategic Small Company"
"9188","Fund, Institutional Class shares of the Developing"
"9189","Growth Fund will be reclassified as Institutional Class"
"9190","shares of the Strategic Small Company Fund, and"
"9191","Class Z shares of the Developing Growth Fund will be"
"9192","reclassified as Class Z shares of the Strategic Small"
"9193","Company Fund.  The value of your account in the Strategic"
"9194","Small Company Fund immediately after the Reorganization"
"9195","will be the same as the value of your account in the"
"9196","Developing Growth Fund immediately before the"
"9197","Reorganization."
"9198","The investment objectives for the Developing Growth"
"9199","Fund and the Strategic Small Company Fund are similar"
"9200","in that the Developing Growth Fund seeks to provide"
"9201","investors with long-term capital growth and the Strategic"
"9202","Small Company Fund seeks to provide investors with"
"9203","capital growth.  Both Funds seek to achieve their investment"
"9204","objectives by investing in small capitalization companies.  While"
"9205","both Funds invest primarily in securities of small capitalization"
"9206","issuers, the Developing Growth Fund seeks to achieve its"
"9207","investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net"
"9208","assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in"
"9209","equity securities of small capitalization companies with"
"9210","growth characteristics at the time of purchase, and the"
"9211","Strategic Small Company Fund seeks to achieve its"
"9212","investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net"
"9213","assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in"
"9214","equity securities of small capitalization companies with"
"9215","growth prospects, value characteristics, or a combination"
"9216","of growth prospects and value characteristics."
"9217","The Developing Growth Fund generally invests in small"
"9218","capitalization companies with an average market"
"9219","capitalization below $2.3 billion, although it may invest in"
"9220","companies outside this range.  The Strategic Small Company"
"9221","Fund invests in small capitalization companies with market"
"9222","capitalizations similar to the companies in the Russell 2000"
"9223","Index.  As of March 31, 2008, the Russell 2000 Index included"
"9224","companies with market capitalizations between $25 million"
"9225","and $6.8 billion.  For additional information regarding the"

"9304","INTRODUCTION"
"9305","The Introduction section of this Prospectus/Proxy Statement"
"9306","provides a brief overview of the key features and other"
"9307","matters typically of interest to shareholders considering"
"9308","a proposed reorganization between mutual funds.  These"
"9309","responses are qualified in their entirety by the remainder"
"9310","of this Prospectus/Proxy Statement, which you should"
"9311","read carefully because it contains additional information"
"9312","and details regarding the proposed reorganization.  The"
"9313","description of the Reorganization is qualified by reference"
"9314","to the full text of the Plan of Reorganization, which is"
"9315","attached as Appendix I."
"9316","A. Questions and Answers Regarding the Reorganization"
"9317","Q.	WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED?"
"9318","A.	The Plan of Reorganization provides for the"
"9319","sale of all the assets and liabilities of the Developing"
"9320","Growth Fund to the Strategic Small Company Fund and"
"9321","the reclassification of the issued and outstanding Developing"
"9322","Growth Fund shares into Strategic Small Company Fund"
"9323","shares.  If shareholders of the Developing Growth Fund approve"
"9324","the Plan of Reorganization and other closing conditions are"
"9325","satisfied, all of the assets and liabilities of the Developing"
"9326","Growth Fund will become the assets and liabilities of the"
"9327","Strategic Small Company Fund, and the issued and outstanding"
"9328","Class A, Class C, Institutional Class and Class Z shares of"
"9329","the Developing Growth Fund will be converted into Class A,"
"9330","Class C, Institutional Class and Class Z shares, respectively,"
"9331","of the Strategic Small Company Fund with an aggregate net"
"9332","asset value equal to the value of the Developing Growth"
"9333","Fund's net assets immediately prior to the Reorganization."
"9334","The value of each Developing Growth Fund shareholder's"
"9335","account in the Strategic Small Company Fund immediately"
"9336","after the Reorganization will be the same as the value"
"9337","of such shareholder's account with Developing Growth"
"9338","Fund immediately prior to the Reorganization."
"9339","Q.	WHY IS THE REORGANIZATION IN THE"
"9340","BEST INTERESTS OF SHAREHOLDERS?"
"9341","A.	The Board of Trustees (the Board) of"
"9342","Old Mutual Funds II, including each of the independent"
"9343","Trustees, determined that the Reorganization would"
"9344","be in the best interests of both Funds and their"
"9345","shareholders based on the following factors, among"
"9346","others:"
"9347","* The compatibility of the investment objectives and"
"9348","principal investment strategies of the two Funds."
"9349","* The continuity of management given that Old Mutual"
"9350","Capital is the adviser to both Funds and Copper Rock"
"9351","Capital Partners, LLC (Copper Rock) is a sub-adviser to"
"9352","both Funds.  Currently, Ashfield Capital Partners, LLC"
"9353","(Ashfield) serves as a sub-adviser to the Developing"
"9354","Growth Fund, and Eagle Asset Management, Inc. (Eagle)"
"9355","and Liberty Ridge Capital, Inc. (Liberty Ridge) serve"
"9356","as sub-advisers to the Strategic Small Company Fund."
"9357","Old Mutual Capital is proposing to shareholders of the"
"9358","Strategic Small Company Fund, by separate proxy, to"
"9359","replace Liberty Ridge with Ashfield as a sub-adviser to"
"9360","the Strategic Small Company Fund.  If the proposal is"
"9361","approved by Strategic Small Company Fund shareholders,"
"9362","Ashfield will replace Liberty Ridge and will begin providing"
"9363","sub-advisory services to the Strategic Small Company"
"9364","Fund on or about February 28, 2009.  If the proposal is"
"9365","not approved by shareholders of the Strategic Small"
"9366","Company Fund, Liberty Ridge will cease providing"
"9367","sub-advisory services to the Strategic Small Company"
"9368","Fund on or about March 31, 2009.  The Board and Old"
"9369","Mutual Capital would then determine what further action"
"9370","to take, which may include recommending a replacement"
"9371","sub-adviser or transferring the portion of the Fund's assets"
"9372","sub-advised by Liberty Ridge to Copper Rock and Eagle."
"9373","* Old Mutual Capital's agreement to reduce the expense"
"9374","limitations for the Strategic Small Company Fund's"
"9375","Class A, Class C, Class Z and Institutional Class"
"9376","shares to 1.55%, 2.30%, 1.30% and 1.05%, respectively,"
"9377","effective upon the consummation of the Reorganization"
"9378","and as a result, shareholders of the Strategic Small"
"9379","Company Fund will benefit from the lower expense"
"9380","limitations."
"9381","* Equal or potentially lower total expense ratios for"
"9382","the combined Fund resulting from increased asset"
"9383","levels and corresponding economies of scale."
"9384","* Old Mutual Capital's belief that the combined Fund"
"9385","will have improved marketability based upon its"
"9386","historical performance record and thus will be better"
"9387","poised to attract new assets and enable shareholders"
"9388","to benefit from economies of scale."
"9389","* The potential operating efficiencies that may result"
"9390","from combining the Funds."
"9391","* The tax-free nature of the Reorganization for Federal"
"9392","income tax purposes, so shareholders should not"
"9393","realize a tax gain or loss as a direct result of the"
"9394","Reorganization."
"9395","Q.	WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE"
"9396","BOARD OF TRUSTEES?"
"9397","A.	The Board recommends that you vote FOR"
"9398","the Reorganization."
"9399","Q.	DO THE FUNDS HAVE THE SAME INVESTMENT"
"9400","OBJECTIVE?"
"9401","A.	The investment objectives for the Developing"
"9402","Growth Fund and the Strategic Small Company Fund are"
"9403","similar in that the Developing Growth Fund seeks to provide"
"9404","investors with long-term capital growth and the Strategic"
"9405","Small Company Fund seeks to provide investors with capital growth."
"9406","Q.	WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES"
"9407","IN THE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND RISKS OF"
"9408","THE FUNDS?"
"9409","A.	While both Funds invest primarily in securities"
"9410","of small capitalization issuers, the Developing Growth"
"9411","Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing"
"9412","in equity securities of small capitalization companies with"
"9413","growth characteristics at the time of purchase, and the"
"9414","Strategic Small Company Fund seeks to achieve its"
"9415","investment objective by investing in equity securities of"
"9416","small capitalization companies with growth prospects, value"
"9417","characteristics, or a combination of growth prospects and"
"9418","value characteristics.  This means that to the extent the"
"9419","Developing Growth Fund focuses its investments in small"
"9420","capitalization issuers with growth characteristics, it may be"
"9421","exposed to greater investment style risk because market"
"9422","performance tends to be cyclical, and during various cycles,"
"9423","certain investment styles may fall in and out of favor."
"9424","The market may not favor the Developing Growth Fund's"
"9425","growth style of investing, and the Developing Growth"
"9426","Fund's returns may vary considerably from other equity"
"9427","funds using different investment styles.  On the other hand,"
"9428","blending growth and value investment styles may cause the"
"9429","Strategic Small Company Fund's returns to be lower than"
"9430","returns of pure growth funds, such as the Developing Growth"
"9431","Fund, during periods when the market favors companies"
"9432","with growth characteristics."
"9433","Q.	HOW DO THE FUNDS COMPARE IN SIZE?"
"9434","A.	As of September 30, 2008, the Developing Growth"
"9435","Fund's net assets were $123.8 million and the Strategic"
"9436","Small Company Fund's net assets were $22.4 million.  The"
"9437","asset size of each Fund fluctuates on a daily basis and the"
"9438","asset size of the Strategic Small Company Fund after the"
"9439","Reorganization may be larger or smaller than the combined"
"9440","assets of the Funds as of September 30, 2008."
"9441","Q.	WILL THE PROPOSED REORGANIZATION RESULT"
"9442","IN HIGHER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES OR OTHER"
"9443","FUND EXPENSES?"
"9444","A.	The management fee for both Funds is 0.95% and"
"9445","will not change upon the closing date of the Reorganization,"
"9446","which is anticipated to occur the close of business on or"
"9447","about March 6, 2009 (the Closing Date).  In addition, Old"
"9448","Mutual Capital has agreed to reduce the expense limitations"
"9449","for the Strategic Small Company Fund's Class A, Class C,"
"9450","Class Z and Institutional Class shares to 1.55%, 2.30%,"
"9451","1.30% and 1.05%, respectively, effective upon the Closing"
"9452","Date, so that they are the same as the expense limitations"
"9453","currently in place for the Developing Growth Fund.  In"
"9454","addition, the projected gross total expense ratios of the"
"9455","Strategic Small Company Fund following the completion"
"9456","of the Reorganization are expected to be equal to or lower"
"9457","than the current expense ratios of the Developing Growth"
"9458","Fund for all share classes except Institutional Class"
"9459","shares, and contractual expense limitations will remain"
"9460","in place through at least December 31, 2009."
"9461","Q.	WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF"
"9462","THE PROPOSED REORGANIZATION?"
"9463","A.	Legal counsel to the Developing Growth Fund"
"9464","and the Strategic Small Company Fund will issue an"
"9465","opinion to Old Mutual Funds II that the Reorganization"
"9466","will constitute a tax-free reorganization for Federal"
"9467","income tax purposes.  Thus, shareholders are not"
"9468","expected to be subject to Federal income taxes as a"
"9469","direct result of the Reorganization."
"9470","Q.	WILL THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY OLD"
"9471","MUTUAL CAPITAL CHANGE?"
"9472","A.	No.  Old Mutual Capital manages the Developing"
"9473","Growth Fund and the Strategic Small Company Fund."
"9474","The custodian, transfer agent and distributor are also"
"9475","the same for both Funds.  Purchase, exchange and"
"9476","redemption privileges are also the same for both Funds."
"9477","Please consult your financial intermediary for information"
"9478","on any services provided by them to the Funds."
"9479","Q.	CAN I CONTINUE TO ADD TO MY DEVELOPING"
"9480","GROWTH FUND ACCOUNT?"
"9481","A.	Yes.  Developing Growth Fund shareholders"
"9482","may continue to make investments in the Developing"
"9483","Growth Fund before the closing date of the Reorganization."
"9484","Q.	WHAT HAPPENS IF THE REORGANIZATION"
"9485","IS NOT APPROVED?"
"9486","A.	Any shares you held in the Developing Growth"
"9487","Fund would remain Developing Growth Fund shares."
"9488","The Developing Growth Fund and the Strategic Small"
"9489","Company Fund would each continue to operate separately"
"9490","and the Board would determine what further action,"
"9491","if any, to take."
"9492","Q.	WILL EITHER FUND PAY FOR THE PROXY"
"9493","SOLICITATION, LEGAL AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED"
"9494","WITH THE PROPOSED REORGANIZATION?"
"9495","A.	The Funds will pay all costs and expenses"
"9496","associated with the Reorganization, subject to current"
"9497","expense limitations.  Costs associated with the Reorganization"
"9498","generally include printing and mailing costs, solicitation"
"9499","costs, legal costs, costs paid to the Funds' independent"
"9500","registered public accounting firm, and other miscellaneous"
"9501","costs.  All costs and expenses associated with the"
"9502","Reorganization will be allocated between the Funds on"
"9503","a pro rata basis based on each Fund's relative net assets."
"9504","The anticipated costs of the reorganization are"
"9505","approximately $51,196."
"9506","Q.	IF APPROVED, WHEN WILL THE PROPOSED"
"9507","REORGANIZATION TAKE PLACE?"
"9508","A.	If approved, the Reorganization will be effective"
"9509","the close of business on or about March 6, 2009, or as soon"
"9510","as reasonably practicable after shareholder approval is"
"9511","obtained.  Shortly after completion of the Reorganization,"
"9512","shareholders will receive a confirmation statement reflecting"
"9513","their new Strategic Small Company Fund account number and"
"9514","number of shares owned."
"9515","Q.	WHAT IF I WANT TO EXCHANGE MY SHARES FOR"
"9516","ANOTHER OLD MUTUAL FUND PRIOR TO THE REORGANIZATION?"
"9517","A.	You may exchange your shares into other"
"9518","mutual funds advised by Old Mutual Capital (each an"
"9519","Old Mutual Fund) before the Closing Date by calling"
"9520","888-772-2888 or contacting your financial intermediary."
"9521","If you choose to exchange your Developing Growth Fund"
"9522","shares for another Old Mutual Fund, your request will be"
"9523","treated as a normal exchange of shares and will be a taxable"
"9524","transaction unless your shares are held in a tax-deferred"
"9525","account, such as an IRA.  If you exchange your shares before"
"9526","the date of the Special Meeting or any adjournments thereof,"
"9527","you will still be asked to cast your vote on the Reorganization."
"9528","Q.	HOW MANY VOTES AM I ENTITLED TO CAST?"
"9529","A.	Shareholders of record as of the close of business"
"9530","on December 10, 2008 (the Record Date) are entitled to vote"
"9531","at the Special Meeting.  You are entitled to one vote for each"
"9532","dollar (and a proportionate fractional vote for each fractional"
"9533","dollar) of net asset value of shares held in your name as"
"9534","determined as of the Record Date."
"9535","Q.	HOW CAN I VOTE MY SHARES?"
"9536","A.	You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting or"
"9537","any adjournments thereof if you owned shares of the Developing"
"9538","Growth Fund as of the close of business on December 10, 2008."
"9539","If you attend the Special Meeting or any adjournments thereof,"
"9540","you may vote your shares in person.  Whether or not you"
"9541","intend to attend the Special Meeting or any adjournments"
"9542","thereof in person, you may vote in any of the following ways:"

"9551","on the Internet by accessing the website listed on your"

"9554","Q.	IF I VOTE MY PROXY NOW, CAN I CHANGE MY"

"9557","it at any time prior to its exercise by executing a superseding"
"9558","proxy or by submitting a notice of revocation to the"
"9559","Secretary of Old Mutual Funds II.  In addition, although"
"9560","mere attendance at the Special Meeting will not revoke"
"9561","a proxy, if you attend the Special Meeting you may"
"9562","withdraw your proxy and vote in person."
"9563","Q.	WHAT IS THE REQUIRED VOTE TO APPROVE"
"9564","THE PROPOSED REORGANIZATION?"
"9565","A.	At the Special Meeting, a quorum being present,"
"9566","approval of the Reorganization requires the affirmative"
"9567","vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities"
"9568","of the Developing Growth Fund as defined by the"
"9569","Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the"
"9570","1940 Act).  This means the affirmative vote of"
"9571","the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of the voting securities of"
"9572","Developing Growth Fund present or represented by proxy at the"
"9573","Special Meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the"
"9574","outstanding voting securities of Developing Growth Fund are"
"9575","present or represented by proxy; or (b) more than 50% of the"
"9576","outstanding voting securities of Developing Growth Fund."
"9577","Q.	WHOM SHOULD I CALL FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION"
"9578","ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS/PROXY STATEMENT?"
"9579","A.	Please call the proxy solicitor, Broadridge, at"
"9580","866-615-7269 to obtain additional information regarding"
"9581","the proposed Reorganization."
"9582","B. Comparison of Investment Objectives and Policies"
"9583","The investment objectives of the Developing Growth Fund"
"9584","and the Strategic Small Company Fund are similar in that"
"9585","both Funds invest primarily in small capitalization"
"9586","companies.  The Developing Growth Fund seeks to"
"9587","provide investors with long-term capital growth by"
"9588","investing in equity securities of small capitalization companies"
"9589","with growth characteristics at the time of purchase, and the"
"9590","Strategic Small Company Fund seeks to provide investors"
"9591","with capital growth by investing in small capitalization"
"9592","companies with growth prospects, value characteristics, or"
"9593","a combination of growth prospects and value characteristics."
"9594","The Strategic Small Company Fund's focus on companies"
"9595","with both growth and value characteristics may make that"
"9596","Fund less susceptible to investment style risk than the"
"9597","Developing Growth Fund, which focuses wholly on growth"
"9598","stocks.  However, this strategy may cause the returns of"
"9599","the Strategic Small Company Fund to be lower than"
"9600","returns of pure growth funds, such as the Developing"
"9601","Growth Fund, during periods when the market favors"
"9602","companies with growth characteristics."
"9603","The Developing Growth Fund generally invests in small"
"9604","capitalization companies with an average market capitalization"
"9605","below $2.3 billion, although it may invest in companies"
"9606","outside this range.  The Strategic Small Company Fund"
"9607","normally invests in small capitalization companies with"
"9608","market capitalizations similar to the companies in the"
"9609","Russell 2000 Index, which as of March 31, 2008, included"
"9610","companies with market capitalizations between $25 million"
"9611","and $6.8 billion.  The market capitalizations of the companies"
"9612","in the Funds' portfolios and the Russell 2000 Index change"
"9613","over time and the Funds will not automatically sell or stop"
"9614","buying stock of a company they already own if the company's"
"9615","market capitalization grows or falls out of the stated ranges."
"9616","Both Funds are advised by Old Mutual Capital and both"
"9617","Funds are sub-advised by Copper Rock.  Currently, Ashfield"
"9618","serves as a sub-adviser to the Developing Growth Fund,"
"9619","and Eagle Asset Management, Inc. and Liberty Ridge"
"9620","Capital, Inc. (Liberty Ridge) serve as sub-advisers to"
"9621","the Strategic Small Company Fund.  Old Mutual Capital is"
"9622","proposing to shareholders of the Strategic Small Company"
"9623","Fund, by separate proxy, to replace Liberty Ridge with"
"9624","Ashfield as a sub-adviser to the Strategic Small Company"
"9625","Fund.  If the proposal is approved by Strategic Small Company"
"9626","Fund shareholders, Ashfield will replace Liberty Ridge"
"9627","and will begin providing sub-advisory services to the Strategic"
"9628","Small Company Fund on or about February 28, 2009."
"9629","If the proposal is not approved by shareholders of the"
"9630","Strategic Small Company Fund, Liberty Ridge will cease"
"9631","providing sub-advisory services to the Strategic Small"
"9632","Company Fund on or about March 31, 2009. The Board and"
"9633","Old Mutual Capital would then determine what further action"
"9634","to take, which may include recommending a replacement"
"9635","sub-adviser or transferring the portion of the Fund's assets"
"9636","sub-advised by Liberty Ridge to Copper Rock and Eagle."
"9637","Reorganizing the Developing Growth Fund into the Strategic"
"9638","Small Company Fund will enable you to maintain your"
"9639","exposure to small capitalization companies while also"
"9640","enabling you to potentially benefit from the Strategic"
"9641","Small Company Fund's focus on investments in small"
"9642","capitalization companies with growth and value"
"9643","characteristics."
"9644","The annual portfolio turnover rate for the Developing"
"9645","Growth Fund was 198.93% for the fiscal year ended"
"9646","March 31, 2008.  The Strategic Small Company Fund's portfolio"
"9647","turnover rate for the same period was 142.78%.  A fund with a"
"9648","higher rate of portfolio turnover will result in higher"
"9649","transaction costs and may result in additional taxes for"
"9650","shareholders as compared to a fund with less portfolio turnover."
"9651","C. Comparison of Risk Factors"
"9652","Each Fund may invest in various types of securities or"
"9653","use certain investment techniques to achieve"
"9654","its investment objective. The following is a summary"
"9655","of the principal risks associated with such"
"9656","securities and investment techniques. Additional"
"9657","information about these risks is included in"
"9658","the Funds' prospectus. As with any security, an"
"9659","investment in either Fund involves certain risks, including loss of principal."
"9660","An investment in the Funds is not a deposit of a"
"9661","bank and is not insured by the Federal Deposit"
"9662","Insurance Corporation or any other government agency."
"9663","The fact that a particular risk is not identified does"
"9664","not indicate that a Fund does not invest"
"9665","its assets in, or is precluded from investing its assets"
"9666","in, securities that give rise to that risk."
"9667","       Similar Risk Factors of the Funds"
"9668","Like all investments in securities, you risk losing money by"
"9669","investing in the Funds.  The main risks of investing in each"
"9670","Fund are as follows:"
"9671","Stock Market Risk.  The value of the stocks and other"
"9672","securities"
"9673","owned by the Funds will fluctuate depending on"
"9674","the performance of the companies that issued them, general"
"9675","market and economic conditions, and investor confidence."
"9676","The market may also fail to recognize a Sub-Adviser's"
"9677","determination of an investment's value or a Sub-Adviser"
"9678","may misgauge that value."
"9679","Small Company Risk.  The Funds invest primarily in"
"9680","small-capitalization companies.  While small-capitalization"
"9681","companies may offer greater potential for capital"
"9682","appreciation than larger more established companies,"
"9683","they may also involve greater risk of loss and price fluctuation."
"9684","The trading markets for securities of small-capitalization"
"9685","issuers may be less liquid and more volatile than"
"9686","securities of larger companies.  This means that the Funds"
"9687","could have greater difficulty buying or selling a security"
"9688","of a small-capitalization issuer at an acceptable price,"
"9689","especially in periods of market volatility."
"9690","Industry and Sector Risk.  Companies that have similar lines"
"9691","of business are grouped together in broad categories"
"9692","called industries.  Certain industries are grouped together in"
"9693","broader categories called sectors.  The Funds may focus"
"9694","their investments in certain industries within certain"
"9695","sectors, which may cause the Funds' performance to"
"9696","be susceptible to the economic, business or other developments"
"9697","that affect those industries."
"9698","       Primary Differences in Risk Factors of the Funds"
"9699","Investment Style Risk.  Market performance tends to be"
"9700","cyclical, and during various cycles, certain investment"
"9701","styles may fall in and out of favor.  The market may not favor the"
"9702","Developing Growth Fund's growth style of investing, and"
"9703","the Developing Growth Fund's returns may vary considerably"
"9704","from other equity funds using different investment styles."
"9705","More information regarding the risks of investing in the"
"9706","Funds is included in the Old Mutual Funds II prospectus."
"9707","D. Comparison of Pricing, Purchase and Redemption Policies,"
"9708","Sales Charges, and Distribution"
"9709","Shares of the Developing Growth Fund and the Strategic"
"9710","Small Company Fund are distributed by Old Mutual Investment"
"9711","Partners (OMIP or the Distributor), a wholly-owned"
"9712","subsidiary of Old Mutual Capital.  The Distributor receives"
"9713","no compensation for serving in such capacity, except as"
"9714","provided in separate distribution plans, adopted pursuant to Ru"
"9715","le 12b-1 of the 1940 Act for each Fund's Class A and Class"
"9716","C shares, and service plans which enable the Funds to"
"9717","directly and indirectly bear certain expenses relating to the"
"9718","distribution and sale of shares and services provided to"
"9719","shareholders.  Pursuant to 12b-1 plans, both the Developing"
"9720","Growth Fund and the Strategic Small Company Fund"
"9721","pay OMIP a service fee at an annual rate of 0.25% of the"
"9722","average daily net assets attributable to Class A shares"
"9723","and a distribution fee and service fee at an annual combined"
"9724","rate of 1.00% of the average daily net assets attributable"
"9725"," to Class C shares.  Because these fees are paid out of the"
"9726","assets of Class A and Class C on an ongoing basis,"
"9727","over time these fees will increase the cost of your investment"
"9728","and may cost you more than paying other types of"
"9729","sales charges.  For more information on distribution"
"9730","and service fees, refer to the Old Mutual Funds II prospectus."
"9731","The Funds have the same procedures for calculating"
"9732","share price and valuing portfolio securities, and the"
"9733","same policies regarding excessive or short term trading."
"9734","These policies and procedures are described in"
"9735","the following sections."
"9736","       Share Price"
"9737","The price you pay for a share of a Fund and the price"
"9738","you receive upon selling or redeeming a share of a"
"9739","Fund is called the net asset value (NAV).  NAV per"
"9740","share class of a Fund is calculated by dividing the"
"9741","total net assets of each class of a Fund by the total"
"9742","number of the classes' shares outstanding of that Fund."
"9743","NAV is determined as of the close of regular trading on the New"
"9744","York Stock Exchange (the NYSE)"
"9745","(normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on each day that"
"9746","the NYSE is open. NAV is not calculated, and"
"9747","you may not conduct Fund transactions, on days"
"9748","the NYSE is closed (generally weekends and New"
"9749","Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents'"
"9750","Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day,"
"9751","Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day)."
"9752","Your purchase, exchange, or redemption of a Fund's"
"9753","shares will be priced at the next NAV calculated after"
"9754","your request is received in good order by the Fund's transfer"
"9755","agent or other Fund agents.  Shares begin to earn dividends"
"9756","on the first business day following the day of purchase.  Shares earn"
"9757","dividends until the day of redemption.  The NAV of your"
"9758","shares when redeemed may be more or less than the price you"
"9759","originally paid, depending primarily upon the Fund's"
"9760","investment performance.  If a Fund invests in another investment"
"9761","company, that Fund's NAV is based in part on the NAV"
"9762","of the other investment companies in which the Fund invests."
"9763","The prospectuses for these other investment companies"
"9764","explain the circumstances under which they may use fair value"
"9765","pricing and its effects."
"9766","The Trust may enter into agreements with broker-dealers,"
"9767","financial institutions, retirement plan accounts, trading"
"9768","platforms, certain fee-based programs, or other service"
"9769","providers (financial intermediaries) that may include the"
"9770","Funds as an investment alternative in the programs they offer or"
"9771","administer.  If you buy shares through a financial intermediary,"
"9772","generally your order must be received by the financial"
"9773","intermediary and transmitted to OMIP or its designee"
"9774","by the close of regular trading on the NYSE in order for you to"
"9775","receive that day's offering price.  Otherwise, the order will"
"9776","receive the offering price that is determined on the next"
"9777","day the NYSE is open.  The Trust and financial"
"9778","intermediaries reserve the right to reject customer orders"
"9779","that are incomplete or otherwise not in good order."
"9780","Financial intermediaries may also accept certain"
"9781","customer orders conditioned on the understanding"
"9782","that the orders may later be rejected in the event they"
"9783"," cannot be transmitted to OMIP or its designee in a timely manner."
"9784","The Trust will be deemed to have received a purchase"
"9785","or redemption order from authorized financial intermediaries"
"9786","(authorized financial intermediaries) when the financial"
"9787","intermediary, or its authorized designee, accepts the order."
"9788","The customer order will be priced at the Fund's NAV next"
"9789","computed after such order is unconditionally accepted by"
"9790","an authorized financial intermediary or its authorized"
"9791","designee."
"9792","       Valuing Portfolio Securities"
"9793","The Funds use pricing services to determine the market"
"9794","value of the securities in their portfolios.  Except as"
"9795","discussed below, the Funds generally use the market price of"
"9796","securities as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE to value"
"9797","equity securities held in the Funds' portfolios, except"
"9798","that securities traded primarily on the NASDAQ Stock Market"
"9799","(NASDAQ) are normally valued by the Fund at the NASDAQ"
"9800","Official Closing Price provided by NASDAQ each business day."
"9801","Short-term investments in the Funds are priced at amortized"
"9802","cost, which approximates market value.  The market value of"
"9803","bonds is determined based on an evaluated price."
"9804","If a Fund holds securities quoted in foreign currencies,"
"9805","it translates that price into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates."
"9806","Because foreign markets may be open at different times"
"9807","than the NYSE, the price of a Fund's shares may"
"9808","change on days when its shares are not available"
"9809","for purchase or sale.  If a market quotation is not readily available"
"9810","or is believed to be unreliable, the security is valued at"
"9811","fair value pursuant to procedures approved by the Board."
"9812","       Fair Value Pricing"
"9813","The Funds have fair value pricing procedures in place,"
"9814","and a Valuation Committee meets as necessary to value"
"9815","securities in appropriate circumstances that may include,"
"9816","but are not limited to, when a market price is believed to be"
"9817","unreliable, is unavailable, or if Fund assets have been"
"9818","affected by events occurring after the close of trading of a"
"9819","securities market, but before a Fund calculates its NAV."
"9820","By fair valuing a security whose price may have been"
"9821","affected by events occurring after the close of trading in its"
"9822","respective market, a Fund attempts to establish a price that it"
"9823","might reasonably expect to receive upon its current sale of that"
"9824","security.  These methods are designed to help ensure that the"
"9825","prices at which Fund shares are purchased and redeemed are"
"9826","fair, and do not result in dilution of shareholder interest or other"
"9827","harm to shareholders.  In addition, fair value pricing is"
"9828","a helpful tool in preventing excessive short-term trading activity"
"9829","because it may make it more difficult for potentially"
"9830","disruptive shareholders to determine if pricing inefficiencies"
"9831","exist in a Fund's securities.  The valuation assigned to fair"
"9832","valued securities for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV"
"9833","may differ from the security's most recent closing market price"
"9834","and from the prices used by other mutual funds to calculate"
"9835","their NAVs.  Although intended to do so, the fair value"
"9836","procedures may not always better represent the price at"
"9837","which the Fund could sell the fair valued security and may not"
"9838","always result in a more accurate NAV."
"9839","       Policy Regarding Excessive or Short-Term Trading"
"9840","While the Funds provide shareholders with daily liquidity,"
"9841","they are intended to be long-term investment vehicles and"
"9842","are not designed for investors that engage in short-term trading"
"9843","activity, market-timing, or other abusive trading practices."
"9844","Short-term trading, market-timing, or other abusive trading"
"9845","practices may disrupt portfolio management strategies, may"
"9846","drive Fund expenses higher, and may harm Fund performance."
"9847","In particular, frequent trading of Fund shares may:"
"9848","* cause a Fund to keep more assets in cash or cash equivalents"
"9849","than it otherwise would, causing the Fund to miss out on"
"9850","investment opportunities;"
"9851","* force a Fund to sell some of its investments sooner than"
"9852","it otherwise would in order to honor redemptions;"
"9853","* increase brokerage commissions and other portfolio transaction"
"9854","expenses if securities are constantly being bought and sold by a"
"9855","Fund as assets move in or out; or"
"9856","* dilute the value of Fund shares held by long-term shareholders."
"9857","The Trust, Old Mutual Capital, and their agents, will not"
"9858","knowingly permit investors to excessively trade the Funds,"
"9859","although no guarantees can be made that all such trading will"
"9860","be identified and restricted.  Purchase and sale orders may be"
"9861","received through financial intermediaries.  The Trust, Old"
"9862","Mutual Capital, and their agents cannot always know or"
"9863","reasonably detect short-term trading through financial"
"9864","intermediaries, or through the use of omnibus accounts"
"9865","by financial intermediaries."
"9866","To minimize harm to the Funds and their shareholders,"
"9867","the Trust, Old Mutual Capital, and their agents reserve"
"9868","the right to reject any purchase order, including exchange"
"9869","purchases, for any reason without prior notice."
"9870","The Board has adopted, and Old Mutual Capital and its"
"9871","affiliates (collectively, for purposes of this section Policy Regarding"
"9872","Excessive or Short-Term Trading, Old Mutual
Capital) and their agents have implemented the following"
"9873","tools designed to discourage excessive short-term trading in the Funds:"
"9874","* trade activity monitoring;"
"9875","* trading guidelines for certain retail mutual funds advised"
"9876","by Old Mutual Capital;"
"9877","* a redemption/exchange fee on short-term trades in certain"
"9878","retail mutual funds advised by Old Mutual Capital; and"
"9879","* selective use of fair value pricing."
"9880","These tools are described in more detail below except fair"
"9881","value pricing, which is described above.  Although these tools"
"9882","are designed to discourage short-term trading, none of"
"9883","these tools alone nor all of them taken together eliminate the"
"9884","possibility that short-term trading activity in the"
"9885","Funds will occur.  Moreover, each of these tools other than"
"9886","the redemption/exchange fee involves judgments that are"
"9887","inherently subjective.  Old Mutual Capital and its agents seek"
"9888","to make these judgments to the best of their abilities in"
"9889","a manner that they believe is consistent with long-term"
"9890","shareholder interests.  For purposes of applying these tools,"
"9891","Old Mutual Capital and its agents may consider an"
"9892","investor's trading history in the retail mutual funds"
"9893","advised by Old Mutual Capital (together referred to"
"9894","as the Old Mutual Funds), other funds, and accounts"
"9895","under common ownership, influence or control.  Old"
"9896","Mutual Capital and the Funds may modify these procedures in"
"9897","response to changing regulatory requirements"
"9898","or to enhance the effectiveness of the procedures."
"9899","       Trade Activity Monitoring"
"9900","The Trust or its agent has entered into a shareholder"
"9901","information agreement with each of its Financial Intermediaries,"
"9902","as such term is defined by Rule 22c-2 under the Investment"
"9903","Company Act of 1940, as amended, pursuant to which such"
"9904","Financial Intermediaries are obligated to provide individual"
"9905","shareholder transaction information to the Trust or its agents"
"9906","for the purpose of monitoring individual shareholder trading"
"9907","activity.  Old Mutual Capital and its agents monitor selected"
"9908","trades in an effort to detect excessive short-term trading"
"9909","activities.  If, as a result of this monitoring, Old Mutual Capital"
"9910","or one of its agents determines that a shareholder has"
"9911","engaged in excessive short-term trading, it will (i) advise the"
"9912","shareholder or use its best efforts to work with the Financial"
"9913","Intermediary that holds the account to inform the shareholder"
"9914","that he or she must stop such activities, and (ii) use its best"
"9915","efforts to refuse to process purchases or exchanges in the"
"9916","shareholder's account other than exchanges into an affiliated"
"9917","money market fund (if available).  Determining whether a"
"9918","shareholder has engaged in excessive short-term trading"
"9919","involves judgments that are inherently subjective.  In making"
"9920","such judgments, Old Mutual Capital and its agents seek to act"
"9921","in a manner that they believe is consistent with the best"
"9922","interests of Old Mutual Fund shareholders."
"9923","The ability of Old Mutual Capital and its agents to monitor"
"9924","trades that are placed by the underlying shareholders of"
"9925","omnibus accounts that are held by intermediaries other than"
"9926","Financial Intermediaries (Second-Tier Intermediaries) may"
"9927","be limited because Second-Tier Intermediaries may choose not"
"9928","to disclose individual shareholder transaction information,"
"9929","or may not disclose such information in a timely"
"9930","manner upon the Trust's request.  Old Mutual Capital and"
"9931","its agents rely on Financial Intermediaries and the willingness,"
"9932","ability and rights of Second-Tier Intermediaries to monitor"
"9933","trading activity in omnibus accounts and/or enforce the Funds'"
"9934","excessive short-term trading policy.  Old Mutual Capital"
"9935","and its agents will attempt to apply the excessive short-term"
"9936","trading policy uniformly to all accounts."
"9937","       Trading Guidelines"
"9938","If a shareholder exceeds four exchanges out of an Old Mutual"
"9939","Fund (other than the Old Mutual Cash Reserves Fund) per"
"9940","calendar year, or if the Trust, Old Mutual Capital, or one of"
"9941","their agents, determines that a shareholder's short-term"
"9942","trading activity is excessive (regardless of whether or not"
"9943","such shareholder exceeds such guidelines), the Trust will"
"9944","not knowingly accept any additional purchase and exchange"
"9945","orders from such shareholder.  The Trust, Old Mutual Capital,"
"9946","and their agents may accept exchanges that are detected"
"9947","under these guidelines if they believe that such transactions"
"9948","are not short-term trading activity, for legitimate trading"
"9949","purposes and consistent with the best interests of long-term"
"9950","shareholders. Using the proceeds from the redemption of"
"9951","shares of one Old Mutual Fund to purchase shares of one"
"9952","or more other Old Mutual Funds is considered a single exchange."
"9953","The Trust may permit exceptions to the four exchange limit"
"9954","for wrap accounts that can demonstrate they are"
"9955","following a bona fide asset allocation program."
"9956","Transactions placed through the same financial intermediary"
"9957","on an omnibus basis may be deemed part of a group for"
"9958","purposes of this policy and may be rejected in whole or in part."
"9959","Transactions accepted by a financial intermediary in violation"
"9960","of the short-term trading policy are not deemed"
"9961","accepted by the Fund and may be cancelled or revoked."
"9962","Old Mutual Capital and its agents may also suspend or terminate"
"9963","a shareholder's exchange privileges if a shareholder"
"9964","engages in a disruptive pattern of exchanges.  The Trust and"
"9965","Old Mutual Capital also reserve the right to delay delivery"
"9966","of redemption proceeds for up to 7 days or to honor certain"
"9967","redemptions with securities rather than cash."
"9968","       Redemption/Exchange Fee"
"9969","The Funds impose a 2.00% redemption/exchange fee on total"
"9970","redemption proceeds before applicable deferred sales charges"
"9971","of any shareholder redeeming shares, including redemption by"
"9972","exchange, of the Funds within 10 calendar days of their purchase."
"9973","The Funds will impose a redemption/exchange fee"
"9974","to the extent that the number of Fund shares redeemed"
"9975","exceeds the number of Fund shares that"
"9976","have been held for more than 10 calendar days."
"9977","In determining how long shares of a Fund have been"
"9978","held, Old Mutual Capital assumes that shares held"
"9979","by the investor for the longest period of time will be sold first."
"9980","A Fund will retain the redemption/exchange fee for the"
"9981","benefit of the remaining shareholders.  Due to operational"
"9982","requirements, certain financial intermediaries' methods for"
"9983","tracking and calculating the fee may differ in some respects"
"9984","from the Funds' methods for tracking and calculating the fee."
"9985","The Funds charge the redemption/exchange fee to"
"9986","discourage market-timing by those shareholders"
"9987","initiating redemptions or exchanges to take advantage of short-term"
"9988","market movements, to help minimize the impact the"
"9989","redemption or exchange may have on the performance of a Fund,"
"9990","to facilitate Fund management, and to offset certain"
"9991","transaction costs and other expenses a Fund incurs because of the"
"9992","redemption or exchange."
"9993","The Funds will not charge the 2.00% redemption/exchange fee"
"9994","on transactions involving the following:"
"9995","* total or partial redemptions of shares by omnibus"
"9996","accounts maintained by financial intermediaries such as"
"9997","broker-dealers and retirement plans and their service"
"9998","providers that do not have the systematic capability to"
"9999","process the fee;"
"10000","* total or partial redemptions of shares by omnibus"
"10001","accounts maintained by financial intermediaries such as"
"10002","broker-dealers and retirement plans and their service"
"10003","providers that have negotiated pre-existing legal covenants"
"10004","and agreements with the Funds to waive or not to impose the fee;"
"10005","* total or partial redemptions effectuated pursuant to an"
"10006","automatic non-discretionary rebalancing program or a"
"10007","systematic withdrawal plan established with the"
"10008","Funds or a financial intermediary;"
"10009","* redemptions of shares from employer-sponsored retirement"

"10835","In general, if you are a taxable investor, Fund distributions"
"10836","(other than a return of capital) are taxable to you at either"
"10837","ordinary income or capital gains tax rates.  This is true whether"
"10838","you reinvest your distributions in additional Fund shares"
"10839","or receive them in cash."
"10840","The tax status of your distributions for each calendar year"

"10865","* Distributions of net investment income and net short-term"
"10866","capital gains are taxable to you as ordinary income. If you are a"
"10867","n individual or other non-corporate shareholder and meet"
"10868","certain holding period requirements, a portion of income dividends"
"10869","paid by a Fund may be designated as qualified"
"10870","dividend income eligible for taxation at long-term capital gain rates."
"10871","* Distributions of net long-term capital gains are taxable to"
"10872","you as long-term capital gains no matter how long you have owned your shares."
"10873","* Distributions declared to shareholders with a record date in"
"10874","December - if paid to you by the end of January - are taxable for"
"10875","Federal income tax purposes as if received in December."
"10876","* A sale or exchange of Fund shares is a taxable event. This"
"10877","means that you may have a capital gain or loss (provided the shares"
"10878","are held as a capital asset), which will be short-term"
"10879","if you held your shares for 12 months or less and long-term if you"
"10880","held your shares for more than 12 months."
"10881","* Fund distributions and gains from the sale or exchange of"
"10882","your Fund shares generally are subject to state and local taxes."
"10883","* If you invest in a Fund shortly before it makes a capital gain"
"10884","distribution, the distribution will lower the value of the Fund's shares"
"10885","by the amount of the distribution and, in effect,"
"10886","you will receive some of your investment back in the form of a taxable"
"10887","distribution. This is sometimes referred to as"
"10888","buying a dividend because, although the distribution is in effect a"
"10889","return of a portion of the purchase price, it is taxable."
"10890","By law, if you do not provide a Fund with your proper taxpayer"
"10891","identification number and certain required certifications, you may"
"10892","be subject to backup withholding on any distributions"
"10893","of income, capital gains, or proceeds from the sale of your shares."
"10894","A Fund also must withhold if the IRS instructs it to"
"10895","do so. When withholding is required, the amount will be 28% of any"
"10896","distributions or proceeds paid."
"10897","Fund shares are generally not sold outside the U.S. Foreign"
"10898","investors should be aware that U.S. withholding, special certification"
"10899","requirements to avoid U.S. backup withholding"
"10900","and claim any treaty benefits, and estate taxes may apply to"
"10901","any investment in the Fund. If you are not a citizen or resident"

"11523","asked to approve the Plan of Reorganization, which sets forth the"
"11524","terms and conditions under which the Reorganization"
"11525","will be implemented.  The Plan of Reorganization provides"
"11526","for the sale of all the assets and liabilities of the Developing"
"11527","Growth Fund to the Strategic Small Company Fund and the"
"11528","reclassification of the issued and outstanding Developing"
"11529","Growth Fund shares into Strategic Small Company Fund shares."
"11530","If shareholders of the Developing Growth Fund"
"11531","approve the Plan of Reorganization and other closing conditions"
"11532","are satisfied, all of the assets and liabilities of the Developing"
"11533","Growth Fund will become the assets and liabilities"
"11534","of the Strategic Small Company Fund, and the issued and"
"11535","outstanding Class A, Class C, Institutional Class and Class Z"
"11536","shares of the Developing Growth Fund will be converted"
"11537","into Class A, Class C, Institutional Class and Class Z shares,"
"11538","respectively, of the Strategic Small Company Fund that"
"11539","have a net asset value equal to the value of the Developing Growth"
"11540","Fund net assets immediately prior to the Reorganization."
"11541","The value of each Developing Growth Fund shareholder's"
"11542","account in the Strategic Small Company Fund immediately"
"11543","after the Reorganization will be the same as the value of such"
"11544","shareholder's account with Developing Growth Fund"
"11545","immediately prior to the Reorganization."
"11546","The value of the Developing Growth Fund's assets to be"
"11547","acquired and the amount of its liabilities to be"
"11548","assumed by the Strategic Small Company Fund and the NAV of a share of"
"11549","the Developing Growth Fund will be determined"
"11550","as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE on the Closing Date, after"
"11551","the declaration of any dividends on the Closing"
"11552","Date, and will be determined in accordance with the valuation procedures"
"11553","described in the Trust's and the Funds' currently"
"11554","effective prospectus and statement of additional information."
"11555","The Closing Date is expected to occur the close of"
"11556","business on or about March 6, 2009."
"11557","As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the Developing"
"11558","Growth Fund will distribute pro rata to its shareholders"
"11559","of record the shares of the Strategic Small Company Fund it"
"11560","receives in the Reorganization, so that each shareholder"
"11561","of the Developing Growth Fund will receive a number of full and"
"11562","fractional shares of the Strategic Small Company Fund"
"11563","equal in value to his or her holdings in the Developing Growth Fund,"
"11564","and the Developing Growth Fund will be terminated."

"11567","names of each owner of record of the Developing Growth Fund and by"
"11568","crediting thereto the respective number of shares"
"11569","of the Strategic Small Company Fund due such owner. Accordingly,"
"11570","immediately after the Reorganization, each former"
"11571","shareholder of the Developing Growth Fund will own shares"
"11572","of the Strategic Small Company Fund that will be"
"11573","equal to the value of that shareholder's shares of the"

"11575","Any special options (for example, automatic investment"

"11577","will automatically transfer to the new accounts."
"11578","The implementation of the Reorganization is subject to a"
"11579","number of conditions as set forth in the Plan of"
"11580","Reorganization, including approval of the shareholders of the Developing"
"11581","Growth Fund. The Plan of Reorganization also requires"
"11582","receipt of a tax opinion indicating that, for federal income tax"
"11583","purposes, the Reorganization qualifies as a tax-free"
"11584","reorganization. The Plan of Reorganization may be terminated and"
"11585","the Reorganization abandoned at any time prior"
"11586","to the Closing Date by the Board if it is determined that the"
"11587","Reorganization would disadvantage either of the Funds. Please review"
"11588","the Plan of Reorganization carefully. A copy of the"
"11589","Plan of Reorganization is attached as Appendix I"
"11590","to this Prospectus/Proxy Statement."
"11591","B. Reasons for the Reorganization"
"11592","The Board of Old Mutual Funds II, including each of"
"11593","the independent Trustees, determined that the reorganization"
"11594","of the Developing Growth Fund into the Strategic Small Company"
"11595","Fund would be in the best interests of both Funds and their"
"11596","shareholders and that the interests of the shareholders"
"11597","of each Fund would not be diluted as a result of the Reorganization."
"11598","In evaluating the proposed Reorganization, the Board"
"11599","considered a number of factors, including:"
"11600","* The compatibility of the investment objectives and"
"11601","principal investment strategies of the two Funds."
"11602","* The relative size and investment performance of each Fund."
"11603","* That capital loss carryforwards available to offset"
"11604","future capital gains of the Developing Growth Fund would"
"11605","succeed to the Strategic Small Company Fund assuming the"
"11606","Reorganization qualifies as a reorganization under Section"
"11607","368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended."
"11608","* Whether the interests of either Fund's current shareholders"
"11609","would be diluted in connection with the proposed Reorganization."
"11610","* The potential benefits of the Reorganization to shareholders"
"11611","of each Fund."
"11612","* The continuity of management given that Old Mutual Capital"
"11613","is the adviser to both Funds and Copper Rock is a sub-adviser to"
"11614","both Funds.  In addition, Old Mutual Capital"
"11615","is proposing to add Ashfield, currently a sub-adviser to the"
"11616","Developing Growth Fund, as a sub-adviser to the Strategic"
"11617","Small Company Fund.  If the proposal is approved by Strategic"
"11618","Small Company Fund shareholders, Ashfield will begin providing"
"11619","sub-advisory services to the Strategic Small Company Fund"
"11620","on or about February 28, 2009."
"11621","* Old Mutual Capital's agreement to reduce the expense"
"11622","limitations for the Strategic Small Company Fund's Class"
"11623","A, Class C, Institutional Class and Class Z shares to"
"11624","1.55%, 2.30%, 1.05% and 1.30%, respectively."
"11625","* Equal or potentially lower total expense ratio for the"
"11626","combined Fund resulting from increased asset levels"
"11627","and corresponding economies of scale."
"11628","* Old Mutual Capital's belief that the combined Fund will"
"11629","have improved marketability based upon its historical"
"11630","performance record and thus will be better poised to"
"11631","attract new assets and enable shareholders to benefit"
"11632","from economies of scale."
"11633","* The potential operating efficiencies that may result from"
"11634","combining the Funds."
"11635","* The tax consequences of the Reorganization, including"
"11636","the tax-free nature of the Reorganization for Federal"
"11637","income tax purposes, so shareholders should not realize"
"11638","a tax gain or loss as a direct result of the Reorganization."
"11639","Old Mutual Capital advised the Board that in light of the"
"11640","compatibility of investment objectives and principal investment"
"11641","strategies, continuity of management at the adviser level,"
"11642","reduction of the Strategic Small Company Fund's expense"
"11643","limitations, and historical performance, the Reorganization"
"11644","of Developing Growth Fund into Strategic Small Company Fund"
"11645","would be in the best interests of both Funds and their shareholders"
"11646","and that the interests of the shareholders of each Fund would"
"11647","not be diluted as a result of the Reorganization.  After"
"11648","considering alternatives for the future of the Developing"
"11649","Growth Fund, the Board concluded that the Developing"
"11650","Growth Fund should be reorganized into the Strategic Small"
"11651","Company Fund."
"11652","C. Federal Income Tax Consequences"
"11653","The following is a general summary of the material Federal"
"11654","income tax consequences of the Reorganization and is"
"11655","based upon the current provisions of the Internal Revenue"
"11656","Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), the existing"
"11657","Treasury regulations thereunder, current administrative"
"11658","rulings of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and judicial"
"11659","decisions, all of which are subject to change.  The principal"
"11660","Federal income tax consequences that are expected to"
"11661","result from the Reorganization, under currently applicable law,"
"11662","are as follows:"
"11663","* The Reorganization will qualify as a reorganization"
"11664","within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code;"
"11665","* No gain or loss will be recognized by the Developing"
"11666","Growth Fund upon the transfer of substantially all of its"
"11667","assets to the Strategic Small Company Fund in exchange"
"11668","solely for shares of the Strategic Small Company Fund;"
"11669","* No gain or loss will be recognized by any shareholder"
"11670","of the Developing Growth Fund upon the exchange of shares"
"11671","of the Developing Growth Fund solely for shares of the"
"11672","Strategic Small Company Fund (including fractional shares"
"11673","to which they may be entitled);"
"11674","* The tax basis of the shares of the Strategic Small Company"
"11675","Fund to be received by a shareholder of the Developing"
"11676","Growth Fund (including fractional shares to which they may"
"11677","be entitled) will be the same as the tax basis of the shares"
"11678","of the Developing Growth Fund surrendered in exchange therefor;"
"11679","* The holding period of the shares of the Strategic Small"
"11680","Company Fund to be received by a shareholder of the Developing"
"11681","Growth Fund will include the holding period for which such"
"11682","shareholder held the shares of the Developing Growth Fund"
"11683","exchanged therefor, provided that such shares of the Developing"
"11684","Growth Fund are capital assets in the hands of such"
"11685","shareholder as of the date the Reorganization is consummated;"
"11686","* No gain or loss will be recognized by the Strategic Small"
"11687","Company Fund upon the receipt by it of substantially all"
"11688","of the assets of the Developing Growth Fund in exchange"
"11689","solely for shares of the Strategic Small Company Fund;"
"11690","* No gain or loss will be recognized by the Developing"
"11691","Growth Fund upon the distribution of shares of the Strategic"
"11692","Small Company Fund to its shareholders in complete"
"11693","liquidation of the Developing Growth Fund;"
"11694","* The tax basis of the assets of the Developing Growth"
"11695","Fund in the hands of the Strategic Small Company Fund"
"11696","will be the same as the tax basis of such assets in the"
"11697","hands of the Developing Growth Fund immediately prior"
"11698","to the Reorganization;"
"11699","* The holding period of the assets of the Developing Growth"
"11700","Fund to be received by the Strategic Small Company"
"11701","Fund will include the holding period of such assets in the"
"11702","hands of the Developing Growth Fund immediately prior to"
"11703","the Reorganization; and"
"11704","* Pursuant to Sections 381(a) and (b) of the Code and"
"11705","Sections 1.381(a)-1 and 1.381(b)-1 of the Income Tax Regulations,"
"11706","the tax year of the Developing Growth Fund will end on the date"
"11707","the Reorganization is consummated and the Strategic Small"
"11708","Company Fund will succeed to and take into account the items"
"11709","of the Developing Growth Fund described in Section 381(c) of"
"11710","the Code, subject to the provisions and limitations specified"
"11711","in Sections 381, 382, 383 and 384 of the Code, and the"
"11712","regulations thereunder."
"11713","Old Mutual Funds II has not requested and will not request"
"11714","an advance ruling from the IRS as to the Federal income tax"
"11715"," consequences of the Reorganization.  As a condition to closing,"
"11716","the law firm Stradley Ronon Stevens & Young, LLP (Stradley
Ronon) shall have rendered a favorable opinion to Old Mutual"
"11717","Funds II as to the foregoing Federal income tax consequences"
"11718","of the Reorganization, which opinion will be conditioned upon"
"11719","the accuracy, as of the date of closing, of certain representations"
"11720","made by Old Mutual Funds II upon which Stradley Ronon will"
"11721","rely in rendering its opinion.  The conclusions reached in"
"11722","Stradley Ronon's opinion could be jeopardized if the representations"
"11723","of Old Mutual Funds II are incorrect in any material respect."
"11724","Capital losses can generally be carried forward to each of the"
"11725","eight (8) taxable years succeeding the loss year to offset future"
"11726","capital gains.  The Reorganization of Developing Growth Fund"
"11727","into the Strategic Small Company Fund will result in a more than"
"11728","50% change in ownership of the Strategic Small Company Fund,"

"13107","D.   Pending Litigation"
"13108","In June 2004, Pilgrim Baxter & Associates, Ltd. (PBA, now"
"13109","known as Liberty Ridge), the former adviser to the Trust and the"
"13110","current sub-adviser to several of the Trust's series portfolios"
"13111","(the LRC Sub-Advised Funds), reached settlement agreements"
"13112","with respect to the market timing and selective disclosure actions"
"13113","filed by the SEC and New York Attorney General (NYAG). Under"
"13114","the NYAG settlement, if certain terms and undertakings in that"
"13115","settlement as described in the statement of additional information"
"13116","are not met, the NYAG settlement stipulates that Liberty Ridge"
"13117","shall promptly terminate the sub-advisory services it provides"
"13118","to the Fund.  In this event, the Trust's Board would be required"
"13119","to seek a new sub-adviser for the LRC Sub-Advised Funds or"
"13120","consider other alternatives."
"13121","As part of the In Re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation pending"
"13122","in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (the MDL
Court), PBHG Funds (now known as Old Mutual Funds II), PBA,"
"13123","its affiliates, and/or certain related and unrelated parties have"
"13124","been named as defendants in a Class Action Suit (Class Action
Suit) and a separate Derivative Suit (Derivative Suit) (together"
"13125","the Civil Litigation). The Civil Litigation consolidates and"
"13126","coordinates for pre-trial matters a number of individual class"
"13127","action suits and derivative suits based on similar claims, which"
"13128","previously had been filed against the PBHG Funds, PBA and/or"
"13129","certain related parties in other jurisdictions, and had been"
"13130","transferred to the MDL Court. Information on the previously filed"
"13131","suits is contained in the statement of additional information."
"13132","Consolidated complaints in the Class Action and Derivative"
"13133","Suits were filed in the Civil Litigation on September 29, 2004"
"13134","(MDL 1586)."
"13135","The Civil Litigation and the previously filed suits are primarily"
"13136","based upon allegations that the defendants engaged in or"
"13137","facilitated market timing of the PBHG Funds, and also made"
"13138","selective disclosure of confidential portfolio information to"
"13139","certain defendants and other parties. The Civil Litigation alleges"
"13140","a variety of theories for recovery, including but not limited to:"
"13141","(i) violations of various provisions of the Federal securities"
"13142","laws; (ii) breaches of fiduciary duty; and (iii) false or misleading"
"13143","prospectus disclosure. The Civil Litigation requests compensatory"
"13144","and punitive damages. In addition, the Derivative Suit"
"13145","requests the removal of each of the Trustees, the removal of"
"13146","Liberty Ridge as investment adviser, the removal of PBHG Fund"
"13147","Distributors (now known as Old Mutual Investment Partners)"
"13148","as distributor, rescission of the management and other contracts"
"13149","between PBHG Funds and the defendants, and rescission of the"
"13150","PBHG Funds' 12b-1 Plan."
"13151","On August 30, 2005, the State of West Virginia West Virginia"
"13152","Securities Division (the WV Securities Division) entered a"
"13153","cease and desist order (the Order and, together with the Civil"
"13154","Litigation, the Litigation) against PBA. PBHG Funds was not"
"13155","named in the Order. In the Order, the WV Securities Division"
"13156","alleged that PBA permitted short-term trading in excess of the"
"13157","PBHG Funds' disclosed limitation of four exchanges per year"
"13158","and also provided confidential portfolio information to customers"
"13159","of a broker-dealer who used the information to market time the"
"13160"," PBHG Funds. The WV Securities Division further alleges in the"
"13161","Order that the foregoing violated the West Virginia Securities Act"
"13162","(W. Va. Code 32-1-101, et seq.) and is seeking that PBA cease"
"13163","and desist from further violation of the West Virginia Securities"
"13164","Act; pay restitution; disgorge fees; pay administrative and"
"13165","investigatory costs and expenses, including counsel fees; pay"
"13166","an administrative assessment; and other relief. It is possible"
"13167","that similar actions based on the same facts and circumstances"
"13168","may be filed in the future by other state agencies. Such other"
"13169","actions will be described in the statement of additional information."
"13170","At this stage of the Litigation it is too early to assess the likely"
"13171","outcome of the Litigation, or success of any defenses each of the"
"13172","defendants may have to the claims. Any potential resolution of the"
"13173","Litigation may include, but not be limited to, judgments or settlements"
"13174","for damages against Liberty Ridge or any other named defendant."
"13175","While it is currently too early to predict the result of the Litigation,"
"13176","Old Mutual Capital does not believe that the outcome of the Litigation"
"13177","will materially affect its ability to carry out its duty as investment"
"13178","adviser to the LRC Sub-Advised Funds. However, neither Liberty"
"13179","Ridge nor Old Mutual Capital is currently able to gauge the level"
"13180","of shareholder redemptions that may result from the news of the"
"13181","resolution of these pending lawsuits. Redemptions may require"
"13182","the LRC Sub-Advised Funds to sell investments to provide for"
"13183","sufficient liquidity, which could adversely impact the investment"
"13184","performance of the LRC Sub-Advised Funds."

"13493","VOTING INFORMATION"
"13494","The Developing Growth Fund expects to solicit proxies"
"13495","principally by mail, but may also solicit proxies by telephone,"
"13496","facsimile, telegraph or personal interview.  Developing Growth"
"13497","Fund officers will not receive any additional or special compensation"
"13498","for solicitation activities.  The Developing Growth Fund also"
"13499","engaged the services of Broadridge to assist in the solicitation"
"13500","of proxies.  In all cases where a telephonic proxy is solicited,"
"13501","the Broadridge representative will ask for each shareholder's"
"13502","full name and address or the zip code or employer identification"
"13503","number and to confirm that the shareholder has received this"
"13504","Prospectus/Proxy Statement and proxy card in the mail.  If the"
"13505","shareholder is a corporation or other entity, the Broadridge"
"13506","representative is required to ask for the person's title and"
"13507","confirmation that the person is authorized to direct the voting"
"13508","of the shares.  If the information solicited agrees with the"
"13509","information provided to Broadridge, then the Broadridge"
"13510","representative may explain the voting process, read the proposals"
"13511","listed on the proxy card, and ask for the shareholder's"
"13512","instructions on each proposal.  Although the Broadridge"
"13513","representative is permitted to answer questions about the"
"13514","process, he or she is not permitted to recommend to the"
"13515","shareholder how to vote, but he or she may read any recommendation"
"13516","set forth in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement.  The telephone"
"13517","solicitor will record the shareholder's voting instructions on the"
"13518","card.  Within 72 hours, the shareholder will be sent a confirming"
"13519","letter or mailgram to confirm his or her vote and asking the"
"13520","shareholder to call 866-615-7269 immediately if his or her instructions"
"13521","are not correctly reflected in the confirmation."
"13522","The Funds will pay all costs and expenses associated with the"
"13523","Reorganization, subject to current expense limitations.  Costs"
"13524","associated with the Reorganization generally include printing and"
"13525","mailing costs, solicitation costs, legal costs, costs paid to the"
"13526","Funds' independent registered public accounting firm, and other"
"13527","miscellaneous costs.  All costs and expenses associated with the"
"13528","Reorganization will be allocated between the Funds on a pro rata"
"13529","basis based on each Fund's relative net assets.  The anticipated"
"13530","costs of the reorganization are approximately $51,196."
"13531","All properly executed and unrevoked proxies received in time for"
"13532","the Special Meeting will be voted in accordance with the instructions"
"13533","they contain.  If no instructions are given, shares represented by"
"13534","proxies will be voted FOR the proposal to approve the Plan of"
"13535","Reorganization and in accordance with the Board's"
"13536","recommendations on other matters.  The presence in person"
"13537","or by proxy of one-third of the outstanding shares of Developing"
"13538","Growth Fund entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will constitute a quorum."
"13539","At the Special Meeting, a quorum being present, approval of the"
"13540","Plan of Reorganization requires the affirmative vote of the lesser"
"13541","of: (a) 67% or more of the voting securities of the Developing Growth"
"13542","Fund present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting,"
"13543","if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities"
"13544","of the Developing Growth Fund are present or represented by proxy;"
"13545","or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the"
"13546","Developing Growth Fund.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will"
"13547","be counted as shares present at the Special Meeting for quorum"
"13548","purposes but will not be considered votes cast at the Special Meeting."
"13549","As a result, they have the same effect as a vote against the Plan of"
"13550","Reorganization.  Broker non-votes arise from a proxy returned by a"
"13551","broker holding shares for a customer which indicates that the"
"13552","broker has not been authorized by the customer to vote on a"
"13553","proposal.  If you return a proxy, you may revoke it at any time"
"13554","prior to its exercise by executing a superseding proxy or by"
"13555","submitting a notice of revocation to the Secretary of Old Mutual"
"13556","Funds II.  In addition, although mere attendance at the Special"
"13557","Meeting will not revoke a proxy, if you attend the Special Meeting"
"13558","you may withdraw your proxy and vote in person.  Shareholders"
"13559","may also transact any other business not currently contemplated"
"13560","that may properly come before the Special Meeting in the"
"13561","discretion of the proxies or their substitutes."
"13562","Shareholders of record as of the close of business on December"
"13563","10, 2008 (the Record Date) are entitled to vote at the Special"
"13564","Meeting.  On the Record Date, there were 2,068.582 Class A"
"13565","shares, 4,269.248 Class C shares, 1,353,337.534 Institutional"
"13566","Class shares and 7,803,720.618 Class Z shares of the Developing"
"13567","Growth Fund outstanding.  Each share held entitles a shareholder"
"13568","to one vote for each dollar (and a proportionate fractional vote for"
"13569","each fractional dollar) of net asset value of shares held by the shareholder."
"13570","If a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, or if a"
"13571","quorum is present at the Special Meeting but sufficient votes"
"13572","to approve the Reorganization are not received, or if other"
"13573","matters arise requiring shareholder attention, the persons"
"13574","named as proxy agents may propose one or more adjournments"
"13575","to permit further solicitation of proxies.  Any such adjournment"
"13576","will require the affirmative vote of one third of those shares"
"13577","present at the Special Meeting or represented by proxy.  The"
"13578","persons designated as proxies may use their discretionary"
"13579","authority to vote as instructed by management of the Fund on"
"13580","questions of adjournment and on any other proposals raised"
"13581","at the Meeting to the extent permitted by the SEC's proxy rules,"
"13582","including proposals for which timely notice was not received,"
"13583","as set forth in the SEC's proxy rules."
"13584","Only one Prospectus/Proxy Statement, along with one proxy card,"
"13585","is being delivered to multiple shareholders who share an address"
"13586","unless the Trust has received contrary instructions from one or more"
"13587","of the shareholders.  The Trust will deliver, promptly upon oral or"
"13588","written request, a separate copy of this Prospectus/Proxy Statement"
"13589","to a shareholder at a shared address to which a single copy of"
"13590","this Prospectus/Proxy Statement was delivered."
"13591","Shareholders may notify the Trust that they wish to receive a"
"13592","separate copy of this Prospectus/Proxy Statement, or wish to"
"13593","receive separate prospectuses and proxy statements in the future,"
"13594","by calling 888-772-2888 or write to Old Mutual Funds II at P.O."
"13595","Box 219534, Kansas City, Missouri  64121-9534.  Multiple"

"13600","OTHER BUSINESS"
"13601","The Board does not intend to present any other business at"
"13602","the Special Meeting.  Other matters will be considered if notice"

"13660","will receive shares of the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund equivalent in dollar"
"13661","value to your shares in the Small Cap Fund at the time of the"
"13662","reorganization."
"13663","The Board's recommendation to reorganize the Small Cap Fund is based"
"13664","primarily on its compatibility with the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund and"
"13665","economies of scale that may be achieved by combining the Funds. Both"
"13666","Funds are advised by Old Mutual Capital, Inc., and while the Small Cap"
"13667","Fund is sub-advised by Liberty Ridge Capital, Inc. and Eagle Asset"
"13668","Management, Inc. and the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund is sub-advised by"
"13669","Thompson Siegel & Walmsley, LLC, both Funds primarily invest in small"
"13670","capitalization companies.  Reorganizing the Small Cap Fund will enable"
"13671","you to maintain your exposure to small capitalization companies while"
"13672","also enabling you to potentially benefit from the TS&W Small Cap Value"
"13673","Fund's focus on investments in small capitalization companies with value"
"13674","characteristics."
"13675","In addition to the foregoing, the Board recommends reorganizing the"
"13676","Small Cap Fund so that shareholders may realize additional benefits"
"13677","such as equal or potentially lower expense ratios than the Small Cap"
"13678","Fund's current expense ratios.  Importantly, the reorganization is"
"13679","designed to be a tax-free reorganization, so you should not realize a"
"13680","tax gain or loss as a direct result of the reorganization.  Additional"
"13681","details about the proposed reorganization are described in the enclosed"
"13682","Proxy Statement."
"13683","This proposal will be presented to shareholders at a special meeting of"
"13684","shareholders to be held on February 27, 2009 in Denver, Colorado. This"
"13685","package contains important information about the proposal, a proxy, a"
"13686","business reply envelope permitting you to vote by mail and simple"

"13689","in detail."
"13690","THE SMALL CAP FUND'S BOARD HAS CAREFULLY CONSIDERED THE PROPOSAL,"

"13827","The Funds have similar investment strategies in that both Funds"
"13828","invest primarily in small capitalization companies.  However,"
"13829","the Small Cap Fund seeks to provide investors with above-average"
"13830","total returns over a three to five year market cycle, consistent"

"13923","INTRODUCTION"
"13924","The Introduction section of this Prospectus/Proxy Statement"
"13925","provides a brief overview of the key features and other matters"
"13926","typically of interest to shareholders considering a proposed"
"13927","reorganization between mutual funds.  These responses are"
"13928","qualified in their entirety by the remainder of this"
"13929","Prospectus/Proxy Statement, which you should read carefully"
"13930","because it contains additional information and details regarding"
"13931","the proposed reorganization.  The description of the Reorganization"
"13932","is qualified by reference to the full text of the Plan of"
"13933","Reorganization, which is attached as Appendix I."
"13934","A. Questions and Answers Regarding the Reorganization"
"13935","Q.	WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED?"
"13936","A.	The Plan of Reorganization provides for the sale of"
"13937","all the assets and liabilities of the Small Cap Fund to the"
"13938","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund and the reclassification of the"
"13939","issued and outstanding Small Cap Fund shares into TS&W Small"
"13940","Cap Value Fund shares.  If shareholders of the Small Cap"
"13941","Fund approve the Plan of Reorganization and other closing"
"13942","conditions are satisfied, all of the assets and liabilities"
"13943","of the Small Cap Fund will become the assets and liabilities"
"13944","of the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund, and the issued and outstanding"
"13945","Class A, Class C, Institutional Class and Class Z shares of the"
"13946","Small Cap Fund will be converted into Class A, Class C,"
"13947","Institutional Class and Class Z shares, respectively, of the"
"13948","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund, with an aggregate net asset value"
"13949","equal to the value of the Small Cap Fund's net assets immediately"
"13950","prior to the Reorganization.  The value of each Small Cap Fund"
"13951","shareholder's account in the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund immediately"
"13952","after the Reorganization will be the same as the value of such"
"13953","shareholder's account with Small Cap Fund immediately prior to"
"13954","the Reorganization."
"13955","Q.	WHY IS THE REORGANIZATION IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF SHAREHOLDERS?"
"13956","A.	The Board of Trustees (the Board) of Old Mutual Funds II,"
"13957","including each of the independent Trustees, determined that the"
"13958","Reorganization would be in the best interests of both Funds and"
"13959","their shareholders based on the following factors, among others:"
"13960","* The compatibility of the investment objectives and principal"
"13961","investment strategies of the two Funds."
"13962","* The continuity of management given that Old Mutual Capital is"
"13963","the adviser to both Funds."
"13964","* Old Mutual Capital's agreement to reduce the management fee for"
"13965","the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund from 1.10% to 1.00% upon"
"13966","consummation of the Reorganization."
"13967","* Old Mutual Capital's agreement to reduce the expense"
"13968","limitations for the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund's Class A,"
"13969","Class C, Class Z and Institutional Class shares to 1.50%,"
"13970","2.25%, 1.25% and 1.10%, respectively, effective upon consummation"
"13971","of the Reorganization."
"13972","* Equal or potentially lower total expense ratios for the"
"13973","combined Fund resulting from increased asset levels and"
"13974","corresponding economies of scale."
"13975","* Old Mutual Capital's belief that the combined Fund will have"
"13976","improved marketability based upon its historical performance"
"13977","record and will be better poised to attract new assets and"
"13978","enable shareholders to benefit from economies of scale."
"13979","* The potential operating efficiencies that may result from"
"13980","combining the Funds."
"13981","* The tax-free nature of the Reorganization for Federal income"
"13982","tax purposes, so shareholders should not realize a tax gain or"
"13983","loss as a direct result of the Reorganization."
"13984","Q.	WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES?"
"13985","A.	The Board recommends that you vote FOR the Reorganization."
"13986","Q.	DO THE FUNDS HAVE THE SAME INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE?"
"13987","A.	The Small Cap Fund seeks to provide investors with"
"13988","above-average total return over a three to five year market"
"13989","cycle, consistent with reasonable risk, by investing at least"
"13990","80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes)"
"13991","in equity securities of small capitalization companies, while the"
"13992","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund seeks to provide investors with long-term"
"13993","capital growth by investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus"
"13994","any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of"
"13995","small capitalization companies with value characteristics."
"13996","The Funds have similar investment strategies in that both Funds"
"13997","invest primarily in small capitalization companies.  The Small"
"13998","Cap Fund invests in small capitalization companies with market"
"13999","capitalizations similar to the companies in the Russell 2000 Index,"
"14000","while the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund invests in small capitalization"
"14001","companies with market capitalizations similar to the companies in the"
"14002","Russell 2000 Value Index.  As of March 31, 2008, the Russell 2000"
"14003","Index included companies with market capitalizations between"
"14004","$25 million and $6.8 billion and the Russell 2000 Value Index"
"14005","included companies with market capitalizations between"
"14006","$25 million and $5.7 billion.  In addition, the TS&W Small"
"14007","Cap Value Fund primarily invests in securities that TS&W"
"14008","believes present a value or potential worth that is not"
"14009","recognized by prevailing market prices or that have experienced"
"14010","some fundamental changes and are intrinsically undervalued"
"14011","by the investment community."
"14012","Q.	WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES IN THE INVESTMENT"
"14013","STRATEGIES AND RISKS OF THE FUNDS?"
"14014","A.	While both Funds invest primarily in securities of"
"14015","small capitalization issuers, the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund"
"14016","normally invests at least 80% of its net assets in securities"
"14017","of small capitalization issuers with value characteristics."
"14018","This means that to the extent the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund"
"14019","invests in small capitalization issuers with value characteristics,"
"14020","it may be exposed to greater investment style risk because market"
"14021","performance tends to be cyclical, and during various cycles,"
"14022","certain investment styles may fall in and out of favor."
"14023","The market may not favor the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund's"
"14024","value style of investing, and the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund's"
"14025","returns may vary considerably from other equity funds using"
"14026","different investment styles.  The Small Cap Fund invests in"
"14027","companies with both value and growth characteristics and,"
"14028","as a result, may be less susceptible to investment style risk."
"14029","However, the Small Cap Fund's returns may be lower than the"
"14030","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund during market cycles that favor"
"14031","companies with value characteristics."
"14032","Q.	HOW DO THE FUNDS COMPARE IN SIZE?"
"14033","A.	As of September 30, 2008, the Small Cap Fund's net"
"14034","assets were $30.7 million and the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund's"
"14035","net assets were $49.6 million.  The asset size of each Fund"
"14036","fluctuates on a daily basis and the asset size of the"
"14037","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund after the Reorganization may be"
"14038","larger or smaller than the combined assets of the Funds"
"14039","as of September 30, 2008."
"14040","Q.	WILL THE PROPOSED REORGANIZATION RESULT IN HIGHER"
"14041","INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES OR OTHER FUND EXPENSES?"
"14042","A.	Upon the closing date of the Reorganization,"
"14043","which is anticipated to be effective the close of business"
"14044","on or about March 6, 2009 (the Closing Date), Old Mutual"
"14045","Capital has agreed to reduce the management fee and the"
"14046","expense limitations for the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund"
"14047","so that they are the same as the management fee and expense"
"14048","limitations currently in place for the Small Cap Fund."
"14049","Although the contractual sub-advisory fee for the"
"14050","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund is 0.10% higher than the"
"14051","contractual sub-advisory fee for the Small Cap Fund,"
"14052","the contractual sub-advisory fee for the TS&W Small Cap"
"14053","Value Fund will be reduced by 0.05% on the Closing Date."
"14054","Because the sub-advisory fee is paid by Old Mutual Capital"
"14055","from its management fee proceeds, the higher sub-advisory"
"14056","fee will not immediately result in higher fund expenses."
"14057","In addition, the projected gross total expense ratios of the"
"14058","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund following the completion of the"
"14059","Reorganization are expected to be equal to or lower than the"
"14060","current expense ratios of the Small Cap Fund, and contractual"
"14061","expense limitations will remain in place through at least"
"14062","December 31, 2009."
"14063","Q.	WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PROPOSED"
"14064","REORGANIZATION?"
"14065","A.	Legal counsel to the Small Cap Fund and the TS&W"
"14066","Small Cap Value Fund will issue an opinion to Old Mutual"
"14067","Funds II that the Reorganization will constitute a tax-free"
"14068","reorganization for Federal income tax purposes.  Thus,"
"14069","shareholders are not expected to be subject to Federal"
"14070","income taxes as a direct result of the Reorganization."
"14071","Q.	WILL THE SHAREHOLDER SERVICES PROVIDED BY OLD"
"14072","MUTUAL CAPITAL CHANGE?"
"14073","A.	No.  Old Mutual Capital manages the Small Cap"
"14074","Fund and the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund.  The custodian,"
"14075","transfer agent and distributor are also the same for"
"14076","both Funds.  Purchase, exchange and redemption privileges"
"14077","are also the same for both Funds.  Please consult your"
"14078","financial intermediary for information on any services"
"14079","provided by them to the Funds."
"14080","Q.	CAN I CONTINUE TO ADD TO MY SMALL CAP FUND ACCOUNT?"
"14081","A.	Yes.  Small Cap Fund shareholders may continue to"
"14082","make investments in the Small Cap Fund before the closing"
"14083","date of the Reorganization."
"14084","Q.	WHAT HAPPENS IF THE REORGANIZATION IS NOT APPROVED?"
"14085","A.	Effective on or about March 31, 2009, Liberty Ridge"
"14086","will cease providing investment sub-advisory services to"
"14087","the Small Cap Fund.  If the Reorganization is not approved,"
"14088","any shares you held in the Small Cap Fund will remain Small"
"14089","Cap Fund shares, but Liberty Ridge will not continue to"
"14090","provide sub-advisory services to the Small Cap Fund after"
"14091","March 31, 2009.  Eagle will continue to provide investment"
"14092","sub-advisory services to the Small Cap Fund.  The Board and Old"
"14093","Mutual Capital would determine what further action to take,"
"14094","which may include recommending that shareholders approve one or"
"14095","more new investment sub-advisers to the Small Cap Fund, or"
"14096","transferring all the Fund's assets to Eagle.  The TS&W Small Cap"
"14097","Value Fund would continue to operate separately."
"14098","Q.	WILL EITHER FUND PAY FOR THE PROXY SOLICITATION, LEGAL"
"14099","AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSED REORGANIZATION?"
"14100","A.	The Funds will pay all costs and expenses associated with"
"14101","the Reorganization, subject to current expense limitations."
"14102","Costs associated with the Reorganization generally include"
"14103","printing and mailing costs, solicitation costs, legal costs,"
"14104","costs paid to the Funds' independent registered public accounting"
"14105","firm, and other miscellaneous costs.  All costs and expenses"
"14106","associated with the Reorganization will be allocated between"
"14107","the Funds on a pro rata basis based on each Fund's relative"
"14108","net assets.  The anticipated costs of the reorganization are"
"14109","approximately $38,692."
"14110","Q.	IF APPROVED, WHEN WILL THE PROPOSED REORGANIZATION"
"14111","TAKE PLACE?"
"14112","A.	If approved, the Reorganization will be effective the"
"14113","close of business on or about March 6, 2009, or as soon as"
"14114","reasonably practicable after shareholder approval is obtained."
"14115","Shortly after completion of the Reorganization, shareholders"
"14116","will receive a confirmation statement reflecting their new"
"14117","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund account number and number of shares"
"14118","owned."
"14119","Q.	WHAT IF I WANT TO EXCHANGE MY SHARES FOR ANOTHER"
"14120","OLD MUTUAL FUND PRIOR TO THE REORGANIZATION?"
"14121","A.	You may exchange your shares into other mutual funds"
"14122","advised by Old Mutual Capital (each an Old Mutual Fund)"
"14123","before the Closing Date by calling 888-772-2888 or contacting"
"14124","your financial intermediary.  If you choose to exchange your"
"14125","Small Cap Fund shares for another Old Mutual Fund, your"
"14126","request will be treated as a normal exchange of shares and"
"14127","will be a taxable transaction unless your shares are held in"
"14128","a tax-deferred account, such as an IRA.  If you exchange your"
"14129","shares before the date of the Special Meeting or any"
"14130","adjournments thereof, you will still be asked to cast your"
"14131","vote on the Reorganization."
"14132","Q.	HOW MANY VOTES AM I ENTITLED TO CAST?"
"14133","A.	Shareholders of record as of the close of business"
"14134","on December 10, 2008 (the Record Date) are entitled to"
"14135","vote at the Special Meeting.  You are entitled to one vote"
"14136","for each dollar (and a proportionate fractional vote for"
"14137","each fractional dollar) of net asset value of shares held"
"14138","in your name as determined as of the Record Date."
"14139","Q.	HOW CAN I VOTE MY SHARES?"
"14140","A.	You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting or"
"14141","any adjournments thereof if you owned shares of the Small"
"14142","Cap Fund as of the close of business on December 10, 2008."
"14143","If you attend the Special Meeting or any adjournments thereof,"
"14144","you may vote your shares in person.  Whether or not you intend"
"14145","to attend the Special Meeting or any adjournments thereof in"
"14146","person, you may vote in any of the following ways:"
"14147","(1)	Mail: Vote, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy"
"14148","card(s) in the enclosed postage-paid envelope;"
"14149","(2)	Telephone: Have your proxy card(s) available. Vote by"
"14150","telephone by calling the toll-free number on your proxy card(s)"
"14151","which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Enter the"

"14155","the Internet by accessing the website listed on your proxy"
"14156","card(s). Enter the control number from your proxy card(s)."
"14157","Follow the simple instructions found on the website."
"14158","Q.	IF I VOTE MY PROXY NOW, CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE LATER?"
"14159","A.	If you vote your proxy now, you may revoke it at any"
"14160","time prior to its exercise by executing a superseding proxy or"
"14161","by submitting a notice of revocation to the Secretary of"
"14162","Old Mutual Funds II.  In addition, although mere attendance"
"14163","at the Special Meeting will not revoke a proxy, if you attend"
"14164","the Special Meeting you may withdraw your proxy and vote"
"14165","in person."
"14166","Q.	WHAT IS THE REQUIRED VOTE TO APPROVE THE PROPOSED"
"14167","REORGANIZATION?"
"14168","A.	At the Special Meeting, a quorum being present,"
"14169","approval of the Reorganization requires the affirmative vote"
"14170","of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the"
"14171","Small Cap Fund as defined by the Investment Company Act of"
"14172","1940, as amended (the 1940 Act).  This means the affirmative"
"14173","vote of the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of the voting"
"14174","securities of Small Cap Fund present or represented by"
"14175","proxy at the Special Meeting, if the holders of more than"
"14176","50% of the outstanding voting securities of Small Cap Fund"
"14177","are present or represented by proxy; or (b) more than 50%"
"14178","of the outstanding voting securities of Small Cap Fund."
"14179","Q.	WHOM SHOULD I CALL FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT"
"14180","THIS PROSPECTUS/PROXY STATEMENT?"
"14181","A.	Please call the proxy solicitor, Broadridge, at"
"14182","866-615-7269 to obtain additional information regarding"
"14183","the proposed Reorganization."
"14184","B. Comparison of Investment Objectives and Policies"
"14185","The Funds have similar investment strategies in that both"
"14186","Funds invest primarily in small capitalization companies."
"14187","In addition, both Funds are advised by Old Mutual Capital,"
"14188","though the Small Cap Fund is sub-advised by Liberty Ridge"
"14189","Capital, Inc. (Liberty Ridge) and Eagle Asset Management,"
"14190","Inc. (Eagle) and the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund is"
"14191","sub-advised by Thompson Siegel & Walmsley, LLC (TS&W)."
"14192","The Small Cap Fund seeks to provide investors with"
"14193","above-average total returns over a three to five year"
"14194","market cycle, consistent with reasonable risk, by investing"
"14195","at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for"
"14196","investment purposes) in equity securities of small"
"14197","capitalization companies.  The TS&W Small Cap Value"
"14198","Fund seeks to provide investors with long-term capital"
"14199","growth by investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus"
"14200","any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities"
"14201","of small capitalization companies with value characteristics."
"14202","Reorganizing the Small Cap Fund into the TS&W Small Cap Value"
"14203","Fund will enable Small Cap Fund shareholders to maintain"
"14204","exposure to small capitalization companies while increasing"
"14205","exposure to value-oriented companies.  This is because the"
"14206","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund primarily invests in small"
"14207","capitalization securities that TS&W believes present a"
"14208","value or potential worth that is not recognized by"
"14209","prevailing market prices or that have experienced some"
"14210","fundamental changes and are intrinsically undervalued"
"14211","by the investment community.  The sub-advisers to the"
"14212","Small Cap Fund generally tend to focus on companies in"
"14213","the blend space, meaning they share both value and"
"14214","growth characteristics.  The Small Cap Fund uses the"
"14215","Russell 2000 Index as its benchmark and invests in"
"14216","small capitalization companies with market capitalizations"
"14217","similar to the companies in the Russell 2000 Index."
"14218","The TS&W Small Cap Value Fund uses the Russell 2000"
"14219","Value Index as its benchmark and invests in small"
"14220","capitalization companies with market capitalizations"
"14221","similar to the companies in the Russell 2000 Value Index."
"14222","As of March 31, 2008, the Russell 2000 Index included"
"14223","companies with market capitalizations between $25 million"
"14224","and $6.8 billion and the Russell 2000 Value Index"
"14225","included companies with market capitalizations between"
"14226","$25 million and $5.7 billion.  The market capitalizations"
"14227","of the companies in the Funds' portfolios and the Indices"
"14228","change over time and the Funds will not automatically sell"
"14229","or stop buying stock of a company they already own if the"
"14230","company's market capitalization grows or falls out of this"
"14231","range."
"14232","The annual portfolio turnover rate for the Small Cap Fund"
"14233","was 117.94% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008."
"14234","The TS&W Small Cap Value Fund's portfolio turnover rate"
"14235","for the same period was 40.37%.  A fund with a higher"
"14236","rate of portfolio turnover will result in higher"
"14237","transaction costs and may result in additional taxes"
"14238","for shareholders as compared to a fund with less"
"14239","portfolio turnover."
"14240","C. Comparison of Risk Factors"
"14241","Each Fund may invest in various types of securities or"
"14242","use certain investment techniques to achieve its"
"14243","investment objective. The following is a summary of"
"14244","the principal risks associated with such securities"
"14245","and investment techniques. Additional information about"
"14246","these risks is included in the Funds' prospectus."
"14247","As with any security, an investment in either Fund"
"14248","involves certain risks, including loss of principal."
"14249","An investment in the Funds is not a deposit of a bank"
"14250","and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance"
"14251","Corporation or any other government agency. The fact"
"14252","that a particular risk is not identified does not"
"14253","indicate that a Fund does not invest its assets in,"
"14254","or is precluded from investing its assets in,"
"14255","securities that give rise to that risk."
"14256","       Similar Risk Factors of the Funds"
"14257","Like all investments in securities, you risk"
"14258","losing money by investing in the Funds.  The main"
"14259","risks of investing in each Fund are as follows:"
"14260","Stock Market Risk.  The value of the stocks and"
"14261","other securities owned by the Funds will fluctuate"
"14262","depending on the performance of the companies that"
"14263","issued them, general market and economic conditions,"
"14264","and investor confidence.  The market may also fail to"
"14265","recognize a Sub-Adviser's determination of an investment's"
"14266","value or a Sub-Adviser may misgauge that value."
"14267","Small Company Risk.  The Funds invest primarily in"
"14268","small-capitalization companies.  While small-capitalization"
"14269","companies may offer greater potential for capital"
"14270","appreciation than larger more established companies,"
"14271","they may also involve greater risk of loss and price"
"14272","fluctuation.  The trading markets for securities of"
"14273","small-capitalization issuers may be less liquid and more"
"14274","volatile than securities of larger companies.  This means"
"14275","that the Funds could have greater difficulty buying or"
"14276","selling a security of a small-capitalization issuer at"
"14277","an acceptable price, especially in periods of market"
"14278","volatility."
"14279","Industry and Sector Risk.  Companies that have similar"
"14280","lines of business are grouped together in broad categories"
"14281","called industries.  Certain industries are grouped together"
"14282","in broader categories called sectors.  The Funds may focus"
"14283","their investments in certain industries within certain sectors,"
"14284","which may cause the Funds' performance to be susceptible to the"
"14285","economic, business or other developments that affect those"
"14286","industries."
"14287","       Primary Differences in Risk Factors of the Funds"
"14288","Investment Style Risk.  Market performance tends to be cyclical,"
"14289","and during various cycles, certain investment styles may fall in"
"14290","and out of favor.  The market may not favor the TS&W Small Cap"
"14291","Value Fund's value style of investing, and the TS&W Small Cap"
"14292","Value Fund's returns may vary considerably from other equity funds"
"14293","using different investment styles."
"14294","More information regarding the risks of investing in the Funds"
"14295","is included in the Old Mutual Funds II prospectus."
"14296","D. Comparison of Pricing, Purchase and Redemption Policies,"
"14297","Sales Charges, and Distribution"
"14298","Shares of the Small Cap Fund and the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund"
"14299","are distributed by Old Mutual Investment Partners (OMIP or"
"14300","the Distributor), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Old Mutual"
"14301","Capital.  The Distributor receives no compensation for serving"
"14302","in such capacity, except as provided in separate distribution"
"14303","plans, adopted pursuant to Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act for each"
"14304","Fund's Class A and Class C shares, and service plans which"
"14305","enable the Funds to directly and indirectly bear certain"
"14306","expenses relating to the distribution and sale of shares and"
"14307","services provided to shareholders.  Pursuant to 12b-1 plans,"
"14308","both the Small Cap Fund and the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund pay"
"14309","OMIP a service fee at an annual rate of 0.25% of the average"
"14310","daily net assets attributable to Class A shares and a"
"14311","distribution fee and service fee at an annual combined rate"
"14312","of 1.00% of the average daily net assets attributable to Class"
"14313","C shares.  Because these fees are paid out of the assets of"
"14314","Class A and Class C on an ongoing basis, over time these fees"
"14315","will increase the cost of your investment and may cost you"
"14316","more than paying other types of sales charges.  For more"
"14317","information on distribution and service fees, refer to the"
"14318","Old Mutual Funds II prospectus."
"14319","The Funds have the same procedures for calculating share"
"14320","price and valuing portfolio securities, and the same policies"
"14321","regarding excessive or short term trading.  These policies"
"14322","and procedures are described in the following sections."
"14323","       Share Price"
"14324","The price you pay for a share of a Fund and the price you"
"14325","receive upon selling or redeeming a share of a Fund is"
"14326","called the net asset value (NAV).  NAV per share class"
"14327","of a Fund is calculated by dividing the total net assets"
"14328","of each class of a Fund by the total number of the classes'"
"14329","shares outstanding of that Fund.  NAV is determined as of"
"14330","the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange"
"14331","(the NYSE) (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on each day"
"14332","that the NYSE is open. NAV is not calculated, and you may"
"14333","not conduct Fund transactions, on days the NYSE is closed"
"14334","(generally weekends and New Year's Day, Martin Luther King,"
"14335","Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,"
"14336","Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and"
"14337","Christmas Day)."
"14338","Your purchase, exchange, or redemption of a Fund's shares"
"14339","will be priced at the next NAV calculated after your"
"14340","request is received in good order by the Fund's transfer"
"14341","agent or other Fund agents.  Shares begin to earn dividends"
"14342","on the first business day following the day of purchase."
"14343","Shares earn dividends until the day of redemption."
"14344","The NAV of your shares when redeemed may be more or"
"14345","less than the price you originally paid, depending"
"14346","primarily upon the Fund's investment performance."
"14347","If a Fund invests in another investment company,"
"14348","that Fund's NAV is based in part on the NAV of the"
"14349","other investment companies in which the Fund invests."
"14350","The prospectuses for these other investment companies"
"14351","explain the circumstances under which they may use fair"
"14352","value pricing and its effects."
"14353","The Trust may enter into agreements with broker-dealers,"
"14354","financial institutions, retirement plan accounts,"
"14355","trading platforms, certain fee-based programs, or"
"14356","other service providers (financial intermediaries)"
"14357","that may include the Funds as an investment alternative"
"14358","in the programs they offer or administer.  If you buy"
"14359","shares through a financial intermediary, generally your"
"14360","order must be received by the financial intermediary"
"14361","and transmitted to OMIP or its designee by the close"
"14362","of regular trading on the NYSE in order for you to"
"14363","receive that day's offering price.  Otherwise, the"
"14364","order will receive the offering price that is determined"
"14365","on the next day the NYSE is open.  The Trust and financial"
"14366","intermediaries reserve the right to reject customer orders"
"14367","that are incomplete or otherwise not in good order."
"14368","Financial intermediaries may also accept certain customer"
"14369","orders conditioned on the understanding that the orders"
"14370","may later be rejected in the event they cannot be transmitted"
"14371","to OMIP or its designee in a timely manner.  The Trust"
"14372","will be deemed to have received a purchase or redemption"
"14373","order from authorized financial intermediaries (authorized
financial intermediaries) when the financial intermediary,"
"14374","or its authorized designee, accepts the order. The customer"
"14375","order will be priced at the Fund's NAV next computed after"
"14376","such order is unconditionally accepted by an authorized"
"14377","financial intermediary or its authorized designee."
"14378","       Valuing Portfolio Securities"
"14379","The Funds use pricing services to determine the market"
"14380","value of the securities in their portfolios.  Except as"
"14381","discussed below, the Funds generally use the market price"
"14382","of securities as of the close of regular trading on the"
"14383","NYSE to value equity securities held in the Funds'"
"14384","portfolios, except that securities traded primarily"
"14385","on the NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ) are normally"
"14386","valued by the Fund at the NASDAQ Official Closing"
"14387","Price provided by NASDAQ each business day."
"14388","Short-term investments in the Funds are priced at"
"14389","amortized cost, which approximates market value."
"14390","The market value of bonds is determined based on an"
"14391","evaluated price.  If a Fund holds securities quoted"
"14392","in foreign currencies, it translates that price into"
"14393","U.S. dollars at current exchange rates.  Because"
"14394","foreign markets may be open at different times than"
"14395","the NYSE, the price of a Fund's shares may change on"
"14396","days when its shares are not available for purchase or"
"14397","sale.  If a market quotation is not readily available"
"14398","or is believed to be unreliable, the security is valued"
"14399","at fair value pursuant to procedures approved by the"
"14400","Board."
"14401","       Fair Value Pricing"
"14402","The Funds have fair value pricing procedures in place,"
"14403","and a Valuation Committee meets as necessary to value"
"14404","securities in appropriate circumstances that may include,"
"14405","but are not limited to, when a market price is believed"
"14406","to be unreliable, is unavailable, or if Fund assets have"
"14407","been affected by events occurring after the close of"
"14408","trading of a securities market, but before a Fund"
"14409","calculates its NAV.  By fair valuing a security whose"
"14410","price may have been affected by events occurring after"
"14411","the close of trading in its respective market, a Fund"
"14412","attempts to establish a price that it might reasonably"
"14413","expect to receive upon its current sale of that security."
"14414","These methods are designed to help ensure that the prices"
"14415","at which Fund shares are purchased and redeemed are fair,"
"14416","and do not result in dilution of shareholder interest or"
"14417","other harm to shareholders.  In addition, fair value pricing"
"14418","is a helpful tool in preventing excessive short-term trading"
"14419","activity because it may make it more difficult for potentially"
"14420","disruptive shareholders to determine if pricing inefficiencies"
"14421","exist in a Fund's securities.  The valuation assigned to"
"14422","fair valued securities for purposes of calculating the Fund's"
"14423","NAV may differ from the security's most recent closing market"
"14424","price and from the prices used by other mutual funds to"
"14425","calculate their NAVs.  Although intended to do so, the"
"14426","fair value procedures may not always better represent"
"14427","the price at which the Fund could sell the fair valued"

"14430","While the Funds provide shareholders with daily liquidity,"
"14431","they are intended to be long-term investment vehicles and"
"14432","are not designed for investors that engage in short-term"
"14433","trading activity, market-timing, or other abusive trading"
"14434","practices.  Short-term trading, market-timing, or other"
"14435","abusive trading practices may disrupt portfolio management"
"14436","strategies, may drive Fund expenses higher, and may harm"
"14437","Fund performance.  In particular, frequent trading of Fund"
"14438","shares may:"
"14439","* cause a Fund to keep more assets in cash or cash"
"14440","equivalents than it otherwise would, causing the Fund"
"14441","to miss out on investment opportunities;"
"14442","* force a Fund to sell some of its investments sooner"
"14443","than it otherwise would in order to honor redemptions;"
"14444","* increase brokerage commissions and other portfolio"
"14445","transaction expenses if securities are constantly"
"14446","being bought and sold by a Fund as assets move in"
"14447","or out; or"
"14448","* dilute the value of Fund shares held by long-term"
"14449","shareholders."
"14450","The Trust, Old Mutual Capital, and their agents, will"
"14451","not knowingly permit investors to excessively trade"
"14452","the Funds, although no guarantees can be made that all"
"14453","such trading will be identified and restricted."
"14454","Purchase and sale orders may be received through"
"14455","financial intermediaries.  The Trust, Old Mutual"
"14456","Capital, and their agents cannot always know or reasonably"
"14457","detect short-term trading through financial intermediaries,"
"14458","or through the use of omnibus accounts by financial"
"14459","intermediaries."
"14460","To minimize harm to the Funds and their shareholders,"
"14461","the Trust, Old Mutual Capital, and their agents reserve"
"14462","the right to reject any purchase order, including"
"14463","exchange purchases, for any reason without prior notice."
"14464","The Board has adopted, and Old Mutual Capital and its"
"14465","affiliates (collectively, for purposes of this section"
"14466","Policy Regarding Excessive or Short-Term Trading, Old
Mutual Capital) and their agents have implemented the"
"14467","following tools designed to discourage excessive"
"14468","short-term trading in the Funds:"
"14469","* trade activity monitoring;"
"14470","* trading guidelines for certain retail mutual funds"
"14471","advised by Old Mutual Capital;"
"14472","* a redemption/exchange fee on short-term trades in"
"14473","certain retail mutual funds advised by Old Mutual Capital;"
"14474","and"
"14475","* selective use of fair value pricing."
"14476","These tools are described in more detail below except"
"14477","fair value pricing, which is described above.  Although"
"14478","these tools are designed to discourage short-term"
"14479","trading, none of these tools alone nor all of them"
"14480","taken together eliminate the possibility that"
"14481","short-term trading activity in the Funds will occur."
"14482","Moreover, each of these tools other than the"
"14483","redemption/exchange fee involves judgments that are"
"14484","inherently subjective.  Old Mutual Capital and its"
"14485","agents seek to make these judgments to the best of"
"14486","their abilities in a manner that they believe is"
"14487","consistent with long-term shareholder interests."
"14488","For purposes of applying these tools, Old Mutual"
"14489","Capital and its agents may consider an investor's"
"14490","trading history in the retail mutual funds advised"
"14491","by Old Mutual Capital (together referred to as"
"14492","the Old Mutual Funds), other funds, and accounts"
"14493","under common ownership, influence or control.  Old"
"14494","Mutual Capital and the Funds may modify these"
"14495","procedures in response to changing regulatory"
"14496","requirements or to enhance the effectiveness of"
"14497","the procedures."
"14498","       Trade Activity Monitoring"
"14499","The Trust or its agent has entered into a shareholder"
"14500","information agreement with each of its Financial"
"14501","Intermediaries, as such term is defined by Rule"
"14502","22c-2 under the Investment Company Act of 1940,"
"14503","as amended, pursuant to which such Financial"
"14504","Intermediaries are obligated to provide individual"
"14505","shareholder transaction information to the Trust or"
"14506","its agents for the purpose of monitoring individual"
"14507","shareholder trading activity.  Old Mutual Capital"
"14508","and its agents monitor selected trades in an effort"
"14509","to detect excessive short-term trading activities."
"14510","If, as a result of this monitoring, Old Mutual Capital"
"14511","or one of its agents determines that a shareholder"
"14512","has engaged in excessive short-term trading, it will"
"14513","(i) advise the shareholder or use its best efforts to"
"14514","work with the Financial Intermediary that holds the"
"14515","account to inform the shareholder that he or she must"
"14516","stop such activities, and (ii) use its best efforts to"
"14517","refuse to process purchases or exchanges in the"
"14518","shareholder's account other than exchanges into an"
"14519","affiliated money market fund (if available)."
"14520","Determining whether a shareholder has engaged in"
"14521","excessive short-term trading involves judgments"
"14522","that are inherently subjective.  In making such"
"14523","judgments, Old Mutual Capital and its agents seek"
"14524","to act in a manner that they believe is consistent"
"14525","with the best interests of Old Mutual Fund shareholders."
"14526","The ability of Old Mutual Capital and its agents to"
"14527","monitor trades that are placed by the underlying"
"14528","shareholders of omnibus accounts that are held by"
"14529","intermediaries other than Financial Intermediaries"
"14530","(Second-Tier Intermediaries) may be limited because"
"14531","Second-Tier Intermediaries may choose not to disclose"
"14532","individual shareholder transaction information, or may"
"14533","not disclose such information in a timely manner upon"
"14534","the Trust's request.  Old Mutual Capital and its agents"
"14535","rely on Financial Intermediaries and the willingness,"
"14536","ability and rights of Second-Tier Intermediaries to"
"14537","monitor trading activity in omnibus accounts and/or"
"14538","enforce the Funds' excessive short-term trading policy."
"14539","Old Mutual Capital and its agents will attempt to apply"
"14540","the excessive short-term trading policy uniformly to all"
"14541","accounts."
"14542","       Trading Guidelines"
"14543","If a shareholder exceeds four exchanges out of an Old"
"14544","Mutual Fund (other than the Old Mutual Cash Reserves Fund)"
"14545","per calendar year, or if the Trust, Old Mutual Capital,"
"14546","or one of their agents, determines that a shareholder's"
"14547","short-term trading activity is excessive (regardless of"
"14548","whether or not such shareholder exceeds such guidelines),"
"14549","the Trust will not knowingly accept any additional purchase"
"14550","and exchange orders from such shareholder.  The Trust,"
"14551","Old Mutual Capital, and their agents may accept exchanges"
"14552","that are detected under these guidelines if they believe"
"14553","that such transactions are not short-term trading activity,"
"14554","for legitimate trading purposes and consistent with the"
"14555","best interests of long-term shareholders. Using the proceeds"
"14556","from the redemption of shares of one Old Mutual Fund to"
"14557","purchase shares of one or more other Old Mutual Funds is"
"14558","considered a single exchange.  The Trust may permit"
"14559","exceptions to the four exchange limit for wrap accounts"
"14560","that can demonstrate they are following a bona fide asset"
"14561","allocation program."
"14562","Transactions placed through the same financial intermediary"
"14563","on an omnibus basis may be deemed part of a group for"
"14564","purposes of this policy and may be rejected in whole or"
"14565","in part.  Transactions accepted by a financial intermediary"
"14566","in violation of the short-term trading policy are not deemed"
"14567","accepted by the Fund and may be cancelled or revoked."
"14568","Old Mutual Capital and its agents may also suspend or"
"14569","terminate a shareholder's exchange privileges if a"
"14570","shareholder engages in a disruptive pattern of exchanges."
"14571","The Trust and Old Mutual Capital also reserve the right to"
"14572","delay delivery of redemption proceeds for up to 7 days or"
"14573","to honor certain redemptions with securities rather than"
"14574","cash."
"14575","       Redemption/Exchange Fee"
"14576","The Funds impose a 2.00% redemption/exchange fee on total"
"14577","redemption proceeds before applicable deferred sales"
"14578","charges of any shareholder redeeming shares, including"
"14579","redemption by exchange, of the Funds within 10 calendar"
"14580","days of their purchase.  The Funds will impose a"
"14581","redemption/exchange fee to the extent that the number"
"14582","of Fund shares redeemed exceeds the number of Fund shares"
"14583","that have been held for more than 10 calendar days."
"14584","In determining how long shares of a Fund have been held,"
"14585","Old Mutual Capital assumes that shares held by the"
"14586","investor for the longest period of time will be sold first."
"14587","A Fund will retain the redemption/exchange fee for the"
"14588","benefit of the remaining shareholders.  Due to operational"
"14589","requirements, certain financial intermediaries' methods"
"14590","for tracking and calculating the fee may differ in some"
"14591","respects from the Funds' methods for tracking and"
"14592","calculating the fee."
"14593","The Funds charge the redemption/exchange fee to discourage"
"14594","market-timing by those shareholders initiating redemptions"
"14595","or exchanges to take advantage of short-term market movements,"
"14596","to help minimize the impact the redemption or exchange may"
"14597","have on the performance of a Fund, to facilitate Fund"
"14598","management,"
"14599","and to offset certain transaction costs and other expenses a"
"14600","Fund incurs because of the redemption or exchange."
"14601","The Funds will not charge the 2.00% redemption/exchange fee"
"14602","on transactions involving the following:"
"14603","* total or partial redemptions of shares by omnibus accounts"
"14604","maintained by financial intermediaries such as broker-dealers"
"14605","and retirement plans and their service providers that do not"
"14606","have the systematic capability to process the fee;"
"14607","* total or partial redemptions of shares by omnibus accounts"
"14608","maintained by financial intermediaries such as broker-dealers"
"14609","and retirement plans and their service providers that have"
"14610","negotiated pre-existing legal covenants and agreements with"
"14611","the Funds to waive or not to impose the fee;"
"14612","* total or partial redemptions effectuated pursuant to an"
"14613","automatic non-discretionary rebalancing program or a"
"14614","systematic withdrawal plan established with the Funds or a"
"14615","financial intermediary;"
"14616","* redemptions of shares from employer-sponsored retirement"
"14617","plans, such as 401(k) plans, which are made in connection"
"14618","with the withdrawal of an entire plan from a Fund;"
"14619","* certain broker wrap fee and other fee-based programs;"
"14620","* redemptions initiated by a Fund, as permitted in the"
"14621","prospectus; or"
"14622","* redemptions by the Old Mutual Asset Allocation Portfolios"
"14623","(each of which is a fund of funds that primarily invests"
"14624","in shares of Old Mutual Funds) or by other asset allocation"
"14625","or target date funds advised by Old Mutual Capital."
"14626","There is no guarantee that the Trust will be successful in"
"14627","its efforts to enforce its redemption/exchange fee."
"14628","Certain financial intermediaries such as broker/dealers,"
"14629","banks, insurance companies and retirement plan administrators"
"14630","may impose frequent trading restrictions that differ from the"
"14631","Funds' frequent trading restrictions, if such frequent trading"
"14632","restrictions are deemed by Old Mutual Capital or its agents to"
"14633","sufficiently protect Fund shareholders.  Please contact your"
"14634","broker/dealer, bank, insurance company or retirement plan"
"14635","administrator to determine what frequent trading restrictions"
"14636","may apply to your account."
"14637","       Share Classes"
"14638","The Funds offer the same share classes.  These share classes"
"14639","are described below."
"14640","The Trust offers four classes of shares:  Class A, Class C,"
"14641","Class Z and Institutional Class.  Each class represents"
"14642","investments in the same portfolio of securities of a Fund"
"14643","and has the same rights and privileges as the other share"
"14644","classes of that Fund, except that:  (i) each class may be"
"14645","subject to different sales charges (loads); (ii) each class"
"14646","may be subject to different distribution fees, which, if"
"14647","applicable, are paid pursuant to a distribution plan adopted"
"14648","under Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act; (iii) each class is subject"
"14649","to different service fees, which, if applicable, are paid"
"14650","pursuant to a service plan which may be adopted under Rule"
"14651","12b-1 of the 1940 Act; (iv) exchanges are generally not"
"14652","permitted between the various share classes but only among"
"14653","the same class; and (v) each class may have exclusive voting"
"14654","rights with respect to matters affecting only that class."
"14655","When choosing a share class, you should consult your financial"
"14656","adviser as to which class is most suitable for you.  Below is"
"14657","a summary of certain features of the share classes."
"14658","You will not pay a sales charge in connection with the"
"14659","acquisition of the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund shares"
"14660","pursuant to the Reorganization.  In addition, the holding"

"14662","sales charge applicable to Class A or Class C shares of"
"14663","the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund received pursuant to the"
"14664","Reorganization will be the date of original purchase of"

"14666","Cap Fund and not the date of the Reorganization."

"15512","       Distributions and Taxes"
"15513","As a regulated investment company, a Fund generally"
"15514","does not pay Federal income tax on the income and"
"15515","gains it distributes to you.  The Funds pay"
"15516","shareholders dividends from their net investment"
"15517","income and distributions from their net realized"
"15518","capital gains at least once a year, if available."
"15519","A Fund may distribute such income dividends and"
"15520","capital gains more frequently, if necessary, in"
"15521","order to reduce or eliminate Federal excise or"
"15522","income taxes on the Fund. The amount of any"
"15523","distribution will vary, and there is no guarantee"
"15524","a Fund will pay either an income dividend or a"
"15525","capital gains distribution."
"15526","Dividends and distributions will be reinvested"
"15527","in your Fund account unless you instruct the"
"15528","Fund otherwise.  There are no fees on reinvestments."
"15529","Alternatively, you may elect to receive your dividends"
"15530","and distributions in cash in the form of a check,"
"15531","wire, or ACH."
"15532","       Taxes on Transactions"
"15533","In general, if you are a taxable investor,"
"15534","Fund distributions (other than a return of capital)"
"15535","are taxable to you at either ordinary income or"
"15536","capital gains tax rates.  This is true whether"
"15537","you reinvest your distributions in additional Fund"
"15538","shares or receive them in cash."
"15539","The tax status of your distributions for each"
"15540","calendar year will be detailed in your annual tax"
"15541","statement from the Fund.  The current qualified"
"15542","dividend income and long-term capital gains tax"

"15565","In addition, investors in taxable accounts should be"
"15566","aware of the following basic tax points:"
"15567","* Distributions of net investment income and net"
"15568","short-term capital gains are taxable to you as ordinary"
"15569","income. If you are an individual or other non-corporate"
"15570","shareholder and meet certain holding period requirements,"
"15571","a portion of income dividends paid by a Fund may be"
"15572","designated as qualified dividend income eligible for"
"15573","taxation at long-term capital gain rates."
"15574","* Distributions of net long-term capital gains are"
"15575","taxable to you as long-term capital gains no matter"
"15576","how long you have owned your shares."
"15577","* Distributions declared to shareholders with a record"
"15578","date in December - if paid to you by the end of"
"15579","January - are taxable for Federal income tax purposes"
"15580","as if received in December."
"15581","* A sale or exchange of Fund shares is a taxable event."
"15582","This means that you may have a capital gain or loss"
"15583","(provided the shares are held as a capital asset),"
"15584","which will be short-term if you held your shares for"
"15585","12 months or less and long-term if you held your"
"15586","shares for more than 12 months."
"15587","* Fund distributions and gains from the sale or"
"15588","exchange of your Fund shares generally are subject"
"15589","to state and local taxes."
"15590","* If you invest in a Fund shortly before it makes"
"15591","a capital gain distribution, the distribution will"
"15592","lower the value of the Fund's shares by the amount"
"15593","of the distribution and, in effect, you will receive"
"15594","some of your investment back in the form of a taxable"
"15595","distribution. This is sometimes referred to as buying
a dividend because, although the distribution is in"
"15596","effect a return of a portion of the purchase price,"
"15597","it is taxable."
"15598","By law, if you do not provide a Fund with your proper"
"15599","taxpayer identification number and certain required"
"15600","certifications, you may be subject to backup withholding"
"15601","on any distributions of income, capital gains, or"
"15602","proceeds from the sale of your shares.  A Fund also"
"15603","must withhold if the IRS instructs it to do so. When"
"15604","withholding is required, the amount will be 28% of"
"15605","any distributions or proceeds paid."
"15606","Fund shares are generally not sold outside the U.S."
"15607","Foreign investors should be aware that U.S. withholding,"
"15608","special certification requirements to avoid U.S. backup"
"15609","withholding and claim any treaty benefits, and estate"
"15610","taxes may apply to any investment in the Fund. If you"
"15611","are not a citizen or resident of the U.S., see the"
"15612","statement of additional information for more information."
"15613","This discussion of Distributions and Taxes is not"
"15614","intended or written to be used as tax advice.  Because"
"15615","everyone's tax situation is unique, you should consult"
"15616","your tax professional about Federal, state, local, or"

"16069","The Funds' past performance, both before and after"

"16322","THE REORGANIZATION"
"16323","A. Information About The Reorganization"
"16324","Shareholders of the Small Cap Fund are being asked"
"16325","to approve the Plan of Reorganization, which sets"
"16326","forth the terms and conditions under which the"
"16327","Reorganization will be implemented.  The Plan of"
"16328","Reorganization provides for the sale of all the"
"16329","assets and liabilities of the Small Cap Fund to"
"16330","the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund and the reclassification"
"16331","of the issued and outstanding Small Cap Fund shares"
"16332","into TS&W Small Cap Value Fund shares.  If"
"16333","shareholders of the Small Cap Fund approve the"
"16334","Plan of Reorganization and other closing"
"16335","conditions are satisfied, all of the assets and"
"16336","liabilities of the Small Cap Fund will become"
"16337","the assets and liabilities of the TS&W Small Cap"
"16338","Value Fund, and the issued and outstanding"
"16339","Class A, Class C, Institutional Class and"
"16340","Class Z shares of the Small Cap Fund will be"
"16341","converted into Class A, Class C,"
"16342","Institutional Class and Class Z shares,"
"16343","respectively, of the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund"
"16344","that have a net asset value equal to the value"
"16345","of the Small Cap Fund net assets immediately"
"16346","prior to the Reorganization.  The value of each"
"16347","Small Cap Fund shareholder's account in the"
"16348","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund immediately after"
"16349","the Reorganization will be the same as the"
"16350","value of such shareholder's account with"
"16351","Small Cap Fund immediately prior to the"
"16352","Reorganization."
"16353","The value of the Small Cap Fund's assets to be"
"16354","acquired and the amount of its liabilities to"
"16355","be assumed by the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund and"
"16356","the NAV of a share of the Small Cap Fund will be"
"16357","determined as of the close of regular trading on"
"16358","the NYSE on the Closing Date, after the declaration"
"16359","of any dividends on the Closing Date, and will be"
"16360","determined in accordance with the valuation"
"16361","procedures described in the Trust's and the Funds'"
"16362","currently effective prospectus and statement of"
"16363","additional information. The Closing Date is"
"16364","expected to occur the close of business on or"
"16365","about March 6, 2009."
"16366","As soon as practicable after the Closing Date,"
"16367","the Small Cap Fund will distribute pro rata to"
"16368","its shareholders of record the shares of the"
"16369","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund it receives in the"
"16370","Reorganization, so that each shareholder of"
"16371","the Small Cap Fund will receive a number of"
"16372","full and fractional shares of the"
"16373","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund equal in value to"
"16374","his or her holdings in the Small Cap Fund,"
"16375","and the Small Cap Fund will be terminated."
"16376","Such distribution will be accomplished by"
"16377","opening accounts on the books of the"
"16378","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund in the names of"
"16379","each owner of record of the Small Cap Fund"
"16380","and by crediting thereto the respective number"
"16381","of shares of the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund due"
"16382","such owner. Each shareholder account shall be"
"16383","credited with the pro rata number of the"
"16384","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund's shares due to"
"16385","that shareholder. Accordingly, immediately"
"16386","after the Reorganization, each former shareholder"
"16387","of the Small Cap Fund will own shares of the"
"16388","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund that will be equal"
"16389","to the value of that shareholder's shares of"
"16390","the Small Cap Fund as of the Closing Date."
"16391","Any special options (for example, automatic"
"16392","investment plans on current Small Cap Fund"
"16393","shareholder accounts) will automatically"
"16394","transfer to the new accounts."
"16395","The implementation of the Reorganization"
"16396","is subject to a number of conditions as set"
"16397","forth in the Plan of Reorganization,"
"16398","including approval of the shareholders of"
"16399","the Small Cap Fund. The Plan of Reorganization"
"16400","also requires receipt of a tax opinion"
"16401","indicating that, for federal income tax purposes,"
"16402","the Reorganization qualifies as a tax-free"
"16403","reorganization. The Plan of Reorganization"
"16404","may be terminated and the Reorganization abandoned"
"16405","at any time prior to the Closing Date by"
"16406","the Board if it is determined that the"
"16407","Reorganization would disadvantage either of the"
"16408","Funds. Please review the Plan of Reorganization"
"16409","carefully. A copy of the Plan of Reorganization"
"16410","is attached as Appendix I to this"
"16411","Prospectus/Proxy Statement."
"16412","B. Reasons for the Reorganization"
"16413","The Board of Old Mutual Funds II, including each"
"16414","of the independent Trustees, determined that"
"16415","the reorganization of the Small Cap Fund into"
"16416","the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund would be in the"
"16417","best interests of both Funds and their"
"16418","shareholders and that the interests of the"
"16419","shareholders of each Fund would not be diluted"
"16420","as a result of the Reorganization."
"16421","In evaluating the proposed Reorganization,"
"16422","the Board considered a number of factors,"
"16423","including:"
"16424","* The compatibility of the investment objectives"
"16425","and principal investment strategies of the two"
"16426","Funds."
"16427","* The relative size and investment performance"
"16428","of each Fund."
"16429","* That capital loss carryforwards available to"
"16430","offset future capital gains of the Small Cap Fund"
"16431","would succeed to the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund,"
"16432","assuming the Reorganization qualifies as a"
"16433","reorganization under Section 368(a) of the"
"16434","Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended."
"16435","* Whether the interests of either Fund's current"
"16436","shareholders would be diluted in connection with"
"16437","the proposed Reorganization."
"16438","* The potential benefits of the Reorganization"
"16439","to shareholders of each Fund."
"16440","* The continuity of management, given that"
"16441","Old Mutual Capital is the adviser to both Funds."
"16442","* Upon consummation of the Reorganization, Old"
"16443","Mutual Capital's agreement to reduce the"
"16444","management fee for the TS&W Small Cap Value"
"16445","Fund to 1.00% and to reduce the expense"
"16446","limitations for the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund's"
"16447","Class A, Class C, Institutional Class and"
"16448","Class Z shares to 1.50%, 2.25%, 1.10% and 1.25%,"
"16449","respectively."
"16450","* Equal or potentially lower total expense ratio"
"16451","for the combined Fund resulting from increased"
"16452","asset levels and corresponding economies of scale."
"16453","* Old Mutual Capital's belief that the combined"
"16454","Fund will have improved marketability based upon"
"16455","its historical performance record and will be"
"16456","better poised to attract new assets and enable"
"16457","shareholders to benefit from economies of scale."
"16458","* The potential operating efficiencies that may"
"16459","result from combining the Funds."
"16460","* The tax consequences of the Reorganization,"
"16461","including the tax-free nature of the Reorganization"
"16462","for Federal income tax purposes, so shareholders"
"16463","should not realize a tax gain or loss as a direct"
"16464","result of the Reorganization."
"16465","Old Mutual Capital advised the Board that in light"
"16466","of the compatibility of investment objectives and"
"16467","principal investment strategies, continuity of"
"16468","management at the adviser level, reduction of the"
"16469","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund's management fee and expense"
"16470","limitations, and better historical performance,"
"16471","the Reorganization of Small Cap Fund into"
"16472","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund would be in the best"
"16473","interests of both Funds and their shareholders"
"16474","and that the interests of the shareholders of"
"16475","each Fund would not be diluted as a result of the"
"16476","Reorganization.  After considering alternatives for"
"16477","the future of the Small Cap Fund, the Board"
"16478","concluded that the Small Cap Fund should be"
"16479","reorganized into the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund."
"16480","In addition, effective on or about March 31, 2009,"
"16481","Liberty Ridge will cease providing investment"
"16482","sub-advisory services to the Small Cap Fund."
"16483","If the Reorganization is not approved, any"
"16484","shares held in the Small Cap Fund will remain Small"
"16485","Cap Fund shares, but Liberty Ridge will not"
"16486","continue to provide sub-advisory services to"
"16487","the Small Cap Fund after March 31, 2009."
"16488","Eagle will continue to provide investment"
"16489","sub-advisory services to the Small Cap Fund."
"16490","The Board and Old Mutual Capital would then"
"16491","determine what further action to take, which"
"16492","may include recommending that shareholders"
"16493","approve one or more new investment sub-advisers"
"16494","to the Small Cap Fund, or transferring all"
"16495","the Fund's assets to Eagle."
"16496","C. Federal Income Tax Consequences"
"16497","The following is a general summary of the"
"16498","material Federal income tax consequences of"
"16499","the Reorganization and is based upon the"
"16500","current provisions of the Internal Revenue"
"16501","Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), the"
"16502","existing Treasury regulations thereunder,"
"16503","current administrative rulings of the"

"16507","tax consequences that are expected to result"
"16508","from the Reorganization, under currently"
"16509","applicable law, are as follows:"
"16510","* The Reorganization will qualify as a"
"16511","reorganization within the meaning of"
"16512","Section 368(a) of the Code;"
"16513","* No gain or loss will be recognized by"
"16514","the Small Cap Fund upon the transfer of"

"16527","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund to be received"
"16528","by a shareholder of the Small Cap Fund"
"16529","will be the same as the tax basis of the"
"16530","shares of the Small Cap Fund surrendered"
"16531","in exchange therefor;"
"16532","* The holding period of the shares of the"
"16533","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund to be received"
"16534","by a shareholder of the Small Cap Fund"
"16535","(including fractional shares to which they"
"16536","may be entitled) will include the holding"
"16537","period for which such shareholder held the"
"16538","shares of the Small Cap Fund exchanged therefor,"
"16539","provided that such shares of the Small Cap"
"16540","Fund are capital assets in the hands of such"
"16541","shareholder as of the date the Reorganization"
"16542","is consummated;"
"16543","* No gain or loss will be recognized by the"

"16552","the Small Cap Fund;"
"16553","* The tax basis of the assets of the Small Cap"

"16563","* Pursuant to Sections 381(a) and (b) of the"
"16564","Code and Sections 1.381(a)-1 and 1.381(b)-1 of"
"16565","the Income Tax Regulations, the tax year of the"
"16566","Small Cap Fund will end on the date the"
"16567","Reorganization is consummated and the"
"16568","TS&W Small Cap Value Fund will succeed to"
"16569","and take into account the items of the Small"
"16570","Cap Fund described in Section 381(c) of the"
"16571","Code, subject to the provisions and limitations"
"16572","specified in Sections 381, 382, 383 and 384"
"16573","of the Code, and the regulations thereunder."
"16574","Old Mutual Funds II has not requested and will"
"16575","not request an advance ruling from the IRS as"
"16576","to the Federal income tax consequences of the"
"16577","Reorganization.  As a condition to closing,"
"16578","the law firm Stradley Ronon Stevens & Young,"
"16579","LLP (Stradley Ronon) shall have rendered a"
"16580","favorable opinion to Old Mutual Funds II as"
"16581","to the foregoing Federal income tax consequences"
"16582","of the Reorganization, which opinion will be"
"16583","conditioned upon the accuracy, as of the date"
"16584","of closing, of certain representations made by"
"16585","Old Mutual Funds II upon which Stradley Ronon"
"16586","will rely in rendering its opinion.  The"
"16587","conclusions reached in Stradley Ronon's opinion"
"16588","could be jeopardized if the representations"
"16589","of Old Mutual Funds II are incorrect in any"
"16590","material respect."
"16591","Capital losses can generally be carried"
"16592","forward to each of the eight (8) taxable years"
"16593","succeeding the loss year to offset future"
"16594","capital gains.  The Reorganization of the Small"
"16595","Cap Fund into the TS&W Small Cap Value Fund will"
"16596","result in a more than 50% change in ownership"
"16597","of the Small Cap Fund, the smaller of the two"
"16598","Funds.  As a result, the capital loss carryovers"
"16599","(together with any current year loss and"
"16600","unrealized depreciation in value of investments,"
"16601","collectively referred to as total capital
loss carryovers) of Small Cap Fund will be"

"16605","in value for investments and aggregate net asset"
"16606","value of the Small Cap Fund as compared to the"

"16608","limitation on the use of the Small Cap Fund's total"

"17962","As part of the In Re Mutual Funds Investment"
"17963","Litigation pending in the U.S. District Court"

"17965","PBHG Funds (now known as Old Mutual Funds II),"
"17966","PBA, its affiliates, and/or certain related and"

"17969","and a separate Derivative Suit (Derivative Suit)"
"17970","(together the Civil Litigation). The Civil"
"17971","Litigation consolidates and coordinates for"

"17973","class action suits and derivative suits based"
"17974","on similar claims, which previously had been"
"17975","filed against the PBHG Funds, PBA and/or certain"
"17976","related parties in other jurisdictions, and had"

"17978","on the previously filed suits is contained in"
"17979","the statement of additional information."
"17980","Consolidated complaints in the Class Action"
"17981","and Derivative Suits were filed in the Civil"
"17982","Litigation on September 29, 2004 (MDL 1586)."
"17983","The Civil Litigation and the previously filed"
"17984","suits are primarily based upon allegations"
"17985","that the defendants engaged in or facilitated"
"17986","market timing of the PBHG Funds, and also"
"17987","made selective disclosure of confidential"
"17988","portfolio information to certain defendants"
"17989","and other parties. The Civil Litigation"
"17990","alleges a variety of theories for recovery,"
"17991","including but not limited to: (i) violations"
"17992","of various provisions of the Federal securities"
"17993","laws; (ii) breaches of fiduciary duty; and"
"17994","(iii) false or misleading prospectus disclosure."
"17995","The Civil Litigation requests compensatory and"
"17996","punitive damages. In addition, the Derivative"
"17997","Suit requests the removal of each of the"
"17998","Trustees, the removal of Liberty Ridge as"
"17999","investment adviser, the removal of PBHG Fund"
"18000","Distributors (now known as Old Mutual Investment"
"18001","Partners) as distributor, rescission of the"
"18002","management and other contracts between PBHG Funds"
"18003","and the defendants, and rescission of the PBHG"
"18004","Funds' 12b-1 Plan."
"18005","On August 30, 2005, the State of West Virginia"
"18006","West Virginia Securities Division (the WV Securities
Division) entered a cease and desist order"
"18007","(the Order and, together with the Civil Litigation,"
"18008","the Litigation) against PBA. PBHG Funds was"
"18009","not named in the Order. In the Order, the"
"18010","WV Securities Division alleged that PBA"
"18011","permitted short-term trading in excess of"
"18012","the PBHG Funds' disclosed limitation of"
"18013","four exchanges per year and also provided"
"18014","confidential portfolio information to"
"18015","customers of a broker-dealer who used the"
"18016","information to market time the PBHG Funds."
"18017","The WV Securities Division further alleges"
"18018","in the Order that the foregoing violated the"
"18019","West Virginia Securities Act"
"18020","(W. Va. Code 32-1-101, et seq.) and is"
"18021","seeking that PBA cease and desist from further"
"18022","violation of the West Virginia Securities Act;"
"18023","pay restitution; disgorge fees; pay administrative"
"18024","and investigatory costs and expenses, including"
"18025","counsel fees; pay an administrative assessment;"
"18026","and other relief. It is possible that similar"
"18027","actions based on the same facts and circumstances"
"18028","may be filed in the future by other state agencies."
"18029","Such other actions will be described in the"
"18030","statement of additional information."
"18031","At this stage of the Litigation it is too early"
"18032","to assess the likely outcome of the Litigation,"
"18033","or success of any defenses each of the defendants"
"18034","may have to the claims. Any potential resolution"
"18035","of the Litigation may include, but not be limited to,"
"18036","judgments or settlements for damages against Liberty"
"18037","Ridge or any other named defendant. While it is"
"18038","currently too early to predict the result of the"
"18039","Litigation, Old Mutual Capital does not believe"
"18040","that the outcome of the Litigation will materially"
"18041","affect its ability to carry out its duty as"
"18042","investment adviser to the LRC Sub-Advised Funds."
"18043","However, neither Liberty Ridge nor Old Mutual"
"18044","Capital is currently able to gauge the level of"
"18045","shareholder redemptions that may result from the"
"18046","news of the resolution of these pending lawsuits."
"18047","Redemptions may require the LRC Sub-Advised Funds"

"18304","VOTING INFORMATION"
"18305","The Small Cap Fund expects to solicit proxies"
"18306","principally by mail, but may also solicit proxies"
"18307","by telephone, facsimile, telegraph or personal"
"18308","interview.  Small Cap Fund officers will not"
"18309","receive any additional or special compensation"
"18310","for solicitation activities.  The Small Cap Fund"
"18311","also engaged the services of Broadridge to assist"
"18312","in the solicitation of proxies.  In all cases"
"18313","where a telephonic proxy is solicited, the"
"18314","Broadridge representative will ask for each"
"18315","shareholder's full name and address or the zip"
"18316","code or employer identification number and to"
"18317","confirm that the shareholder has received this"
"18318","Prospectus/Proxy Statement and proxy card in the mail."
"18319","If the shareholder is a corporation or other"
"18320","entity, the Broadridge representative is required"
"18321","to ask for the person's title and confirmation that"
"18322","the person is authorized to direct the voting of the"
"18323","shares.  If the information solicited agrees with the"
"18324","information provided to Broadridge, then the Broadridge"
"18325","representative may explain the voting process, read"
"18326","the proposals listed on the proxy card, and ask for"
"18327","the shareholder's instructions on each proposal."
"18328","Although the Broadridge representative is permitted"
"18329","to answer questions about the process, he or she is"
"18330","not permitted to recommend to the shareholder how to"
"18331","vote, but he or she may read any recommendation set"
"18332","forth in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement.  The"
"18333","telephone solicitor will record the shareholder's"
"18334","voting instructions on the card.  Within 72 hours,"
"18335","the shareholder will be sent a confirming letter or"
"18336","mailgram to confirm his or her vote and asking the"
"18337","shareholder to call 866-615-7269 immediately if his"
"18338","or her instructions are not correctly reflected in"
"18339","the confirmation."
"18340","The Funds will pay all costs and expenses associated"
"18341","with the Reorganization, subject to current expense"
"18342","limitations.  Costs associated with the Reorganization"
"18343","generally include printing and mailing costs,"
"18344","solicitation costs, legal costs, costs paid to the"
"18345","Funds' independent registered public accounting firm,"
"18346","and other miscellaneous costs.  All costs and expenses"
"18347","associated with the Reorganization will be allocated"
"18348","between the Funds on a pro rata basis based on each"
"18349","Fund's relative net assets.  The anticipated costs"
"18350","of the reorganization are approximately $38,692."
"18351","All properly executed and unrevoked proxies received"
"18352","in time for the Special Meeting will be voted in"
"18353","accordance with the instructions they contain.  If"
"18354","no instructions are given, shares represented by"
"18355","proxies will be voted FOR the proposal to approve"
"18356","the Plan of Reorganization and in accordance with"
"18357","the Board's recommendations on other matters.  The"
"18358","presence in person or by proxy of one-third of the"
"18359","outstanding shares of Small Cap Fund entitled to"
"18360","vote at the Special Meeting will constitute a"
"18361","quorum."
"18362","At the Special Meeting, a quorum being present,"
"18363","approval of the Plan of Reorganization requires"
"18364","the affirmative vote of the lesser of:"
"18365","(a)  67% or more of the voting securities"
"18366","of the Small Cap Fund present or represented"
"18367","by proxy at the Special Meeting, if the holders"
"18368","of more than 50% of the outstanding voting"
"18369","securities of the Small Cap Fund are present"
"18370","or represented by proxy; or"
"18371","(b)  of more than 50% of the outstanding voting"
"18372","securities of the Small Cap Fund.  Abstentions"
"18373","and broker non-votes will be counted as shares"
"18374","present at the Special Meeting for quorum purposes"
"18375","but will not be considered votes cast at the"
"18376","Special Meeting.  As a result, they have the"
"18377","same effect as a vote against the Plan of"
"18378","Reorganization.  Broker non-votes arise"
"18379","from a proxy returned by a broker holding"
"18380","shares for a customer which indicates that"
"18381","the broker has not been authorized by the"
"18382","customer to vote on a proposal.  If you"
"18383","return a proxy, you may revoke it at any time"
"18384","prior to its exercise by executing a"
"18385","superseding proxy or by submitting a notice of"
"18386","revocation to the Secretary of Old Mutual"
"18387","Funds II.  In addition, although mere attendance"
"18388","at the Special Meeting will not revoke a proxy,"
"18389","if you attend the Special Meeting you may"
"18390","withdraw your proxy and vote in person."
"18391","Shareholders may also transact any other"
"18392","business not currently contemplated that"
"18393","may properly come before the Special Meeting"
"18394","in the discretion of the proxies or their"
"18395","substitutes."
"18396","Shareholders of record as of the close of"
"18397","business on December 10, 2008 (the Record Date)"
"18398","are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting."
"18399","On the Record Date, there were 12,689.973"
"18400","Class A shares, 11,326.975 Class C shares,"
"18401","11.364 Institutional Class shares and"
"18402","1,157,857.822 Class Z shares of the"
"18403","Small Cap Fund outstanding.  Each share"
"18404","held entitles a shareholder to one vote for"
"18405","each dollar (and a proportionate fractional"
"18406","vote for each fractional dollar) of net asset"
"18407","value of shares held by the shareholder."
"18408","If a quorum is not present at the Special"
"18409","Meeting, or if a quorum is present at the"
"18410","Special Meeting but sufficient votes to"
"18411","approve the Reorganization are not received,"
"18412","or if other matters arise requiring shareholder"
"18413","attention, the persons named as proxy agents"
"18414","may propose one or more adjournments to permit"

"18487","OLD MUTUAL FUNDS II"
"18488","ON BEHALF OF THE"
"18489","OLD MUTUAL MID-CAP FUND"
"18490","December 23, 2008Dear Shareholder:"
"18491","The Old Mutual Mid-Cap Fund's Board of Trustees (the Board)"
"18492"," requests your vote on a proposal to reorganize the Old Mutual"
"18493"," Mid-Cap Fund (the Mid-Cap Fund) into the Old Mutual TS&W"
"18494"," Mid-Cap Value Fund (the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund and"
"18495","together with the Mid-Cap Fund, the Funds).  If the"
"18496","reorganization is approved by shareholders, you will receive"
"18497"," shares of the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund equivalent in dollar"
"18498"," value to your shares in the Mid-Cap Fund at the time of the"
"18499","reorganization."
"18500","The Board's recommendation to reorganize the Mid-Cap Fund"
"18501","is based primarily on its compatibility with the TS&W Mid-Cap"
"18502","Value Fund and economies of scale that may be achieved by"
"18503"," combining the Funds. Both Funds are advised by Old Mutual"
"18504"," Capital, Inc., and while the Mid-Cap Fund is sub-advised by"
"18505"," Liberty Ridge Capital, Inc. and the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund"
"18506","is sub-advised by Thompson Siegel & Walmsley, LLC, both"
"18507","Funds primarily invest in mid-capitalization companies."
"18508","Reorganizing the Mid-Cap Fund will enable you to maintain"
"18509"," your exposure to mid-capitalization companies while also"
"18510","enabling you to potentially benefit from the TS&W Mid-Cap"
"18511","Value Fund's focus on investments in mid-capitalization"
"18512"," companies with value characteristics."
"18513","In addition to the foregoing, the Board recommends reorganizing"
"18514"," the Mid-Cap Fund so that shareholders may realize additional"
"18515","benefits such as equal or potentially lower expense ratios than"
"18516"," the Mid-Cap Fund's current expense ratios.  Importantly, the"
"18517"," reorganization is designed to be a tax-free reorganization, so"
"18518"," you should not realize a tax gain or loss as a direct result of"
"18519"," the reorganization.  Additional details about the proposed"
"18520"," reorganization are described in the enclosed Proxy Statement."
"18521","This proposal will be presented to shareholders at a special"
"18522","meeting of shareholders to be held on February 27, 2009 in"
"18523"," Denver, Colorado. This package contains important information"
"18524"," about the proposal, a proxy, a business reply envelope permitting"
"18525","you to vote by mail and simple instructions on how to vote by phone"
"18526"," or via the Internet.  We encourage you to read the entire Proxy"
"18527"," Statement, which describes the proposal in detail."
"18528","THE MID-CAP FUND'S BOARD HAS CAREFULLY CONSIDERED"
"18529","THE PROPOSAL, BELIEVES THE PROPOSAL TO BE IN THE BEST"
"18530"," INTERESTS OF MID-CAP FUND SHAREHOLDERS, AND UNANIMOUSLY"
"18531"," RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE PROPOSAL."
"18532","You can vote in one of four ways:"
"18533","BY MAIL using the enclosed"
"18534","proxy card;"
"18535","BY INTERNET through the website listed on your"
"18536","proxy card;"
"18537","BY TELEPHONE by calling the number indicated"
"18538","on your proxy card; or"
"18539","IN PERSON at the Special Meeting of"
"18540","Shareholders on February 27, 2009.Your vote is extremely important,"
"18541","no matter how many shares"
"18542"," you own.  If we do not receive sufficient votes to approve the"
"18543","proposal, we may have to send additional mailings or conduct"
"18544","telephone solicitations.  If you have any questions about the"
"18545","proposal, please call our proxy solicitor, Broadridge at 866-615-7269."
"18546","Thank you for your response and we look forward to preserving"

"18626"," reclassification of the issued and outstanding shares of the"
"18627","Mid-Cap Fund into shares of the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund based"
"18628","upon the net asset values of the two Funds (the Reorganization)."
"18629","  The TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund is also a series portfolio of Old"
"18630","Mutual Funds II.  Upon the consummation of the Reorganization,"
"18631"," all of the assets and liabilities of the Mid-Cap Fund will become"
"18632","assets and liabilities of the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund, and Class A"

"18644","The Funds have similar investment strategies in that both Funds"
"18645"," invest primarily in mid-capitalization companies.  However, the"
"18646"," Mid-Cap Fund seeks to provide investors with above-average total"
"18647"," returns over a three to five year market cycle, consistent with"
"18648"," reasonable risk, by investing at least 80% of its net assets"

"18652","investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings"
"18653"," for investment purposes) in equity securities of mid-capitalization"
"18654"," companies with value characteristics.  The TS&W Mid-Cap Value"
"18655","Fund generally invests in mid-capitalization companies that"
"18656"," Thompson Siegel & Walmsley, LLC (TS&W), the TS&W Mid-Cap"

"18744","INTRODUCTION"
"18745","The Introduction section of this Prospectus/Proxy Statement"
"18746"," provides a brief overview of the key features and other matters"
"18747","typically of interest to shareholders considering a proposed"
"18748","reorganization between mutual funds. These responses are"
"18749","qualified in their entirety by the remainder of this Prospectus/Proxy"
"18750","Statement, which you should read carefully because it contains"
"18751"," additional information and details regarding the proposed"
"18752","reorganization.  The description of the Reorganization is qualified"
"18753"," by reference to the full text of the Plan of Reorganization, which"
"18754"," is attached as Appendix I."
"18755","A. Questions and Answers Regarding the Reorganization"
"18756","Q.	WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED?"
"18757","A.	The Plan of Reorganization provides for the sale of"
"18758"," all the assets and liabilities of the Mid-Cap Fund to the TS&W"
"18759"," Mid-Cap Value Fund and the reclassification of the issued and"
"18760"," outstanding Mid-Cap Fund shares into TS&W Mid-Cap Value"
"18761","Fund shares.  If shareholders of the Mid-Cap Fund approve the"
"18762"," Plan of Reorganization and other closing conditions are"
"18763","satisfied, all of the assets and liabilities of the Mid-Cap Fund"
"18764"," will become the assets and liabilities of the TS&W Mid-Cap"
"18765"," Value Fund, and the issued and outstanding Class A, Class"
"18766"," C, Institutional Class and Class Z shares of the Mid-Cap"
"18767","Fund will be converted into Class A, Class C, Institutional"
"18768"," Class and Class Z shares, respectively, of the TS&W Mid-Cap"
"18769","Value Fund, with an aggregate net asset value equal to the"
"18770","value of the Mid-Cap Fund's net assets immediately prior"
"18771","to the Reorganization.  The value of each Mid-Cap Fund"
"18772","shareholder's account in the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund"
"18773"," immediately after the Reorganization will be the same"
"18774"," as the value of such shareholder's account with Mid-Cap"
"18775"," Fund immediately prior to the Reorganization."
"18776","Q.	WHY IS THE REORGANIZATION IN THE BEST"
"18777"," INTERESTS OF SHAREHOLDERS?"
"18778","A.	The Board of Trustees (the Board) of Old"
"18779","Mutual Funds II, including each of the independent Trustees,"
"18780"," determined that the Reorganization would be in the best"
"18781","interests of both Funds and their shareholders based on"
"18782"," the following factors, among others:"
"18783","* The compatibility of the investment objectives and"
"18784","principal investment strategies of the two Funds."
"18785","* The continuity of management, given that Old Mutual"
"18786","Capital is the adviser to both Funds."
"18787","* The lower expense limitations for the TS&W Mid-Cap Value"
"18788"," Fund's Class A, Class C and Class Z shares of 1.40%, 2.15%"
"18789","and 1.12%, respectively, and that as a result, shareholders"
"18790","of the Mid-Cap Fund will benefit from the lower expense"
"18791","limitations that are in effect for the TS&W Mid-Cap Value"
"18792","Fund upon the Closing Date (defined below) of the"
"18793","Reorganization."
"18794","* Equal or potentially lower total expense ratios for the"
"18795","combined Fund resulting from increased asset levels"
"18796","and corresponding economies of scale."
"18797","* Old Mutual Capital's belief that the combined Fund will"
"18798"," have improved marketability and will be better poised"
"18799"," to attract new assets and enable shareholders to benefit"
"18800","from economies of scale."
"18801","* The potential operating efficiencies that may result"
"18802"," from combining the Funds."
"18803","* The tax-free nature of the Reorganization for Federal"
"18804","income tax purposes, so shareholders should not realize"
"18805","a tax gain or loss as a direct result of the Reorganization."
"18806","Q.	WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE"
"18807","BOARD OF TRUSTEES?"
"18808","A.	The Board recommends that you vote FOR"
"18809","the Reorganization."
"18810","Q.	DO THE FUNDS HAVE THE SAME INVESTMENT"
"18811"," OBJECTIVE?"
"18812","A.	The Mid-Cap Fund seeks to provide investors"
"18813"," with above-average total return over a three to five year"
"18814","market cycle, consistent with reasonable risk, by investing at"
"18815"," least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment"
"18816"," purposes) in equity securities of mid-capitalization companies,"
"18817"," while the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund seeks to provide investors"
"18818"," with long-term capital growth by investing at least 80% of its net"
"18819","assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity"
"18820","securities of mid-capitalization companies with value characteristics."
"18821","The Funds have similar investment strategies in that both Funds"
"18822"," invest primarily in mid-capitalization companies. The Mid-Cap"
"18823","Fund invests in mid-capitalization companies with market"
"18824","capitalizations similar to the companies in the S&P MidCap 400"
"18825","Index, while the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund invests in"
"18826"," mid-capitalization companies with market capitalizations similar"
"18827","to the companies in the Russell MidCap Value Index.  As of"
"18828","March 31, 2008, the S&P MidCap 400 Index included companies"
"18829","with market capitalizations between $262 million and $12.5 billion"
"18830","and the Russell MidCap Value Index included companies with"
"18831"," market capitalizations between $156 million and $45.7 billion."
"18832","  In addition, the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund primarily invests"
"18833","in securities that TS&W believes present a value or potential"
"18834"," worth that is not recognized by prevailing market prices or that"
"18835","have experienced some fundamental changes and are intrinsically"
"18836"," undervalued by the investment community."
"18837","Q.	WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES IN THE"
"18838","INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND RISKS OF THE FUNDS?"
"18839","A.	While both Funds invest primarily in securities of"
"18840","mid-capitalization issuers, the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund normally"
"18841"," invests at least 80% of its net assets in securities of"
"18842","mid-capitalization issuers with value characteristics.  This means"
"18843"," that to the extent the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund invests in"
"18844","mid-capitalization issuers with value characteristics, it may be"
"18845","exposed to greater investment style risk because market performance"
"18846","tends to be cyclical, and during various cycles, certain investment"
"18847","styles may fall in and out of favor.  The market may not favor the TS&W"
"18848"," Mid-Cap Value Fund's value style of investing, and the TS&W Mid-Cap"
"18849"," Value Fund's returns may vary considerably from other equity funds"
"18850"," using different investment styles.  The Mid-Cap Fund invests in"
"18851","companies with both value and growth characteristics and, as a result,"
"18852","may be less susceptible to investment style risk.  However, the Mid-Cap"
"18853"," Fund's returns may be lower than the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund during"
"18854","market cycles that favor companies with value characteristics."
"18855","Q.	HOW DO THE FUNDS COMPARE IN SIZE?"
"18856","A.	As of September 30, 2008, the Mid-Cap Fund's net assets"
"18857"," were $115.7 million and the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund's net assets"
"18858"," were $63.5 million.  The asset size of each Fund fluctuates on a daily"
"18859","basis and the asset size of the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund after the"
"18860","Reorganization may be larger or smaller than the combined assets"
"18861"," of the Funds as of September 30, 2008."
"18862","Q.	WILL THE PROPOSED REORGANIZATION RESULT IN HIGHER"
"18863"," INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES OR OTHER FUND EXPENSES?"
"18864","A.	The management fee for both Funds is 0.95% and will not"
"18865"," change upon the closing date of the Reorganization, which is"
"18866","anticipated to occur the close of business on or about March 6,"
"18867"," 2009 (the Closing Date).  The expense limitations for the TS&W"
"18868","Mid-Cap Value Fund are lower than the expense limitations for the"
"18869","Mid-Cap Fund.  As a result, shareholders of the Mid-Cap Fund will"
"18870","benefit from the lower expense limitations that are in effect for the"
"18871","TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund upon the Closing Date of the Reorganization."
"18872","In addition, the projected gross total expense ratios of the TS&W"
"18873","Mid-Cap Value Fund following the completion of"
"18874","the Reorganization are expected to be lower than the current gross"
"18875","total expense ratios of the Mid-Cap Fund."
"18876","Q.	WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PROPOSED"
"18877"," REORGANIZATION?"
"18878","A.	Legal counsel to the Mid-Cap Fund and the TS&W Mid-Cap"
"18879"," Value Fund will issue an opinion to Old Mutual Funds II that the"
"18880","Reorganization will constitute a tax-free reorganization for Federal"
"18881"," income tax purposes.  Thus, shareholders are not expected to be"
"18882"," subject to Federal income taxes as a direct result of the Reorganization."
"18883","Q.	WILL THE SHAREHOLDER SERVICES PROVIDED BY OLD"
"18884"," MUTUAL CAPITAL CHANGE?"
"18885","A.	No.  Old Mutual Capital manages the Mid-Cap Fund and the"
"18886"," TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund.  The custodian, transfer agent and"
"18887","distributor are also the same for both Funds.  Purchase, exchange"
"18888"," and redemption privileges are also the same for both Funds.  Please"
"18889"," consult your financial intermediary for information on any services"
"18890"," provided by them to the Funds."
"18891","Q.	CAN I CONTINUE TO ADD TO MY MID-CAP FUND ACCOUNT?"
"18892","A.	Yes.  Mid-Cap Fund shareholders may continue to make"
"18893","investments in the Mid-Cap Fund before the closing date of the"
"18894"," Reorganization."
"18895","Q.	WHAT HAPPENS IF THE REORGANIZATION IS"
"18896","NOT APPROVED?"
"18897","A.	Effective on or about March 31, 2009, Liberty Ridge will"
"18898","cease providing investment sub-advisory services to the Mid-Cap"
"18899"," Fund.  If the Reorganization is not approved, any shares you held"
"18900"," in the Mid-Cap Fund will remain Mid-Cap Fund shares, but Liberty"
"18901","Ridge will not continue to provide sub-advisory services to the"
"18902"," Mid-Cap Fund after March 31, 2009.  The Board and Old Mutual"
"18903","Capital would determine what further action to take, which may"
"18904"," include recommending that shareholders approve one or more"
"18905"," new investment sub-advisers to the Mid-Cap Fund.  The TS&W"
"18906"," Mid-Cap Value Fund would continue to operate separately."
"18907","Q.	WILL EITHER FUND PAY FOR THE PROXY SOLICITATION,"
"18908","LEGAL AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSED"
"18909","REORGANIZATION?"
"18910","A.	The Funds will pay all costs and expenses associated"
"18911"," with the Reorganization, subject to current expense limitations."
"18912"," Costs associated with the Reorganization generally include"
"18913","printing and mailing costs, solicitation costs, legal costs, costs"
"18914"," paid to the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm,"
"18915","and other miscellaneous costs.  All costs and expenses associated"
"18916","with the Reorganization will be allocated between the Funds on a"
"18917"," pro rata basis based on each Fund's relative net assets.  The"
"18918"," anticipated costs of the reorganization are approximately $58,893."
"18919","Q.	IF APPROVED, WHEN WILL THE PROPOSED"
"18920","REORGANIZATION TAKE PLACE?"
"18921","A.	If approved, the Reorganization will be effective the"
"18922"," close of business on or about March 6, 2009, or as soon as"
"18923"," reasonably practicable after shareholder approval is obtained."
"18924"," Shortly after completion of the Reorganization, shareholders"
"18925"," will receive a confirmation statement reflecting their new TS&W"
"18926","Mid-Cap Value Fund account number and number of shares owned."
"18927","Q.	WHAT IF I WANT TO EXCHANGE MY SHARES FOR"
"18928","ANOTHER OLD MUTUAL FUND PRIOR TO THE REORGANIZATION?"
"18929","A.	You may exchange your shares into other mutual funds"
"18930"," advised by Old Mutual Capital (each an Old Mutual Fund) before"
"18931","the Closing Date by calling 888-772-2888 or contacting your financial"
"18932"," intermediary.  If you choose to exchange your Mid-Cap Fund shares"
"18933"," for another Old Mutual Fund, your request will be treated as a normal"
"18934","exchange of shares and will be a taxable transaction unless your"
"18935"," shares are held in a tax-deferred account, such as an IRA.  If you"
"18936"," exchange your shares before the date of the Special Meeting or"
"18937","any adjournments thereof, you will still be asked to cast your vote"
"18938"," on the Reorganization."
"18939","Q.	HOW MANY VOTES AM I ENTITLED TO CAST?"
"18940","A.	Shareholders of record as of the close of business on"
"18941","December 10, 2008 (the Record Date) are entitled to vote at the"
"18942","Special Meeting.  You are entitled to one vote for each dollar (and a"
"18943"," proportionate fractional vote for each fractional dollar) of net asset"
"18944","value of shares held in your name as determined as of the Record"
"18945","Date."
"18946","Q.	HOW CAN I VOTE MY SHARES?"
"18947","A.	You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting or any"
"18948","adjournments thereof if you owned shares of the Mid-Cap Fund at the"
"18949"," close of business on December 10, 2008.  If you attend the Special"
"18950"," Meeting or any adjournments thereof, you may vote your shares in"
"18951"," person.  Whether or not you intend to attend the Special Meeting or"
"18952","any adjournments thereof in person, you may vote in any of the"
"18953","following ways:"
"18954","(1)	Mail: Vote, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card(s)"
"18955","in the enclosed postage-paid envelope;"
"18956","(2)	Telephone: Have your proxy card(s) available. Vote by"

"18962","by accessing the website listed on your proxy card(s). Enter the control"
"18963","number from your proxy card(s). Follow the simple instructions found on"
"18964","the website."
"18965","Q.	IF I VOTE MY PROXY NOW, CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE LATER?"
"18966","A.	If you vote your proxy now, you may revoke it at any time"
"18967"," prior to its exercise by executing a superseding proxy or by submitting"
"18968"," a notice of revocation to the Secretary of Old Mutual Funds II.  In"
"18969","addition, although mere attendance at the Special Meeting will not revoke"
"18970","a proxy, if you attend the Special Meeting you may withdraw your proxy"
"18971","and vote in person."
"18972","Q.	WHAT IS THE REQUIRED VOTE TO APPROVE THE"
"18973"," PROPOSED REORGANIZATION?"
"18974"," A.	At the Special Meeting, a quorum being present, approval of"
"18975","the Reorganization requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Mid-Cap Fund as defined by the"
"18976","Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act).  This"
"18977","means the affirmative vote of the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of the voting"
"18978"," securities of Mid-Cap Fund present or represented by proxy at the"
"18979","Special Meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding"
"18980","voting securities of Mid-Cap Fund are present or represented by proxy;"
"18981"," or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of Mid-Cap Fund."

"18984","A.	Please call the proxy solicitor, Broadridge, at 866-615-7269"
"18985","to obtain additional information regarding the proposed Reorganization."
"18986","B. Comparison of Investment Objectives and Policies"
"18987","The investment strategies of the Mid-Cap Fund and the TS&W Mid-Cap"
"18988","Value Fund are similar in that both Funds invest primarily in"
"18989"," mid-capitalization companies.  In addition, both Funds are advised"
"18990"," by Old Mutual Capital, though the Mid-Cap Fund is sub-advised by"
"18991","Liberty Ridge Capital, Inc. and the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund is"
"18992","sub-advised by TS&W.  The Mid-Cap Fund seeks to provide investors"
"18993"," with above-average total return over a three to five year market cycle,"
"18994"," consistent with reasonable risk, by investing at least 80% of its net"
"18995"," assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity"
"18996"," securities of mid-capitalization companies, while the TS&W Mid-Cap"
"18997"," Value Fund seeks to provide investors with long-term capital growth"
"18998"," by investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for"
"18999"," investment purposes) in equity securities of mid-capitalization"
"19000","companies with value characteristics."
"19001","Reorganizing the Mid-Cap Fund into the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund"
"19002","will enable Mid-Cap Fund shareholders to maintain exposure to"
"19003","mid-capitalization companies while increasing exposure to"
"19004"," value-oriented companies.  This is because the TS&W Mid-Cap"
"19005"," Value Fund primarily invests in mid-capitalization securities that"
"19006"," TS&W believes present a value or potential worth that is not"
"19007"," recognized by prevailing market prices or that have experienced"
"19008"," some fundamental changes and are intrinsically undervalued by"
"19009","the investment community.  The Mid-Cap Fund focuses on companies"
"19010","in the blend space, meaning they share both value and growth"
"19011"," characteristics.  The Mid-Cap Fund uses the S&P MidCap 400"
"19012","Index as its benchmark while the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund uses"
"19013"," the Russell MidCap Value Index as its benchmark.  As of March 31,"
"19014","2008, the S&P MidCap 400 Index included companies with market"
"19015","capitalizations between $262 million and $12.5 billion and the Russell"
"19016","MidCap Value Index included companies with market capitalizations"
"19017","between $156 million and $45.7 billion.  The market capitalizations"
"19018","of the companies in the Funds' portfolios and the Indices change"
"19019","over time and the Funds will not automatically sell or stop buying"
"19020","stock of a company they already own if the company's market"
"19021"," capitalization grows or falls out of this range."
"19022","The annual portfolio turnover rate for the Mid-Cap Fund was 119.16%"
"19023"," for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008.  The TS&W Mid-Cap Value"
"19024"," Fund's portfolio turnover rate for the same period was 66.60%.  A fund"
"19025"," with a higher rate of portfolio turnover will result in higher transaction"
"19026"," costs and may result in additional taxes for shareholders as"
"19027"," compared to a fund with less portfolio turnover."
"19028","C. Comparison of Risk Factors"
"19029","Each Fund may invest in various types of securities or use certain"
"19030","investment techniques to achieve its investment objective. The"
"19031","following is a summary of the principal risks associated with such"
"19032","securities and investment techniques. Additional information about"
"19033"," these risks is included in the Funds' prospectus. As with any security,"
"19034"," an investment in either Fund involves certain risks, including loss"
"19035","of principal. An investment in the Funds is not a deposit of a bank"
"19036","and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or"
"19037","any other government agency. The fact that a particular risk is not"
"19038","identified does not indicate that a Fund does not invest its assets in,"
"19039","or is precluded from investing its assets in, securities that give rise to"
"19040","that risk."
"19041","       Similar Risk Factors of the Funds"
"19042","Like all investments in securities, you risk losing money by investing"
"19043","in the Funds.  The main risks of investing in each Fund are as follows:"
"19044","Stock Market Risk.  The value of the stocks and other securities owned"
"19045","by the Funds will fluctuate depending on the performance of the companies"
"19046"," that issued them, general market and economic conditions, and investor"
"19047"," confidence.  The market may also fail to recognize a Sub-Adviser's"
"19048"," determination of an investment's value or a Sub-Adviser may"
"19049","misgauge that value."
"19050","Small and Mid-Capitalization Company Risk.  The Funds primarily invest"
"19051"," in mid-capitalization companies and also may invest in small-capitalization"
"19052","companies.  While small-capitalization companies, and to an extent"
"19053"," mid-capitalization companies, may offer greater potential for capital"
"19054"," appreciation than larger and more established companies, they may"
"19055"," also involve greater risk of loss and price fluctuation.  The trading markets"
"19056"," for securities of small-capitalization and mid- capitalization issuers may"
"19057","be less liquid and more volatile than securities of larger companies.  This"
"19058","means that the Funds could have greater difficulty buying or selling a"
"19059","security of a small-capitalization or mid-capitalization issuer at an"
"19060","acceptable price, especially in periods of market volatility."
"19061","Industry and Sector Risk.  Companies that have similar lines of business"
"19062","are grouped together in broad categories called industries.  Certain"
"19063"," industries are grouped together in broader categories called sectors."
"19064","The Funds may focus their investments in certain industries within"
"19065","certain sectors, which may cause the Funds' performance to be"
"19066","susceptible to the economic, business or other developments that"
"19067","affect those industries."
"19068","       Primary Differences in Risk Factors of the Funds"
"19069","Investment Style Risk.  Market performance tends to be cyclical, and"
"19070"," during various cycles, certain investment styles may fall in and out of"
"19071"," favor.  The market may not favor the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund's value"
"19072","style of investing, and the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund's returns may vary"
"19073"," considerably from other equity funds using different investment styles."
"19074","More information regarding the risks of investing in the Funds is included"
"19075"," in the Old Mutual Funds II prospectus."
"19076","D. Comparison of Pricing, Purchase and Redemption Policies, Sales"
"19077"," Charges and Distribution"
"19078","Shares of the Mid-Cap Fund and the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund are"
"19079"," distributed by Old Mutual Investment Partners (OMIP or"
"19080","the Distributor), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Old Mutual Capital."
"19081"," The Distributor receives no compensation for serving in"
"19082"," such capacity, except as provided in separate distribution"
"19083","plans, adopted pursuant to Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act for each"
"19084"," Fund's Class A and Class C shares, and service plans which enable"
"19085"," the Funds to directly and indirectly bear certain expenses"
"19086"," relating to the distribution and sale of shares and services provided"
"19087","to shareholders.  Pursuant to 12b-1"
"19088","plans, both the Mid-Cap Fund and the TS&W Mid-Cap Value"
"19089"," Fund pay OMIP a service fee at an annual rate of 0.25% of"
"19090"," the average daily net assets attributable to Class A"
"19091","shares and a distribution fee and service fee at an annual combined"
"19092"," rate of 1.00% of the average daily net assets attributable"
"19093"," to Class C shares.  Because these fees are paid out of the assets"
"19094"," of Class A and Class C on an ongoing basis, over time these"
"19095","fees will increase the cost of your investment and may cost"
"19096"," you more than paying other types of sales charges.  For more"
"19097","information on distribution and service fees, refer to the"
"19098","Old Mutual Funds II prospectus."
"19099","The Funds have the same procedures for calculating"
"19100","share price and valuing portfolio securities, and the"
"19101","same policies regarding excessive or short term trading."
"19102","These policies and procedures are described in the following"
"19103","sections."
"19104","       Share Price"
"19105","The price you pay for a share of a Fund and the price you"
"19106"," receive upon selling or redeeming a share of a Fund is"
"19107"," called the net asset value (NAV).  NAV per share class of a Fund"
"19108"," is calculated by dividing the total net assets of each class"
"19109","of a Fund by the total number of the classes' shares outstanding"
"19110"," of that Fund.  NAV is determined as of the close of regular trading"
"19111","on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) (normally 4:00 p.m."
"19112","Eastern Time) on each day that the NYSE is open. NAV is not"
"19113","calculated, and you may not conduct Fund transactions, on"
"19114","days the NYSE is closed (generally weekends and New Year's"
"19115","Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,"
"19116","Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence"
"19117"," Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day)."
"19118","Your purchase, exchange, or redemption of a Fund's shares"
"19119"," will be priced at the next NAV calculated after your request"
"19120","is received in good order by the Fund's transfer agent or other"
"19121","Fund agents.  Shares begin to earn dividends on the first"
"19122"," business day following the day of purchase.  Shares earn dividends"
"19123"," until the day of redemption.  The NAV of your shares when"
"19124"," redeemed may be more or less than the price you originally"
"19125"," paid, depending primarily upon the Fund's investment"
"19126","performance.  If a Fund invests in another investment company,"
"19127"," that Fund's NAV is based in part on the NAV of the other"
"19128"," investment companies in which the Fund invests.  The"
"19129"," prospectuses for these other investment companies"
"19130","explain the circumstances under which they may use"
"19131"," fair value pricing and its effects."
"19132","The Trust may enter into agreements with broker-dealers,"
"19133","financial institutions, retirement plan accounts, trading platforms,"
"19134","certain fee-based programs, or other service"
"19135"," providers (financial intermediaries) that may include"
"19136","the Funds as an investment alternative in the programs"
"19137","they offer or administer.  If you buy shares through a"
"19138"," financial intermediary, generally your order must be received"
"19139"," by the financial"
"19140","intermediary and transmitted to OMIP or its designee by"
"19141"," the close of regular trading on the NYSE in order for you to receive"
"19142"," that day's offering price.  Otherwise, the order will receive"
"19143"," the offering price that is determined on the next day the NYSE is"
"19144","open.  The Trust and financial intermediaries reserve the"
"19145","right to reject customer orders that are incomplete or otherwise"
"19146"," not in good order.  Financial intermediaries may also"
"19147","accept certain customer orders conditioned on the understanding"
"19148"," that the orders may later be rejected in the event they cannot"
"19149"," be transmitted to OMIP or its designee in a timely manner."
"19150"," The Trust will be deemed to have received a purchase or"
"19151","redemption order from authorized financial intermediaries"
"19152","(authorized financial intermediaries) when the financial"
"19153","intermediary, or its authorized designee, accepts the order."
"19154"," The customer order will be priced at the Fund's NAV next"
"19155","computed after such order is unconditionally accepted by"
"19156"," an authorized financial intermediary or its authorized designee."
"19157","       Valuing Portfolio Securities"
"19158","The Funds use pricing services to determine the market value"
"19159"," of the securities in their portfolios.  Except as discussed"
"19160","below, the Funds generally use the market price of securities"
"19161","as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE to value"
"19162","equity securities held in the Funds' portfolios, except that"
"19163","securities traded primarily on the NASDAQ Stock Market"
"19164","(NASDAQ) are normally valued by the Fund at the NASDAQ"
"19165"," Official Closing Price provided by NASDAQ each business day."
"19166","Short-term investments in the Funds are priced at amortized"
"19167"," cost, which approximates market value.  The market value"
"19168","of bonds is determined based on an evaluated price.  If a Fund"
"19169","holds securities quoted in foreign currencies, it translates"
"19170"," that price into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates.  Because"
"19171","foreign markets may be open at different times than the"
"19172","NYSE, the price of a Fund's shares may change on days when"
"19173","its shares are not available for purchase or sale.  If a"
"19174"," market quotation is not readily available or is believed to be"
"19175","unreliable, the security is valued at fair value pursuant to"
"19176","procedures approved by the Board."
"19177","       Fair Value Pricing"
"19178","The Funds have fair value pricing procedures in place, and a"
"19179"," Valuation Committee meets as necessary to value"
"19180"," securities in appropriate circumstances that may include,"
"19181"," but are not limited to, when a market price is believed to"
"19182"," be unreliable, is unavailable, or if Fund assets have been affected"
"19183"," by events occurring after the close of trading of a securities"
"19184","market, but before a Fund calculates its NAV.  By fair"
"19185","valuing a security whose price may have been affected"
"19186"," by events occurring after the close of trading in its respective market,"
"19187"," a Fund attempts to establish a price that it might reasonably"
"19188"," expect to receive upon its current sale of that security."
"19189","These methods are designed to help ensure that the prices"
"19190"," at which Fund shares are purchased and redeemed are fair,"
"19191"," and do not result in dilution of shareholder interest or other"
"19192","harm to shareholders.  In addition, fair value pricing is a"
"19193","helpful tool in preventing excessive short-term trading"
"19194","activity because it may make it more difficult for potentially"
"19195","disruptive shareholders to determine if pricing inefficiencies"
"19196","exist in a Fund's securities.  The valuation assigned to fair valued"
"19197","securities for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV may"
"19198"," differ from the security's most recent closing market price"
"19199","and from the prices used by other mutual funds to calculate"
"19200","their NAVs.  Although intended to do so, the fair value"
"19201","procedures may not always better represent the price at"
"19202"," which the Fund could sell the fair valued security and may not"
"19203","always result in a more accurate NAV."
"19204","       Policy Regarding Excessive or Short-Term Trading"
"19205","While the Funds provide shareholders with daily liquidity,"
"19206"," they are intended to be long-term investment vehicles and are"
"19207"," not designed for investors that engage in short-term trading"
"19208"," activity, market-timing, or other abusive trading practices."
"19209","Short-term trading, market-timing, or other abusive trading"
"19210"," practices may disrupt portfolio management strategies,"
"19211"," may drive Fund expenses higher, and may harm Fund"
"19212"," performance.  In particular, frequent trading of Fund shares"
"19213"," may:"
"19214","* cause a Fund to keep more assets in cash or cash equivalents"
"19215"," than it otherwise would, causing the Fund to miss out on"
"19216","investment opportunities;"
"19217","* force a Fund to sell some of its investments sooner than"
"19218","it otherwise would in order to honor redemptions;"
"19219","* increase brokerage commissions and other portfolio transaction"
"19220"," expenses if securities are constantly being bought and sold"
"19221"," by a Fund as assets move in or out; or"
"19222","* dilute the value of Fund shares held by long-term shareholders."
"19223","The Trust, Old Mutual Capital, and their agents, will not knowingly"
"19224","permit investors to excessively trade the Funds, although"
"19225"," no guarantees can be made that all such trading will be"
"19226","identified and restricted.  Purchase and sale orders may be"
"19227","received through financial intermediaries.  The Trust, Old"
"19228","Mutual Capital, and their agents cannot always know or"
"19229"," reasonably detect short-term trading through financial"
"19230","intermediaries, or through the use of omnibus accounts"
"19231"," by financial intermediaries."
"19232","To minimize harm to the Funds and their shareholders,"
"19233","the Trust, Old Mutual Capital, and their agents reserve the"
"19234","right to reject any purchase order, including exchange"
"19235"," purchases, for any reason without prior notice."
"19236","The Board has adopted, and Old Mutual Capital and its"
"19237"," affiliates (collectively, for purposes of this section Policy"
"19238"," Regarding Excessive or Short-Term Trading, Old Mutual
Capital) and their agents have implemented the following"
"19239"," tools designed to discourage excessive short-term"
"19240","trading in the Funds:"
"19241","* trade activity monitoring;"
"19242","* trading guidelines for certain retail mutual funds advised"
"19243","by Old Mutual Capital;"
"19244","* a redemption/exchange fee on short-term trades in certain"
"19245"," retail mutual funds advised by Old Mutual Capital; and"
"19246","* selective use of fair value pricing."
"19247","These tools are described in more detail below except fair"
"19248"," value pricing, which is described above.  Although these"
"19249"," tools are designed to discourage short-term trading,"
"19250"," none of these tools alone nor all of them taken together"
"19251","eliminate the possibility that short-term trading activity in the Funds"
"19252"," will occur.  Moreover, each of these tools other than the"
"19253"," redemption/exchange fee involves judgments that are"
"19254"," inherently subjective.  Old Mutual Capital and its agents"
"19255","seek to make these judgments to the best of their abilities in a"
"19256"," manner that they believe is consistent with long-term shareholder"
"19257","interests.  For purposes of applying these tools, Old Mutual"
"19258","Capital and its agents may consider an investor's trading history"
"19259"," in the retail mutual funds advised by Old Mutual Capital"
"19260","(together referred to as the Old Mutual Funds), other funds,"
"19261","and accounts under common ownership, influence or"
"19262","control.  Old Mutual Capital and the Funds may modify these"
"19263"," procedures in response to changing regulatory requirements"
"19264"," or to enhance the effectiveness of the procedures."
"19265","       Trade Activity Monitoring"
"19266","The Trust or its agent has entered into a shareholder information"
"19267","agreement with each of its Financial Intermediaries, as such term"
"19268"," is defined by Rule 22c-2 under the Investment Company"
"19269","Act of 1940, as amended, pursuant to which such Financial"
"19270"," Intermediaries are obligated to provide individual"
"19271","shareholder transaction information to the Trust or its agents for"
"19272"," the purpose of monitoring individual shareholder trading"
"19273"," activity.  Old Mutual Capital and its agents monitor selected trades"
"19274"," in an effort to detect excessive short-term trading"
"19275","activities.  If, as a result of this monitoring, Old Mutual"
"19276","Capital or one of its agents determines that a shareholder has"
"19277"," engaged in excessive short-term trading, it will (i) advise the"
"19278","shareholder or use its best efforts to work with the Financial"
"19279","Intermediary that holds the account to inform the"
"19280"," shareholder that he or she must stop such activities,"
"19281"," and (ii) use its best efforts to refuse to process"
"19282"," purchases or exchanges in the shareholder's account"
"19283","other than exchanges into an affiliated money market fund"
"19284"," (if available).  Determining whether a shareholder has"
"19285","engaged in excessive short-term trading"
"19286"," involves judgments that are inherently subjective.  In making"
"19287"," such judgments, Old Mutual Capital and its agents seek"
"19288","to act in a manner that they believe is consistent with the"
"19289"," best interests of Old Mutual Fund shareholders."
"19290","The ability of Old Mutual Capital and its agents to monitor"
"19291","trades that are placed by the underlying shareholders of"
"19292","omnibus accounts that are held by intermediaries other"
"19293","than Financial Intermediaries (Second-Tier Intermediaries)"
"19294","may be limited because Second-Tier Intermediaries may choose"
"19295","not to disclose individual shareholder transaction information,"
"19296","or may not disclose such information in a"
"19297","timely manner upon the Trust's request.  Old Mutual"
"19298","Capital and its agents rely on Financial Intermediaries"
"19299"," and the willingness, ability and rights of Second-Tier"
"19300"," Intermediaries to monitor trading activity in omnibus"
"19301","accounts and/or enforce the Funds'"
"19302"," excessive short-term trading policy.  Old Mutual Capital and"
"19303"," its agents will attempt to apply the excessive short-term"
"19304"," trading policy uniformly to all accounts."
"19305","       Trading Guidelines"
"19306","If a shareholder exceeds four exchanges out of an Old Mutual"
"19307","Fund (other than the Old Mutual Cash Reserves Fund) per"
"19308","calendar year, or if the Trust, Old Mutual Capital, or one of their"
"19309","agents, determines that a shareholder's short-term trading"
"19310","activity is excessive (regardless of whether or not such"
"19311"," shareholder exceeds such guidelines), the Trust will not"
"19312","knowingly accept any additional purchase and exchange orders"
"19313"," from such shareholder.  The Trust, Old Mutual Capital,"
"19314"," and their agents may accept exchanges that are detected under"
"19315"," these guidelines if they believe that such transactions"
"19316","are not short-term trading activity, for legitimate trading purposes"
"19317"," and consistent with the best interests of long-term shareholders."
"19318","Using the proceeds from the redemption of shares"
"19319"," of one Old Mutual Fund to purchase shares of one or more"
"19320","other Old Mutual Funds is considered a single exchange.  The"
"19321"," Trust may permit exceptions to the four exchange limit for wrap"
"19322"," accounts that can demonstrate they are following a"
"19323","bona fide asset allocation program."
"19324","Transactions placed through the same financial intermediary"
"19325","on an omnibus basis may be deemed part of a group for"
"19326","purposes of this policy and may be rejected in whole or in part."
"19327","Transactions accepted by a financial intermediary in violation"
"19328"," of the short-term trading policy are not deemed accepted"
"19329","by the Fund and may be cancelled or revoked.  Old Mutual"
"19330","Capital and its agents may also suspend or terminate a"
"19331","shareholder's exchange privileges if a shareholder engages"
"19332","in a disruptive pattern of exchanges.  The Trust and Old"
"19333"," Mutual Capital also reserve the right to delay delivery of redemption"
"19334"," proceeds for up to 7 days or to honor certain redemptions"
"19335"," with securities rather than cash."
"19336","       Redemption/Exchange Fee"
"19337","The Funds impose a 2.00% redemption/exchange fee on total redemption"
"19338","proceeds before applicable deferred sales charges of any"
"19339","shareholder redeeming shares, including redemption by"
"19340","exchange, of the Funds within 10 calendar days of their"
"19341","purchase.  The Funds will impose a redemption/exchange fee"
"19342"," to the extent that the number of Fund shares redeemed exceeds"
"19343"," the number of Fund shares that have been held"
"19344","for more than 10 calendar days.  In determining how long"
"19345"," shares of a Fund have been held, Old Mutual Capital assumes"
"19346","that shares held by the investor for the longest period of"
"19347"," time will be sold first.  A Fund will retain the redemption/exchange"
"19348","fee for the benefit of the remaining shareholders.  Due to"
"19349","operational requirements, certain financial intermediaries'"
"19350","methods for tracking and calculating the fee may differ in"
"19351","some respects from the Funds' methods for tracking and"
"19352","calculating the fee."
"19353","The Funds charge the redemption/exchange fee to discourage"
"19354"," market-timing by those shareholders initiating redemptions"
"19355"," or exchanges to take advantage of short-term market"
"19356"," movements, to help minimize the impact the redemption or"
"19357"," exchange may have on the performance of a Fund, to"
"19358","facilitate Fund management, and to offset certain"
"19359","transaction costs and other expenses a Fund incurs"
"19360","because of the redemption or exchange."
"19361","The Funds will not charge the 2.00% redemption/exchange"
"19362"," fee on transactions involving the following:"
"19363","* total or partial redemptions of shares by omnibus"
"19364"," accounts maintained by financial intermediaries such as"
"19365"," broker-dealers and retirement plans and their service"
"19366"," providers that do not have the systematic capability to process the fee;"
"19367","* total or partial redemptions of shares by omnibus accounts"
"19368","maintained by financial intermediaries such as broker-dealers"
"19369","and retirement plans and their service"

"20207"," not pay Federal income tax on the income and gains it"
"20208","distributes to you.  The Funds pay shareholders dividends"
"20209"," from their net investment income and distributions from"
"20210","their net realized capital gains at least once a year, if available."
"20211"," A Fund may distribute such income dividends and capital gains"
"20212","more frequently, if necessary, in order to reduce or eliminate"
"20213"," Federal excise or income taxes on the Fund. The amount of"
"20214","any distribution will vary, and there is no guarantee a Fund"
"20215"," will pay either an income dividend or a capital gains distribution."
"20216","Dividends and distributions will be reinvested in your Fund"
"20217","account unless you instruct the Fund otherwise.  There are"
"20218","no fees on reinvestments.  Alternatively, you may elect to"
"20219","receive your dividends and distributions in cash in the"
"20220","form of a check, wire, or ACH."
"20221","       Taxes on Transactions"
"20222","In general, if you are a taxable investor, Fund distributions"
"20223"," (other than a return of capital) are taxable to you at either"
"20224","ordinary income or capital gains tax rates.  This is true"
"20225","whether you reinvest your distributions in additional Fund"
"20226","shares or receive them in cash."
"20227","The tax status of your distributions for each calendar year"
"20228","will be detailed in your annual tax statement from the Fund."
"20229","The current qualified dividend income and long-term capital"
"20230"," gains tax rates for non-corporate shareholders are"
"20231"," provided in the table below."

"20254","In addition,"
"20255","investors in taxable accounts should be aware of the"
"20256"," following basic tax points:"
"20257","* Distributions of net investment income and net"
"20258","short-term capital gains are taxable to you as"
"20259","ordinary income. If you are an individual or other"
"20260"," non-corporate shareholder and meet certain holding"
"20261"," period requirements, a portion of income dividends"
"20262"," paid by a Fund may be designated as qualified"
"20263","dividend income eligible for taxation at long-term"
"20264"," capital gain rates."
"20265","* Distributions of net long-term capital gains are"
"20266","taxable to you as long-term capital gains no matter"
"20267"," how long you have owned your shares."
"20268","* Distributions declared to shareholders with a record"
"20269","date in December - if paid to you by the end of January -"
"20270","are taxable for Federal income tax purposes as"
"20271","if received in December."
"20272","* A sale or exchange of Fund shares is a taxable"
"20273"," event. This means that you may have a capital"
"20274","gain or loss (provided the shares are held as a"
"20275","capital asset), which will be short-term if you held"
"20276","your shares for 12 months or less and long-term"
"20277"," if you held your shares for more than 12 months."
"20278","* Fund distributions and gains from the sale or exchange of your Fund"
"20279","shares generally are subject to state and local taxes."
"20280","* If you invest in a Fund shortly before it makes a capital gain"
"20281","distribution, the distribution will lower the value of the Fund's"
"20282","shares by the amount of the distribution and, in effect, you will receive"
"20283","some of your investment back in the form of a taxable distribution. This"
"20284","is sometimes referred to as buying a dividend because, although the"
"20285","distribution is in effect a return of a portion of the purchase"
"20286","price, it is taxable."
"20287","By law, if you do not provide a Fund with your proper taxpayer"
"20288","identification number and certain required certifications, you may"
"20289","be subject to backup withholding on any distributions of income,"
"20290","capital gains, or proceeds from the sale of your shares.  A Fund also must"
"20291","withhold if the IRS instructs it to do so. When withholding is required, the"
"20292","amount will be 28% of any distributions or proceeds paid."
"20293","Fund shares are generally not sold outside the U.S. Foreign investors"
"20294","should be aware that U.S. withholding, special certification requirements"
"20295","to avoid U.S. backup withholding and claim any treaty benefits, and"
"20296","estate taxes may apply to any investment in the Fund. If you are not a"
"20297","citizen or resident of the U.S., see the statement of additional information"
"20298","for more information."
"20299","This discussion of Distributions and Taxes is not intended or written"
"20300","to be used as tax advice.  Because everyone's tax situation is unique,"
"20301","you should consult your tax professional about Federal, state, local, or"
"20302","foreign tax consequences before making an investment in a Fund."
"20303","Refer to the statement of additional information"
"20304","for additional tax information."

"20893","THE REORGANIZATION"
"20894","A. Information About The Reorganization"
"20895","Shareholders of the Mid-Cap Fund are being asked to approve"
"20896","the Plan of Reorganization, which sets forth the terms and"
"20897","conditions under which the Reorganization will be implemented."
"20898","The Plan of Reorganization provides for the sale of all the assets"
"20899","and liabilities of the Mid-Cap Fund to the TS&W Mid-Cap Value"
"20900","Fund and the reclassification of the issued and outstanding"
"20901","Mid-Cap Fund shares into TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund shares."
"20902","If shareholders of the Mid-Cap Fund approve the Plan of"
"20903","Reorganization and other closing conditions are satisfied, all"
"20904","of the assets and liabilities of the Mid-Cap Fund will become"
"20905","the assets and liabilities of the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund, and"
"20906","the issued and outstanding Class A, Class C, Institutional Class"
"20907","and Class Z shares of the Mid-Cap Fund will be converted into"
"20908","Class A, Class C, Institutional Class and Class Z shares,"
"20909","respectively, of the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund that have a"
"20910","net asset value equal to the value of the Mid-Cap Fund net"
"20911","assets immediately prior to the Reorganization.  The value"
"20912","of each Mid-Cap Fund shareholder's account in the TS&W"
"20913","Mid-Cap Value Fund immediately after the Reorganization"
"20914","will be the same as the value of such shareholder's account"
"20915","with Mid-Cap Fund immediately prior to the Reorganization."
"20916","The value of the Mid-Cap Fund's assets to be acquired and"
"20917","the amount of its liabilities to be assumed by the TS&W Mid-Cap"
"20918","Value Fund and the NAV of a share of the Mid-Cap Fund will be"
"20919","determined as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE on the"
"20920","Closing Date, after the declaration of any dividends on the"
"20921","Closing Date, and will be determined in accordance with the"
"20922","valuation procedures described in the Trust's and the Funds'"
"20923","currently effective prospectus and statement of additional"
"20924","information. The Closing Date is expected to occur the close"
"20925","of business on or about March 6, 2009."
"20926","As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the Mid-Cap"
"20927","Fund will distribute pro rata to its shareholders of record the"
"20928","shares of the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund it receives in the"
"20929","Reorganization, so that each shareholder of the Mid-Cap Fund"
"20930","will receive a number of full and fractional shares of the TS&W"
"20931","Mid-Cap Value Fund equal in value to his or her holdings in the"
"20932","Mid-Cap Fund, and the Mid-Cap Fund will be terminated.  Such"
"20933","distribution will be accomplished by opening accounts on the"
"20934","books of the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund in the names of each"
"20935","owner of record of the Mid-Cap Fund and by crediting thereto"
"20936","the respective number of shares of the TS&W Mid-Cap Value"
"20937","Fund due such owner. Accordingly, immediately after the"
"20938","Reorganization, each former shareholder of the Mid-Cap Fund"
"20939","will own shares of the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund that will be"
"20940","equal to the value of that shareholder's shares of the Mid-Cap"
"20941","Fund as of the Closing Date. Any special options (for example,"
"20942","automatic investment plans on current Mid-Cap Fund shareholder"
"20943","accounts) will automatically transfer to the new accounts."
"20944","The implementation of the Reorganization is subject to a number"
"20945","of conditions as set forth in the Plan of Reorganization, including"
"20946","approval of the shareholders of the Mid-Cap Fund. The Plan of"
"20947","Reorganization also requires receipt of a tax opinion indicating"
"20948","that, for federal income tax purposes, the Reorganization qualifies"
"20949","as a tax-free reorganization. The Plan of Reorganization may"
"20950","be terminated and the Reorganization abandoned at any time"
"20951","prior to the Closing Date by the Board if it is determined that"
"20952","the Reorganization would disadvantage either of the Funds. Please"
"20953","review the Plan of Reorganization carefully. A copy of the Plan of"
"20954","Reorganization is attached as Appendix I to this Prospectus/Proxy"
"20955","Statement."
"20956","B. Reasons for the Reorganization"
"20957","The Board of Old Mutual Funds II, including each of the"
"20958","independent Trustees, determined that the reorganization of the"
"20959","Mid-Cap Fund into the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund would be in"
"20960","the best interests of both Funds and their shareholders and"
"20961","that the interests of the shareholders of each Fund would not be"
"20962","diluted as a result of the Reorganization."
"20963","In evaluating the proposed Reorganization, the Board considered"
"20964"," number of factors, including:"
"20965","* The compatibility of the investment objectives and principal"
"20966","investment strategies of the two Funds."
"20967","* The relative size and investment performance of each Fund."
"20968","* Whether capital loss carryforwards available to offset future capital"
"20969","gains of the Mid-Cap Fund would succeed to the TS&W Mid-Cap Value"
"20970","Fund assuming the Reorganization qualifies as a reorganization"
"20971","under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended."
"20972","* Whether the interests of either Fund's current shareholders would"
"20973","be diluted in connection with the proposed Reorganization."
"20974","* The potential benefits of the Reorganization to shareholders"
"20975","of each Fund."
"20976","* The continuity of management, given that Old Mutual Capital is"
"20977","the adviser to both Funds."
"20978","* The lower expense limitations for the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund's"
"20979","Class A, Class C and Class Z shares of 1.40%, 2.15% and 1.12%,"
"20980","respectively, and that as a result, shareholders of the Mid-Cap"
"20981","Fund will benefit from the lower expense limitations that are in"
"20982","effect for the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund upon the Closing Date of the"
"20983","Reorganization."
"20984","* Equal or potentially lower total expense ratio for the combined"
"20985","Fund resulting from increased asset levels and corresponding"
"20986","economies of scale."
"20987","* Old Mutual Capital's belief that the combined Fund will have"
"20988","improved marketability and will be better poised to attract new"
"20989","assets and enable shareholders to benefit from economies of scale."
"20990","* The potential operating efficiencies that may result from combining"
"20991","the Funds."
"20992","* The tax consequences of the Reorganization, including the tax-free"
"20993","nature of the Reorganization for Federal income tax purposes, so"
"20994","shareholders should not realize a tax gain or loss as a direct"
"20995","result of the Reorganization."
"20996","Old Mutual Capital advised the Board that in light of the"
"20997","compatibility of investment objectives and principal investment"
"20998","strategies, continuity of management at the adviser level,"
"20999","benefit to shareholders of the Mid-Cap Fund resulting from the"
"21000","lower expense limitations for the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund,"
"21001","the Reorganization of Mid-Cap Fund into TS&W Mid-Cap Value"
"21002","Fund would be in the best interests of both Funds and their"
"21003","shareholders and that the interests of the shareholders of each"
"21004","Fund would not be diluted as a result of the Reorganization."
"21005","After considering alternatives for the future of the Mid-Cap Fund,"
"21006","the Board concluded that the Mid-Cap Fund should be reorganized"
"21007","into the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund."
"21008","In addition, effective on or about March 31, 2009, Liberty Ridge"
"21009","will cease providing investment sub-advisory services to the"
"21010","Mid-Cap Fund.  If the Reorganization is not approved, any"
"21011","shares held in the Mid-Cap Fund will remain Mid-Cap Fund"
"21012","shares, but Liberty Ridge will not continue to provide"
"21013","sub-advisory services to the Mid-Cap Fund after March 31, 2009."
"21014","The Board and Old Mutual Capital would then determine what"
"21015","further action to take, which may include recommending that"
"21016","shareholders approve one or more new investment sub-advisers"
"21017","to the Mid-Cap Fund."
"21018","C. Federal Income Tax Consequences"
"21019","The following is a general summary of the material Federal income"
"21020","tax consequences of the Reorganization and is based upon the"
"21021","current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"
"21022","amended (the Code), the existing Treasury regulations thereunder,"
"21023","current administrative rulings of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)"
"21024","and judicial decisions, all of which are subject to change."
"21025","The principal Federal income tax consequences that are"
"21026","expected to result from the Reorganization, under currently"
"21027","applicable law, are as follows:"
"21028","* The Reorganization will qualify as a reorganization within"
"21029","the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code;"
"21030","* No gain or loss will be recognized by the Mid-Cap Fund upon"
"21031","the transfer of substantially all of its assets to the TS&W Mid-Cap"
"21032","Value Fund in exchange solely for shares of the TS&W Mid-Cap"
"21033","Value Fund;"
"21034","* No gain or loss will be recognized by any shareholder of the"
"21035","Mid-Cap Fund upon the exchange of shares of the Mid-Cap"
"21036","Fund solely for shares of the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund"
"21037","(including fractional shares to which they may be entitled);"
"21038","* The tax basis of the shares of the TS&W Mid-Cap Value"
"21039","Fund to be received by a shareholder of the Mid-Cap Fund"
"21040","will be the same as the tax basis of the shares of the Mid-Cap"
"21041","Fund surrendered in exchange therefor;"
"21042","* The holding period of the shares of the TS&W Mid-Cap Value"
"21043","Fund to be received by a shareholder of the Mid-Cap Fund"
"21044","(including fractional shares to which they may be entitled)"
"21045","will include the holding period for which such shareholder"
"21046","held the shares of the Mid-Cap Fund exchanged therefor,"
"21047","provided that such shares of the Mid-Cap Fund are capital"
"21048","assets in the hands of such shareholder as of the date the"
"21049","Reorganization is consummated;"
"21050","* No gain or loss will be recognized by the TS&W Mid-Cap"
"21051","Value Fund upon the receipt by it of substantially all of the"
"21052","assets of the Mid-Cap Fund in exchange solely for shares"
"21053","of the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund;"
"21054","* No gain or loss will be recognized by the Mid-Cap Fund"
"21055","upon the distribution of shares of the TS&W Mid-Cap Value"
"21056","Fund to its shareholders in complete liquidation of the"
"21057","TS&W Mid-Cap Fund;"
"21058","* The tax basis of the assets of the Mid-Cap Fund in the"
"21059","hands of the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund will be the same"
"21060","as the tax basis of such assets in the hands of the Mid-Cap"
"21061","Fund immediately prior to the Reorganization;"
"21062","* The holding period of the assets of the Mid-Cap Fund to"
"21063","be received by the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund will include"
"21064","the holding period of such assets in the hands of the Mid-Cap"
"21065","Fund immediately prior to the Reorganization; and"
"21066","* Pursuant to Sections 381(a) and (b) of the Code and"
"21067","Sections 1.381(a)-1 and 1.381(b)-1 of the Income Tax"
"21068","Regulations, the tax year of the Mid-Cap Fund will end"
"21069","on the date the Reorganization is consummated and the"
"21070","TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund will succeed to and take into"
"21071","account the items of the Mid-Cap Fund described in"
"21072","Section 381(c) of the Code, subject to the provisions and"
"21073","limitations specified in Sections 381, 382, 383 and 384"
"21074","of the Code, and the regulations thereunder."
"21075","Old Mutual Funds II has not requested and will not request"

"21077","tax consequences of the Reorganization.  As a condition"
"21078","to closing, the law firm Stradley Ronon Stevens & Young,"
"21079","LLP (Stradley Ronon) shall have rendered a favorable"

"22051","In June 2004, Pilgrim Baxter & Associates, Ltd. (PBA, now"
"22052","known as Liberty Ridge), the former adviser to the Trust and"
"22053","the current sub-adviser to several of the Trust's series"
"22054","portfolios (the LRC Sub-Advised Funds), reached settlement"
"22055","agreements with respect to the market timing and selective"
"22056","disclosure actions filed by the SEC and New York Attorney"
"22057","General (NYAG). Under the NYAG settlement, if certain terms"
"22058","and undertakings in that settlement as described in the statement"
"22059","of additional information are not met, the NYAG settlement"
"22060","stipulates that Liberty Ridge shall promptly terminate the"
"22061","sub-advisory services it provides to the LRC Sub-Advised"
"22062","Funds.  In this event, the Trust's Board would be required to"
"22063","seek a new sub-adviser for the LRC Sub-Advised Funds or"
"22064","consider other alternatives."
"22065","As part of the In Re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation pending"
"22066","in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland"
"22067","(the MDL Court), PBHG Funds (now known as Old"
"22068","Mutual Funds II), PBA, its affiliates, and/or certain related"
"22069","and unrelated parties have been named as defendants in"
"22070","a Class Action Suit (Class Action Suit) and a separate"
"22071","Derivative Suit (Derivative Suit) (together the Civil Litigation)."
"22072","The Civil Litigation consolidates and coordinates for"
"22073","pre-trial matters a number of individual class action suits"
"22074","and derivative suits based on similar claims, which"
"22075","previously had been filed against the PBHG Funds, PBA"
"22076","and/or certain related parties in other jurisdictions, and had"
"22077","been transferred to the MDL Court. Information on the"
"22078","previously filed suits is contained in the statement of"
"22079","additional information. Consolidated complaints in the Class"
"22080","Action and Derivative Suits were filed in the Civil Litigation"
"22081","on September 29, 2004 (MDL 1586)."
"22082","The Civil Litigation and the previously filed suits are primarily"
"22083","based upon allegations that the defendants engaged in or"
"22084","facilitated market timing of the PBHG Funds, and also made"
"22085","selective disclosure of confidential portfolio information to"
"22086","certain defendants and other parties. The Civil Litigation alleges"
"22087","a variety of theories for recovery, including but not limited to:"
"22088","(i) violations of various provisions of the Federal securities"
"22089","laws; (ii) breaches of fiduciary duty; and (iii) false or"
"22090","misleading prospectus disclosure. The Civil Litigation"
"22091","requests compensatory and punitive damages. In addition,"
"22092","the Derivative Suit requests the removal of each of the Trustees,"
"22093","the removal of Liberty Ridge as investment adviser, the removal"
"22094","of PBHG Fund Distributors (now known as Old Mutual Investment"
"22095","Partners) as distributor, rescission of the management and"
"22096","other contracts between PBHG Funds and the defendants,"
"22097","and rescission of the PBHG Funds' 12b-1 Plan."
"22098","On August 30, 2005, the State of West Virginia West Virginia"
"22099","Securities Division (the WV Securities Division) entered a"
"22100","cease and desist order (the Order and, together with the"
"22101","Civil Litigation, the Litigation) against PBA. PBHG Funds"
"22102","was not named in the Order. In the Order, the WV Securities"
"22103","Division alleged that PBA permitted short-term trading in"
"22104","excess of the PBHG Funds' disclosed limitation of four"
"22105","exchanges per year and also provided confidential"
"22106","portfolio information to customers of a broker-dealer"
"22107","who used the information to market time the PBHG Funds."
"22108","The WV Securities Division further alleges in the Order"
"22109","that the foregoing violated the West Virginia Securities"
"22110","Act (W. Va. Code 32-1-101, et seq.) and is seeking that"
"22111","PBA cease and desist from further violation of the West"
"22112","Virginia Securities Act; pay restitution; disgorge fees; pay"
"22113","administrative and investigatory costs and expenses,"
"22114","including counsel fees; pay an administrative assessment;"
"22115","and other relief. It is possible that similar actions based on"
"22116","the same facts and circumstances may be filed in the future"
"22117","by other state agencies. Such other actions will be described"
"22118","in the statement of additional information."
"22119","At this stage of the Litigation it is too early to assess the"
"22120","likely outcome of the Litigation, or success of any defenses"
"22121","each of the defendants may have to the claims. Any potential"
"22122","resolution of the Litigation may include, but not be limited to,"
"22123","judgments or settlements for damages against Liberty Ridge"
"22124","or any other named defendant. While it is currently too early"
"22125","to predict the result of the Litigation, Old Mutual Capital does"
"22126","not believe that the outcome of the Litigation will materially"
"22127","affect its ability to carry out its duty as investment adviser to"
"22128","the LRC Sub-Advised Funds. However, neither Liberty Ridge"
"22129","nor Old Mutual Capital is currently able to gauge the level of"
"22130","shareholder redemptions that may result from the news of the"
"22131","resolution of these pending lawsuits. Redemptions may require"
"22132","the LRC Sub-Advised Funds to sell investments to provide for"
"22133","sufficient liquidity, which could adversely impact the investment"
"22134","performance of the LRC Sub-Advised Funds."

"22453","The Mid-Cap Fund expects to solicit proxies principally by mail,"
"22454","but may also solicit proxies by telephone, facsimile, telegraph or"
"22455","personal interview.  Mid-Cap Fund officers will not receive any"
"22456","additional or special compensation for solicitation activities.  The"
"22457","Mid-Cap Fund also engaged the services of Broadridge to assist"
"22458","in the solicitation of proxies.  In all cases where a telephonic proxy"
"22459","is solicited, the Broadridge representative will ask for each"
"22460","shareholder's full name and address or the zip code or employer"
"22461","identification number and to confirm that the shareholder has"
"22462","received this Prospectus/Proxy Statement and proxy card in the"
"22463","mail.  If the shareholder is a corporation or other entity, the"
"22464","Broadridge representative is required to ask for the person's title"
"22465","and confirmation that the person is authorized to direct the"
"22466","voting of the shares.  If the information solicited agrees with the"
"22467","information provided to Broadridge, then the Broadridge"
"22468","representative may explain the voting process, read the proposals"
"22469"," listed on the proxy card, and ask for the shareholder's instructions"
"22470","on each proposal.  Although the Broadridge representative is"
"22471","permitted to answer questions about the process, he or she is"
"22472","not permitted to recommend to the shareholder how to vote, but"
"22473","he or she may read any recommendation set forth in the"
"22474","Prospectus/Proxy Statement.  The telephone solicitor will record"
"22475","the shareholder's voting instructions on the card.  Within 72 hours,"
"22476","the shareholder will be sent a confirming letter or mailgram to"
"22477","confirm his or her vote and asking the shareholder to call"
"22478","866-615-7269 immediately if his or her instructions are not"
"22479","correctly reflected in the confirmation."
"22480","The Funds will pay all costs and expenses associated with the"
"22481","Reorganization, subject to current expense limitations.  Costs"
"22482","associated with the Reorganization generally include printing"
"22483","and mailing costs, solicitation costs, legal costs, costs paid to"
"22484","the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm, and"
"22485","other miscellaneous costs.  All costs and expenses associated"
"22486","with the Reorganization will be allocated between the Funds on"
"22487","a pro rata basis based on each Fund's relative net assets.  The"
"22488","anticipated costs of the reorganization are approximately $58,893."

"22504","of the Mid-Cap Fund.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will be"
"22505","counted as shares present at the Special Meeting for quorum"
"22506","purposes but will not be considered votes cast at the Special"
"22507","Meeting.  As a result, they have the same effect as a vote"
"22508","against the Plan of Reorganization.  Broker non-votes arise"
"22509","from a proxy returned by a broker holding shares for a customer"
"22510","which indicates that the broker has not been authorized by the"
"22511","customer to vote on a proposal.  If you return a proxy, you may"
"22512","revoke it at any time prior to its exercise by executing a superseding"
"22513","proxy or by submitting a notice of revocation to the Secretary of"
"22514","Old Mutual Funds II.  In addition, although mere attendance at the"
"22515","Special Meeting will not revoke a proxy, if you attend the Special"
"22516","Meeting you may withdraw your proxy and vote in person."
"22517","Shareholders may also transact any other business not currently"
"22518","contemplated that may properly come before the Special Meeting"
"22519","in the discretion of the proxies or their substitutes."
"22520","Shareholders of record as of the close of business on December"
"22521","10, 2008 (the Record Date) are entitled to vote at the Special"
"22522","Meeting.  On the Record Date, there were 61,367.641 Class A"
"22523","shares, 13,771.917 Class C shares, 1,009,827.389 Institutional"
"22524","Class shares and 10,234,297.312 Class Z shares of the Mid-Cap"
"22525","Fund outstanding.  Each share held entitles a shareholder to"
"22526","one vote for each dollar (and a proportionate fractional vote"
"22527","for each fractional dollar) of net asset value of shares held"
"22528","by the shareholder."
"22529","If a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, or if a"
"22530","quorum is present at the Special Meeting but sufficient votes"
"22531","to approve the Reorganization are not received, or if other"
"22532","matters arise requiring shareholder attention, the persons"
"22533","named as proxy agents may propose one or more adjournments"
"22534","to permit further solicitation of proxies.  Any such adjournment"
"22535","will require the affirmative vote of one third of those shares"
"22536","present at the Special Meeting or represented by proxy."
"22537","The persons designated as proxies may use their"
"22538","discretionary authority to vote as instructed by management"
"22539","of the Fund on questions of adjournment and on any other"
"22540","proposals raised at the Meeting to the extent permitted by the"

"22548","Prospectus/Proxy Statement to a shareholder at a shared"

"22597","OLD MUTUAL FUNDS II"
"22598","ON BEHALF OF THE"
"22599","OLD MUTUAL SELECT GROWTH FUND"
"22600","December 23, 2008Dear Shareholder:"
"22601","The Old Mutual Select Growth Fund's Board of Trustees"
"22602"," (the Board) requests your vote on a proposal to reorganize"
"22603"," the Old Mutual Select Growth Fund (the Select Growth Fund)"
"22604","into the Old Mutual Large Cap Growth Fund (formerly known as"
"22605","the Old Mutual Large Cap Growth Concentrated Fund) (the Large
Cap Growth Fund and together with the Select Growth Fund, the"
"22606"," Funds).  If the reorganization is approved by shareholders, you"
"22607"," will receive shares of the Large Cap Growth Fund equivalent in"
"22608","dollar value to your shares in the Select Growth Fund at the time"
"22609"," of the reorganization."
"22610","The Board's recommendation to reorganize the Select Growth Fund"
"22611"," is based primarily on its compatibility with the Large Cap Growth"
"22612","Fund and economies of scale that may be achieved by combining"
"22613","the Funds. Both Funds are advised by Old Mutual Capital, Inc. and"
"22614","sub-advised by Ashfield Capital Partners, LLC and Turner"
"22615","Investment Partners, LLC.  In addition, both Funds seek to provide"
"22616"," investors with long-term capital growth by investing in companies"
"22617","with favorable growth prospects.  Reorganizing the Select Growth"
"22618","Fund will enable you to maintain the limitation that each sub-adviser"
"22619","not invest in more than forty companies, while also enabling you to"
"22620","potentially benefit from increasing your exposure to large"
"22621","capitalization companies with growth characteristics."
"22622","In addition, shareholders may realize additional benefits such"
"22623","as equal or potentially lower expense ratios than the"
"22624","Select Growth Fund's current expense ratios.  Importantly,"
"22625"," the reorganization is designed to be a tax-free reorganization,"
"22626","so you should not realize a tax gain or loss as"
"22627","a direct result of the reorganization.  Additional details about the"
"22628","proposed reorganization are described in the enclosed"
"22629","Proxy Statement."
"22630","This proposal will be presented to shareholders at a special meeting"
"22631","of shareholders to be held on February 27, 2009 in Denver, Colorado."
"22632","This package contains important information about the proposal, a"
"22633","proxy, a business reply envelope permitting you to vote by mail and"
"22634","simple instructions on how to vote by phone or via the Internet.  We"
"22635","encourage you to read the entire Proxy Statement, which describes"
"22636","the proposal in detail."
"22637","THE SELECT GROWTH FUND'S BOARD HAS CAREFULLY"
"22638","CONSIDERED THE PROPOSAL, BELIEVES THE PROPOSAL TO"
"22639","BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF SELECT GROWTH FUND"
"22640","SHAREHOLDERS, AND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT"
"22641"," YOU VOTE FOR THE PROPOSAL."
"22642","You can vote in one of four ways:"
"22643","BY MAIL using the enclosed"
"22644","proxy card;"
"22645","BY INTERNET through the website listed on your"
"22646","proxy card;"
"22647","BY TELEPHONE by calling the number indicated"
"22648","on your proxy card; or"
"22649","IN PERSON at the Special Meeting of"
"22650","Shareholders on February 27, 2009."
"22651","Your vote is extremely important, no matter how many shares you"
"22652","own.  If we do not receive sufficient votes to approve the proposal,"
"22653","we may have to send additional mailings or conduct telephone"
"22654","solicitations.  If you have any questions about the proposal, please"
"22655","call our proxy solicitor, Broadridge at 866-615-7269."
"22656","Thank you for your response and we look forward to preserving"
"22657","your trust as a valued shareholder over the long term."

"22844","INTRODUCTION"
"22845","The Introduction section of this Prospectus/Proxy Statement provides"
"22846","a brief overview of the key features and other matters typically of"
"22847","interest to shareholders considering a proposed reorganization between"
"22848","mutual funds.  These responses are qualified in their entirety by the"
"22849","remainder of this Prospectus/Proxy Statement, which you should read"
"22850","carefully because it contains additional information and details regarding"
"22851","the proposed reorganization.  The description of the Reorganization is"
"22852","qualified by reference to the full text of the Plan of Reorganization, which"
"22853","is attached as Appendix I."
"22854","A. Questions and Answers Regarding the Reorganization"
"22855","Q.	WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED?"
"22856","A.	The Plan of Reorganization provides for the sale of all the"
"22857","assets and liabilities of the Select Growth Fund to the Large Cap Growth"
"22858","Fund and the reclassification of the issued and outstanding Select Growth"
"22859","Fund shares into Large Cap Growth Fund shares.  If shareholders of the"
"22860","Select Growth Fund approve the Plan of Reorganization and other closing"
"22861","conditions are satisfied, all of the assets and liabilities of"
"22862","the Select Growth Fund will become the assets"
"22863","and liabilities of the Large Cap Growth Fund,"
"22864","and the issued and outstanding Class A, Class C, Institutional Class and"
"22865","Class Z shares of the Select Growth Fund will be converted into Class A,"
"22866","Class C, Institutional Class and Class Z shares, respectively, of the Large"
"22867","Cap Growth Fund, with an aggregate net asset value equal to the value of"
"22868","the Select Growth Fund's net assets immediately prior to the Reorganization."
"22869","The value of each Select Growth Fund shareholder's account"
"22870"," in the Large Cap Growth Fund immediately after the Reorganization"
"22871"," will be the same as the value"
"22872","of such shareholder's account with Select Growth Fund immediately"
"22873","prior to the Reorganization."
"22874","Q.	WHY IS THE REORGANIZATION IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF"
"22875","SHAREHOLDERS?"
"22876","A.	The Board of Trustees (the Board) of Old Mutual Funds II,"
"22877"," including each of the independent Trustees, determined that the"
"22878","Reorganization would be in the best interests of both Funds and their"
"22879","shareholders based on the following factors, among others:"
"22880","* The compatibility of the investment objectives and principal investment"
"22881","strategies of the two Funds."
"22882","* The continuity of management given that Old Mutual Capital is the adviser"
"22883","to both Funds and that Ashfield and Turner are sub-advisers to both Funds."
"22884","* The contractual management fee for the Large Cap Growth Fund is 0.05%"
"22885","lower than the contractual management fee for the Select Growth Fund, and"
"22886","therefore Select Growth Fund shareholders may benefit from a lower"
"22887","management fee once the Large Cap Growth Fund expenses are under the"
"22888","contractual expense limitations."
"22889","* Equal or potentially lower total expense ratios for the combined Fund"
"22890","resulting from increased asset levels and corresponding economies of scale."
"22891","* Old Mutual Capital's belief that the combined Fund will have improved"
"22892","marketability based upon its longer-term historical performance record"
"22893","and will be better poised to attract new assets and enable shareholders"
"22894","to benefit from economies of scale."
"22895","* The potential operating efficiencies that may result from combining the"
"22896","Funds."
"22897","* The tax-free nature of the Reorganization for Federal income tax purposes,"
"22898","so shareholders should not realize a tax gain or loss as a direct result of the"
"22899","Reorganization."
"22900","Q.	WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES?"
"22901","A.	The Board recommends that you vote FOR the Reorganization."
"22902","Q.	DO THE FUNDS HAVE THE SAME INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE?"
"22903","A.	The investment objectives of the Select Growth Fund and the Large"
"22904","Cap Growth Fund are the same in that both Funds seek to provide investors"
"22905","with long-term capital growth.  Both Funds seek to achieve their investment"
"22906","objectives by investing in companies with favorable growth prospects.  In"
"22907","addition, both Funds are advised by Old Mutual Capital and sub-advised by"
"22908","Ashfield and Turner, each of which invests the portion of the Funds it manages"
"22909","in not more than 40 securities."
"22910","Q.	WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES IN THE INVESTMENT"
"22911","STRATEGIES AND RISKS OF THE FUNDS?"
"22912","A.	While both Funds invest in companies with favorable growth"
"22913","prospects, the Select Growth Fund seeks to achieve its investment"
"22914","objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings"
"22915","for investment purposes) in companies of any market capitalization"
"22916","(but generally invests in large capitalization companies), while the Large"
"22917","Cap Growth Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing"
"22918","at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes)"
"22919","in large capitalization companies.  While small and mid- capitalization"
"22920","companies may offer greater potential for capital appreciation than larger"
"22921","more established companies, they may also involve greater risk of loss"
"22922","and price fluctuation.  In addition, trading markets for securities of small"
"22923","and mid- capitalization issuers may be less liquid and more volatile than"
"22924","securities of larger companies.  The Large Cap Growth Fund may invest in"
"22925","companies with market capitalizations within the market capitalization range"
"22926","of those companies in the Russell 1000 Growth Index.  As of March 31, 2008,"
"22927","the Russell 1000 Growth Index included companies with market capitalizations"
"22928","between $155 million and $476 billion.  The Select Growth Fund generally"
"22929","invests in companies with an average market capitalization above $12 billion."
"22930","	Also, while the Select Growth Fund is classified as a diversified"
"22931","fund, the Large Cap Growth Fund is classified as a non-diversified fund."
"22932","This means that the Large Cap Growth Fund may own larger positions in a"
"22933","smaller number of securities than funds that are classified as diversified."
"22934","The Large Cap Growth Fund may invest up to 25% of its total assets in"
"22935","securities of any one issuer, which means that an increase or decrease"
"22936","in the value of a single security will likely have a greater impact on the"
"22937","Fund's net asset value (NAV) and total return than a diversified fund."
"22938","The Large Cap Growth Fund's share price may also be more volatile than"
"22939","those funds classified as diversified."
"22940","Q.	HOW DO THE FUNDS COMPARE IN SIZE?"
"22941","A.	As of September 30, 2008, the Select Growth Fund's net assets"
"22942","were $80.1 million and the Large Cap Growth Fund's net assets were $134.5"
"22943","million.  The asset size of each Fund fluctuates on a daily basis and the"
"22944","asset size of the Large Cap Growth Fund after the Reorganization may be"
"22945","larger or smaller than the combined assets of the Funds as of September"
"22946","30, 2008."
"22947","Q.	WILL THE PROPOSED REORGANIZATION RESULT IN HIGHER"
"22948","INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES OR OTHER FUND EXPENSES?"
"22949","A.	The current expense limitations for the Funds are the same and"
"22950","the contractual management fee for the Large Cap Growth Fund is 0.05%"
"22951","lower than the contractual management fee for the Select Growth Fund.  As"
"22952","a result, Select Growth Fund shareholders may benefit from a lower"
"22953","management fee once the Large Cap Growth Fund expenses are under the"
"22954","contractual expense limitations.  Although the contractual sub-advisory fee"
"22955","for the Large Cap Growth Fund is 0.05% higher than the contractual"
"22956","sub-advisory fee for the Select Growth Fund, the contractual sub-advisory fee"
"22957","for the Large Cap Growth Fund will be reduced by 0.025% upon consummation"
"22958","of the Reorganization, which is anticipated to occur"
"22959","the close of business on or about March 6, 2009 (the"
"22960","Closing Date).  Because the sub-advisory fee is"
"22961","paid by Old Mutual Capital from its management fee proceeds, the higher"
"22962","sub-advisory fee will not immediately result in higher fund expenses.  In"
"22963","addition, the projected gross total expense ratios of the Large Cap Growth"
"22964","Fund following the completion of the Reorganization are expected to be lower"
"22965","than the current expense ratios of the Select Growth Fund for all share classes"
"22966","except Institutional Class shares, and contractual expense limitations will"
"22967","remain in place through at least December 31, 2009."
"22968","Q.	WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PROPOSED"
"22969","REORGANIZATION?"
"22970","A.	Legal counsel to the Select Growth Fund and the Large Cap"
"22971","Growth Fund will issue an opinion to Old Mutual Funds II that the"
"22972","Reorganization will constitute a tax-free reorganization for Federal"
"22973","income tax purposes.  Thus, shareholders are not expected to be"
"22974","subject to Federal income taxes as a direct result of the Reorganization."
"22975","Q.	WILL THE SHAREHOLDER SERVICES PROVIDED BY OLD"
"22976","MUTUAL CAPITAL CHANGE?"
"22977","A.	No.  Old Mutual Capital manages the Select Growth Fund and"
"22978","the Large Cap Growth Fund.  The custodian, transfer agent and distributor"
"22979","are also the same for both Funds.  Purchase, exchange and redemption"
"22980","privileges are also the same for both Funds.  Please consult your financial"
"22981","intermediary for information on any services provided by them to the Funds."
"22982","Q.	CAN I CONTINUE TO ADD TO MY SELECT GROWTH FUND ACCOUNT?"
"22983","A.	Yes.  Select Growth Fund shareholders may continue to make"
"22984","investments in the Select Growth Fund before the closing date"
"22985"," of the Reorganization."
"22986","Q.	WHAT HAPPENS IF THE REORGANIZATION IS NOT APPROVED?"
"22987","A.	Any shares you held in the Select Growth Fund would remain Select"
"22988","Growth Fund shares.  The Select Growth Fund and the Large Cap Growth Fund"
"22989","would each continue to operate separately and the Board would"
"22990","determine what further action, if any, to take."
"22991","Q.	WILL EITHER FUND PAY FOR THE PROXY SOLICITATION, LEGAL"
"22992","AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSED REORGANIZATION?"
"22993","A.	The Funds will pay all costs and expenses associated with the"
"22994","Reorganization, subject to current expense limitations.  Costs associated"
"22995","with the Reorganization generally include printing and mailing"
"22996","costs, solicitation costs, legal costs, costs paid to"
"22997","the Funds' independent registered public accounting"
"22998","firm, and other miscellaneous costs.  All costs and expenses"
"22999","associated with the Reorganization will be allocated between the Funds on a"
"23000","pro rata basis based on each Fund's relative net assets.  The anticipated costs"
"23001","of the reorganization are approximately $85,862."
"23002","Q.	IF APPROVED, WHEN WILL THE PROPOSED REORGANIZATION"
"23003","TAKE PLACE?"
"23004","A.	If approved, the Reorganization will be effective the close of"
"23005","business on or about March 6, 2009, or as soon as reasonably practicable"
"23006","after shareholder approval is obtained.  Shortly after completion of the"
"23007","Reorganization, shareholders will receive a confirmation statement reflecting"
"23008","their new Large Cap Growth Fund account number and number of shares owned."
"23009","Q.	WHAT IF I WANT TO EXCHANGE MY SHARES FOR ANOTHER OLD"
"23010","MUTUAL FUND PRIOR TO THE REORGANIZATION?"
"23011","A.	You may exchange your shares into other mutual funds advised"
"23012","by Old Mutual Capital (each an Old Mutual Fund) before the Closing Date"
"23013","by calling 888-772-2888 or contacting your financial intermediary.  If you"
"23014","choose to exchange your Select Growth Fund shares for another Old Mutual"
"23015","Fund, your request will be treated as a normal exchange of shares and will be"
"23016","a taxable transaction unless your shares are held in a tax-deferred account,"
"23017","such as an IRA.  If you exchange your shares before the date of the Special"
"23018","Meeting or any adjournments thereof, you will still be asked to cast your vote"
"23019","on the Reorganization."
"23020","Q.	HOW MANY VOTES AM I ENTITLED TO CAST?"
"23021","A.	Shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 10,"
"23022","2008 (the Record Date) are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.  You are"
"23023","entitled to one vote for each dollar (and a proportionate"
"23024","fractional vote for each fractional dollar) of net asset value"
"23025","of shares held in your name as determined"
"23026","as of the Record Date."
"23027","Q.	HOW CAN I VOTE MY SHARES?"
"23028","A.	You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting or any adjournments"
"23029","thereof if you owned shares of the Select Growth"
"23030","Fund as of the close of business on December 10, 2008."
"23031","If you attend the Special Meeting or any adjournments"
"23032","thereof, you may vote your shares in person.  Whether or not you intend to"
"23033"," attend the Special Meeting or any adjournments thereof in person,"
"23034"," you may vote in any"
"23035","of the following ways:"
"23036","(1)	Mail: Vote, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card(s) in the"
"23037","enclosed postage-paid envelope;"
"23038","(2)	Telephone: Have your proxy card(s) available. Vote by telephone by"
"23039","calling the toll-free number on your proxy card(s)"
"23040","which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week."
"23041","Enter the control number on the proxy card(s) (a confirmation"
"23042","of your telephone vote will be mailed to you); or"
"23043","(3)	Internet: Have your proxy card(s) available. Vote on the Internet by"
"23044","accessing the website listed on your proxy card(s). Enter the control number"
"23045","from your proxy card(s). Follow the simple instructions found on the website."
"23046","Q.	IF I VOTE MY PROXY NOW, CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE LATER?"
"23047","A.	If you vote your proxy now, you may revoke it at any time prior to its"
"23048","exercise by executing a superseding proxy or"
"23049","by submitting a notice of revocation to the Secretary of"
"23050","Old Mutual Funds II.  In addition, although mere attendance at"
"23051","the Special Meeting will not revoke a proxy, if you attend the Special Meeting"
"23052","you may withdraw your proxy and vote in person."
"23053","Q.	WHAT IS THE REQUIRED VOTE TO APPROVE THE PROPOSED REO"
"23054","RGANIZATION?"
"23055","A.	At the Special Meeting, a quorum being present, approval of the"
"23056","Reorganization requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding
voting securities of the Select Growth Fund as defined by the Investment"
"23057","Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act).  This means the"
"23058","affirmative vote of the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of the voting securities"
"23059","of Select Growth Fund present or represented by proxy at the Special"
"23060","Meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting"
"23061","securities of Select Growth Fund are present or represented by proxy;"
"23062","or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of Select"
"23063","Growth Fund."
"23064","Q.	WHOM SHOULD I CALL FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION"
"23065","ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS/PROXY STATEMENT?"
"23066","A.	Please call the proxy solicitor, Broadridge, at 866-615-7269"
"23067","to obtain additional information regarding the proposed Reorganization."
"23068","B. Comparison of Investment Objectives and Policies"
"23069","The investment objectives of the Select Growth Fund and the Large"
"23070","Cap Growth Fund are the same in that both Funds seek to provide"
"23071","long-term capital growth.  The Funds seek to achieve their investment"
"23072","objectives by investing in companies with favorable growth prospects."
"23073","In addition, both Funds are advised by Old Mutual Capital and sub-advised"
"23074","by Ashfield and Turner, each of which invests the portion of the Funds it"
"23075","manages in not more than 40 securities."
"23076","Although both Funds invest in companies with favorable growth prospects,"
"23077","the Select Growth Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing"
"23078","at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes)"
"23079","in companies of any market capitalization (but generally invests in large"
"23080","capitalization companies), while the Large Cap Growth Fund seeks to"
"23081","achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net"
"23082","assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in large capitalization"
"23083","companies.  Small and mid- capitalization companies in which the Select"
"23084","Growth Fund may invest may offer greater potential for capital appreciation"
"23085","than larger more established companies, but they may also involve greater"
"23086","risk of loss and price fluctuation.  In addition, trading"
"23087","markets for securities of small and mid- capitalization"
"23088","issuers may be less liquid and more volatile"
"23089","than securities of larger companies.  The Large Cap Growth Fund may invest"
"23090","in companies with market capitalizations within the market capitalization"
"23091","range of those companies in the Russell 1000 Growth Index.  As of March"
"23092","31, 2008, the Russell 1000 Growth Index included companies with market"
"23093","capitalizations between $155 million and $476 billion.  The Select Growth"
"23094","Fund generally invests in companies with an average market capitalization"
"23095","above $12 billion.  The market capitalization of the companies in each Fund's"
"23096","portfolio and the Russell 1000 Growth Index changes over time and the Funds"
"23097","will not automatically sell or stop buying stock of a company it already owns"
"23098","if the company's market capitalization grows or falls out of its target range."
"23099","Also, while the Select Growth Fund is classified as a diversified fund, the"
"23100"," Large Cap Growth Fund is classified as a non-diversified fund.  This"
"23101","means that the Large Cap Growth Fund may own larger positions in a"
"23102","smaller number of securities than funds that are classified as diversified."
"23103","The Large Cap Growth Fund may invest up to 25% of its total assets in"
"23104","securities of any one issuer, which means that an increase or decrease"
"23105","in the value of a single security will likely have a greater impact on the"
"23106","Fund's NAV and total return than a diversified fund.  The Large Cap Growth"
"23107","Fund's share price may also be more volatile than those funds classified"
"23108","as diversified."
"23109","Reorganizing the Select Growth Fund into the Large Cap Growth Fund"
"23110","will enable Select Growth Fund shareholders to increase exposure to"
"23111","large capitalization companies with favorable growth prospects while"
"23112","reducing exposure to small and mid- capitalization companies.  The"
"23113","Select Growth Fund uses the Russell 3000 Growth Index as its benchmark,"
"23114","and the Large Cap Growth Fund uses the Russell 1000 Growth Index as its"
"23115","benchmark."
"23116","The annual portfolio turnover rate for the Select Growth Fund was 173.62%"
"23117","for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008.  The Large Cap Growth Fund's"
"23118","portfolio turnover rate for the same period was 112.65%.  A fund with a"
"23119","higher rate of portfolio turnover will result in higher transaction costs and"
"23120","may result in additional taxes for shareholders as compared to a fund with"
"23121"," less portfolio turnover."
"23122","C. Comparison of Risk Factors"
"23123","Each Fund may invest in various types of securities or use certain"
"23124","investment techniques to achieve its investment objective. The following"
"23125","is a summary of the principal risks associated with such securities"
"23126","and investment techniques. Additional information about these risks"
"23127","is included in the Funds' prospectus. As with any security, an investment"
"23128","in either Fund involves certain risks, including loss of principal. An"
"23129","investment in the Funds is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured"
"23130","by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government"
"23131","agency. The fact that a particular risk is not identified does not indicate"
"23132","that a Fund does not invest its assets in, or is precluded from investing"
"23133","its assets in, securities that give rise to that risk."
"23134","       Similar Risk Factors of the Funds"
"23135","Like all investments in securities, you risk losing money by investing in"
"23136","the Funds.  The main risks of investing in each Fund are as follows:"
"23137","Stock Market Risk.  The value of the stocks and other securities owned by"
"23138","the Funds will fluctuate depending on the performance of the companies that"
"23139","issued them, general market and economic conditions, and investor confidence."
"23140","The market may also fail to recognize a Sub-Adviser's determination of an"
"23141","investment's value or a Sub-Adviser may misgauge that value."
"23142","Investment Style Risk.  Market performance tends to be cyclical, and during"
"23143","various cycles, certain investment styles may fall in and out of favor.  The"
"23144","market may not favor the Funds' growth style of investing, and the Funds'"
"23145","returns may vary considerably from other equity funds using different"
"23146","investment styles."
"23147","Industry and Sector Risk.  Companies that have similar lines of business"
"23148","are grouped together in broad categories called industries.  Certain industries"
"23149","are grouped together in broader categories called sectors.  The Funds may"
"23150","focus their investments in certain industries within certain sectors, which"
"23151","may cause the Funds' performance to be susceptible to the economic,"
"23152","business or other developments that affect those industries."
"23153","       Primary Differences in Risk Factors of the Funds"
"23154","Small and Mid-Cap Company Risk.  The Select Growth Fund may invest"
"23155","in small-cap or mid-cap companies.  While small-cap and mid-cap"
"23156","companies may offer greater potential for capital appreciation than"
"23157","larger more established companies, they may also involve greater"
"23158","risk of loss and price fluctuation.  The trading markets for securities"
"23159","of small-cap and mid-cap issuers may be less liquid and more volatile"
"23160","than securities of larger companies.  This means that the Select Growth"
"23161","Fund could have greater difficulty buying or selling a security of a"
"23162","small-cap or mid-cap issuer at an acceptable price, especially in periods"
"23163","of market volatility."
"23164","Non-Diversified Fund Risk.  The Large Cap Growth Fund is non-diversified,"
"23165","which means that it may own larger positions in a smaller number of securities"
"23166","than funds that are diversified.  The Large Cap Growth Fund may invest up to"
"23167","25% of its total assets in the securities of one issuer.  This means that an"
"23168","increase or decrease in the value of a single security"
"23169","likely will have a greater impact on the Large Cap Growth"
"23170","Fund's NAV and total return than a diversified"
"23171","fund.  The Large Cap Growth Fund's share prices may also be more volatile"
"23172","than those of diversified funds."
"23173","More information regarding the risks of investing in the Funds is included in"
"23174","the Old Mutual Funds II prospectus."
"23175","D. Comparison of Pricing, Purchase and Redemption Policies, Sales Charges,"
"23176","and Distribution"
"23177","Shares of the Select Growth Fund and the Large Cap Growth Fund"
"23178","are distributed by Old Mutual Investment Partners"
"23179","(OMIP or the Distributor), a wholly-owned subsidiary of"
"23180","Old Mutual Capital.  The Distributor receives"
"23181","no compensation for serving in such capacity, except as provided in separate"
"23182","distribution plans, adopted pursuant to Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act for"
"23183","each Fund's Class A and Class C shares, and service plans which enable"
"23184","the Funds to directly and indirectly bear certain expenses relating to the"
"23185","distribution and sale of shares and services provided to shareholders."
"23186"," Pursuant to 12b-1 plans, both the Select Growth Fund and the Large"
"23187","Cap Growth Fund pay OMIP a service fee at an annual rate of"
"23188"," 0.25% of the average daily net assets attributable to"
"23189","Class A shares and a distribution fee and service fee at an annual combined"
"23190","rate of 1.00% of the average daily net assets attributable to Class C shares."
"23191","Because these fees are paid out of the assets of Class A and Class C on"
"23192","an ongoing basis, over time these fees will increase the cost of your"
"23193","investment and may cost you more than paying other types of sales"
"23194","charges.  For more information on distribution and service fees, refer"
"23195","to the Old Mutual Funds II prospectus."
"23196","The Funds have the same procedures for calculating share price and"
"23197","valuing portfolio securities, and the same policies regarding excessive"
"23198","or short term trading.  These policies and procedures are described in"
"23199","the following sections."
"23200","       Share Price"
"23201","The price you pay for a share of a Fund and the price you receive upon"
"23202","selling or redeeming a share of a Fund is called the net asset value"
"23203","(NAV).  NAV per share class of a Fund is calculated by dividing the"
"23204","total net assets of each class of a Fund by the total number of the"
"23205","classes' shares outstanding of that Fund.  NAV is determined as of"
"23206","the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the"
"23207"," NYSE) (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on each day that the"
"23208","NYSE is open. NAV is not calculated, and you may not conduct Fund"
"23209","transactions, on days the NYSE is closed (generally weekends and"
"23210","New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good"
"23211","Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving"
"23212","Day, and Christmas Day)."
"23213","Your purchase, exchange, or redemption of a Fund's shares will be"
"23214","priced at the next NAV calculated after your request is received in"
"23215","good order by the Fund's transfer agent or other Fund agents.  Shares"
"23216","begin to earn dividends on the first business day following the day of"
"23217","purchase.  Shares earn dividends until the day of redemption.  The NAV"
"23218","of your shares when redeemed may be more or less than the price you"
"23219","originally paid, depending primarily upon the Fund's investment performance."
"23220","If a Fund invests in another investment company, that Fund's NAV is based in"
"23221","part on the NAV of the other investment companies in which the Fund invests."
"23222"," The prospectuses for these other investment companies explain the"
"23223","circumstances under which they may use fair value pricing and its effects."
"23224","The Trust may enter into agreements with broker-dealers, financial"
"23225","institutions, retirement plan accounts, trading platforms, certain"
"23226","fee-based programs, or other service providers (financial intermediaries)"
"23227","that may include the Funds as an investment alternative in the programs"
"23228","they offer or administer.  If you buy shares through a financial"
"23229","intermediary, generally your order must be received by the financial"
"23230","intermediary and transmitted to OMIP or its designee by the close"
"23231","of regular trading on the NYSE in order for you to receive that day's"
"23232","offering price.  Otherwise, the order will receive the offering price that"
"23233","is determined on the next day the NYSE is open.  The Trust and financial"
"23234","intermediaries reserve the right to reject customer orders that are"
"23235","incomplete or otherwise not in good order.  Financial intermediaries"
"23236","may also accept certain customer orders conditioned on the"
"23237","understanding that the orders may later be rejected in the event they"
"23238","cannot be transmitted to OMIP or its designee in a timely manner."
"23239","The Trust will be deemed to have received a purchase or redemption"
"23240","order from authorized financial intermediaries (authorized financial
intermediaries) when the financial intermediary, or its authorized"
"23241","designee, accepts the order. The customer order will be priced at the"
"23242","Fund's NAV next computed after such order is unconditionally accepted"
"23243","by an authorized financial intermediary or its authorized designee."
"23244","       Valuing Portfolio Securities"
"23245","The Funds use pricing services to determine the market value of the"
"23246","securities in their portfolios.  Except as discussed below, the Funds"
"23247","generally use the market price of securities as of the close of regular"
"23248","trading on the NYSE to value equity securities held in the Funds'"
"23249","portfolios, except that securities traded primarily on the NASDAQ"
"23250","Stock Market (NASDAQ) are normally valued by the Fund at the"
"23251","NASDAQ Official Closing Price provided by NASDAQ each business day."
"23252","Short-term investments in the Funds are priced at amortized cost,"
"23253","which approximates market value.  The market value of bonds is"
"23254","determined based on an evaluated price.  If a Fund holds securities"
"23255","quoted in foreign currencies, it translates that price into U.S. dollars"
"23256","at current exchange rates.  Because foreign markets may be open at"
"23257","different times than the NYSE, the price of a Fund's shares may change"
"23258","on days when its shares are not available for purchase or sale.  If a market"
"23259","quotation is not readily available or is believed to be"
"23260","unreliable, the security is valued at fair value pursuant"
"23261","to procedures approved by the Board."
"23262","       Fair Value Pricing"
"23263","The Funds have fair value pricing procedures in place, and a Valuation"
"23264","Committee meets as necessary to value securities in appropriate circumstances"
"23265","that may include, but are not limited to, when a market price is believed to be"
"23266","unreliable, is unavailable, or if Fund assets have been affected by events"
"23267","occurring after the close of trading of a securities market, but before a"
"23268","Fund calculates its NAV.  By fair valuing a security whose price may"
"23269","have been affected by events occurring after the close of trading in its"
"23270","respective market, a Fund attempts to establish a price that it might"
"23271","reasonably expect to receive upon its current sale of that security."
"23272","These methods are designed to help ensure that the prices at which"
"23273","Fund shares are purchased and redeemed are fair, and do not result"
"23274","in dilution of shareholder interest or other harm to shareholders.  In"
"23275","addition, fair value pricing is a helpful tool in preventing excessive"
"23276","short-term trading activity because it may make it more difficult for"
"23277","potentially disruptive shareholders to determine if pricing inefficiencies"
"23278","exist in a Fund's securities.  The valuation assigned to fair valued"
"23279","securities for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV may differ from"
"23280","the security's most recent closing market price and from the prices"
"23281","used by other mutual funds to calculate their NAVs.  Although intended"
"23282","to do so, the fair value procedures may not always better represent the"
"23283","price at which the Fund could sell the fair valued security and may not"
"23284","always result in a more accurate NAV."
"23285","       Policy Regarding Excessive or Short-Term Trading"
"23286","While the Funds provide shareholders with daily liquidity, they are"
"23287","intended to be long-term investment vehicles and are not designed"
"23288","for investors that engage in short-term trading activity, market-timing,"
"23289","or other abusive trading practices.  Short-term trading, market-timing,"
"23290","or other abusive trading practices may disrupt portfolio management"
"23291","strategies, may drive Fund expenses higher, and may harm Fund"
"23292","performance.  In particular, frequent trading of Fund shares may:"
"23293","* cause a Fund to keep more assets in cash or cash equivalents than"
"23294","it otherwise would, causing the Fund to miss out on investment"
"23295","opportunities;"
"23296","* force a Fund to sell some of its investments sooner than it"
"23297","otherwise would in order to honor redemptions;"
"23298","* increase brokerage commissions and other portfolio transaction"
"23299","expenses if securities are constantly being bought and sold by a"
"23300","Fund as assets move in or out; or"
"23301","* dilute the value of Fund shares held by long-term shareholders."
"23302","The Trust, Old Mutual Capital, and their agents, will not knowingly"
"23303","permit investors to excessively trade the Funds, although no"
"23304","guarantees can be made that all such trading will be identified"
"23305","and restricted.  Purchase and sale orders may be received through"
"23306","financial intermediaries.  The Trust, Old Mutual Capital, and their"
"23307","agents cannot always know or reasonably detect short-term trading"
"23308","through financial intermediaries, or through the use of omnibus"
"23309","accounts by financial intermediaries."
"23310","To minimize harm to the Funds and their shareholders, the Trust,"
"23311","Old Mutual Capital, and their agents reserve the right to reject any"
"23312","purchase order, including exchange purchases, for any reason"
"23313","without prior notice."
"23314","The Board has adopted, and Old Mutual Capital and its affiliates"
"23315","(collectively, for purposes of this section Policy Regarding Excessive"
"23316","or Short-Term Trading, Old Mutual Capital) and their agents have"
"23317","implemented the following tools designed to discourage excessive"
"23318","short-term trading in the Funds:"
"23319","* trade activity monitoring;"
"23320","* trading guidelines for certain retail mutual funds advised by Old"
"23321","Mutual Capital;"
"23322","* a redemption/exchange fee on short-term trades in certain retail"
"23323","mutual funds advised by Old Mutual Capital; and"
"23324","* selective use of fair value pricing."
"23325","These tools are described in more detail below except fair value"
"23326","pricing, which is described above.  Although these tools are"
"23327","designed to discourage short-term trading, none of these tools"
"23328","alone nor all of them taken together eliminate the possibility that"
"23329","short-term trading activity in the Funds will occur.  Moreover, each"
"23330","of these tools other than the redemption/exchange fee involves"
"23331","judgments that are inherently subjective.  Old Mutual Capital and"
"23332","its agents seek to make these judgments to the best of their abilities"
"23333","in a manner that they believe is consistent with long-term shareholder"
"23334","interests.  For purposes of applying these tools, Old Mutual Capital"
"23335","and its agents may consider an investor's trading history in the"
"23336","retail mutual funds advised by Old Mutual Capital (together referred"
"23337","to as the Old Mutual Funds), other funds, and accounts under"
"23338","common ownership, influence or control.  Old Mutual Capital and the"
"23339","Funds may modify these procedures in response to changing"
"23340","regulatory requirements or to enhance the effectiveness of the"
"23341","procedures."
"23342","       Trade Activity Monitoring"
"23343","The Trust or its agent has entered into a shareholder information"
"23344","agreement with each of its Financial Intermediaries, as such term"
"23345","is defined by Rule 22c-2 under the Investment Company Act of 1940,"
"23346","as amended, pursuant to which such Financial Intermediaries are"
"23347","obligated to provide individual shareholder transaction information"
"23348","to the Trust or its agents for the purpose of monitoring individual"
"23349","shareholder trading activity.  Old Mutual Capital and its agents"
"23350","monitor selected trades in an effort to detect excessive short-term"
"23351","trading activities.  If, as a result of this monitoring, Old Mutual"
"23352","Capital or one of its agents determines that a shareholder has"
"23353","engaged in excessive short-term trading, it will (i) advise the"
"23354","shareholder or use its best efforts to work with the Financial"
"23355","Intermediary that holds the account to inform the shareholder"
"23356","that he or she must stop such activities, and (ii) use its best"
"23357","efforts to refuse to process purchases or exchanges in the"
"23358","shareholder's account other than exchanges into an affiliated"
"23359","money market fund (if available).  Determining whether a"
"23360","shareholder has engaged in excessive short-term trading"
"23361","involves judgments that are inherently subjective.  In making"
"23362","such judgments, Old Mutual Capital and its agents seek to act"
"23363","in a manner that they believe is consistent with the best"
"23364","interests of Old Mutual Fund shareholders."
"23365","The ability of Old Mutual Capital and its agents to monitor"
"23366","trades that are placed by the underlying shareholders of"
"23367","omnibus accounts that are held by intermediaries other"
"23368","than Financial Intermediaries (Second-Tier Intermediaries)"
"23369","may be limited because Second-Tier Intermediaries may"
"23370","choose not to disclose individual shareholder transaction"
"23371","information, or may not disclose such information in a timely"
"23372","manner upon the Trust's request.  Old Mutual Capital and its"
"23373","agents rely on Financial Intermediaries and the willingness,"
"23374","ability and rights of Second-Tier Intermediaries to monitor"
"23375","trading activity in omnibus accounts and/or enforce the Funds'"
"23376","excessive short-term trading policy.  Old Mutual Capital and its"
"23377","agents will attempt to apply the excessive short-term trading policy"
"23378","uniformly to all accounts."
"23379","       Trading Guidelines"
"23380","If a shareholder exceeds four exchanges out of an Old Mutual Fund"
"23381","(other than the Old Mutual Cash Reserves Fund) per calendar year, or"
"23382","if the Trust, Old Mutual Capital, or one of their agents, determines that"
"23383","a shareholder's short-term trading activity is excessive (regardless"
"23384","of whether or not such shareholder exceeds such guidelines), the"
"23385","Trust will not knowingly accept any additional purchase and"
"23386","exchange"
"23387","orders from such shareholder.  The Trust, Old Mutual Capital,"
"23388","and their agents may accept exchanges that are detected"
"23389","under these guidelines if they believe that such transactions"
"23390","are not short-term trading activity, for legitimate trading"
"23391","purposes and consistent with the best interests of long-term"
"23392","shareholders. Using the proceeds from the redemption of"
"23393","shares of one Old Mutual Fund to purchase shares of one"
"23394","or more other Old Mutual Funds is considered a single"
"23395","exchange.  The Trust may permit exceptions to the four"
"23396","exchange limit for wrap accounts that can demonstrate"
"23397","they are following a bona fide asset allocation program."
"23398","Transactions placed through the same financial intermediary"
"23399","on an omnibus basis may be deemed part of a group for"
"23400","purposes of this policy and may be rejected in whole or"
"23401","in part.  Transactions accepted by a financial intermediary"
"23402","in violation of the short-term trading policy are not deemed"
"23403","accepted by the Fund and may be cancelled or revoked."
"23404","Old Mutual Capital and its agents may also suspend or"
"23405","terminate a shareholder's exchange privileges if a"
"23406","shareholder engages in a disruptive pattern of exchanges."
"23407"," The Trust and Old Mutual Capital also reserve the right to"
"23408","delay delivery of redemption proceeds for up to 7 days or"
"23409","to honor certain redemptions with securities rather than cash."
"23410","       Redemption/Exchange Fee"
"23411","The Funds impose a 2.00% redemption/exchange fee on"
"23412","total redemption proceeds before applicable deferred sales"
"23413","charges of any shareholder redeeming shares, including"
"23414","redemption by exchange, of the Funds within 10 calendar"
"23415","days of their purchase.  The Funds will impose a"
"23416","redemption/exchange fee to the extent that the number of"
"23417","Fund shares redeemed exceeds the number of Fund shares"
"23418","that have been held for more than 10 calendar days.  In"
"23419","determining how long shares of a Fund have been held, Old"
"23420","Mutual Capital assumes that shares held by the investor for"
"23421","the longest period of time will be sold first.  A Fund will retain"
"23422","the redemption/exchange fee for the benefit of the remaining"
"23423","shareholders.  Due to operational requirements, certain financial"
"23424","intermediaries' methods for tracking and calculating the fee may"
"23425","differ in some respects from the Funds' methods for tracking and"
"23426","calculating the fee."
"23427","The Funds charge the redemption/exchange fee to discourage"
"23428","market-timing by those shareholders initiating redemptions or"
"23429","exchanges to take advantage of short-term market movements,"
"23430","to help minimize the impact the redemption or exchange may have"
"23431","on the performance of a Fund, to facilitate Fund management, and to"
"23432","offset certain transaction costs and other expenses a Fund incurs"
"23433","because of the redemption or exchange."
"23434","The Funds will not charge the 2.00% redemption/exchange fee on"
"23435","transactions involving the following:"
"23436","* total or partial redemptions of shares by omnibus accounts"
"23437","maintained by financial intermediaries such as broker-dealers"
"23438","and retirement plans and their service providers that do not have"
"23439","the systematic capability to process the fee;"
"23440","* total or partial redemptions of shares by omnibus accounts"
"23441","maintained by financial intermediaries such as broker-dealers"
"23442","and retirement plans and their service providers that have"
"23443","negotiated pre-existing legal covenants and agreements with"
"23444","the Funds to waive or not to impose the fee;"
"23445","* total or partial redemptions effectuated pursuant to an automatic"
"23446","non-discretionary rebalancing program or a systematic withdrawal"
"23447","plan established with the Funds or a financial intermediary;"
"23448","* redemptions of shares from employer-sponsored retirement"
"23449","plans, such as 401(k) plans, which are made in connection with"
"23450","the withdrawal of an entire plan from a Fund;"
"23451","* certain broker wrap fee and other fee-based programs;"
"23452","* redemptions initiated by a Fund, as permitted in the"
"23453","prospectus; or"
"23454","* redemptions by the Old Mutual Asset Allocation Portfolios"
"23455","(each of which is a fund of funds that primarily invests in"
"23456","shares of Old Mutual Funds) or by other asset allocation or"
"23457","target date funds advised by Old Mutual Capital."
"23458","There is no guarantee that the Trust will be successful in its"
"23459","efforts to enforce its redemption/exchange fee."
"23460","Certain financial intermediaries such as broker/dealers, banks,"
"23461","insurance companies and retirement plan administrators may"
"23462","impose frequent trading restrictions that differ from the Funds'"
"23463","frequent trading restrictions, if such frequent trading restrictions"
"23464","are deemed by Old Mutual Capital or its agents to sufficiently protect"
"23465","Fund shareholders.  Please contact your broker/dealer, bank, insurance"
"23466","company or retirement plan administrator to determine what frequent"
"23467","trading restrictions may apply to your account."
"23468","       Share Classes"
"23469","The Funds offer the same share classes.  These share classes are"
"23470","described below."
"23471","The Trust offers four classes of shares:  Class A, Class C, Class Z"
"23472","and Institutional Class.  Each class represents investments in the"
"23473","same portfolio of securities of a Fund and has the same rights and"
"23474","privileges as the other share classes of that Fund, except that:  (i)"
"23475","each class may be subject to different sales charges (loads); (ii) each"
"23476","class may be subject to different distribution fees, which, if applicable,"
"23477","are paid pursuant to a distribution plan adopted under Rule 12b-1 of the"
"23478","1940 Act; (iii) each class is subject to different service fees, which, if"
"23479","applicable, are paid pursuant to a service plan which may be adopted"
"23480","under Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act; (iv) exchanges are generally not"
"23481","permitted between the various share classes but only among the same"
"23482","class; and (v) each class may have exclusive voting rights with respect"
"23483","to matters affecting only that class.  When choosing a share class, you"
"23484","should consult your financial adviser as to which class is most suitable"
"23485","for you.  Below is a summary of certain features of the share classes."
"23486","You will not pay a sales charge in connection with the acquisition of the"

"23723","purchased at NAV on all purchases of $1 million or more, other than"

"24077","Generally, you will not pay an initial sales charge when you exchange"

"24208","       Distributions and Taxes"
"24209","As a regulated investment company, a Fund generally does"
"24210","not pay Federal income tax on the income and gains it distributes"
"24211","to you.  The Funds pay shareholders dividends from their net"
"24212","investment income and distributions from their net realized"
"24213","capital gains at least once a year, if available.  A Fund may"
"24214","distribute such income dividends and capital gains more"
"24215","frequently, if necessary, in order to reduce or eliminate Federal"
"24216","excise or income taxes on the Fund. The amount of any"
"24217","distribution will vary, and there is no guarantee a Fund will"
"24218","pay either an income dividend or a capital gains distribution."
"24219","Dividends and distributions will be reinvested in your Fund"
"24220","account unless you instruct the Fund otherwise.  There are"
"24221","no fees on reinvestments.  Alternatively, you may elect to"
"24222","receive your dividends and distributions in cash in the form"
"24223","of a check, wire, or ACH."
"24224","       Taxes on Transactions"
"24225","In general, if you are a taxable investor, Fund distributions"
"24226","(other than a return of capital) are taxable to you at either"
"24227","ordinary income or capital gains tax rates.  This is true"
"24228","whether you reinvest your distributions in additional Fund"
"24229","shares or receive them in cash."
"24230","The tax status of your distributions for each calendar year"
"24231","will be detailed in your annual tax statement from the Fund."
"24232","The current qualified dividend income and long-term capital"
"24233","gains tax rates for non-corporate shareholders are provided"
"24234","in the table below."

"24257","addition, investors in taxable accounts should be aware of the"
"24258","following basic tax points:"
"24259","* Distributions of net investment income and net short-term capital"
"24260","gains are taxable to you as ordinary income. If you are an"
"24261","individual or other non-corporate shareholder and meet certain"
"24262","holding period requirements, a portion of income dividends paid"
"24263","by a Fund may be designated as qualified dividend income"
"24264","eligible for taxation at long-term capital gain rates."
"24265","* Distributions of net long-term capital gains are taxable to you"
"24266","as long-term capital gains no matter how long you have owned"
"24267","your shares."
"24268","* Distributions declared to shareholders with a record date in"
"24269","December - if paid to you by the end of January - are taxable"
"24270","for Federal income tax purposes as if received in December."
"24271","* A sale or exchange of Fund shares is a taxable event. This"
"24272","means that you may have a capital gain or loss (provided the"
"24273","shares are held as a capital asset), which will be short-term if"
"24274","you held your shares for 12 months or less and long-term if you"
"24275","held your shares for more than 12 months."
"24276","* Fund distributions and gains from the sale or exchange of your"
"24277","Fund shares generally are subject to state and local taxes."
"24278","* If you invest in a Fund shortly before it makes a capital gain"
"24279","distribution, the distribution will lower the value of the Fund's"
"24280","shares by the amount of the distribution and, in effect, you will"
"24281","receive some of your investment back in the form of a taxable"
"24282","distribution. This is sometimes referred to as buying a dividend"
"24283","because, although the distribution is in effect a return of a portion"
"24284","of the purchase price, it is taxable."
"24285","By law, if you do not provide a Fund with your proper taxpayer"
"24286","identification number and certain required certifications, you may"
"24287","be subject to backup withholding on any distributions of income,"
"24288","capital gains, or proceeds from the sale of your shares.  A Fund also"
"24289","must withhold if the IRS instructs it to do so. When withholding is"
"24290","required, the amount will be 28% of any distributions or proceeds paid."
"24291","Fund shares are generally not sold outside the U.S. Foreign"
"24292","investors should be aware that U.S. withholding, special certification"
"24293","requirements to avoid U.S. backup withholding and claim any"
"24294","treaty benefits, and estate taxes may apply to any investment"
"24295","in the Fund. If you are not a citizen or resident of the U.S., see"
"24296","the statement of additional information for more information."
"24297","This discussion of Distributions and Taxes is not intended or"
"24298","written to be used as tax advice.  Because everyone's tax situation"
"24299","is unique, you should consult your tax professional about Federal,"
"24300","state, local, or foreign tax consequences before making an"

"24935","prior to the Reorganization.  The value of each Select Growth"
"24936","Fund shareholder's account in the Large Cap Growth Fund"
"24937","immediately after the Reorganization will be the same as the"
"24938","value of such shareholder's account with Select Growth Fund"
"24939","immediately prior to the Reorganization."
"24940","The value of the Select Growth Fund's assets to be acquired"
"24941","and the amount of its liabilities to be assumed by the Large"
"24942","Cap Growth Fund and the NAV of a share of the Select Growth"
"24943","Fund will be determined as of the close of regular trading on"
"24944","the NYSE on the Closing Date, after the declaration of any"
"24945","dividends on the Closing Date, and will be determined in"
"24946","accordance with the valuation procedures described in the"
"24947","Trust's and the Funds' currently effective prospectus and"
"24948","statement of additional information. The Closing Date is"
"24949","expected to occur the close of business on or about March"
"24950","6, 2009."
"24951","As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the Select"
"24952","Growth Fund will distribute pro rata to its shareholders of"
"24953","record the shares of the Large Cap Growth Fund it receives"
"24954","in the Reorganization, so that each shareholder of the Select"
"24955","Growth Fund will receive a number of full and fractional shares"
"24956","of the Large Cap Growth Fund equal in value to his or her holdings"
"24957","in the Select Growth Fund, and the Select Growth Fund will be"
"24958","terminated.  Such distribution will be accomplished by opening"
"24959","accounts on the books of the Large Cap Growth Fund in the names"
"24960","of each owner of record of the Select Growth Fund and by"
"24961","crediting thereto the respective number of shares of the"
"24962","Large Cap Growth Fund due such owner.  Accordingly,"
"24963","immediately after the Reorganization, each former shareholder"
"24964","of the Select Growth Fund will own shares of the Large Cap"
"24965","Growth Fund that will be equal to the value of that shareholder's"
"24966","shares of the Select Growth Fund as of the Closing Date. Any"
"24967","special options (for example, automatic investment plans on"
"24968","current Select Growth Fund shareholder accounts) will"
"24969","automatically transfer to the new accounts."
"24970","The implementation of the Reorganization is subject to a"
"24971","number of conditions as set forth in the Plan of Reorganization,"
"24972","including approval of the shareholders of the Select Growth"
"24973","Fund. The Plan of Reorganization also requires receipt of a"
"24974","tax opinion indicating that, for federal income tax purposes,"
"24975","the Reorganization qualifies as a tax-free reorganization."
"24976","The Plan of Reorganization may be terminated and the"
"24977","Reorganization abandoned at any time prior to the Closing"
"24978","Date by the Board if it is determined that the Reorganization"
"24979","would disadvantage either of the Funds. Please review the"
"24980","Plan of Reorganization carefully. A copy of the Plan of"
"24981","Reorganization is attached as Appendix I to this Prospectus/Proxy"
"24982","Statement."
"24983","B. Reasons for the Reorganization"
"24984","The Board of Old Mutual Funds II, including each of the"
"24985","independent Trustees, determined that the reorganization of"
"24986","the Select Growth Fund into the Large Cap Growth Fund would"
"24987","be in the best interests of both Funds and their shareholders"
"24988","and that the interests of the shareholders of each Fund would"
"24989","not be diluted as a result of the Reorganization."
"24990","In evaluating the proposed Reorganization, the Board"
"24991","considered a number of factors, including:"
"24992","* The compatibility of the investment objectives and principal"
"24993","investment strategies of the two Funds."
"24994","* The relative size and investment performance of each Fund."
"24995","* That capital loss carryforwards available to offset future capital"
"24996","gains of the Select Growth Fund would succeed to the Large Cap"
"24997","Growth Fund, assuming the Reorganization qualifies as a"
"24998","reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue"
"24999","Code of 1986, as amended."
"25000","* Whether the interests of either Fund's current shareholders"
"25001","would be diluted in connection with the proposed Reorganization."
"25002","* The potential benefits of the Reorganization to shareholders of"
"25003","each Fund."
"25004","* The continuity of management given that Old Mutual Capital is"
"25005","the adviser to both Funds."
"25006","* The contractual management fee for the Large Cap Growth Fund"
"25007","is 0.05% lower than the contractual management fee for the Select"
"25008","Growth Fund, and therefore Select Growth Fund shareholders will"
"25009","benefit from a lower management fee upon consummation of the"
"25010","Reorganization."
"25011","* Equal or potentially lower total expense ratio for the combined"
"25012","Fund resulting from increased asset levels and corresponding"
"25013","economies of scale."
"25014","* Old Mutual Capital's belief that the combined Fund will have"
"25015","improved marketability based upon its longer-term historical"
"25016","performance record and will be better poised to attract new assets"
"25017","and enable shareholders to benefit from economies of scale."
"25018","* The potential operating efficiencies that may result from"
"25019","combining the Funds."
"25020","* The tax consequences of the Reorganization, including the"
"25021","tax-free nature of the Reorganization for Federal income tax"
"25022","purposes, so shareholders should not realize a tax gain or"
"25023","loss as a direct result of the Reorganization."
"25024","Old Mutual Capital advised the Board that in light of the compatibility"
"25025","of investment objectives and principal investment strategies,"
"25026","continuity of management at the adviser and sub-adviser levels,"
"25027","the Large Cap Growth Fund's lower contractual management fee,"
"25028","and better longer-term historical performance, the Reorganization"
"25029","of Select Growth Fund into the Large Cap Growth Fund would be in"
"25030","the best interests of both Funds and their shareholders and that the"
"25031","interests of the shareholders of each Fund would not be diluted as a"
"25032","result of the Reorganization.  After considering alternatives for the"
"25033","future of the Select Growth Fund, the Board concluded that the"
"25034","Select Growth Fund should be reorganized into the Large Cap Growth"
"25035","Fund."
"25036","C. Federal Income Tax Consequences"
"25037","The following is a general summary of the material Federal income"
"25038","tax consequences of the Reorganization and is based upon the"
"25039","current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"
"25040","amended (the Code), the existing Treasury regulations"
"25041","thereunder, current administrative rulings of the Internal"
"25042","Revenue Service (IRS) and judicial decisions, all of which"
"25043","are subject to change.  The principal Federal income tax"
"25044","consequences that are expected to result from the"
"25045","Reorganization, under currently applicable law, are as follows:"
"25046","* The Reorganization will qualify as a reorganization"
"25047","within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code;"
"25048","* No gain or loss will be recognized by the Select Growth"
"25049","Fund upon the transfer of substantially all of its assets to"
"25050","the Large Cap Growth Fund in exchange solely for shares"
"25051","of the Large Cap Growth Fund;"
"25052","* No gain or loss will be recognized by any shareholder of"
"25053","the Select Growth Fund upon the exchange of shares of the"
"25054","Select Growth Fund solely for shares of the Large Cap Growth"
"25055","Fund (including fractional shares to which they may be entitled);"
"25056","* The tax basis of the shares of the Large Cap Growth Fund"
"25057","to be received by a shareholder of the Select Growth Fund will"
"25058","be the same as the tax basis of the shares of the Select Growth"
"25059","Fund surrendered in exchange therefor;"
"25060","* The holding period of the shares of the Large Cap Growth"
"25061","Fund to be received by a shareholder of the Select Growth"
"25062","Fund (including fractional shares to which they may be"
"25063","entitled) will include the holding period for which such"
"25064","shareholder held the shares of the Select Growth Fund"
"25065","exchanged therefor, provided that such shares of the"
"25066","Select Growth Fund are capital assets in the hands of"
"25067","such shareholder as of the date the Reorganization is"
"25068","consummated;"
"25069","* No gain or loss will be recognized by the Large Cap"
"25070","Growth Fund upon the receipt by it of substantially all"
"25071","of the assets of the Select Growth Fund in exchange"
"25072","solely for shares of the Large Cap Growth Fund;"
"25073","* No gain or loss will be recognized by the Select"
"25074","Growth Fund upon the distribution of shares of the"
"25075","Large Cap Growth Fund to its shareholders in complete"
"25076","liquidation of the Select Growth Fund;"
"25077","* The tax basis of the assets of the Select Growth Fund"
"25078","in the hands of the Large Cap Growth Fund will be the"
"25079","same as the tax basis of such assets in the hands of"
"25080","the Select Growth Fund immediately prior to the Reorganization;"
"25081","* The holding period of the assets of the Select Growth"
"25082","Fund to be received by the Large Cap Growth Fund will"
"25083","include the holding period of such assets in the hands of"
"25084","the Select Growth Fund immediately prior to the Reorganization;"
"25085","and"
"25086","* Pursuant to Sections 381(a) and (b) of the Code and"
"25087","Sections 1.381(a)-1 and 1.381(b)-1 of the Income Tax"
"25088","Regulations, the tax year of the Select Growth Fund"
"25089","will end on the date the Reorganization is consummated"
"25090","and the Large Cap Growth Fund will succeed to and take"
"25091","into account the items of the Select Growth Fund described"
"25092","in Section 381(c) of the Code, subject to the provisions and"
"25093","limitations specified in Sections 381, 382, 383 and 384 of"
"25094","the Code, and the regulations thereunder."
"25095","Old Mutual Funds II has not requested and will not request"
"25096","an advance ruling from the IRS as to the Federal income tax"
"25097","consequences of the Reorganization.  As a condition to closing,"
"25098","the law firm Stradley Ronon Stevens & Young, LLP (Stradley Ronon)"
"25099","shall have rendered a favorable opinion to Old Mutual Funds II as"
"25100","to the foregoing Federal income tax consequences of the"
"25101","Reorganization, which opinion will be conditioned upon the"
"25102","accuracy, as of the date of closing, of certain representations"
"25103","made by Old Mutual Funds II upon which Stradley Ronon will"
"25104","rely in rendering its opinion.  The conclusions reached in"
"25105","Stradley Ronon's opinion could be jeopardized if the"
"25106","representations of Old Mutual Funds II are incorrect in any"
"25107","material respect."
"25108","Capital losses can generally be carried forward to each of"
"25109","the eight (8) taxable years succeeding the loss year to offset"
"25110","future capital gains.  The Reorganization of Select Growth"
"25111"," Fund into the Large Cap Growth Fund will result in a more"
"25112","than 50% change in ownership of the Select Growth Fund,"
"25113","the smaller of the two Funds.  As a result, the capital loss"
"25114","carryovers (together with any current year loss and unrealized"
"25115","depreciation in value of investments, collectively referred to as"
"25116","total capital loss carryovers) of Select Growth Fund will be"
"25117","subject to an annual limitation for federal income tax purposes."
"25118","The tax basis capital loss carryovers, unrealized"
"25119","appreciation/depreciation in value for investments and aggregate"
"25120","net asset value of the Select Growth Fund as compared to the"
"25121","Large Cap Growth Fund and the approximate annual limitation"
"25122","on the use of the Select Growth Fund's total capital loss carryovers"
"25123","following the Reorganization"
"25124","are as follows:"
"25125","Select Growth Fund"
"25126","Large Cap Growth Fund(2)"
"25127","Capital Loss"
"25128","Carryovers at 3/31/08"

"25148","(10.6%)"

"25156","4.94%"
"25157","Annual Limitation (approximate)(1)"
"25158","$4.0 million"
"25159"," N/A(1)"
"25160","The actual limitation will equal the aggregate net asset value of"
"25161","the Select Growth Fund on the closing date multiplied by the long-term"
"25162","tax-exempt rate for ownership changes during the month in which the"
"25163","Reorganization closes; such limitation is increased by the amount of"
"25164","any built-in gain, i.e., unrealized appreciation in value of investments"
"25165","of the Select Growth Fund on the closing date that is recognized in the"
"25166","taxable year."
"25167","(2)  The Large Cap Growth Fund (formerly known as the Old Mutual"
"25168","Large Cap Growth Concentrated Fund) is the survivor of a merger"
"25169","dated April 25, 2008 between the Old Mutual Large Cap Growth Fund"
"25170","and the Old Mutual Large Cap Growth Concentrated Fund.  As a result"
"25171","of the merger, the Large Cap Growth Fund (formerly known as the Old"
"25172","Mutual Large Cap Growth Concentrated Fund) succeeded to certain"
"25173","capital loss carryforwards of the Large Cap Growth Fund which may"
"25174","only be used by the Large Cap Growth Fund (formerly known as the"
"25175","Old Mutual Large Cap Growth Concentrated Fund) to offset built-in"
"25176","gain in the former assets of the Large Cap Growth Fund that is"
"25177","recognized prior to the fifth anniversary of such merger.  The amount"
"25178","of capital loss carryovers described above does not include the"
"25179","amount of carryforwards available to offset the built-in gain in the"
"25180","former assets of the Large Cap Growth Fund."
"25181","Given the amount of this annual limitation relative to the total"
"25182","capital loss carryovers, this limitation likely will cause a portion"
"25183","of the Select Growth Fund's capital loss carryovers to expire"
"25184","unutilized.  However, given the amount of Select Growth Fund's"
"25185","total capital loss carryovers relative to its net realized losses"
"25186","($7.3 million at September 30, 2008 for generally accepted"
"25187","accounting principles purposes), it is also likely that such"
"25188","carryovers would expire unutilized in any event.  However,"
"25189","whether this annual limitation is material will depend upon"
"25190","the facts at the time of closing of the Reorganization."
"25191","The description of the Federal income tax consequences of"
"25192","the Reorganization provided above is made without regard"
"25193","to the particular facts and circumstances of any shareholder"
"25194","of the Select Growth Fund.  Select Growth Fund shareholders"
"25195","are urged to consult their own tax advisers as to the specific"
"25196","consequences to them of the Reorganization, including the"
"25197","applicability and effect of state, local, foreign and other tax laws."
"25198","D. Other Conditions"
"25199","Completion of the Reorganization is subject to various conditions,"
"25200","including the following:"
"25201","* All consents, approvals, permits and authorizations required to"
"25202","be obtained from governmental authorities, including the SEC"
"25203","and state securities commissions, to permit the parties to carry"
"25204","out the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization"
"25205","shall have been received;"
"25206","* The Plan of Reorganization and related Trust matters shall have"
"25207","been approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the"

"25210","the affirmative vote of the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of the"
"25211","voting securities of the Select Growth Fund present or represented"
"25212","by proxy at the Special Meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of"
"25213","the outstanding voting securities of the Select Growth Fund are"
"25214"," present or represented by proxy; or (b) more than 50% of the"
"25215","outstanding voting securities of the Select Growth Fund;"
"25216","* The net assets of the Select Growth Fund to be acquired by"

"25219","market value of the gross assets held by the Select Growth Fund"
"25220","immediately prior to the reclassification;"
"25221","* The dividend or dividends as described in the Plan of"

"25225","transactions contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization will"
"25226","constitute a reorganization within the meanings of Section 368(a)"
"25227","of the Code, and that the shareholders of the Select Growth Fund will"
"25228","recognize no gain or loss to the extent that they receive shares of"
"25229","the Large Cap Growth Fund in exchange for their shares of the"
"25230","Select Growth Fund in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization;"
"25231"," and"
"25232","* Old Mutual Funds II shall have received an opinion of Stradley"
"25233","Ronon addressed to and in form and substance satisfactory to"
"25234","Old Mutual Funds II, to the effect that the Plan of Reorganization"
"25235","has been duly authorized and approved by all requisite action of"
"25236","Old Mutual Funds II and the holders of the shares of the Select"
"25237","Growth Fund."
"25238","E. Shareholders' Rights"
"25239","The Select Growth Fund and the Large Cap Growth Fund are each"
"25240","separate series of shares of beneficial interest of Old Mutual Funds"
"25241","II, a Delaware statutory trust.  Since both Funds are part of the"

"25243","Shareholders are entitled to participate equally in dividends and"

"25245","shares and, upon liquidation, to participate proportionately in a"

"25247","outstanding liabilities allocable to that class.  Fractional shares"
"25248","of the Large Cap Growth Fund have proportionately the same"

"25396","Capital managed approximately $3.5 billion in mutual fund assets"
"25397","as of September 30, 2008."
"25398","Ashfield, a Delaware limited liability company located at 750"
"25399","Battery Street, Suite 600, San Francisco, California 94111, is a"
"25400","Sub-Adviser to the Funds.  Ashfield manages and supervises the"
"25401","investment of the Funds' assets on a discretionary basis, subject to"
"25402","the supervision of Old Mutual Capital.  Ashfield is a majority-owned"
"25403","subsidiary of OMUSH and an affiliate of Old Mutual Capital."
"25404","Ashfield also provides investment management services to"
"25405","high net worth private investors and institutional accounts,"
"25406","including corporate retirement plans, public funds, multi-employer"
"25407","pension plans, endowments and foundations.  Ashfield managed"
"25408","approximately $3.7 billion in assets as of September 30, 2008."
"25409","Turner, a Pennsylvania limited liability company located at 1205"
"25410","Westlakes Drive, Suite 100, Berwyn, Pennsylvania 19312, is also"
"25411","a Sub-Adviser to the Funds.  Turner manages and supervises the"
"25412","investment of the Funds' assets on a discretionary basis, subject"
"25413","to the supervision of Old Mutual Capital.  Turner held discretionary"
"25414","management authority with respect to approximately $22.2 billon"
"25415","in assets as of September 30, 2008."
"25416","Old Mutual Capital was appointed investment adviser to the Funds"
"25417","effective January 1, 2006. As investment adviser, Old Mutual"
"25418","Capital oversees the investment decisions made by Ashfield"
"25419","and Turner (together, the Sub-Advisers), including monitoring the"
"25420","performance, security holdings and portfolio trading.  Old Mutual"
"25421","Capital also oversees the Sub-Advisers' compliance with prospectus"
"25422","limitations and other relevant investment restrictions.  In addition"
"25423","to providing investment advisory services to the Funds, Old Mutual"
"25424","Capital provides certain administrative services for the Funds."
"25425","The Select Growth Fund pays Old Mutual Capital a management fee"
"25426","which is calculated daily and paid monthly at the annual rate of 0.90%"
"25427","of the Fund's average daily net assets and the Large Cap Growth"
"25428","Fund pays Old Mutual Capital a management fee which is calculated"
"25429","daily and paid monthly at the annual rate of 0.85% of the Fund's"
"25430","average daily net assets.  In exchange for providing sub-advisory"
"25431","services to the Select Growth Fund, Ashfield and Turner are entitled"
"25432","to receive a fee from Old Mutual Capital equal to 0.45% of the"
"25433","average daily net assets of the Fund.  In exchange for providing"
"25434","sub-advisory services to the Large Cap Growth Fund, Ashfield and"
"25435","Turner are entitled to receive a fee from Old Mutual Capital equal"
"25436","to 0.50% of the average daily net assets of the Fund.  Upon the"
"25437","Closing Date of the Reorganization, the sub-advisory fee paid by"
"25438","Old Mutual Capital to Ashfield and Turner for providing sub-advisory"
"25439","services to the Large Cap Growth Fund will be reduced to 0.475%."
"25440","Because the sub-advisory fee is paid by Old Mutual Capital from its"
"25441","management fee proceeds, the higher sub-advisory fee will not"
"25442","immediately result in higher fund expenses.  In addition, the"
"25443","projected gross total expense ratios of the Large Cap Growth"
"25444","Fund following the completion of the Reorganization are expected"
"25445","to be lower than the current expense ratios of the Select Growth"
"25446","Fund for all share classes except Institutional Class shares,"
"25447","and contractual expense limitations will remain in place through"
"25448","at least December 31, 2009."

"26525","In June 2004, Pilgrim Baxter & Associates, Ltd. (PBA, now"
"26526","known as Liberty Ridge), the former adviser to the Trust and"
"26527","the current sub-adviser to several of the Trust's series portfolios"
"26528","(the LRC Sub-Advised Funds), reached settlement agreements"
"26529","with respect to the market timing and selective disclosure actions"
"26530","filed by the SEC and New York Attorney General (NYAG). Under"
"26531","the NYAG settlement, if certain terms and undertakings in that"
"26532","settlement as described in the statement of additional"
"26533","information are not met, the NYAG settlement stipulates"
"26534","that Liberty Ridge shall promptly terminate the sub-advisory"
"26535","services it provides to the LRC Sub-Advised Funds.  In this"
"26536","event, the Trust's Board would be required to seek a new"
"26537","sub-adviser for the LRC Sub-Advised Funds or consider"
"26538","other alternatives."
"26539","As part of the In Re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation"
"26540","pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of"
"26541","Maryland (the MDL Court), PBHG Funds (now known as"
"26542","Old Mutual Funds II), PBA, its affiliates, and/or certain related"
"26543","and unrelated parties have been named as defendants in"
"26544","a Class Action Suit (Class Action Suit) and a separate"
"26545","Derivative Suit (Derivative Suit) (together the Civil
Litigation). The Civil Litigation consolidates and"
"26546","coordinates for pre-trial matters a number of individual"
"26547","class action suits and derivative suits based on similar"
"26548","claims, which previously had been filed against the PBHG"
"26549","Funds, PBA and/or certain related parties in other jurisdictions,"
"26550","and had been transferred to the MDL Court. Information on the"
"26551","previously filed suits is contained in the statement of additional"
"26552","information. Consolidated complaints in the Class Action and"
"26553","Derivative Suits were filed in the Civil Litigation on September"
"26554","29, 2004 (MDL 1586)."
"26555","The Civil Litigation and the previously filed suits are primarily"
"26556","based upon allegations that the defendants engaged in or"
"26557","facilitated market timing of the PBHG Funds, and also made"
"26558","selective disclosure of confidential portfolio information to"
"26559","certain defendants and other parties. The Civil Litigation alleges"
"26560","a variety of theories for recovery, including but not limited"
"26561","to: (i) violations of various provisions of the Federal securities"
"26562","laws; (ii) breaches of fiduciary duty; and (iii) false or misleading"
"26563","prospectus disclosure. The Civil Litigation requests"
"26564","compensatory and punitive damages. In addition, the"
"26565","Derivative Suit requests the removal of each of the Trustees,"
"26566","the removal of Liberty Ridge as investment adviser, the"
"26567","removal of PBHG Fund Distributors (now known as Old"
"26568","Mutual Investment Partners) as distributor, rescission of"
"26569","the management and other contracts between PBHG Funds"
"26570","and the defendants, and rescission of the PBHG Funds' 12b-1"
"26571","Plan."
"26572","On August 30, 2005, the State of West Virginia West Virginia"
"26573","Securities Division (the WV Securities Division) entered a"
"26574","cease and desist order (the Order and, together with the"
"26575","Civil Litigation, the Litigation) against PBA. PBHG Funds"
"26576","was not named in the Order. In the Order, the WV Securities"
"26577","Division alleged that PBA permitted short-term trading in"
"26578","excess of the PBHG Funds' disclosed limitation of four"
"26579","exchanges per year and also provided confidential portfolio"
"26580","information to customers of a broker-dealer who used the"
"26581","information to market time the PBHG Funds. The WV Securities"
"26582","Division further alleges in the Order that the foregoing violated"
"26583","the West Virginia Securities Act (W. Va. Code 32-1-101, et seq.)"
"26584","and is seeking that PBA cease and desist from further violation"
"26585","of the West Virginia Securities Act; pay restitution; disgorge"
"26586","fees; pay administrative and investigatory costs and expenses,"
"26587","including counsel fees; pay an administrative assessment;"
"26588","and other relief. It is possible that similar actions based on"
"26589","the same facts and circumstances may be filed in the future"
"26590","by other state agencies. Such other actions will be described"
"26591","in the statement of additional information."
"26592","At this stage of the Litigation it is too early to assess the"
"26593","likely outcome of the Litigation, or success of any defenses"
"26594","each of the defendants may have to the claims. Any potential"
"26595","resolution of the Litigation may include, but not be limited to,"
"26596","judgments or settlements for damages against Liberty Ridge"
"26597","or any other named defendant. While it is currently too early"
"26598","to predict the result of the Litigation, Old Mutual Capital does"
"26599","not believe that the outcome of the Litigation will materially"
"26600","affect its ability to carry out its duty as investment adviser"
"26601","to the LRC Sub-Advised Funds. However, neither Liberty Ridge"
"26602","nor Old Mutual Capital is currently able to gauge the level of"
"26603","shareholder redemptions that may result from the news of the"
"26604","resolution of these pending lawsuits. Redemptions may require"
"26605","the LRC Sub-Advised Funds to sell investments to provide for"
"26606","sufficient liquidity, which could adversely impact the investment"
"26607","performance of the LRC Sub-Advised Funds."

"26912","VOTING INFORMATION"
"26913","The Select Growth Fund expects to solicit proxies principally by"
"26914","mail, but may also solicit proxies by telephone, facsimile, telegraph"
"26915","or personal interview.  Select Growth Fund officers will not receive"
"26916","any additional or special compensation for solicitation activities."
"26917"," The Select Growth Fund also engaged the services of Broadridge"
"26918","to assist in the solicitation of proxies.  In all cases where a"
"26919","telephonic proxy is solicited, the Broadridge representative will"
"26920","ask for each shareholder's full name and address or the zip code"
"26921","or employer identification number and to confirm that the"
"26922","shareholder has received this Prospectus/Proxy Statement and"
"26923","proxy card in the mail.  If the shareholder is a corporation or other"
"26924","entity, the Broadridge representative is required to ask for the"
"26925","person's title and confirmation that the person is authorized to"
"26926","direct the voting of the shares.  If the information solicited agrees"
"26927","with the information provided to Broadridge, then the Broadridge"
"26928","representative may explain the voting process, read the"
"26929","proposals listed on the proxy card, and ask for the shareholder's"
"26930","instructions on each proposal.  Although the Broadridge"
"26931","representative is permitted to answer questions about the"
"26932","process, he or she is not permitted to recommend to the"
"26933","shareholder how to vote, but he or she may read any"
"26934","recommendation set forth in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement."
"26935","The telephone solicitor will record the shareholder's voting"
"26936","instructions on the card.  Within 72 hours, the shareholder"
"26937","will be sent a confirming letter or mailgram to confirm his or"
"26938","her vote and asking the shareholder to call 866-615-7269"
"26939","immediately if his or her instructions are not correctly reflected"
"26940","in the confirmation."
"26941","The Funds will pay all costs and expenses associated with the"
"26942","Reorganization, subject to current expense limitations.  Costs"
"26943","associated with the Reorganization generally include printing and"
"26944","mailing costs, solicitation costs, legal costs, costs paid to the Funds'"
"26945","independent registered public accounting firm, and other"
"26946","miscellaneous costs.  All costs and expenses associated with"
"26947","the Reorganization will be allocated between the Funds on a pro"
"26948","rata basis based on each Fund's relative net assets.  The"
"26949","anticipated costs of the reorganization are approximately $85,862."
"26950","All properly executed and unrevoked proxies received in time"
"26951","for the Special Meeting will be voted in accordance with the"
"26952","instructions they contain.  If no instructions are given, shares"
"26953","represented by proxies will be voted FOR the proposal to"
"26954","approve the Plan of Reorganization and in accordance with"
"26955","the Board's recommendations on other matters.  The presence"
"26956","in person or by proxy of one-third of the outstanding shares of"
"26957","Select Growth Fund entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will"
"26958","constitute a quorum."
"26959","At the Special Meeting, a quorum being present, approval of the"
"26960","Plan of Reorganization requires the affirmative vote of the lesser"
"26961","of: (a) 67% or more of the voting securities of the Select Growth"
"26962","Fund present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting, if"
"26963","the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities"
"26964","of the Select Growth Fund are present or represented by proxy;"
"26965","or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the"
"26966","Select Growth Fund.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will be"
"26967","counted as shares present at the Special Meeting for quorum"
"26968","purposes but will not be considered votes cast at the Special"
"26969","Meeting.  As a result, they have the same effect as a vote"
"26970","against the Plan of Reorganization.  Broker non-votes arise"
"26971","from a proxy returned by a broker holding shares for a customer"
"26972","which indicates that the broker has not been authorized by the"
"26973","customer to vote on a proposal.  If you return a proxy, you may"
"26974","revoke it at any time prior to its exercise by executing a"
"26975","superseding proxy or by submitting a notice of revocation"
"26976","to the Secretary of Old Mutual Funds II.  In addition, although"
"26977","mere attendance at the Special Meeting will not revoke a"
"26978","proxy, if you attend the Special Meeting you may withdraw"
"26979","your proxy and vote in person.  Shareholders may also"
"26980","transact any other business not currently contemplated"
"26981","that may properly come before the Special Meeting in the"
"26982","discretion of the proxies or their substitutes."
"26983","Shareholders of record as of the close of business on"
"26984","December 10, 2008 (the Record Date) are entitled to"
"26985","vote at the Special Meeting.  On the Record Date, there"
"26986","were 20,788.653 Class A shares, 29,074.484 Class C shares,"
"26987","2,389.144 Institutional Class shares and 3,660,312.411 Class"
"26988","Z shares of the Select Growth Fund outstanding.  Each share"
"26989","held entitles a shareholder to one vote for each dollar (and a"
"26990","proportionate fractional vote for each fractional dollar) of net"
"26991","asset value of shares held by the shareholder."
"26992","If a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, or if a quorum"
"26993","is present at the Special Meeting but sufficient votes to approve"
"26994","the Reorganization are not received, or if other matters arise"
"26995","requiring shareholder attention, the persons named as proxy"
"26996","agents may propose one or more adjournments to permit further"
"26997","solicitation of proxies.  Any such adjournment will require the"
"26998","affirmative vote of one third of those shares present at the Special"
"26999","Meeting or represented by proxy.  The persons designated as"
"27000","proxies may use their discretionary authority to vote as instructed"
"27001","by management of the Fund on questions of adjournment and"
"27002","on any other proposals raised at the Meeting to the extent"
"27003","permitted by the SEC's proxy rules, including proposals for"
"27004","which timely notice was not received, as set forth in the SEC's"
"27005","proxy rules."
"27006","Only one Prospectus/Proxy Statement, along with one proxy"
"27007","card, is being delivered to multiple shareholders who share"
"27008","an address unless the Trust has received contrary instructions"
"27009","from one or more of the shareholders.  The Trust will deliver,"
"27010","promptly upon oral or written request, a separate copy of this"
"27011","Prospectus/Proxy Statement to a shareholder at a shared"
"27012","address to which a single copy of this Prospectus/Proxy"
"27013","Statement was delivered."
"27014","Shareholders may notify the Trust that they wish to receive"
"27015","a separate copy of this Prospectus/Proxy Statement, or wish"
"27016","to receive separate prospectuses and proxy statements in"
"27017","the future, by calling 888-772-2888 or write to Old Mutual"
"27018","Funds II at P.O. Box 219534, Kansas City, Missouri  64121-9534."
"27019","Multiple shareholders sharing an address can request to"
"27020","receive a single copy of proxy statements in the future if"
"27021","they are currently receiving multiples copies of proxy"
"27022","statements by calling or writing to the Trust as indicated"
"27023","above."
"27024","OTHER BUSINESS"
"27025","The Board does not intend to present any other business"
"27026","at the Special Meeting.  Other matters will be considered"
"27027","if notice is given within a reasonable amount of time prior"
"27028","to the Special Meeting.  If any other matter may properly"
"27029","come before the Special Meeting, or any adjournment"
"27030","thereof, the persons named in the accompanying proxy"
"27031","card intend to vote, act, or consent thereunder in accordance"
"27032","with their best judgment at that time with respect to such matters."
"27033","The Trustees recommend approval of the Proposal.  Any"
"27034","unmarked proxies without instructions to the contrary will"
"27035","be voted in favor of approval of the Proposal."

"27082","March 31, 2009, in accordance with"
"27083","the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"27084","Oversight Board (United States), we"
"27085","considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"27086","reporting, including controls over"
"27087","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"27088","auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"27089","expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"27090","and to comply with the requirements of"
"27091","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"27092","an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"27093","Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"27094","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"27095","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"27096","financial reporting. The management of the Funds is"
"27097","responsible for establishing and maintaining effective"
"27098","internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"27099","responsibility, estimates and"
"27100","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"27101","expected benefits and related costs of"
"27102","controls. A company's internal control over financial"
"27103","reporting is a process designed to"
"27104","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability"
"27105","of financial reporting and the"
"27106","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"27107","in accordance with generally"
"27108","accepted accounting principles. A company's internal"
"27109","control over financial reporting includes"
"27110","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"27111","maintenance of records that, in"
"27112","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"27113","transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"27114","of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"27115","that transactions are recorded as"
"27116","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"27117","in accordance with generally"
"27118","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"27119","expenditures of the company are being"
"27120","made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"27121","management and trustees of the company;"
"27122","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"27123","prevention or timely detection of"
"27124","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"27125","company's assets that could have a material"
"27126","effect on the financial statements."
"27127","f)R1CfWATERHOUsFWPER5"
"27128","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"27129","financial reporting may not prevent or"
"27130","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"27131","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"27132","are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"27133","inadequate because of changes in"
"27134","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"27135","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"27136","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"27137","exists when the design or operation of"
"27138","a control does not allow management or employees,"
"27139","in the normal course of performing their"
"27140","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"27141","on a timely basis. A material"
"27142","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"27143","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"27144","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"27145","that a material misstatement of the"
"27146","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not"
"27147","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"27148","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"

"27152","control over financial reporting that might be material"
"27153","weaknesses under standards established by the"
