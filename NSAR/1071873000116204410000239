"497","<P style=margin:0pt; line-height:14pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt>The management of The MP63 Fund, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. Generally, controls that are relevant to an audit pertain to the entity&#146;s objective of preparing financial statements for external purposes that are fairly presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Those controls include the safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition. </P>"

A material weakness is a condition in which the design or operation of one or more of the internal control components does not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that misstatements caused by error or fraud in amounts that would be material in relation to the financial statements being audited may occur and not be detected within a timely period by employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions. However, we noted no matters involving internal control and its operation, including controls for safeguarding securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of .</P>"
