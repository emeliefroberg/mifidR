"476","<DESCRIPTION>POWER INCOME FUND JUNE 2011 IC LETTER"
"477","<TEXT>"
"478","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"479","To the Shareholders of Power Income Fund"
"480","and Board of Trustees of Northern Lights Fund Trust"
"481","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"482","Power Income Fund (the Fund), a series of shares of beneficial"
"483","interest of Northern Lights Fund Trust, as of and for the period"
"484","ended June 30, 2011, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"485","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we"
"486","considered its internal control over financial reporting, including"
"487","control activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"488","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"489","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"490","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"491","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"492","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"493","The management of Northern Lights Fund Trust is responsible for"
"494","establishing and maintaining effective internal control over"
"495","financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"496","and judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"497","benefits and related costs of controls.  A funds internal control"
"498","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"499","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"500","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"501","purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted"
"502","in the United States of America (GAAP).  A funds internal control"
"503","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"504","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"505","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"506","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"507","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"508","preparation of  financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and"
"509","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"510","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"511","fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"512","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"513","of a funds assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"514","statements."
"515","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"516","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"517","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"518","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"519","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"520","procedures may deteriorate."
"521","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"522","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"523","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"524","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"525","A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"526","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"527","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"528","of the Funds annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"529","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"530","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"531","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"532","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"533","in internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"534","standards established by the PCAOB.  However, we noted no"
"535","deficiencies in the Funds internal control over financial"
"536","reporting and its operation, including controls for safeguarding"
"537","securities that we consider to be a material weakness, as defined"
"538","above, as of June 30, 2011."
"539","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"540","management, the shareholders of Power Income Fund, the Board of"
"541","Trustees of Northern Lights Fund Trust and the Securities and"
"542","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be"
"543","used by anyone other than these specified parties."
