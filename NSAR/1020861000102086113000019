"2433","<TEXT>"
"2434","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2435","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of SunAmerica Series, Inc.:"
"2436","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"2437","SunAmerica Series, Inc. (the Fund) as of and for the year ended"
"2438","October 31, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the"
"2439","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"2440","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"2441","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"2442","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"2443","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"2444","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"2445","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"2446","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"2447","reporting."
"2448","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"2449","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"2450","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"2451","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal"
"2452","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"2453","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"2454","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"2455","accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"2456","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2457","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2458","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of each portfolio;"
"2459","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"2460","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"2461","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of each"
"2462","portfolio are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"2463","and directors of each portfolio; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance"
"2464","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"2465","disposition of each portfolio's assets that could have a material effect on"
"2466","the financial statements."
"2467","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2468","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"2469","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls"
"2470","may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"2471","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2472","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"2473","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"2474","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2475","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2476","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"2477","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"2478","the Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"2479","detected on a timely basis."
"2480","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"2481","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"2482","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"2483","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established"
"2484","by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"2485","we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"2486","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"2487","securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"2488","above as of October 31, 2013."

"2556","The Board of Directors of the Registrant amended the principal investment"

"2614","Item 77Q1(b) - SunAmerica Series, Inc."
"2615","   Effective on June 5, 2013, the Prospectus is hereby amended as set forth"
"2616","below."
"2617","     On page 18 of the Prospectus, under the heading PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT
STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES OF THE PORTFOLIO, the third and fourth paragraphs"
"2618","are hereby deleted in their entirety and replaced with the following:"
"2619","     The Portfolio will select up to thirty high dividend yielding common
     stocks, which will be evaluated and adjusted at the discretion of the
     portfolio manager on an annual basis. The first ten stocks selected will
     represent the ten highest yielding stocks within the Dow Jones Industrial
     Average. The next twenty stocks will be selected from the Russell 1000
     Index, although stocks in the financials and utilities sectors will
     generally be excluded from this twenty stock selection process. Certain
     stocks in the Russell 1000 Index may also be excluded as a result of
     liquidity screens applied during the selection process. The selection
     criteria used to select stocks for the twenty stock portion of the
     Portfolio will generally include dividend yield as well as a combination of
     factors that relate to profitability and valuation. Selections for the
     Portfolio may include securities of foreign issuers, but such securities
     may not exceed 20% of the Portfolio at the time of the annual rebalancing.
     While the securities selection process will take place on an annual basis,
     the portfolio manager may, from time to time, substitute certain securities
     for those selected for the Portfolio or reduce the position size of a
     portfolio security in between the annual rebalancings, under certain
     limited circumstances. These circumstances will generally include where a
     security held by the Portfolio no longer meets the dividend yielding
     criteria, when the value of a security becomes a disproportionately large
     percentage of the Portfolio's holdings, or when the size of the Portfolio's
     position in the security has the potential to create market liquidity or
     other issues in connection with the annual rebalancing or efficient
     management of the Portfolio, each in the discretion of the portfolio
     manager.

     The annual consideration of the stocks that meet the selection criteria
     will take place on or about the end of the Focused Dividend Strategy
     Portfolio's fiscal year (October 31). Immediately after the Portfolio buys
     and sells stock in connection with the Portfolio's annual rebalancing, it
     will hold approximately an equal value of each of the thirty stocks. In
     other words, the Focused Dividend Strategy Portfolio will invest about 1/30
     of its assets in each of the stocks that make up its portfolio. Thereafter,
     when an investor purchases shares of the Portfolio, the Adviser will
     generally invest additional funds in the pre-selected stocks based on each
     stock's respective percentage of the Portfolio's assets at the time."
"2620","     In addition, on page 41 of the Prospectus, under the heading MORE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE PORTFOLIOS, in the subsection WHAT OTHER TYPES OF
SECURITIES MAY THE PORTFOLIO NORMALLY INVEST IN AS PART OF EFFICIENT PORTFOLIO
MANAGEMENT AND WHICH MAY PRODUCE SOME INCOME?, the following types of"
"2621","securities are hereby added with respect to the Portfolio:"
"2622","     -    Futures"
"2623","     -    Exchange-traded funds"
"2624","     In addition, on page 41 of the Prospectus, under the heading MORE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE PORTFOLIOS, in the subsection WHAT RISKS MAY AFFECT THE
PORTFOLIO?, the following types non-principal risks are hereby added with"
"2625","respect to the Portfolio:"
"2626","     -    Futures contracts"
"2627","     -    Exchange-traded funds"
"2628","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
"2629","     In addition, on page 44 of the Prospectus, under the heading MORE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE PORTFOLIOS, in the subsection GLOSSARY--INVESTMENT AND
OTHER TERMINOLOGY, the following sentence is hereby added to the term"
"2630","Exchange-traded funds (ETFs):

     The Focused Dividend Strategy Portfolio will generally invest in ETFs in"
"2631","     order to increase its investment exposure pending investment of cash by"
"2632","     allowing the Portfolio's cash assets to perform more like securities, while"
"2633","     maintaining liquidity.

     In addition, on page 45 of the Prospectus, under the heading MORE"
"2634","INFORMATION ABOUT THE PORTFOLIOS, in the subsection GLOSSARY--INVESTMENT AND"
"2635","OTHER TERMINOLOGY, the term Options and futures is hereby deleted in its
entirety and the following is hereby added to this subsection:

     A FUTURES CONTRACT, a type of derivative security, is a standardized"
"2636","     contract, traded on a futures exchange, to buy or sell a certain underlying"
"2637","     instrument at a certain date in the future, at a specified price. An INDEX"
"2638","     FUTURES CONTRACT is a contract to buy or sell units of an index at an"
"2639","     agreed price on a specified future date. Depending on the change in value"
"2640","     of the index between the time when a Portfolio enters into and closes out"
"2641","     an index futures contract, the Portfolio realizes a gain or loss."
"2642","     OPTIONS are contracts involving the right to receive or obligation to"
"2643","     deliver assets or money depending on the performance of one or more"
"2644","     underlying assets or a market or economic index.

     In addition, on page 46 of the Prospectus, under the heading MORE"
"2645","INFORMATION ABOUT THE PORTFOLIOS, in the subsection GLOSSARY--RISK"
"2646","TERMINOLOGY, the following terms are hereby added to this subsection:

     EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS: Most ETFs are investment companies whose shares are"
"2647","     purchased and sold on a securities exchange. An ETF typically represents a"
"2648","     portfolio of securities designed to track a particular market segment or"
"2649","     index. An investment in an ETF generally presents the same primary risks as"
"2650","     an investment in a conventional fund (i.e., one that is not"
"2651","     exchange-traded) that has the same investment objectives, strategies and"
"2652","     policies. In addition, an ETF may fail to accurately track the market"
"2653","     segment or index that underlies its investment objective. The price of an"
"2654","     ETF can fluctuate, and a Portfolio could lose money investing in an ETF."
"2655","     FUTURES CONTRACTS: The price volatility of futures contracts has been"
"2656","     historically greater than that for traditional securities such as stocks"
"2657","     and bonds. The risks associated with a Portfolio's use of futures contracts"
"2658","     include the risk that: (i) changes in the price of a futures contract may"
"2659","     not always track the changes in market value of the underlying instrument"
"2660","     that it is designed to track (e.g., an equity index); (ii) trading"
"2661","     restrictions or limitations may be imposed by an exchange, and government"
"2662","     regulations may restrict trading in futures contracts; (iii) if the"
"2663","     Portfolio has insufficient cash to meet margin requirements, the Portfolio"
"2664","     may need to sell other investments, including at disadvantageous times; and"
"2665","     (iv) although the Portfolio will generally purchase only exchange-traded"
"2666","     futures, due to market conditions there may not always be a liquid"
"2667","     secondary market for a futures contract and, as a result, the Portfolio may"
"2668","     be unable to close out its futures contracts at a time which is"
"2669","     advantageous.

     Capitalized terms used herein but not defined have the meanings assigned to
them in the Prospectus.



   Effective July 2, 2013, the Prospectus is hereby amended as set forth below.

FOCUSED BALANCED STRATEGY PORTFOLIO:

     On page 3 of the Prospectus, under the heading PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT"
"2670","STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES OF THE PORTFOLIO, the second paragraph is hereby
deleted and replaced with the following:

The principal investment technique of the Portfolio is allocation of assets"
"2671","among a combination of SunAmerica funds that invest in equity and fixed income"
"2672","securities. The Portfolio may also invest in the SunAmerica Alternative"
"2673","Strategies Fund, which is categorized as `alternative strategies,' and the"
"2674","SunAmerica Global Trends Fund and the SunAmerica Income Explorer Fund, which are"
"2675","categorized as `global strategies,' in the projected asset allocation ranges"
"2676","below. In addition, the Portfolio may invest in any other affiliated SunAmerica"
"2677","fund, including the SunAmerica Money Market Fund. The Portfolio may also invest"
"2678","in exchange-traded funds (`ETFs'), although the portfolio manager will generally"
"2679","only invest in ETFs to obtain exposure to a particular asset class when there is"
"2680","no SunAmerica fund option available. The SunAmerica funds in which the Portfolio"

"2692","      On page 5 of the Prospectus, under the heading PRINCIPAL RISKS OF
INVESTING IN THE PORTFOLIO, the following is hereby added immediately following"
"2693","the sub-heading ACTIVE TRADING RISK:"
"2694","ETF RISK. Most ETFs are investment companies whose shares are purchased and
sold on a securities exchange. An ETF represents a portfolio of securities
designed to track a particular market segment or



index. An investment in an ETF generally presents the same primary risks as an
investment in a conventional fund (i.e., one that is not exchange-traded) that
has the same investment objectives, strategies and policies. In addition, an ETF
may fail to accurately track the market segment or index that underlies its
investment objective. To the extent that the Portfolio invests in an ETF, the
Portfolio will indirectly bear its proportionate share of the management and
other expenses that are charged by the ETF in addition to the expenses paid by
the Portfolio.

PREFERRED SECURITIES RISK. The Portfolio invests in Underlying SunAmerica Funds
that invest significantly in preferred securities. Preferred securities are
subject to bond market volatility, credit risk and interest rate fluctuation
risk. In addition, preferred securities are subordinated to other securities in
the issuer's capital structure and are subject to the risk that the issuer will
fail to make dividends or other distributions on the preferred securities when
due because other claims on the issuer's assets take priority. Preferred
securities may be less liquid than many other types of securities or may be
subject to the risk of being redeemed prior to their scheduled date.

CLOSED-END FUND RISK. The Portfolio invests in Underlying SunAmerica Funds that
invest significantly in closed-end funds. An Underlying SunAmerica Fund's
investments in closed-end funds generally reflect the risks of the underlying
securities held by the closed-end funds. The Underlying SunAmerica Funds will
indirectly bear their proportionate share of the management and other expenses
that are charged by the closed-end funds in addition to the expenses paid by
such fund. In addition, shares of closed-end funds are subject to a number of
risks which are related directly to their structure. First, shares of closed-end
funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value, which is a risk
separate and distinct from the risk that the Underlying SunAmerica Fund's net
asset value could decrease as a result of its investment activities. Second,
many closed-end funds include leverage in their capital structure as a part of a
strategy designed to enhance the level of income and capital appreciation to
their shareholders. The presence of leverage in the closed-end fund structure
introduces both increased volatility of net asset value, and the potential for
greater variability in the dividends paid by the closed-end funds, as the cost
of borrowings often changes up or down with the general level of interest rates.

FOREIGN EXPOSURE RISK. The Portfolio invests in Underlying SunAmerica Funds
that invest significantly in foreign securities. Investments in foreign
countries are subject to a number of risks. A principal risk is that
fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign
currencies may negatively affect an investment. In addition, there may be
less publicly available information about a foreign company and it may not be
subject to the same uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting
standards as U.S. companies. Foreign governments may not regulate securities
markets and companies to the same degree as the U.S. government. Foreign
investments will also be affected by local, political or economic
developments and governmental actions. Consequently, foreign securities may
be less liquid, more volatile and more difficult to price than U.S.
securities. These risks are heightened when the issuer is in an emerging
market."

Trends Fund and the Income Explorer Fund are currently the only Underlying Funds
in which the Portfolios may invest to gain exposure to the `global strategies'
asset class.

The Global Trends Fund seeks to provide capital appreciation by utilizing an
actively managed rules-based investment process to allocate assets across a
diversified, broad-based spectrum of asset classes, including the global equity
and fixed income markets, currencies and commodities. The Global Trends Fund
generally seeks to implement this strategy by investing in futures contracts and
futures-related instruments, including, but not limited to, U.S. and non-U.S.
equity index futures, U.S. and non-U.S. fixed income futures, currency forwards,
and commodity futures (collectively, `futures instruments') that provide the
Fund with exposure to the various asset classes. The Global Trends Fund may
invest in such futures instruments both directly and indirectly through the
Global Trends Subsidiary (as described below). The Global Trends Fund expects to
invest a significant portion of its assets in repurchase agreements
collateralized by obligations of the U.S government and its agencies, and may
also invest in other high-quality, short-term securities (`money market
instruments'). The [GRAPHIC OMITTED] primary purpose of the repurchase
agreements and other money market instruments held by the Global Trends Fund
will be to serve as collateral for the futures instruments, however, these
instruments may also earn income for the Fund. The Global Trends Fund's return
is expected to be derived principally from changes in the value of the assets
underlying the futures instruments held by the Fund."

LOANS:"
"2821","The Income Explorer Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective primarily by
strategically allocating its assets among a preferred securities strategy,
closed-end fund strategy and global dividend equity strategy.

      PREFERRED SECURITIES STRATEGY (`PREFERRED SLEEVE'). The principal
investment technique of the Preferred Sleeve is to invest in a diversified
portfolio of preferred securities issued by U.S. and foreign companies,
including traditional preferred securities, hybrid preferred securities and
floating rate preferred securities. The Preferred Sleeve may invest in both
investment grade and below investment grade securities.



      CLOSED-END FUND STRATEGY (`CLOSED-END FUND SLEEVE'). The principal
investment technique of the Closed-End Fund Sleeve is to invest in the common
stock of closed-end management investment companies selected by the subadviser
that invest significantly in fixed income securities, although the Closed-End
Fund Sleeve may also invest in closed-end funds that invest in equity and other
income-producing securities. The types of securities held by the closed-end
funds may include, but are not limited to, convertible securities, emerging
market debt securities, government securities, high yield securities, investment
grade securities, mortgage securities, preferred securities, senior loan
securities, municipal securities and common stocks, and the closed- end funds
may seek to obtain exposure to income-producing securities through a variety of
different investment strategies, such as global income strategies, limited
duration strategies, multi-sector strategies and other income-oriented
strategies.

      GLOBAL DIVIDEND EQUITY STRATEGY (`GLOBAL DIVIDEND SLEEVE'). The
principal investment technique of the Global Dividend Sleeve is to employ a
buy and hold strategy with approximately 50 high dividend yielding equity
securities selected annually from the Morgan Stanley Capital International
All Country World Index (`MSCI ACWI Index'). It is expected that the Global
Dividend Sleeve will invest primarily in common stocks, and to a lesser
extent, preferred stocks, and may invest in companies of any size. It is
anticipated that the Global Dividend Sleeve will invest in both U.S. and
foreign (non-U.S.) securities, including securities of emerging markets, and
that the Global Dividend Sleeve will be invested in a number of different
countries."
"2822","On page 11, under the heading INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES, the"
"2823","following is hereby added immediately following the sub-heading titled"
"2824","REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS:"
"2825","INVESTMENT COMPANY SECURITIES. In reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(G) of the 1940
Act, and subject to the Portfolios' investment policies, the Portfolios may
invest an unlimited amount in Underlying SunAmerica Funds and may also invest in
government securities and short-term paper. Pursuant to Rule 12d1-2 under the
1940, the Portfolios may also invest in other types of securities and in
unaffiliated investment companies, including ETFs (the `Unaffiliated Funds' and
together with the Underlying SunAmerica Funds, the `Underlying Funds'). While
the Portfolios are permitted under the 1940 Act to invest in securities other
than the Underlying Funds, the Portfolios presently do not intend to invest in
other securities.

Investments by the Portfolios in Unaffiliated Funds are subject to the limits of
Section 12(d)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act, which permit a Portfolio to invest up to
10% of its assets in shares of other investment companies and up to 5% of its
assets in any one investment company as long as the investment does not
represent more than 3% of the outstanding voting stock of the acquired
investment company, although the Portfolios may invest in excess of these limits
if they comply with Section 12(d)(1)(F) of the 1940 Act. In particular, pursuant
to Section 12(d)(1)(F) of the 1940 Act, a Portfolio will be limited in the
amount it can invest in any one Unaffiliated Fund to 3% of the
total outstanding stock of the Unaffiliated Fund owned by the Portfolio and all
affiliated persons of the Portfolio (the `3% Limitation'). As a result, the
Portfolio may hold a smaller position in the Unaffiliated Fund than if it were
not subject to this restriction. Moreover, to comply with other provisions of
Section 12(d)(1)(F) of the 1940 Act, on any matter upon which the Unaffiliated
Fund stockholders are solicited to vote, the Adviser will vote Unaffiliated Fund
shares in the same general proportion as shares held by other stockholders of
the Unaffiliated Fund.

The Portfolios may also invest in ETFs that have received exemptive relief from
the SEC that permits funds investing in those ETFs, such as the Portfolios, to
invest in the ETFs in excess of the 3% Limitation in compliance with certain
conditions.

Each Portfolio will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any management
and other expenses paid by an Underlying Fund in which it invests."
