"1369","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"1370","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1371","To the Trustees of Eaton Vance Mutual Funds Trust and"
"1372","Shareholders of Parametric Emerging Markets Fund:"
"1373","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"1374","Parametric Emerging Markets Fund (the Fund) (one of the"
"1375","funds constituting Eaton Vance Mutual Funds Trust) as of and for"
"1376","the year ended January 31, 2017, in accordance with the"
"1377","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1378","(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"1379","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1380","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1381","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"1382","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"1383","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1384","Fund's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"1385","express no such opinion."
"1386","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1387","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1388","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1389","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1390","related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over financial"
"1391","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1392","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1393","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1394","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control"
"1395","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"1396","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1397","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1398","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"1399","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1400","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1401","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1402","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"1403","authorizations of management of the fund and trustees of the"
"1404","trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1405","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"1406","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on"
"1407","the financial statements."
"1408","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1409","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"1410","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1411","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"1412","because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1413","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1414","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1415","the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"1416","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1417","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"1418","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1419","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that"
"1420","there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a"
"1421","fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented"
"1422","or detected on a timely basis."
"1423","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1424","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1425","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1426","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1427","standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"1428","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"1429","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"1430","and its operation, including controls for safeguarding securities"
"1431","that we consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as"
"1432","of January 31, 2017."
"1433","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1434","management and the Trustees of Eaton Vance Mutual Funds"
"1435","Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"1436","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"1437","these specified parties."

"1456","Adviser shall be entitled to receive compensation at a certain"
"1457","rate; and"
"1458","       WHEREAS, the Adviser has offered to reduce such"
"1459","advisory fee rate, and the Trust has accepted such fee reduction,"

"1461","       WHEREAS, the Adviser and the Trust wish to"
"1462","memorialize said fee reduction in writing;"
"1463","	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual"
"1464","covenants and agreements contained herein and for other good"
"1465","and valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby"
"1466","acknowledged, the Trust and the Adviser hereby jointly and"
"1467","severally agree as follows:"

"1473","2.	This Agreement may only be terminated or amended"
"1474","upon the mutual written consent of the Trust and the"
"1475","Adviser; provided, however, that (i) no termination of"
"1476","this Agreement shall be effective unless approved by the"
"1477","majority vote of those Trustees of the Trust who are not"
"1478","interested persons of the Adviser or the Trust (the"
"1479","Independent Trustees) and by the vote of a majority of"
"1480","the outstanding voting securities of the Fund; (ii) no"
"1481","amendment of this Agreement shall be effective unless"
"1482","approved by the majority vote of the Independent"
"1483","Trustees; and (iii) no amendment of this Agreement that"
"1484","decreases the fee reductions set forth herein shall be"
"1485","effective unless approved by the vote of a majority of"
"1486","the outstanding voting securities of the Fund."
"1487","3.	For purposes of this Agreement the term vote of a
majority of the outstanding voting securities of the
Fund shall mean the vote, at a meeting of"
"1488","shareholders, of the lesser of (i) 67 per centum or more"
"1489","of the shares of the Fund present or represented by"
"1490","proxy at the meeting if the holders of more than 50 per"
"1491","centum of the outstanding shares of the Fund are"
"1492","present or represented by proxy at the meeting, or (ii)"
"1493","more than 50 per centum of the outstanding shares of"
"1494","the Fund."
"1495","4.	This instrument is executed under seal and shall be"
"1496","governed by Massachusetts law."
"1497","IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been executed as of"

"1541","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"1542","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1543","To the Trustees of Eaton Vance Mutual Funds Trust and"
"1544","Shareholders of Parametric International Equity Fund:"
"1545","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"1546","of Parametric International Equity Fund (the Fund) (one of the"
"1547","funds constituting Eaton Vance Mutual Funds Trust) as of and"
"1548","for the year ended January 31, 2017, in accordance with the"
"1549","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1550","(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"1551","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1552","securities, as  a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"1553","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1554","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1555","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1556","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1557","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1558","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1559","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1560","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1561","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1562","related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over financial"
"1563","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1564","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1565","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1566","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal"
"1567","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1568","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1569","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"1570","and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"1571","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1572","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1573","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1574","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"1575","authorizations of management of the fund and trustees of the"
"1576","trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1577","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"1578","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on"
"1579","the financial statements."
"1580","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1581","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"1582","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"1583","are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"1584","because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1585","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1586","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1587","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1588","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1589","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1590","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1591","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1592","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1593","material misstatement of a fund's annual or interim financial"
"1594","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1595","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1596","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1597","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1598","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1599","standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"1600","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"1601","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"1602","and its operation, including controls for safeguarding securities"
"1603","that we consider to be a material weakness, as defined above,"
"1604","as of January 31, 2017."
"1605","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1606","management and the Trustees of Eaton Vance Mutual Funds"
"1607","Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"1608","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"1609","these specified parties."
