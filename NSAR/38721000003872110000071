"2695","for those shares sold pursuant to the private offering exemption for the"
"2696","purpose of raising initial capital or obtaining any required initial"
"2697","shareholder approvals."
"2698","(b) Acquiring Trust is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares"
"2699","of beneficial interest, without par value, of Acquiring Fund, each"
"2700","outstanding share of which is, and each share of which when issued pursuant"
"2701","to and in accordance with the Plan will be, fully paid, non-assessable, and"
"2702","has or will have full voting rights.  Acquiring Trust currently issues"

"2704","five classes of shares: Class A, Class B, Class C, Class R, and Advisor"
"2705","Class.  No shareholder of Acquiring Trust shall have any preemptive or other"
"2706","right to subscribe for Acquiring Fund Shares."
"2707","(c) The financial statements appearing in Acquiring Fund's Annual Report to"
"2708","Shareholders for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, audited by"
"2709","PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, a copy of which has been delivered to Target"
"2710","Fund, and any interim unaudited financial statements, copies of which may"
"2711","be furnished to Target Fund, fairly present the financial position of"
"2712","Acquiring Fund as of their respective dates and the results of Acquiring"
"2713","Fund's operations for the periods indicated in conformity with Generally"
"2714","Accepted Accounting Principles applied on a consistent basis."
"2715","(d) The books and records of Acquiring Fund accurately summarize the"
"2716","accounting data represented and contain no material omissions with respect"
"2717","to the business and operations of Acquiring Fund."
"2718","(e) Acquiring Trust, on behalf of Acquiring Fund, is not a party to or"
"2719","obligated under any provision of its Agreement and Declaration of Trust,"
"2720","By-laws, any contract or any other commitment or obligation, and is not"
"2721","subject to any order or decree, that would be violated by its execution of"
"2722","or performance under the Plan, and no consent, approval, authorization or"
"2723","order of any court or governmental authority is required for the"
"2724","consummation by Acquiring Fund or Acquiring Trust of the transactions"
"2725","contemplated by the Plan, except for the registration of Acquiring Fund"
"2726","Shares under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or as may otherwise be required"
"2727","under the federal and state securities laws or the rules and regulations"
"2728","thereunder."
"2729","(f) Acquiring Trust has elected to treat Acquiring Fund as a regulated"
"2730","investment company (RIC) for federal income tax purposes under Part I of"
"2731","Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code)."
"2732","Acquiring Fund is a fund as defined in Section 851(g)(2) of the Code, has"
"2733","qualified as a RIC for each taxable year since its inception, and intends to"
"2734","continue to qualify as a RIC as of the Closing Date.  Consummation of the"
"2735","transactions contemplated by the Plan will not cause Acquiring Fund to fail"
"2736","to be qualified as a RIC as of the Closing Date."
"2737","(g) Acquiring Fund is not under jurisdiction of a Court in a Title 11 or"
"2738","similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code."
"2739","(h) Acquiring Fund does not have any unamortized or unpaid organizational"
"2740","fees or expenses."
"2741","(i) Acquiring Fund does not have any known liabilities, costs or expenses"
"2742","of a material amount, contingent or otherwise, other than those incurred"
"2743","in the ordinary course of business as an investment company."
"2744","(j) There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Target Fund"
"2745","and Acquiring Fund that was issued, acquired, or will be settled at a"
"2746","discount."
"2747","(k) Acquiring Fund does not own, directly or indirectly, nor has it owned"
"2748","during the past five (5) years, directly or indirectly, any shares of"
"2749","Target Fund."
"2750","(l) Acquiring Trust has no plan or intention to issue additional shares"
"2751","of Acquiring Fund following the Reorganization except for shares issued"
"2752","in the ordinary course of Acquiring Fund's business as a series of an"
"2753","open-end investment company; nor does Acquiring Trust have any plan or"
"2754","intention to redeem or otherwise reacquire any shares of Acquiring Fund"
"2755","issued pursuant to the Plan, either directly or through any transaction,"
"2756","agreement, or arrangement with any other person, other than in the"
"2757","ordinary course of its business or to the extent necessary to comply with"
"2758","its legal obligation under Section 22(e) of the 1940 Act."
"2759","(m) Acquiring Fund is in the same line of business as Target Fund before"
"2760","the Reorganization and did not enter into such line of business as part of"
"2761","the Reorganization. Acquiring Fund will actively continue Target Fund's"
"2762","business in substantially the same manner that Target Fund conducted that"
"2763","business immediately before the Reorganization and has no plan or intention"
"2764","to change such business. On the Closing Date, Acquiring Fund expects that at"
"2765","least 33 1/3% of Target Fund's portfolio assets will meet the investment"
"2766","objectives, strategies, policies, risks and restrictions of Acquiring Fund."
"2767","Acquiring Fund has no plan or intention to change any of its investment"
"2768","objectives, strategies, policies, risks and restrictions after the"
"2769","Reorganization. Acquiring Fund has no plan or intention to sell or"
"2770","otherwise dispose of any of the former assets of Target Fund, except"
"2771","for dispositions made in the ordinary course of its business or"
"2772","dispositions necessary to maintain its qualification as a RIC, although"
"2773","in the ordinary course of its business, Acquiring Fund will continuously"
"2774","review its investment portfolio (as Target Fund did before the Closing)"
"2775","to determine whether to retain or dispose of particular securities,"
"2776","including those included among the former assets of Target Fund."
"2777","(n) The registration statement on Form N-14 referred to in Section 7(g)"
"2778","hereof (the Registration Statement), and any prospectus or statement of"
"2779","additional information of Acquiring Fund contained or incorporated therein"
"2780","by reference, and any supplement or amendment to the Registration Statement"
"2781","or any such prospectus or statement of additional information, on the"
"2782","effective and clearance dates of the Registration Statement, on the date"
"2783","of the Special Meeting of Target Fund shareholders, and on the Closing"
"2784","Date: (i) shall comply in all material respects with the provisions of"
"2785","the 1933 Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended"
"2786","(the 1934 Act), the 1940 Act, the rules and regulations thereunder,"
"2787","and all applicable state securities laws and the rules and regulations"
"2788","thereunder; and (ii) shall not contain any untrue statement of a material"
"2789","fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or"
"2790","necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances"
"2791","under which the statements were made, not misleading."
"2792","5. Representations and Warranties by Target Fund."
"2793","Target Fund represents and warrants to Acquiring Trust that:"
"2794","(a) Target Fund was originally organized as a California corporation on"
"2795","August 30, 1984, and was reorganized as a Delaware statutory trust"
"2796","effective March 21, 2000.  Target Fund is duly registered under the 1940"

"2801","initial capital or obtaining any required initial shareholder approvals."
"2802","(b) Target Fund is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares of"
"2803","beneficial interest, without par value, each outstanding share of which"
"2804","is fully paid, non-assessable, and has full voting rights.  Target Fund"

"2806","interest of Target Fund have been allocated and designated to each such"

"3165","that such condition or obligation will not or cannot be met."
"3166","(b) If the transactions contemplated by the Plan have not been consummated"
"3167","by December 31, 2009, the Plan shall automatically terminate on that date,"

"3169","(c) In the event of termination of the Plan prior to its consummation,"
"3170","pursuant to the provisions hereof, the Plan shall become void and have"
"3171","no further effect, and neither Target Fund, Acquiring Trust, nor Acquiring"
"3172","Fund, nor their trustees, officers, or agents or the shareholders of Target"

"3176","(d) At any time prior to the Closing, any of the terms or conditions of the"

"3189","on behalf of Acquiring Fund, to be acceptable, such term or condition shall"
"3190","be binding as if it were a part of the Plan without a vote or approval of the"

"3265","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"3266","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"3267","Franklin Custodian Funds, Inc."
"3268","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"3269","Franklin DynaTech Fund, Franklin Growth Fund, Franklin Income Fund,"
"3270","Franklin U.S. Government Securities Fund and Franklin Utilities Fund"
"3271","(constituting portfolios of Franklin Custodian Funds, Inc. (the Funds))"
"3272","as of and for the year ended September 30, 2009, in accordance with"
"3273","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"3274","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"3275","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"3276","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"3277","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"
"3278","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"3279","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"3280","financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"3281","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"3282","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"3283","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"3284","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"3285","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"3286","costs of controls. A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"3287","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"3288","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"3289","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"3290","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"3291","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"3292","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"3293","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"3294","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"3295","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"3296","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"3297","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"3298","of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"3299","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"3300","fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3301","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"3302","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"3303","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"3304","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"3305","that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3306","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"3307","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"3308","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"3309","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"3310","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"3311","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"3312","misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial statements will"
"3313","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3314","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"3315","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3316","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"3317","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"3318","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we"
"3319","noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"3320","and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"3321","consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of September 30, 2009."
"3322","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"3323","the Board of Trustees of Franklin Custodian Funds, Inc. and the Securities and"
"3324","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
