"4170","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"4171","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"4172","for establishing and maintaining effective"

"4174","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"4175","judgments by management are required to"
"4176","assess the expected benefits and related"
"4177","costs of controls.  A fund's internal control"
