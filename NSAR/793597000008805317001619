"1448","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1449","statements of the Deutsche European Equity Fund (the"
"1450","Fund), as of and for the year ended August 31, 2017, in"
"1451","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1452","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1453","considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1454","reporting, including control activities for safeguarding"
"1455","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"1456","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1457","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"1458","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"1459","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"1460","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"1461","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"1462","over financial reporting."
"1463","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"1464","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1465","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1466","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"1467","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"1468","A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1469","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1470","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1471","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1472","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1473","principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"1474","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1475","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1476","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1477","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1478","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1479","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1480","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"1481","and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"1482","made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1483","management and directors of the fund; and (3)  provide"
"1484","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1485","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1486","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1487","financial statements."
"1488","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1489","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1490","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1491","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1492","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1493","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1494","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1495","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1496","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1497","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1498","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1499","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1500","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1501","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1502","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1503","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1504","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1505","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"1506","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"1507","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1508","all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting"
"1509","that might be material weaknesses under standards"

"1617","Deutsche European Equity Fund"
"1618","Effective on May 24, 2017, the Fund's principal"
"1619","investment strategy was amended to the following:"
"1620","Main investments. Under normal circumstances,"
"1621","the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets, plus"
"1622","the amount of any borrowings for investment"
"1623","purposes, in equity securities and other securities"
"1624","with equity characteristics of issuers domiciled in"
"1625","Europe. In addition to common stock, other"
"1626","securities with equity characteristics such as"
"1627","preferred stock, convertible securities and warrants"
"1628","are counted toward satisfaction of this 80%"
"1629","investment policy. An issuer is deemed to be"
"1630","domiciled in Europe if: (1) it is organized under"
"1631","the laws of a European country, or maintains its"
"1632","headquarters or a principal place of business in"
"1633","Europe; (2) it derives 50% or more of its revenues"
"1634","and profits from goods produced or sold,"
"1635","investments made, or services performed in Europe"
"1636","or has 50% or more of its assets in Europe; or (3) its"
"1637","equity securities are traded principally in Europe."
"1638","Company-specific criteria drive security selection"
"1639","and the portfolio management team seeks to"
"1640","identify securities of companies that the portfolio"
"1641","management team believes have a good market"
"1642","position, forward-looking products, expert"
"1643","management,  a corporate strategy that concentrates"
"1644","on core competencies, yield-oriented use of"
"1645","resources and sustainable, above-average growth in"
"1646","profitability. The fund may invest in any country,"
"1647","including emerging markets, or sector. The fund"
"1648","may invest in companies of any market"
"1649","capitalization. The fund expects to maintain a"
"1650","portfolio of 50-70 stocks."
"1651","The fund normally invests primarily in common"
"1652","stocks, but may also invest in preferred stocks,"
"1653","convertible securities, debt securities of any quality,"
"1654","maturity or duration, short-term securities,"
"1655","participation notes, structured notes, futures"
"1656","contracts, stock options, total return swaps, warrants"
"1657","and other securities. The fund may invest up to 20%"
"1658","of its assets in short-term securities and cash"
"1659","equivalents."
"1660","Deutsche Global Growth Fund"
"1661","Effective on or about October 1, 2017, the Fund"
"1662","was renamed Deutsche International Growth Fund,"
"1663","and the Fund's principal investment strategy was"
"1664","amended to the following:"
"1665","Main Investments. The fund invests primarily in"
"1666","foreign equities (equities issued by foreign based"
"1667","companies and listed on foreign exchanges) and"
"1668","may invest in companies of any size and from any"
"1669","country, including countries with emerging"
"1670","economies. The fund's equity investments may also"
"1671","include preferred stocks and other securities with"
"1672","equity characteristics, such as convertible securities"
"1673","and warrants."
"1674","The fund will generally invest less than 20% of its"
"1675","assets in US equities."
