"15737","with its responsibilities under this Section 3, the Manager is responsible for decisions to buy and sell securities and other investments"
"15738","for the Series&#8217; portfolio, broker-dealer selection, and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Manager&#8217;s primary"

"15740","factors specified in the Prospectus and/or Statement of Additional Information for the Trust, which include price (including the"
"15741","applicable brokerage commission or dollar spread), the size of the order, the nature of the market for the security, the timing"

"15743","the difficulty of execution, execution capabilities and operational facilities of the firms involved, and the firm&#8217;s risk"
"15744","in positioning a block of securities. Accordingly, the price to the Series in any transaction may be less favorable than that available"
