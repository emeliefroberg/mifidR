"1497","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"

"1500","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1501","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1502","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"1503","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"

"1516","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1517","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
