"4131","Item 77D - DWS Strategic Government Securities"
"4132","Fund (a series of DWS Income Trust)"
"4133","Effective on or about May 1, 2013, DWS Strategic"
"4134","Government Securities Fund no longer utilizes the"
"4135","Global Tactical Asset Allocation Overlay Strategy."
"4136","Effective on or about November 29, 2013, the Fund"
"4137","added the following to its principal investment strategy:"
"4138","Interest rate strategy. In addition to the fund's main"
"4139","investment strategy, portfolio management may, from"
"4140","time to time, seek to enhance returns by employing a"
"4141","rules-based methodology to identify interest rate trends"
"4142","across developed markets using derivatives, in particular"
"4143","buying and selling interest rate futures contracts. In"
"4144","implementing this strategy, portfolio management may"
"4145","utilize proprietary rules-based interest rate indices."
"4146","For the purpose of complying with the 80% test, the"
"4147","fund does not use the notional value of a derivative"
"4148","instrument, but rather, uses the mark-to-market value"
"4149","(i.e., the unrealized net gain or loss on an open derivative"
"4150","instrument) of the derivative instrument. The mark-to-
market value of a derivative instrument will not be"
"4151","treated as an investment in securities backed by the full"
"4152","faith and credit of the US government. By calculating"
"4153","the 80% test on the basis of mark-to-market value,"
"4154","rather than the notional value, of derivative instruments,"
"4155","the fund may invest a greater percentage of its assets in"
"4156","such derivative instruments than would otherwise be the"
"4157","case."
"4158","Although the fund's aggregate notional market exposure"
"4159","from derivatives employed as part of the interest rate"
"4160","strategy may equal up to 100% of the fund's assets, the"
"4161","fund normally limits the net notional value of all open"
"4162","interest rate strategy related derivatives instruments,"
"4163","after aggregating the fund's long and short positions, to"
"4164","20% of the fund's net assets. In addition, the net mark-
to-market value of all open interest rate strategy related"
"4165","derivatives instruments, plus any required initial margin"
"4166","payments, is normally expected to be less than 5% of the"
"4167","fund's net assets. There can be no assurance, however,"
"4168","that these limits will prevent the fund from incurring"
"4169","losses due to its use of interest rate related derivative"
"4170","instruments."
"4171","Effective on or about November 29, 2013, the Fund"
"4172","replaced existing similar disclosure in its principal"
"4173","investment strategy with the following:"
"4174","Derivatives. Outside of the interest rate strategy,"
"4175","portfolio management generally may use futures"
"4176","contracts or interest rate swaps, which are types of"
"4177","derivatives (a contract whose value is based on, for"
"4178","example, indices, currencies or securities), for duration"
"4179","management (i.e., reducing or increasing the sensitivity"
"4180","of the fund's portfolio to interest rate changes). In"
"4181","addition, portfolio management generally may use (i)"
"4182","options on US government agency mortgage-backed"
"4183","TBAs or total return swaps to seek to enhance potential"
"4184","gains; or (ii) options on interest rate futures to hedge"
"4185","against potential adverse interest rate movements."
"4186","The fund may also use various types of derivatives (i)"
"4187","for hedging purposes; (ii) for risk management; (iii) for"
"4188","non-hedging purposes to seek to enhance potential gains;"
"4189","or (iv) as a substitute for direct investment in a particular"
"4190","asset class or to keep cash on hand to meet shareholder"
"4191","redemptions."
"4192","Item 77D - DWS Unconstrained Income Fund (a"

"4194","Effective on or about May 31, 2013, DWS"

"4550","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"4551","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"4552","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"4553","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"4554","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"4555","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"4556","over financial reporting."
"4557","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"4558","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"4559","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"4560","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"4561","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"4562","A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"4563","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"4564","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"4565","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"4566","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"4567","principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"4568","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"4569","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"4570","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"4571","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"4572","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"4573","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"4574","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"4575","and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"4576","made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"4577","management and directors of the fund; and (3)  provide"
"4578","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"4579","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"4580","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"4581","financial statements."
"4582","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"4583","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"4584","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"4585","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"4586","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"4587","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"4588","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"4589","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"4590","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"4591","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"4592","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"4593","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"4594","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"4595","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"4596","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"4597","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"4598","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"4599","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"4600","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"4601","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"4602","all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting"
"4603","that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"4604","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"4605","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies"
"4606","in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and"
"4607","its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"4608","securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as"
"4609","defined above as of October 31, 2013."
