"5781","      continue to qualify, as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M"
"5782","      of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations issued"
"5783","      thereunder (the Code), except as may be authorized to the contrary by"

"5785","      shall at all times be subject to the review of the Trust's Board of"
"5786","      Trustees."
"5787","(c)   BOOKS AND RECORDS. Pursuant to applicable law, the Adviser shall keep each"
"5788","      Fund's books and records required to be maintained by, or on behalf of,"

"5791","      property of the Fund and it will promptly surrender any of such records to"
"5792","      the Fund upon the Fund's request. The Adviser further agrees to preserve"
"5793","      for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act any such"
"5794","      records of the Fund required to be preserved by such Rule."

"5798","      Trust's Board of Trustees may request from time to time or as the Adviser"
"5799","      may otherwise deem to be desirable. The Adviser shall make recommendations"
"5800","      to the Trust's Board of Trustees with respect to Trust policies, and shall"

"5805","      Board of Trustees, furnish such other services as the Adviser shall from"
"5806","      time to time determine to be necessary or useful to perform its"

"5809","      the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for each Fund with brokers"
"5810","      or dealers selected by the Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers"
"5811","      affiliated with the Adviser to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act and"
"5812","      the Trust's policies and procedures applicable to the Funds. The Adviser"
"5813","      shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at"
"5814","      prices which, under the circumstances, result in total costs or proceeds"
"5815","      being the most favorable to the Funds. In assessing the best overall terms"
"5816","      available for any transaction, the Adviser shall consider all factors it"
"5817","      deems relevant, including the breadth of the market in the security, the"
"5818","      price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of"
"5819","      the broker or dealer, research services provided to the Adviser, and the"
"5820","      reasonableness of the commission, if any, both for the specific"
"5821","      transaction and on a continuing basis. In no event shall the Adviser be"
"5822","      under any duty to obtain the lowest commission or the best net price for"
"5823","      any Fund on any particular transaction, nor shall the Adviser be under any"
"5824","      duty to execute any order in a fashion either preferential to any Fund"

"5826","      adverse to such other accounts."
"5827","(f)   SELECTION OF BROKERS OR DEALERS. In selecting brokers or dealers qualified"
"5828","      to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected"
"5829","      who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are"
"5830","      defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the"
"5831","      Adviser, the Funds and/or the other accounts over which the Adviser"
"5832","      exercises investment discretion. The Adviser is authorized to pay a broker"
"5833","      or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission"
"5834","      for executing a portfolio transaction for a Fund which is in excess of the"
"5835","      amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"5836","      effecting that transaction if the Adviser determines in good faith that"
"5837","      the total commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"5838","      brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed"
"5839","      in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"5840","      responsibilities of the Adviser with respect to accounts over which it"
"5841","      exercises investment discretion. The Adviser shall report to the Board of"
"5842","      Trustees of the Trust regarding overall commissions paid by the Fund and"
"5843","      their reasonableness in relation to their benefits to the Fund. Any"
"5844","      transactions for a Fund that are effected through an affiliated"
"5845","      broker-dealer on a national securities exchange of which such"
"5846","      broker-dealer is a member will be effected in accordance with Section"
"5847","      11(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the"
"5848","      regulations promulgated thereunder, including Rule lla22(T). The Fund"
"5849","      hereby authorizes any such broker or dealer to retain commissions for"
"5850","      effecting such transactions and to pay out of such retained commissions"
"5851","      any compensation due to others in connection with effectuating those"
"5852","      transactions."

"5857","      applicable laws and regulations, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate"
"5858","      the securities to be sold or purchased with those of other Funds or its"
"5859","      other clients if, in the Adviser's reasonable judgment, such aggregation"
"5860","      (i) will result in an overall economic benefit to the Fund, taking into"
"5861","      consideration the advantageous selling or purchase price, brokerage"
"5862","      commission and other expenses, and trading requirements, and (ii) is not"
"5863","      inconsistent with the policies set forth in the Trust's registration"
"5864","      statement and the Fund's Prospectus and Statement of Additional"
"5865","      Information. In such event, the Adviser will allocate the securities so"
"5866","      purchased or sold, and the expenses incurred in the transaction, in an"
"5867","      equitable manner, consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund"
"5868","      and such other clients."
"5869","4.    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES."
"5870","(a)   The Adviser hereby represents and warrants to the Trust as follows:"

"5878","            adviser under the laws of all applicable jurisdictions. The Adviser"
"5879","            shall maintain such registrations or licenses in effect at all times"

"5881","      (iii) The Adviser at all times shall provide its best judgment and effort"
"5882","            to the Trust in carrying out the Adviser's obligations hereunder."
"5883","(b)   The Trust hereby represents and warrants to the Adviser as follows:"
"5884","      (i)   The Trust has been duly organized as a statutory trust under the"
"5885","            laws of the State of Delaware and is authorized to enter into this"

"5903","directly to a Sub-Adviser. The fee for any partial month under this Agreement"
"5904","shall be calculated on a proportionate basis. In the event that the total"
"5905","expenses of a Fund exceed the limits on investment company expenses imposed by"
"5906","any statute or any regulatory authority of any jurisdiction in which shares of"
"5907","such Fund are qualified for offer and sale, the Adviser will bear the amount of"
"5908","such excess, except: (i) the Adviser shall not be required to bear such excess"
"5909","to an extent greater than the compensation due to the Adviser for the period for"
"5910","which such expense limitation is required to be calculated unless such statute"
"5911","or regulatory authority shall so require; and (ii) the Adviser shall not be"
"5912","required to bear the expenses of a Fund to an extent which would result in the"
"5913","Fund's or Trust's inability to qualify as a regulated investment company under"
"5914","the provisions of Subchapter M of the Code."
"5915","      6. INTERESTED PERSONS. It is understood that, to the extent consistent"

"6234","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"6235","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"6236","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"6237","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"6238","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"6239","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"6240","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"6241","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"6242","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"6243","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"6244","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"6245","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"6246","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"6247","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A Funds'"
"6248","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"6249","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"6250","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"6251","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"6252","with generally accepted accounting principles. A Funds'"
"6253","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"6254","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"6255","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"6256","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"6257","the Funds; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"6258","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"6259","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"6260","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Funds are"
"6261","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"6262","and Trustees of the Funds; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"6263","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"6264","acquisition, use or disposition of a Funds' assets that could"
"6265","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"6266","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"6267","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"6268","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"6269","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"6270","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"6271","procedures may deteriorate."
"6272","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"6273","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"6274","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"6275","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"6276","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"6277","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"6278","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds' annual or"
"6279","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on"
"6280","a timely basis."
"6281","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"6282","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"6283","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"6284","in internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"6285","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"6286","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"6287","Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"6288","including controls over securities, that we consider to be a material"
"6289","weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2014."
