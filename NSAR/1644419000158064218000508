"502","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT"
"503","REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"504","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"505","To the Shareholders of Measured"
"506","Risk Strategy Fund and"
"507","Board of Trustees of Northern"
"508","Lights Fund Trust IV"
"509","In planning and performing our"
"510","audit of the financial statements"
"511","of Measured Risk Strategy Fund"
"512","(the Fund), a series of Northern"
"513","Lights Fund Trust IV, as of"
"514","November 30, 2017, and for the"
"515","period December 28, 2016"
"516","(commencement of operations)"
"517","through November 30, 2017, in"
"518","accordance with the standards of"
"519","the Public Company Accounting"
"520","Oversight Board (United States),"
"521","we considered the Fund's"
"522","internal control over financial"
"523","reporting, including controls over"
"524","safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"525","for designing our auditing"
"526","procedures for the purpose of"
"527","expressing our opinion on the"
"528","financial statements and to"
"529","comply with the requirements of"
"530","Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"531","purpose of expressing an opinion"
"532","on the effectiveness of the"
"533","Fund's internal control over"
"534","financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"535","we express no such opinion."
"536","The management of the Fund is"
"537","responsible for establishing and"
"538","maintaining effective internal"
"539","control over financial reporting."
"540","In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"541","estimates and judgments by"
"542","management are required to"
"543","assess the expected benefits and"
"544","related costs of controls.  A"
"545","fund's internal control over"
"546","financial reporting is a process"
"547","designed to provide reasonable"
"548","assurance regarding the"
"549","reliability of financial reporting"
"550","and the preparation of financial"
"551","statements for external purposes"
"552","in accordance with generally"
"553","accepted accounting principles"
"554","(GAAP).  A fund's internal control"
"555","over financial reporting includes"
"556","those policies and procedures"
"557","that (1) pertain to the"
"558","maintenance of records that, in"
"559","reasonable detail, accurately and"
"560","fairly reflect the transactions and"
"561","dispositions of the assets of the"
"562","fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"563","assurance that transactions are"
"564","recorded as necessary to permit"
"565","preparation of financial"
"566","statements in accordance with"
"567","GAAP, and that receipts and"
"568","expenditures of the fund are"
"569","being made only in accordance"
"570","with authorizations of"
"571","management and trustees of the"
"572","fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"573","assurance regarding prevention"
"574","or timely detection of"
"575","unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"576","disposition of a fund's assets that"
"577","could have a material effect on"
"578","the financial statements."
"579","Because of its inherent"
"580","limitations, internal control over"
"581","financial reporting may not"
"582","prevent or detect misstatements."
"583","Also, projections of any"
"584","evaluation of effectiveness to"
"585","future periods are subject to the"
"586","risk that controls may become"
"587","inadequate because of changes"
"588","in conditions, or that the degree"
"589","of compliance with the policies"
"590","or procedures may deteriorate."
"591","A deficiency in internal control"
"592","over financial reporting exists"
"593","when the design or operation of"
"594","a control does not allow"
"595","management or employees, in"
"596","the normal course of performing"
"597","their assigned functions, to"
"598","prevent or detect misstatements"
"599","on a timely basis.  A material"
"600","weakness is a deficiency, or"
"601","combination of deficiencies, in"
"602","internal control over financial"
"603","reporting, such that there is a"
"604","reasonable possibility that a"
"605","material misstatement of the"
"606","Fund's annual or interim financial"
"607","statements will not be prevented"
"608","or detected on a timely basis."
"609","Our consideration of the Fund's"
"610","internal control over financial"
"611","reporting was for the limited"
"612","purpose described in the first"
"613","paragraph and would not"
"614","necessarily disclose all"
"615","deficiencies in internal control"
"616","that might be material"
"617","weaknesses under standards"
"618","established by the Public"
"619","Company Accounting Oversight"
"620","Board (United States).  However,"
"621","we noted no deficiencies in the"
"622","Fund's internal control over"
"623","financial reporting and its"
"624","operation, including controls"
"625","over safeguarding securities that"
"626","we consider to be a material"
"627","weakness as defined above as of"
"628","November 30, 2017."
"629","This report is intended solely for"
"630","the information and use of"
"631","management and the Board of"
"632","Trustees of the Fund and the"
"633","Securities and Exchange"
"634","Commission and is not intended"
"635","to be and should not be used by"
"636","anyone other than these"
"637","specified parties."
