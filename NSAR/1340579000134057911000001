"680","Since February 2004,"
"681","Federated and related"
"682","entities (collectively, Federated)"
"683"," have been named as"
"684","defendants in several"
"685","lawsuits that are now"
"686","pending in the United"
"687","States District Court for"
"688","the Western"
"689","District of Pennsylvania."
"690","These lawsuits have been"
"691","consolidated into a single"
"692","action alleging excessive"
"693","advisory fees involving"
"694"," one of the Federated-sponsored"
"695"," mutual funds (Funds)."
"696","       Federated and its"
"697","counsel have been defending"
"698"," this litigation. Additional"
"699","lawsuits based upon"
"700","similar allegations may be"
"701"," filed in the future. The"
"702","potential impact of these"
"703"," lawsuits, all of which seek"
"704","monetary damages, attorneys'"
"705","fees"
"706","and expenses, and future potential"
"707"," similar suits is uncertain."
"708","Although"
"709","we do not believe that these"
"710","lawsuits will have a material"
"711","adverse effect on the Funds,"
"712","there can be no"
"713","assurance that these suits,"
"714","ongoing adverse publicity and/or"
"715","other developments resulting from the"
"716","allegations in these matters"
"717"," will not result in increased"
"718"," redemptions, or reduced sales,"

"732","To the Shareholders and Board"

"735","In planning and performing our"

"738","Strategy Portfolio (one of the"
"739"," portfolios constituting Federated"
"740"," Managed Pool Series) (the"

"742","ended November 30, 2010, in"
"743","accordance with the standards of the"
"744","Public Company Accounting"
"745","Oversight Board (United States),"
"746","we considered the Fund's internal"
"747","control over financial reporting,"
"748","including controls over safeguarding"
"749","securities, as a basis for"
"750","designing our auditing procedures"
"751","for the purpose of expressing our"
"752","opinion on the financial"
"753","statements and to comply with the"
"754"," requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"755","not for the purpose of"
"756","expressing an opinion on the"
"757","effectiveness of the Fund's"
"758","internal control over financial"
"759","reporting."
"760","Accordingly, we express no"
"761","such opinion."
"762","The management of the Fund is"
"763","responsible for establishing and"

"765","control over financial reporting."
"766","In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"767","estimates and judgments by"
"768","management are required to assess"
"769","the expected benefits and related"
"770","costs of controls. A"
"771","company's internal control over"

"775","of financial reporting and the"
"776","preparation of financial"
"777","statements for external purposes"
"778"," in accordance with generally"

"780","A"
"781","company's internal control over"
"782","financial reporting includes those"
"783","policies and procedures that"
"784","(1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"785","records that, in reasonable detail,"
"786"," accurately and fairly reflect"
"787","the transactions and dispositions"
"788","of the assets of the company; (2)"
"789","provide reasonable assurance"
"790","that transactions are recorded as"
"791","necessary to permit preparation of"
"792","financial statements in"
"793","accordance with generally accepted"
"794"," accounting principles, and that"
"795","receipts and expenditures of"
"796","the company are being made only in"
"797","accordance with authorizations of"
"798"," management and"
"799","directors of the company; and (3)"
"800","provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"801","prevention or timely"
"802","detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"803","use or disposition of a company's assets"
"804","that could have a"
"805","material effect on the financial statements."
"806","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"807","internal control over financial reporting"
"808","may not prevent or"
"809","detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"810"," of any evaluation of effectiveness"
"811","to future periods are"
"812","subject to the risk that controls may"
"813","become inadequate because of changes in"
"814","conditions, or that"
"815","the degree of compliance with the policies"
"816"," or procedures may deteriorate."
"817","A deficiency in internal control over"
"818","financial reporting exists when the"
"819","design or operation of a"
"820","control does not allow management or"
"821","employees, in the normal course of"
"822","performing their"
"823","assigned functions, to prevent or"
"824","detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"825","A material weakness is"
"826","a deficiency, or a combination of"
"827","deficiencies, in internal control"
"828","over financial reporting, such"
"829","that there is a reasonable possibility"
"830","that a material misstatement of the"
"831","company's annual or"
"832","interim financial statements will"
"833","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"834","Our consideration of the Fund's internal"
"835","control over financial reporting was for"
"836","the limited"
"837","purpose described in the first paragraph"
"838","and would not necessarily disclose all"
"839","deficiencies in"
"840","internal control that might be material"
"841","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"842","Public"
"843","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"844","However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"845","the Fund's internal control over financial"
"846","reporting and its operation, including"
"847","controls over"
"848","safeguarding securities, that we consider"
"849","to be a material weakness as defined above as"
