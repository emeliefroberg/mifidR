"785","File Number: 811-4984"
"786","Exhibit 99.77B"
"787","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"788","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"789","American Beacon Funds:"
"790","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of American"
"791","Beacon Funds (comprised of the American Beacon Zebra Large Cap Equity Fund and"
"792","the American Beacon Zebra Small Cap Equity Fund) for the period June 1, 2010"
"793","to August 31, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"794","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered American Beacon"
"795","Funds' internal control over financialreporting, including controls over"
"796","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"797","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"798","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"799","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of American Beacon Funds'"
"800","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no"
"801","such opinion."
"802","The management of American Beacon Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"803","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"804","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"805","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"806","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"807","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"808","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"809","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"810","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"811","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"812","and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"813","authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"814","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"815","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"816","material effect on the financial statements."
"817","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"818","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"819","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"820","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"821","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"822","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"823","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"824","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"825","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material  weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"826","combination of deficiencies,  in internal control over financial reporting,"
"827","such that there is a  reasonable  possibility  that a material  misstatement"
"828","of American Beacon Funds'  annual  or  interim  financial  statements  will"
"829","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"830","Our consideration of American Beacon Funds' internal control over financial"
"831","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"832","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might"
"833","be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"834","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"835","in American Beacon Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"836","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, which we consider"
"837","to be a material weakness as defined above as of August 31, 2010."
"838","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"839","the Board of Trustees of American Beacon Funds and the Securities and Exchange"
"840","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"841","than these specified parties."
