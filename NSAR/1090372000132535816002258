"933","On August 26, 2016 the shareholders of the Jacob Wisdom Fund (the Wisdom Fund or"
"934","Predecessor Fund) approved an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (Reorganization
Plan), which qualified as a tax-free exchange for federal income tax purposes, providing for the"
"935","transfer of assets and the assumption of liabilities of the Predecessor Fund to the Small Cap"
"936","Growth Fund (the Fund). The Reorganization Plan provided for the acquisition by the Fund of all"
"937","of the assets of the Predecessor Fund in exchange solely for the assumption of all of the liabilities"
"938","of the Predecessor Fund and the issuance of shares of the Fund distributed pro rata by the"
"939","Predecessor Fund to its shareholders in complete liquidation and termination of the Predecessor"
"940","Fund. Investor Class shares of the Predecessor Fund were reorganized into Institutional Class"
"941","shares of the Fund. Pursuant to the Reorganization Plan, each shareholder of the Predecessor"
"942","Fund received shares of the Fund equal in value to the shares the shareholder had immediately"
"943","prior to the Reorganization. On August 29, 2016, the reorganization was completed and the"
"944","Predecessor Fund had $267,842 of unrealized appreciation on that date."

"1044","**$(1,918,563) as reported in the Small Cap Growth Fund Statement of Operations, plus $170,823"

"1064","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1065","To the Board of Directors of Jacob Funds Inc."
"1066","and the Shareholders of Jacob Internet Fund,"
"1067","Jacob Small Cap Growth Fund, and Jacob Micro Cap Growth Fund"
"1068","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of the Jacob Internet Fund, Jacob Small"
"1069","Cap Growth Fund and Jacob Micro Cap Growth Fund (the Funds), each a series of shares of Jacob"
"1070","Funds Inc., as of August 31, 2016 and for the year then ended, in accordance with the standards of the"
"1071","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Funds'"
"1072","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1073","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"1074","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1075","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such"
"1076","opinion."
"1077","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1078","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"1079","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal control over"
"1080","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1081","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1082","accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  A company's"
"1083","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1084","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1085","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1086","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and"
"1087","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1088","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1089","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"1090","material effect on the financial statements."
"1091","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1092","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1093","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of"
"1094","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1095","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control"
"1096","does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to"
"1097","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"1098","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1099","material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1100","detected on a timely basis."
"1101","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1102","described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that"
"1103","might be material weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB.  However, we noted no"
"1104","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"1105","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as of August 31,"
"1106","2016."
