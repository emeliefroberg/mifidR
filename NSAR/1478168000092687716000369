"1236","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED"
"1237","PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1238","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1239","Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Funds Trust"
"1240","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1241","statements of Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Funds"
"1242","Trust comprising Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Select"
"1243","40 Fund, Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Alpha Fund,"
"1244","Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Income Fund, and"
"1245","Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Alpha Plus Fund (the"
"1246","Funds) as of and for the year ended November 30,"
"1247","2015, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1248","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1249","States), we considered the Funds internal control over"
"1250","financial reporting, including controls over"
"1251","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1252","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1253","opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"1254","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"1255","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1256","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"1257","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such"
"1258","opinion."
"1259","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"1260","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1261","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1262","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1263","management are required to assess the expected"
"1264","benefits and related costs of controls.  A funds"
"1265","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"1266","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1267","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1268","preparation of financial statements for external"
"1269","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1270","accounting principles (GAAP).  A funds internal"
"1271","control over financial reporting includes those"
"1272","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1273","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1274","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1275","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1276","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1277","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1278","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that"
"1279","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made"
"1280","only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1281","management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"1282","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1283","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"1284","disposition of a funds assets that could have a"
"1285","material effect on the financial statements."
"1286","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1287","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1288","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1289","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"1290","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"1291","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1292","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1293","deteriorate."
"1294","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1295","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1296","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1297","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1298","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1299","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"1300","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"1301","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1302","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds"
"1303","annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1304","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1305","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"1306","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1307","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1308","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"1309","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1310","standards established by the Public Company"
"1311","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1312","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds"
"1313","internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1314","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1315","securities, that we consider to be a material weakness"
"1316","as defined above as of November 30, 2015."
"1317","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"1318","use of management and the Board of Trustees of the"
"1319","Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"1320","and is not intended to be and should not be used by"

"1333","N-SAR EXHIBIT 77E"
"1334","ALL FUNDS ADVISED BY OFI STEELPATH"
"1335","(based upon Non Defendant Version)"
"1336","Pending Litigation.  In 2009, several putative  class action lawsuits"
"1337","were filed and later"
"1338","consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado"
"1339"," against"
"1340","OppenheimerFunds, Inc., the parent of the Manager (OFI),"
"1341","OppenheimerFunds Distributor,"
"1342","Inc., the Funds principal underwriter and distributor (OFDI),"
"1343","and Oppenheimer Rochester"
"1344","California Municipal Fund, a fund advised by OFI Global Asset"
"1345","Management, Inc. and"
"1346","distributed by the Distributor (the California Fund),  in"
"1347","connection with the California Fund's"
"1348","investment performance.  The plaintiffs asserted claims against"
"1349","OFI, OFDI and certain present"
"1350","and former trustees and officers of the California Fund under"
"1351","the federal securities laws, alleging,"
"1352","among other things, that the disclosure documents of the"
"1353","California Fund contained"
"1354","misrepresentations and omissions and the investment policies"
"1355","of the California Fund were not"
"1356","followed.   Plaintiffs in the suit filed an amended complaint"
"1357","and defendants filed a motion to"
"1358","dismiss.  In 2011, the court issued an order which granted in"
"1359","part and denied in part the"
"1360","defendants motion to dismiss.  In 2012, plaintiffs filed a"
"1361","motion, which defendants opposed, to"
"1362","certify a class and appoint class representatives and class"
"1363","counsel.  In March 2015, the court"
"1364","granted plaintiffs motion for class certification.  In May"
"1365","2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the"
"1366","Tenth Circuit vacated the class certification order and"
"1367","remanded the matter to the district court"
"1368","for further proceedings.    In October 2015, the district"
"1369","court reaffirmed its order granting"
"1370","plaintiffs motion for class certification.  In December 2015,"
"1371","the Tenth Circuit denied"
"1372","defendants petition to appeal the district court's reaffirmed"
"1373","class certification order."
"1374","OFI and OFDI believe the suit is without merit that it is"
"1375","premature to render any opinion as to"
"1376","the likelihood of an outcome unfavorable to them in the Suit"
"1377","and that no estimate can yet be"
"1378","made as to the amount or range of any potential loss."
"1379","Furthermore, OFI believes that the suit"
"1380","should not impair the ability of OFI or OFDI to perform"
"1381","their respective duties to the Fund and"
"1382","that the outcome of the suit should not have any material"
"1383","effect on the operations of any of the"
"1384","Oppenheimer funds."
