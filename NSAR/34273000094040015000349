"3540","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"3541","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"3542","Virtus Equity Trust"
"3543","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"3544","statements of the funds constituting Virtus Equity Trust,"
"3545","hereafter referred to as the Trust as of and for the year"
"3546","ended March 31, 2015, in accordance with the standards of the"
"3547","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"3548","considered the Trust's internal control over financial"
"3549","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"3550","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"3551","of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"3552","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"3553","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"3554","Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"3555","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness"
"3556","of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"3557","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"3558","maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"3559","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"3560","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"3561","benefits and related costs of controls.  A trust's internal"
"3562","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"3563","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"3564","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"3565","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"3566","accounting principles.  A trust's internal control over"
"3567","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"3568","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"3569","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"3570","dispositions of the assets of the trust; (2) provide reasonable"
"3571","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"3572","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"3573","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"3574","expenditures of the trust are being made only in accordance"
"3575","with authorizations of management and trustees of the trust;"
"3576","and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"3577","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"3578","disposition of a trust's assets that could have a material"
"3579","effect on the financial statements."
"3580","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"3581","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"3582","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"3583","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3584","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"3585","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3586","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"3587","exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"3588","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"3589","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"3590","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"3591","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"3592","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"3593","material misstatement of the Trust's annual or interim"
"3594","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"3595","timely basis."
"3596","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over"
"3597","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"3598","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"3599","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that"
"3600","might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"3601","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"3602","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trust's internal"
"3603","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"3604","controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be"
"3605","material weaknesses as defined above as of March 31, 2015."
"3606","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"3607","management and the Board of Trustees of Virtus Equity Trust and"
"3608","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to"
"3609","be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"

"3822","SUBADVISORY AGREEMENT"
"3823","Virtus Growth & Income Fund"
"3824","	December 8, 2014"
"3825","Rampart Investment Management Company, LLC"
"3826","One International Place, 14th Floor"
"3827","Boston, MA 02110"
"3828","RE:	Subadvisory Agreement"
"3829","Ladies and Gentlemen:"
"3830","Virtus Equity Trust (the Fund) is an open-end investment"
"3831","company of the series type registered under the Investment"
"3832","Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Act), and is subject to"
"3833","the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.  The shares of"
"3834","the Fund are offered or may be offered in several series,"
"3835","including Virtus Growth & Income Fund (collectively, sometimes"
"3836","hereafter referred to as the Series)."
"3837","Virtus Investment Advisers, Inc. (the Adviser) evaluates and"
"3838","recommends series advisers for the Series and is responsible for"
"3839","the day-to-day management of the Series."
"3840","1.	Employment as a Subadviser.  The Adviser, being duly"
"3841","authorized, hereby employs Rampart Investment Management"
"3842","Company, LLC (the Subadviser) as a discretionary series"
"3843","adviser to invest and reinvest the assets of the Series"
"3844","designated by the Adviser as set forth on Schedule F attached"
"3845","hereto (the Designated Series) on the terms and conditions"
"3846","set forth herein."
"3847","2.	Acceptance of Employment; Standard of Performance.  The"
"3848","Subadviser accepts its employment as a discretionary series"
"3849","adviser of the Designated Series and agrees to use its best"
"3850","professional judgment to make investment decisions for the"
"3851","Designated Series in accordance with the provisions of this"
"3852","Agreement and as set forth in Schedule D attached hereto and"
"3853","made a part hereof."
"3854","3.	Services of Subadviser.  In providing management services to"
"3855","the Designated Series, the Subadviser shall be subject to the"
"3856","investment objectives, policies and restrictions of the Fund"
"3857","as they apply to the Designated Series and as set forth in the"
"3858","Fund's then current prospectus (Prospectus) and statement of"
"3859","additional information (Statement of Additional Information)"
"3860","filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC)"
"3861","as part of the Fund's Registration Statement, as may be"
"3862","periodically amended and provided to the Subadviser by the"
"3863","Adviser, and to the investment restrictions set forth in the"
"3864","Act and the Rules thereunder, to the supervision and control"
"3865","of the Trustees of the Fund (the Trustees), and to"
"3866","instructions from the Adviser.  The Subadviser shall not,"
"3867","without the Fund's prior written approval, effect any"
"3868","transactions that would cause the Designated Series at the"
"3869","time of the transaction to be out of compliance with any of"
"3870","such restrictions or policies."
"3871","4.	Transaction Procedures.  All series transactions for the"
"3872","Designated Series shall be consummated by payment to, or"
"3873","delivery by, the Custodian(s) from time to time designated by"
"3874","the Fund (the Custodian), or such depositories or agents as"
"3875","may be designated by the Custodian in writing, of all cash"
"3876","and/or securities due to or from the Series.  The Subadviser"
"3877","shall not have possession or custody of such cash and/or"
"3878","securities or any responsibility or liability with respect to"
"3879","such custody.  The Subadviser shall advise the Custodian and"
"3880","confirm in writing to the Fund all investment orders for the"
"3881","Designated Series placed by it with brokers and dealers at the"
"3882","time and in the manner set forth in Schedule A hereto (as"
"3883","amended from time to time).  The Fund shall issue to the"
"3884","Custodian such instructions as may be appropriate in"
"3885","connection with the settlement of any transaction initiated by"
"3886","the Subadviser.  The Fund shall be responsible for all"
"3887","custodial arrangements and the payment of all custodial"
"3888","charges and fees, and, upon giving proper instructions to the"
"3889","Custodian, the Subadviser shall have no responsibility or"
"3890","liability with respect to custodial arrangements or the act,"
"3891","omissions or other conduct of the Custodian."
"3892","5.	Allocation of Brokerage.  The Subadviser shall have authority"
"3893","and discretion to select brokers and dealers to execute"
"3894","Designated Series transactions initiated by the Subadviser,"
"3895","and to select the markets on or in which the transactions will"
"3896","be executed."
"3897","A.	In placing orders for the sale and purchase of"
"3898","Designated Series securities for the Fund, the"
"3899","Subadviser's primary responsibility shall be to seek"
"3900","the best execution of orders at the most favorable"
"3901","prices.  However, this responsibility shall not"
"3902","obligate the Subadviser to solicit competitive bids for"
"3903","each transaction or to seek the lowest available"
"3904","commission cost to the Fund, so long as the Subadviser"
"3905","reasonably believes that the broker or dealer selected"
"3906","by it can be expected to obtain a best execution"
"3907","market price on the particular transaction and"
"3908","determines in good faith that the commission cost is"
"3909","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage"
"3910","and research services (as defined in Section 28(e)(3)"
"3911","of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) provided by"
"3912","such broker or dealer to the Subadviser, viewed in"
"3913","terms of either that particular transaction or of the"
"3914","Subadviser's overall responsibilities with respect to"
"3915","its clients, including the Fund, as to which the"
"3916","Subadviser exercises investment discretion,"
"3917","notwithstanding that the Fund may not be the direct or"
"3918","exclusive beneficiary of any such services or that"
"3919","another broker may be willing to charge the Fund a"
"3920","lower commission on the particular transaction."
"3921","B.	The Subadviser may manage other portfolios and expects"
"3922","that the Fund and other portfolios the Subadviser"
"3923","manages will, from time to time, purchase or sell the"
"3924","same securities.  The Subadviser may aggregate orders"
"3925","for the purchase or sale of securities on behalf of the"
"3926","Designated Series with orders on behalf of other"
"3927","portfolios the Subadviser manages.  Securities"
"3928","purchased or proceeds of securities sold through"
"3929","aggregated orders, as well as expenses incurred in the"
"3930","transaction, shall be allocated to the account of each"
"3931","portfolio managed by the Subadviser that bought or sold"
"3932","such securities in a manner considered by the"
"3933","Subadviser to be equitable and consistent with the"
"3934","Subadviser's fiduciary obligations in respect of the"
"3935","Designated Series and to such other accounts."
"3936","C.	The Subadviser shall not execute any Series"
"3937","transactions for the Designated Series with a broker or"
"3938","dealer that is (i) an affiliated person (as defined"
"3939","in the Act) of the Fund, the Subadviser, any subadviser"
"3940","to any other Series of the Fund, or the Adviser; (ii) a"
"3941","principal underwriter of the Fund's shares; or (iii) an"
"3942","affiliated person of such an affiliated person or"
"3943","principal underwriter; in each case, unless such"
"3944","transactions are permitted by applicable law or"
"3945","regulation and carried out in compliance with any"
"3946","applicable policies and procedures of the Fund.  The"
"3947","Fund shall provide the Subadviser with a list of"
"3948","brokers and dealers that are affiliated persons of"
"3949","the Fund or the Adviser, and applicable policies and"
"3950","procedures."
"3951","D.	Consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund"
"3952","in respect of the Designated Series and the"
"3953","requirements of best price and execution, the"
"3954","Subadviser may, under certain circumstances, arrange to"
"3955","have purchase and sale transactions effected directly"
"3956","between the Designated Series and another account"
"3957","managed by the Subadviser (cross transactions),"
"3958","provided that such transactions are carried out in"
"3959","accordance with applicable law or regulation and any"
"3960","applicable policies and procedures of the Fund.  The"
"3961","Fund shall provide the Subadviser with applicable"
"3962","policies and procedures."
"3963","6.	Proxies."
"3964","A.	Unless the Adviser or the Fund gives the Subadviser"
"3965","written instructions to the contrary, the Subadviser,"
"3966","or a third party designee acting under the authority"
"3967","and supervision of the Subadviser, shall review all"
"3968","proxy solicitation materials and be responsible for"
"3969","voting and handling all proxies in relation to the"
"3970","assets of the Designated Series.  Unless the Adviser or"
"3971","the Fund gives the Subadviser written instructions to"
"3972","the contrary, the Subadviser will, in compliance with"
"3973","the proxy voting procedures of the Designated Series"
"3974","then in effect, vote or abstain from voting, all"
"3975","proxies solicited by or with respect to the issuers of"
"3976","securities in which assets of the Designated Series may"
"3977","be invested.  The Adviser shall cause the Custodian to"
"3978","forward promptly to the Subadviser all proxies upon"
"3979","receipt, so as to afford the Subadviser a reasonable"
"3980","amount of time in which to determine how to vote such"
"3981","proxies. The Subadviser agrees to provide the Adviser"
"3982","in a timely manner with a record of votes cast"
"3983","containing all of the voting information required by"
"3984","Form N-PX in an electronic format to enable the Fund to"
"3985","file Form N-PX as required by Rule 30b1-4 under the"
"3986","Act."
"3987","B.	The Subadviser is authorized to deal with"
"3988","reorganizations, exchange offers and other voluntary"
"3989","corporate actions with respect to securities held in"
"3990","the Series in such manner as the Subadviser deems"
"3991","advisable, unless the Fund or the Adviser otherwise"
"3992","specifically directs in writing.  With the Adviser's"
"3993","approval, the Subadviser shall also have the authority"
"3994","to: (i) identify, evaluate and pursue legal claims,"
"3995","including commencing or defending suits, affecting the"
"3996","securities held at any time in the Series, including"
"3997","claims in bankruptcy, class action securities"
"3998","litigation and other litigation; (ii) participate in"
"3999","such litigation or related proceedings with respect to"
"4000","such securities as the Subadviser deems appropriate to"
"4001","preserve or enhance the value of the Series, including"
"4002","filing proofs of claim and related documents and"
"4003","serving as lead plaintiff in class action lawsuits;"
"4004","(iii) exercise generally any of the powers of an owner"
"4005","with respect to the supervision and management of such"
"4006","rights or claims, including the settlement, compromise"
"4007","or submission to arbitration of any claims, the"
"4008","exercise of which the Subadviser deems to be in the"
"4009","best interest of the Series or required by applicable"
"4010","law, including ERISA, and (iv) employ suitable agents,"
"4011","including legal counsel, and to pay their reasonable"
"4012","fees, expenses and related costs from the Series."
"4013","7.	Prohibited Conduct.  In providing the services described in"
"4014","this Agreement, the Subadviser's responsibility regarding"
"4015","investment advice hereunder is limited to the Designated"
"4016","Series, and the Subadviser will not consult with any other"
"4017","investment advisory firm that provides investment advisory"
"4018","services to the Fund or any other investment company sponsored"
"4019","by Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. regarding transactions for"
"4020","the Fund in securities or other assets.  The Fund shall"
"4021","provide the Subadviser with a list of investment companies"
"4022","sponsored by Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. and the"
"4023","Subadviser shall be in breach of the foregoing provision only"
"4024","if the investment company is included in such a list provided"
"4025","to the Subadviser prior to such prohibited action.  In"
"4026","addition, the Subadviser shall not, without the prior written"
"4027","consent of the Fund and the Adviser, delegate any obligation"
"4028","assumed pursuant to this Agreement to any affiliated or"
"4029","unaffiliated third party."
"4030","8.	Information and Reports."
"4031","A.	The Subadviser shall keep the Fund and the Adviser"
"4032","informed of developments relating to its duties as"
"4033","Subadviser of which the Subadviser has, or should have,"
"4034","knowledge that would materially affect the Designated"
"4035","Series.  In this regard, the Subadviser shall provide"
"4036","the Fund, the Adviser and their respective officers"
"4037","with such periodic reports concerning the obligations"
"4038","the Subadviser has assumed under this Agreement as the"
"4039","Fund and the Adviser may from time to time reasonably"
"4040","request.  In addition, prior to each meeting of the"
"4041","Trustees, the Subadviser shall provide the Adviser and"
"4042","the Trustees with reports regarding the Subadviser's"
"4043","management of the Designated Series during the most"
"4044","recently completed quarter, which reports: (i) shall"
"4045","include Subadviser's representation that its"
"4046","performance of its investment management duties"
"4047","hereunder is in compliance with the Fund's investment"
"4048","objectives and practices, the Act and applicable rules"
"4049","and regulations under the Act, and the diversification"
"4050","and minimum good income requirements of Subchapter M"
"4051","under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,"
"4052","and (ii) otherwise shall be in such form as may be"
"4053","mutually agreed upon by the Subadviser and the Adviser."
"4054","B.	Each of the Adviser and the Subadviser shall provide"
"4055","the other party with a list, to the best of the"
"4056","Adviser's or the Subadviser's respective knowledge, of"
"4057","each affiliated person (and any affiliated person of"
"4058","such an affiliated person) of the Adviser or the"
"4059","Subadviser, as the case may be, and each of the Adviser"
"4060","and Subadviser agrees promptly to update such list"
"4061","whenever the Adviser or the Subadviser becomes aware of"
"4062","any changes that should be added to or deleted from the"
"4063","list of affiliated persons."
"4064","C.	The Subadviser shall also provide the Adviser with any"
"4065","information reasonably requested by the Adviser"
"4066","regarding its management of the Designated Series"
"4067","required for any shareholder report, amended"
"4068","registration statement, or Prospectus supplement to be"
"4069","filed by the Fund with the SEC."
"4070","9.	Fees for Services.  The compensation of the Subadviser for its"
"4071","services under this Agreement shall be calculated and paid by"
"4072","the Adviser in accordance with the attached Schedule C."
"4073","Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between the Fund"
"4074","and the Adviser, the Adviser is solely responsible for the"
"4075","payment of fees to the Subadviser."
"4076","10.	Limitation of Liability.  Except as otherwise stated in"
"4077","this Agreement, the Subadviser shall not be liable for any"
"4078","action taken, omitted or suffered to be taken by it in its"
"4079","best professional judgment, in good faith and believed by it"
"4080","to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers"
"4081","conferred upon it by this Agreement, or in accordance with"
"4082","specific directions or instructions from the Fund, provided,"
"4083","however, that such acts or omissions shall not have"
"4084","constituted a material breach of the investment objectives,"
"4085","policies and restrictions applicable to the Designated Series"
"4086","as defined in the Prospectus and Statement of Additional"
"4087","Information , or a material breach of any laws, rules,"
"4088","regulations or orders applicable to the Designated Series, and"
"4089","that such acts or omissions shall not have resulted from the"
"4090","Subadviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross"
"4091","negligence, or reckless disregard of its obligations and"
"4092","duties hereunder."
"4093","11.	Confidentiality.  Subject to the duty of the Subadviser and"
"4094","the Fund to comply with applicable law, including any demand"
"4095","of any regulatory or taxing authority having jurisdiction, the"
"4096","parties hereto shall treat as confidential all information"
"4097","pertaining to the Designated Series and the actions of the"
"4098","Subadviser and the Fund in respect thereof.  Notwithstanding"
"4099","the foregoing, the Fund and the Adviser agree that the"
"4100","Subadviser may (i) disclose in marketing materials and similar"
"4101","communications that the Subadviser has been engaged to manage"
"4102","assets of the Designated Series pursuant to this Agreement,"
"4103","and (ii) include performance statistics regarding the Series"
"4104","in composite performance statistics regarding one or more"
"4105","groups of Subadviser's clients published or included in any of"
"4106","the foregoing communications, provided that the Subadviser"
"4107","does not identify any performance statistics as relating"
"4108","specifically to the Series."
"4109","12.	Assignment.  This Agreement shall terminate automatically"
"4110","in the event of its assignment, as that term is defined in"
"4111","Section 2(a)(4) of the Act.  The Subadviser shall notify the"
"4112","Fund and the Adviser in writing sufficiently in advance of any"
"4113","proposed change of control, as defined in Section 2(a)(9) of"
"4114","the Act, as will enable the Fund to consider whether an"
"4115","assignment as defined in Section 2(a)(4) of the Act will"
"4116","occur, and to take the steps necessary to enter into a new"
"4117","contract with the Subadviser."
"4118","13.	Representations, Warranties and Agreements of the"
"4119","Subadviser.  The Subadviser represents, warrants and agrees"
"4120","that:"
"4121","A.	It is registered as an investment adviser under the"
"4122","Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (Advisers
Act)."
"4123","B.	It will maintain, keep current and preserve on behalf"
"4124","of the Fund, in the manner required or permitted by the"
"4125","Act and the Rules thereunder including the records"
"4126","identified in Schedule B (as Schedule B may be amended"
"4127","from time to time).  The Subadviser agrees that such"
"4128","records are the property of the Fund, and shall be"
"4129","surrendered to the Fund or to the Adviser as agent of"
"4130","the Fund promptly upon request of either. The Fund"
"4131","acknowledges that Subadviser may retain copies of all"
"4132","records required to meet the record retention"
"4133","requirements imposed by law and regulation."
"4134","C.	It shall maintain a written code of ethics (the Code
of Ethics) complying with the requirements of Rule"
"4135","204A-1 under the Advisers Act and Rule 17j-l under the"
"4136","Act and shall provide the Fund and the Adviser with a"
"4137","copy of the Code of Ethics and evidence of its"
"4138","adoption.  It shall institute procedures reasonably"
"4139","necessary to prevent Access Persons (as defined in Rule"
"4140","17j-1) from violating its Code of Ethics.  The"
"4141","Subadviser acknowledges receipt of the written code of"
"4142","ethics adopted by and on behalf of the Fund.  Each"
"4143","calendar quarter while this Agreement is in effect, a"
"4144","duly authorized compliance officer of the Subadviser"
"4145","shall certify to the Fund and to the Adviser that the"
"4146","Subadviser has complied with the requirements of Rules"
"4147","204A-1 and 17j-l during the previous calendar quarter"

"4151","or acted upon any material, non-public information, as"
"4152","such term is defined under relevant securities laws,"
"4153","and if such a violation has occurred or the code of"
"4154","ethics of the Fund, or if such a violation of its Code"
"4155","of Ethics has occurred, that appropriate action was"
"4156","taken in response to such violation.  Annually, the"
"4157","Subadviser shall furnish to the Fund and the Adviser a"
"4158","written report which complies with the requirements of"
"4159","Rule 17j-1 concerning the Subadviser's Code of Ethics."
"4160","The Subadviser shall permit the Fund and the Adviser to"
"4161","examine the reports required to be made by the"
"4162","Subadviser under Rules 204A-1(b) and 17j-l(d)(1) and"
"4163","this subparagraph."
"4164","D.	It has adopted and implemented, and throughout the term"
