"503","PUBLIC"
"504","ACCOUNTING"
"505","FIRM"
"506","To the Shareholders"
"507","and Board of Trustees"
"508","AdvisorOne Funds"
"509","Omaha, Nebraska"
"510","In planning and"
"511","performing our audit of"
"512","the financial statements"
"513","of Milestone Treasury"
"514","Obligations Fund (the"
"515","Fund), a series of"
"516","AdvisorOne Funds, as"
"517","of and for the year"
"518","ended November 30,"
"519","2014, in accordance"
"520","with the standards of"
"521","the Public Company"
"522","Accounting Oversight"
"523","Board (United States),"
"524","we considered its"
"525","internal control over"
"526","financial reporting,"
"527","including control"
"528","activities for"
"529","safeguarding securities,"
"530","as a basis for designing"
"531","our auditing procedures"
"532","for the purpose of"
"533","expressing our opinion"
"534","on the financial"
"535","statements and to"
"536","comply with the"
"537","requirements of Form"
"538","N-SAR, but not for the"
"539","purpose of expressing"
"540","an opinion on the"
"541","effectiveness of the"
"542","Fund's internal control"
"543","over financial reporting."
"544","Accordingly, we"
"545","express no such"
"546","opinion."
"547","The management of the"
"548","Fund is responsible for"
"549","establishing and"
"550","maintaining effective"
"551","internal control over"
"552","financial reporting.   In"
"553","fulfilling this"
"554","responsibility, estimates"
"555","and judgments by"
"556","management are"
"557","required to assess the"
"558","expected benefits and"
"559","related costs of controls."
"560","A company's internal"
"561","control over financial"
"562","reporting is a process"
"563","designed to provide"
"564","reasonable assurance"
"565","regarding the reliability"
"566","of financial reporting"
"567","and the preparation of"
"568","financial statements for"
"569","external purposes in"
"570","accordance with"
"571","accounting principles"
"572","generally accepted in"
"573","the United States of"
"574","America.   Such internal"
"575","control includes policies"
"576","and procedures that"
"577","provide reasonable"
"578","assurance regarding"
"579","prevention or timely"
"580","detection of"
"581","unauthorized"
"582","acquisition, use or"
"583","disposition of a"
"584","company's assets that"
"585","could have a material"
"586","effect on the financial"
"587","statements."
"588","Because of inherent"
"589","limitations, internal"
"590","control over financial"
"591","reporting may not"
"592","prevent or detect"
"593","misstatements.   Also,"
"594","projections of any"
"595","evaluation of"
"596","effectiveness to future"
"597","periods are subject to"
"598","the risk that controls"
"599","may become inadequate"
"600","because of changes in"
"601","conditions, or that the"
"602","degree of compliance"
"603","with the policies or"
"604","procedures may"
"605","deteriorate."
"606","A control deficiency"
"607","exists when the design"
"608","or operation of a control"
"609","does not allow"
"610","management or"
"611","employees, in the"
"612","normal course of"
"613","performing their"
"614","assigned functions, to"
"615","prevent or detect"
"616","misstatements on a"
"617","timely basis.   A"
"618","significant deficiency is"
"619","a control deficiency, or"
"620","combination of control"
"621","deficiencies, that"
"622","adversely affects the"
"623","company's ability to"
"624","initiate, authorize,"
"625","record, process or report"
"626","financial data reliably in"
"627","accordance with"
"628","accounting principles"
"629","generally accepted in"
"630","the United States of"
"631","America such that there"
"632","is more than a remote"
"633","likelihood that a"
"634","misstatement of the"
"635","company's annual or"
"636","interim financial"
"637","statements that is more"
"638","than inconsequential"
"639","will not be prevented or"
"640","detected. A material"
"641","weakness is a"
"642","significant deficiency,"
"643","or combination of"
"644","significant deficiencies,"
"645","that results in more than"
"646","a remote likelihood that"
"647","a material misstatement"
"648","of the annual or interim"
"649","financial statements will"
"650","not be prevented or"
"651","detected."

"656","Our consideration of the"
"657","Fund's internal control"
"658","over financial reporting"
"659","was for the limited"
"660","purpose described in the"
"661","first paragraph and"
"662","would not necessarily"
"663","disclose all deficiencies"
"664","in internal control that"
"665","might be significant"
"666","deficiencies or material"
"667","weaknesses under"
"668","standards established by"
"669","the Public Company"
"670","Accounting Oversight"
"671","Board (United States)."
"672","However, we noted no"
"673","deficiencies in the"
"674","Fund's internal control"
"675","over financial reporting"
"676","and its operation,"
"677","including controls for"
"678","safeguarding securities,"
"679","which we consider to be"
"680","material weaknesses, as"
"681","defined above, as of"
"682","November 30, 2014."
"683","This report is intended"
