"2862","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"2863","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of"
"2864","American Century Capital Portfolios, Inc.:"
"2865","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"2866","of American Century Capital Portfolios, Inc. (the &#147;Corporation&#148;),"
"2867","including the Equity Income Fund, Mid Cap Value Fund, Small Cap"
"2868","Value Fund, Value Fund, Large Company Value Fund, Real Estate Fund,"
"2869","Equity Index Fund, NT Large Company Value Fund and NT Mid Cap Value"
"2870","Fund, as of and for the year ended March 31, 2010, in accordance with"
"2871","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"2872","States), we considered the Corporation&#146;s internal control over financial"
"2873","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"2874","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"2875","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"2876","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"2877","effectiveness of the Corporation&#146;s internal control over financial"
"2878","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2879","The management of the Corporation is responsible for establishing and"
"2880","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"2881","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"2882","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"2883","controls. A corporation&#146;s internal control over financial reporting"
"2884","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"2885","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"2886","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2887","accounting principles.  A corporation&#146;s internal control over financial"
"2888","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"2889","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"2890","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"2891","corporation; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"2892","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"2893","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"2894","receipts and expenditures of the corporation are being made only in"
"2895","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"2896","corporation; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"2897","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition"
"2898","of a corporation&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the"
"2899","financial statements."
"2900","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2901","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"2902","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"2903","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2904","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"2905","procedures may deteriorate."
"2906","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2907","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"2908","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"2909","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"2910","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"2911","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"2912","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"2913","misstatement of the corporation&#146;s annual or interim financial"
"2914","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2915","Our consideration of the Corporation&#146;s internal control over"
"2916","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"2917","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"2918","deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"2919","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"2920","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"2921","no deficiencies in the Corporation&#146;s internal control over"
"2922","financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"2923","for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material"
"2924","weakness as defined above, as of March 31, 2010."
"2925","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"2926","management and the Board of Directors of American Century Capital"
"2927","Portfolios, Inc., and the Securities and Exchange Commission and"
"2928","is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"2929","than these specified parties."

"2950","Terms of new or amended securities"
"2951","(a)(1) Mid Cap Value and Small Cap Value each renamed its Advisor Class"
"2952"," &#147;A Class&#148;, effective 03/01/10."
"2953","The Advisor Class shares of each of the funds were renamed A Class"
"2954","shares.  A Class shares have a front end sales charge (load)."
"2955","However, the sales charge on A Class shares will be waived for purchases"
"2956","of additional shares in accounts that held shares of an Advisor Class"
"2957","fund prior to March 1, 2010."
"2958","(b)(1) Mid Cap Value and Small Cap Value, each a series of the trust,"
"2959","began offering C and R Classes during the period, effective 03/01/10."
"2960","Each fund is a series of shares issued by the trust, and shares of each"
"2961","fund have equal voting rights. In addition, each series (or fund) may be"
"2962","divided into separate classes. Additional funds and classes may be added"
"2963","without a shareholder vote. Each fund votes separately on matters affecting"
"2964","that fund exclusively. Voting rights are not cumulative, so that investors"
"2965","holding more than 50% of the trust&#146;s (i.e., all funds&#146;) outstanding shares"
"2966","may be able to elect a Board of Trustees. The trust undertakes dollar-based"
"2967","voting, meaning that the number of votes a shareholder is entitled to is"
"2968","based upon the dollar amount of the shareholder&#146;s investment. The election"
"2969","of trustees is determined by the votes received from all trust shareholders"
"2970","without regard to whether a majority of shares of any one fund voted in favor"
"2971","of a particular nominee or all nominees as a group."
"2972","Each shareholder has rights to dividends and distributions declared by the"
"2973","fund he or she owns and to the net assets of such fund upon its liquidation"
"2974","or dissolution proportionate to his or her share ownership interest in the"
"2975","fund. Shares of each fund have equal voting rights, although each fund votes"
"2976","separately on matters affecting that fund exclusively."
"2977","The assets belonging to each series are held separately by the custodian and"
"2978","the shares of each series represent a beneficial interest in the principal,"
"2979","earnings and profit (or losses) of investments and other assets held for each"
"2980","series. Shareholder rights are the same for all series of securities unless"
"2981","otherwise stated. Within their respective series, all shares have equal"
"2982","redemption rights. Each share, when issued, is fully paid and non-assessable."
"2983","The A, C, and R Class shares of the funds are made available to participants"
"2984","in employer-sponsored retirement plans and to persons purchasing through"
"2985","broker-dealers, banks, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries"
"2986","that provide various administrative, shareholder and distribution services."
"2987","The funds&#146; distributor enters into contracts with various banks,"
"2988","broker-dealers, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries,"
"2989","with respect to the sale of the funds&#146; shares and/or the use"
"2990","of the funds&#146; shares in various investment products or in connection"
"2991","with various financial services."
"2992","Certain recordkeeping and administrative services that would otherwise be"
"2993","performed by the funds&#146; transfer agent may be performed by a plan sponsor"
"2994","(or its agents) or by a financial intermediary for A Class, C Class and R Class"
"2995","investors. In addition to such services, the financial intermediaries provide"
"2996","various individual shareholder and distribution services."
"2997","To enable the funds&#146; shares to be made available through such plans and"
"2998","financial intermediaries, and to compensate them for such services, the"
"2999","funds&#146; Board of Trustees has adopted the A, C and R Class Plans."
"3000","Pursuant to the A Class Plan, the A Class pays the funds&#146; distributor 0.25%"
"3001","annually of the average daily net asset value of the funds&#146; A Class shares."
"3002","The distributor may use these fees to pay for certain ongoing shareholder and"
"3003","administrative services and for distribution"
"3004","services, including past distribution services. This payment is fixed at 0.25%"
"3005","and is not based on expenses incurred by the distributor."
"3006","Pursuant to the C Class Plan, the C Class pays the funds&#146; distributor 1.00%"
"3007","annually of the average daily net asset value of the funds&#146; C Class shares,"
"3008","0.25% of which is paid for certain ongoing individual shareholder"
"3009","and administrative services and 0.75% of which is paid for"
"3010","distribution services, including past distribution services. This payment is"
"3011","fixed at 1.00% and is not based on expenses incurred by the distributor."
"3012","Pursuant to the R Class Plan, the R Class pays the funds&#146; distributor 0.50%"
"3013","annually of the average daily net asset value of the R Class shares."
"3014","The distributor may use these fees to pay for certain ongoing shareholder and"
"3015","administrative services and for distribution services,"
"3016","including past distribution services. This payment is fixed at 0.50% and is not"
"3017","based on expenses incurred by the distributor."
"3018","    The distributor then makes these payments to the financial intermediaries"
"3019","(including underwriters and broker-dealers, who may use some of the proceeds"
"3020","to compensate sales personnel) who offer the A Class for the services"
"3021","described below. No portion of these payments is used by the"
"3022","distributor to pay for advertising, printing costs or interest expenses."
"3023","    Payments may be made for a variety of individual shareholder services,"
"3024","including, but not limited to:"
"3025","    (a)  providing individualized and customized investment advisory services,"
"3026","including the consideration of shareholder profiles and specific goals;"
"3027","    (b)  creating investment models and asset allocation models for use by"
"3028","shareholders in selecting appropriate funds;"
"3029","    (c)  conducting proprietary research about investment choices and the"
"3030","market in general;"
"3031","    (d)  periodic rebalancing of shareholder accounts to ensure compliance"
"3032","with the selected asset allocation;"
"3033","    (e)  consolidating shareholder accounts in one place; and"
"3034","    (f)  other individual services."
"3035","    Individual shareholder services do not include those activities and"
"3036","expenses that are primarily intended to result in the sale of additional"
"3037","shares of the funds."
"3038","    Distribution services include any activity undertaken or expense incurred"
"3039","that is primarily intended to result in the sale of A Class, C Class or"
"3040","R Class shares, which services may include but are not limited to:"
"3041","    (a)  paying sales commissions, on-going commissions and other payments"
"3042","to brokers, dealers, financial institutions or others who sell A Class, C Class"
"3043","or R Class shares pursuant to selling agreements;"
"3044","    (b)  compensating registered representatives or other employees of the"
"3045","distributor who engage in or support distribution of the funds&#146; A Class,"
"3046","C Class or R Class shares;"
"3047","    (c)  paying and compensating expenses (including overhead and telephone"
"3048","expenses) of the distributor;"
"3049","    (d)  printing prospectuses, statements of additional information and"
"3050","reports for other-than-existing shareholders;"
"3051","    (e)  preparing, printing and distributing sales literature and advertising"
"3052","materials provided to the funds&#146; shareholders and prospective shareholders;"
"3053","    (f)  receiving and answering correspondence from prospective shareholders,"
"3054","including distributing prospectuses, statements of additional information,"
"3055","    and shareholder reports;"
"3056","    (g)  providing facilities to answer questions from prospective shareholders"
"3057","about fund shares;"
"3058","    (h)  complying with federal and state securities laws pertaining to the"
"3059","sale of fund shares;"
"3060","    (i)  assisting shareholders in completing application forms and selecting"
"3061","dividend and other account options;"
"3062","    (j)  providing other reasonable assistance in connection with the"
"3063","distribution of fund shares;"
"3064","     (k)  organizing and conducting of sales seminars and payments in the"
"3065","form of transactional and compensation or promotional incentives;"
"3066","    (l)  profit on the foregoing;"
"3067","    (m)  paying service fees for providing personal, continuing services to"
"3068","investors, as contemplated by the Conduct Rules of the FINRA; and"
"3069","    (n)  such other distribution and services activities as the advisor"
"3070","determines may be paid for by the funds pursuant to the terms of the"
"3071","agreement between the corporation and the funds&#146; distributor and in"
"3072","accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act."
"3073","    Each shareholder&#146;s ability to purchase, exchange, redeem and transfer"
"3074","shares will be affected by the policies of the financial intermediary"
"3075","through which he/she does business. Some policy differences may include"
"3076","    &#149;	minimum investment requirements"
"3077","    &#149;	exchange policies"
"3078","    &#149;	fund choices"
"3079","    &#149;	cutoff time for investments"
"3080","    &#149;	trading restrictions"
"3081","    In addition, a financial intermediary may charge a transaction fee for"
"3082","the purchase or sale of fund shares. Those charges are retained by the"
"3083","financial intermediary and are not shared with American Century"
"3084","Investments or the funds."
"3085","    The funds have authorized certain financial intermediaries to accept"
"3086","orders on the funds&#146; behalf. American Century has selling agreements with"
"3087","these financial intermediaries requiring them to track the time"
"3088","investment orders are received and to comply with procedures relating"
"3089","to the transmission of orders. Orders must be received by the financial"
"3090","intermediary on the funds&#146; behalf before the time the net asset value"
"3091","is determined in order to receive that day&#146;s share price. If"
"3092","those orders are transmitted to American Century and paid for in accordance"
"3093","with the selling agreement, they will be priced at the net asset value"
"3094","next determined after your request is received in the form"
"3095","required by the intermediary."
"3096","    Unless otherwise specified below, the minimum initial investment"
"3097","amount to open an account is $2,500. Financial intermediaries may open"
"3098","an account with $250, but may require their clients to meet"
"3099","different investment minimums.  There is a $50 minimum for subsequent"
"3100","purchases. However, there is no subsequent purchase minimum for financial"
"3101","intermediaries or employer-sponsored retirement plans, but financial"
"3102","intermediaries may require their clients to meet different"
"3103","subsequent purchase requirements."
"3104","    If you sell C, or in certain cases, A Class shares, you may pay"
"3105","a sales charge, depending on how long you have held your shares."
"3106","Redemption proceeds will be calculated using the net asset value"
"3107","(NAV) next determined after we receive a transaction request in good order."
"3108","    A fund&#146;s net asset value, or NAV, is the price of the fund&#146;s shares."
"3109","    However, we reserve the right to delay delivery of redemption"
"3110","proceeds up to seven days. For example, each time a shareholder makes"
"3111","an investment with American Century, there is a seven-day holding"
"3112","period before we will release redemption proceeds from those shares,"
"3113","unless a shareholder provides us with satisfactory proof that the"
"3114","purchase funds have cleared.  For funds with CheckWriting privileges,"
"3115","we will not honor checks written against shares subject to this seven-day"
"3116","holding period. Investments by wire generally require only a one-day"
"3117","holding period. If you change your address, we may require that any"
"3118","redemption request made within 15 days be submitted in writing and be"
"3119","signed by all authorized signers with their signatures guaranteed."
"3120","If you change your bank information, we may impose a 15-day holding"
"3121","period before we will transfer or wire redemption proceeds to your bank."
"3122","Please remember, if you request redemptions by wire, $10 will be"
"3123","deducted from the amount redeemed. Your bank also may charge a fee."
"3124","In addition, we reserve the right to honor certain redemptions with"
"3125","securities, rather than cash."
"3126","    If, during any 90-day period, a shareholder redeems fund shares"
"3127","worth more than $250,000 (or 1% of the value of a fund&#146;s assets if"
"3128","that amount is less than $250,000), we reserve the right to pay part"
"3129","or all of the redemption proceeds in excess of this amount in readily"
"3130","marketable securities instead of in cash. The portfolio managers"
"3131","would select these securities from the fund&#146;s portfolio."
"3132","    We will value these securities in the same manner as we do in"
"3133","computing the fund&#146;s net asset value. We may provide these securities"
"3134","in lieu of cash without prior notice. Also, if payment is made in"
"3135","securities, the shareholder may have to pay brokerage or other"
"3136","transaction costs to convert the securities to cash."
"3137","    If the redemption would exceed this limit and the shareholder"
"3138","would like to avoid being paid in securities, please provide us"
"3139","with an unconditional instruction to redeem at least 15 days"
"3140","prior to the date on which the redemption transaction is to occur."
"3141","The instruction must specify the dollar amount or number of shares"
"3142","to be redeemed and the date of the transaction. This minimizes the"
"3143","effect of the redemption on a fund and its remaining investors."
"3144","    If the shareholder&#146;s account balance falls below the minimum"
"3145","initial investment amount for any reason, American Century Investments"
"3146","reserves the right to redeem the shares in the account and send"
"3147","the proceeds to your address of record. Prior to doing so, we will notify"
"3148","the shareholder and give him/her 60 days to meet the minimum. Please"
"3149","note that shares redeemed in this manner may be subject to a sales"
"3150","charge if held less than the applicable time period.  The shareholder"
"3151","also may incur tax liability as a result of the redemption.  For"
"3152","Institutional Class shares, we reserve the right to convert the"
"3153","shareholder&#146;s shares to Investor Class shares of the same fund. The"
"3154","Investor Class shares have a unified management fee that is 0.20%"
"3155","higher than the Institutional Class."
"3156","    Within 90 days of a redemption of any A Class shares, you may"
"3157","reinvest all of the redemption proceeds in A Class shares of any"
"3158","American Century Investments fund at the then-current net asset"
"3159","value without paying an initial sales charge. At your request, any CDSC"
"3160","you paid on an A Class redemption that you are reinvesting will be"
"3161","credited to your account. You or your financial professional must"
"3162","notify the fund&#146;s transfer agent in writing at the time of the"
"3163","reinvestment to take advantage of this privilege, and you may use"
"3164","it only once per account. This privilege applies only if the"
"3165","new account is owned by the original account owner."
"3166","You may exchange shares of the fund for shares of the same"
"3167","class of another American Century fund without a sales charge"
"3168","if you meet the following criteria:"
"3169","&#149; The exchange is for a minimum of $100"
"3170","&#149; For an exchange that opens a new account, the amount"
"3171","of the exchange must meet or exceed the minimum account"
"3172","size requirement for the fund receiving the exchange"
"3173","For purposes of computing any applicable CDSC on shares that"
"3174","have been exchanged, the holding period will begin as of the date"
"3175","of purchase of the original fund owned. Exchanges from"
"3176","a money market fund are subject to a sales charge on the fund"
"3177","being purchased, unless the money market fund shares were"
"3178","acquired by exchange from a fund with a sales charge or by"
"3179","reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions."
"3180","A signature guarantee - which is different from a notarized"
"3181","signature - is a warranty that the signature presented is"
"3182","genuine. We may require a signature guarantee for the following"
"3183","transactions."
"3184","&#149; You have chosen to conduct business in writing only"
"3185","and would like to redeem over $100,000."
"3186","&#149; Your redemption or distribution check or automatic"
"3187","redemption is made payable to someone other than the"
"3188","account owners."
"3189","&#149; Your redemption proceeds or distribution amount is"
"3190","sent by EFT (ACH or wire) to a destination other than"
"3191","your personal bank account."
"3192","&#149; You are transferring ownership of an account"
"3193","over $100,000."
"3194","&#149; You change your address and request a redemption"
"3195","over $100,000 within 15 days."
"3196","&#149; You change your bank information and request"
"3197","a redemption within 15 days."
"3198","We reserve the right to require a signature"
"3199","guarantee for other transactions, at our discretion."
"3200","Investment instructions are irrevocable."
"3201","That means that once you have mailed or otherwise transmitted"
"3202","your investment instruction, you may not modify or cancel it."
"3203","Each fund reserves the right to suspend the offering of shares"
"3204","for a period of time and to"
"3205","reject any specific investment (including a purchase by"
"3206","exchange). Additionally, we may refuse a purchase if,"
"3207","in our judgment, it is of a size that would disrupt the"
"3208","management of a fund."
"3209","We reserve the right to change any stated investment requirement,"
"3210","including those that relate to purchases, exchanges and redemptions."
"3211","We also may alter, add or discontinue any service or privilege."
"3212","Changes may affect all investors or only those in certain classes"
"3213","or groups. In addition, from time to time we may waive a policy"
"3214","on a case-by-case basis, as the advisor deems appropriate."

"4984","3.	Board Supervision.  All of the functions undertaken by the"
"4985","Investment Manager hereunder shall at all times be subject to the direction"
"4986","of the Board of Directors, its executive committee, or any committee or"
"4987","officers of the Company acting under the authority of the Board of Directors."
"4988","4.	Payment of Expenses.  The Investment Manager will pay all of the"
"4989","expenses of each class of each Fund, other than interest, taxes, brokerage"
"4990","commissions, extraordinary expenses, the fees and expenses of the Independent"
"4991","Directors (including counsel fees), and expenses incurred in connection with"

"5001","5.	Account Fees.  The Company, by resolution of the Board of Directors,"
"5002","including a majority of the Independent Directors, may from time to time"
"5003","authorize the imposition of a fee as a direct charge against shareholder"
"5004","accounts of any class of one or more of the Funds, such fee to be retained"
"5005","by the Company or to be paid to the Investment Manager to defray expenses"
"5006","which would otherwise be paid by the Investment Manager in accordance with"
"5007","the provisions of paragraph 4 of this Agreement.  At least sixty days prior"
"5008","written notice of the intent to impose such fee must be given to the"
"5009","shareholders of the affected Fund or Fund class."
"5010","6.	Management Fees."
"5011","(a)	In consideration of the services provided by the Investment Manager,"
"5012","each class of each Fund shall pay to the Investment Manager a management fee"
"5013","that is calculated as described in this Section 6 using the fee schedules set"
"5014","forth on Schedule A."
"5015","(b)	Definitions"
"5016","(1)	An &#147;Investment Team&#148; is the Portfolio Managers that the Investment"
"5017","Manager has designated to manage a given portfolio."
"5018","(2)	An &#147;Investment Strategy&#148; is the processes and policies implemented"
"5019","by the Investment Manager for pursuing a particular investment objective"
"5020","managed by an Investment Team."
"5021","(3)	A &#147;Primary Strategy Portfolio&#148; is each Fund, as well as any other"
"5022","series of any other registered investment company for which the Investment"
"5023","Manager, or an affiliated investment advisor, serves as the investment"
"5024","manager and for which American Century Investment Services, Inc. serves"
"5025","as the distributor."
"5026","(4)	A &#147;Secondary Strategy Portfolio&#148; of a Fund is another account"
"5027","managed by the Investment Manager that is managed by the same Investment"
"5028","Team but is not a Primary Strategy Portfolio."
"5029","(5)	The &#147;Secondary Strategy Share Ratio&#148; of a Fund is calculated by"
"5030","dividing the net assets of the Fund by the sum of the net assets of the"
"5031","Primary Strategy Portfolios that share a common Investment Strategy."
"5032","(6)	The &#147;Secondary Strategy Assets&#148; of a Fund is the sum of the net"
"5033","assets of the Fund&#146;s Secondary Strategy Portfolios multiplied by the Fund&#146;s"
"5034","Secondary Strategy Share Ratio."
"5035","(7)	The &#147;Investment Strategy Assets&#148; of a Fund is the sum of the net"
"5036","assets of the Fund and the Fund&#146;s Secondary Strategy Assets."
"5037","(8)	The &#147;Per Annum Fee Dollar Amount&#148; is the dollar amount resulting"
"5038","from applying the applicable Fee Schedule for a class of a Fund using the"
"5039","Investment Strategy Assets."
"5040","(9)	The &#147;Per Annum Fee Rate&#148; for a class of a Fund is the percentage"
"5041","rate that results from dividing the Per Annum Fee Dollar Amount for the"
"5042","class of a Fund by the Investment Strategy Assets of the Fund."
"5043","(c)	Daily Management Fee Calculation. For each calendar day, each"
"5044","class of each Fund shall accrue a fee calculated by multiplying the Per"
"5045","Annum Fee Rate for that class by the net assets of the class on that day,"
"5046","and further dividing that product by 365 (366 in leap years)."
"5047","(d)	Monthly Management Fee Payment. On the first business day of each"
"5048","month, each class of each Fund shall pay the management fee to the"
"5049","Investment Manager for the previous month.  The fee for the previous"
"5050","month shall be the sum of the Daily Management Fee Calculations"
"5051","for each calendar day in the previous month."
"5052","(e)	Additional Series or Classes. In the event that the Board of"
"5053","Directors shall determine to issue any additional series or classes of"
"5054","shares for which it is proposed that the Investment Manager serve as"
"5055","investment manager, the Company and the Investment Manager may enter"
"5056","into an Addendum to this Agreement setting forth the name of the series"
"5057","and/or class, the Fee Schedule for each and such other terms and"
"5058","conditions as are applicable to the management of such series and/or"
"5059","classes, or, in the alternative, enter into a separate management agreement"
"5060","that relates specifically to such series and/or classes of shares."
"5061","7.	Subcontracts.  In rendering the services to be provided pursuant to"
"5062","this Agreement, the Investment Manager may, from time to time, engage or"
"5063","associate itself with such persons or entities as it determines is"
"5064","necessary or convenient in its sole discretion and may"
