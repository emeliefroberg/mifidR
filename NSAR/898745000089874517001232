"6159","Agreement. The Series understands it will be"
"6160","bound by the terms of agreements executed by the"
"6161","Sub-Advisor on the Series' behalf to the same"
"6162","extent as if the Series had executed such"
"6163","agreement directly.  Under most such agreements,"
"6164","subject to applicable rules, regulations, orders and"
"6165","rulings (including Securities and Exchange"
"6166","Commission No-Action Letters),  a broker-dealer"
"6167","is generally granted a lien on, and a right to set off"
"6168","against, any of the Series' assets managed by the"
"6169","Sub-Advisor held at an exchange or at the"
"6170","custodian of the Series, in order to satisfy any"
"6171","indebtedness arising out of the trading activity, and"

"6175","dealer including any debit balances, losses or other"
"6176","amounts due as a result of the Sub-Advisor's"
"6177","trading on the Series' behalf, including"
"6178","commissions.  Notwithstanding anything to the"
"6179","contrary in this Agreement, except as otherwise"
"6180","specified by notice from the Series to the Sub-"
"6181","Advisor, the Sub-Advisor may establish accounts in"
"6182","the name of the Series and place orders for the"
"6183","execution of transactions in accordance with the"
"6184","investment guidelines hereunder with or through"
"6185","any broker-dealer that the Sub-Advisor may select"
"6186","in its own discretion and without notice to the"
"6187","Series.  Such broker-dealers are authorized to act"
"6188","on instructions from the Sub-Advisor, including, but"
"6189","not limited to instructions with respect to"
"6190","transferring money, securities or other property"
"6191","between accounts held by such broker-dealer or"
"6192","elsewhere on behalf of the Series and to instruct"
"6193","the receipt or delivery of securities or property on"
"6194","behalf of the Series. Broker-dealers may rely on"
"6195","instructions from the Sub-Advisor until they have"
"6196","received written notice of Series' revocation,"
"6197","provided, however, that such revocation shall not"
"6198","be effective with respect to open positions or"
"6199","outstanding orders submitted by the Sub-Advisor"
"6200","but not yet executed."
"6201","(j)	Open accounts with Foreign Account Tax"
"6202","Compliance Act compliant broker-dealers and"
"6203","futures commission merchants (broker-dealers),"
"6204","select broker-dealers to effect all transactions for"
"6205","each Series, place all necessary orders with"
"6206","broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated"
"6207","broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if"
"6208","applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable"
"6209","law, purchase or sell orders for each Series may be"
"6210","aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell"
"6211","orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such"
"6212","event allocation of securities and/or instruments so"
"6213","sold or purchased, as well as the expenses"
"6214","incurred in the transaction, will be made by the"
"6215","Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor"
"6216","considers to be the most equitable and consistent"
"6217","with its fiduciary obligations to the Series and to"
"6218","other clients.  The Manager recognizes that, in"
"6219","some cases, this procedure may limit the size of"
"6220","the position that may be acquired or sold for the"
"6221","Series. The Sub-Advisor will report on such"
"6222","allocations at the reasonable request of the"
"6223","Manager, the Fund or the Fund's Board of"
"6224","Directors. The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts"
"6225","to obtain execution of transactions for each Series"
"6226","at prices which are advantageous to the Series and"
"6227","at commission rates that are reasonable in relation"
"6228","to the benefits received. However, the Sub-Advisor"
"6229","may select brokers or dealers on the basis that they"
"6230","provide brokerage, research or other services or"
"6231","products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent"
"6232","consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor"
"6233","may pay a broker or dealer an amount of"
"6234","commission for effecting a securities transaction in"
"6235","excess of the amount of commission or dealer"
"6236","spread another broker or dealer would have"
"6237","charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-"
"6238","Advisor determines in good faith that such amount"
"6239","of commission is reasonable in relation to the value"
"6240","of the brokerage and research products and/or"
"6241","services provided by such broker or dealer. This"
"6242","determination, with respect to brokerage and"
"6243","research products and/or services, may be viewed"
"6244","in terms of either that particular transaction or the"
"6245","overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and"
"6246","its affiliates have with respect to each Series as"
"6247","well as to accounts over which they exercise"
"6248","investment discretion. Not all such services or"
"6249","products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in"
"6250","managing the Allocated Assets. In addition, joint"
"6251","repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized"
"6252","by the Series except to the extent permitted under"
"6253","any exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor"
"6254","provided that all conditions of such order are"
"6255","complied with."

Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the"
"6261","Fund and the Manager with such periodic and"
"6262","special reports as the Fund or the Manager may"
"6263","reasonably request. In compliance with the"
"6264","requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the"
"6265","Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it"
"6266","maintains for each Series are the property of the"
"6267","Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described"
"6268","by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that"
"6269","it maintains for the Series and that are required to"
"6270","be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act,"
"6271","and further agrees to surrender as soon as"
"6272","reasonably practicable to the Fund any records that"
"6273","it maintains for a Series upon request by the Fund"
"6274","or the Manager. The Sub-Advisor has no"
"6275","responsibility for the maintenance of Fund records"
"6276","except insofar as is directly related to the services"
"6277","the Sub-Advisor provides to a Series."

"6279","1940 Act and the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics"

"6403","Agreement or as a result of the failure by the Manager or"
"6404","any of its affiliates to comply with the terms of this"
"6405","Agreement, except for losses resulting from willful"
"6406","misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of, or from"
"6407","reckless disregard of, the duties of the Sub-Advisor or any"
"6408","of its directors, officers, employees, agents, or affiliates."
"6409","For the avoidance of doubt, any broker, dealer,"
"6410","counterparty or other entity through which Series trades"
"6411","are executed shall not be considered the agent or delegate"
"6412","of the Sub-Advisor."
"6413","6.	Trade Errors"
"6414","The Sub-Advisor will notify the Manager of any Trade"
"6415","Error(s) (as defined below) resulting in discernable net"
"6416","realized losses to the Series, regardless of materiality, as"
"6417","soon as reasonably practicable upon the discovery such"
"6418","Trade Error(s) by the Sub-Advisor. Notwithstanding"
"6419","Section 5, the Sub-Advisor shall be liable for any"
"6420","discernable net realized loss suffered by the Series"
"6421","resulting from Trade Errors due to negligence,"
"6422","misfeasance, or disregard of duties of the Sub Advisor or"
"6423","any of its directors, officers, employees, agents (excluding"
"6424","any broker-dealer selected by the Sub-Advisor), or"
"6425","affiliates. For purposes under this Section 6, Trade Errors"
"6426","are defined as errors due to (i) erroneous orders by the"
"6427","Sub-Advisor for the Series that result in the purchase or"
"6428","sale of securities that were not intended to be purchased"
"6429","or sold; (ii) erroneous orders by the Sub-Advisor that result"
"6430","in the over-execution of securities for the Series; or (iii)"
"6431","purchases or sales of financial instruments by the Sub-"
"6432","Advisor that violate the investment limitations or"
"6433","restrictions disclosed in the Series' then current registration"
"6434","statement and/or imposed by applicable law or regulation"
"6435","(such limitations or restrictions calculated on the Allocated"
"6436","Assets), unless otherwise agreed to in writing.  For the"
"6437","avoidance of doubt, reimbursements under this section will"
"6438","be solely for discernable and direct net realized losses"
"6439","incurred by the Series and not for any indirect or"
"6440","consequential losses resulting from a Trade Error (i.e.,"
"6441","there will be no reimbursements by the Sub-Advisor for"
"6442","opportunity costs to the Series).  In addition,"
"6443","reimbursements under this section will be paid without"
"6444","interest or adjustment for foreign currency movements"
"6445","from the date of the reimbursable incident."
"6446","7.	Supplemental Arrangements"
"6447","The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other"
"6448","persons affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated"
"6449","third parties to better enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its"
"6450","obligations under this Agreement for the provision of"
"6451","certain personnel and facilities to the Sub-Advisor, subject"
"6452","to written notification to and approval of the Manager"
"6453","where such arrangements are material to the Sub-"
"6454","Advisor's responsibilities hereunder and, where required"
"6455","by applicable law, the Board of Directors of the Fund;"
"6456","provided, however, that entry into any such arrangements"
"6457","shall not relieve the Sub-Advisor of any of its obligations"
"6458","under this Agreement."
"6459","8.	Regulation"
"6460","The Sub-Advisor shall submit to all regulatory and"
"6461","administrative bodies having jurisdiction over the services"
"6462","provided pursuant to this Agreement and will furnish any"
"6463","Series' information, reports or other material solely in Sub-"
"6464","Advisor's possession which any such body may request or"
"6465","require pursuant to applicable laws and regulations."
"6466","9.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement"

"6485","If the shareholders of a Series fail to approve the"
"6486","Agreement or any continuance of the Agreement in"
"6487","accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act, the"
"6488","Sub-Advisor will continue to act as Sub-Advisor with"

"8300","provisions of this Section 5.1(c)(2) shall apply to"

"8319","determined by the Board of Directors as"
"8320","belonging to such series. Dividends and"
"8321","distributions may vary between the classes of a"
"8322","series to reflect differing allocations of the"
"8323","expense of each class of that series to such"
"8324","extent and for such purposes as the Board of"
"8325","Directors may deem appropriate. The Board of"
"8326","Directors shall have the power, in its sole"

"8328","dividends, including dividends designated in"
"8329","whole or in part as capital gains distributions,"

"8331","Directors, to enable the Corporation, or where"
"8332","applicable each series of shares to qualify as a"

"8334","Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or"
"8335","any successor or comparable statute thereto,"
"8336","and regulations promulgated thereunder, and to"

"8338","of shares, for Federal income and excise taxes"
"8339","in respect of that or any other year."
"8340","(4)	Liquidation. In the event of the liquidation of the"
"8341","Corporation or of the assets attributable to a"
"8342","particular series or class, the stockholders of"
"8343","each series or class that has been established"
"8344","and designated and is being liquidated shall be"
"8345","entitled to receive, as a series or class, when"
"8346","and as declared by the Board of Directors, the"
"8347","excess of the assets belonging to that series or"
"8348","class over the liabilities belonging to that series"
"8349","or class. The holders of shares of any series or"
"8350","class shall not be entitled thereby to any"
"8351","distribution upon liquidation of any other series"
"8352","or class. The assets so distributable to the"
"8353","stockholders of any particular series or class"
"8354","shall be distributed among such stockholders"
"8355","according to their respective rights taking into"
"8356","account the proper allocation of expenses being"
"8357","borne by that series or class. The liquidation of"
"8358","assets attributable to any particular series or"
"8359","class in which there are shares then outstanding"
"8360","and the termination of the series or the class"
"8361","may be authorized by vote of a majority of the"
"8362","Board of Directors then in office, without action"
"8363","or approval of the stockholders, to the extent"
"8364","consistent with applicable laws and regulations."
"8365","In the event that there are any general assets"
"8366","not belonging to any particular series or class of"
"8367","stock and available for distribution, such"
"8368","distribution shall be made to holders of stock of"
"8369","various series or classes in such proportion as"
"8370","the Board of Directors determines to be fair and"
"8371","equitable, and such determination by the Board"
"8372","of Directors shall be conclusive and binding for"
"8373","all purposes."
"8374","(5)	Redemption. All shares of stock of the"
"8375","Corporation shall be subject to the redemption,"
"8376","repurchase and conversion provisions set forth"
"8377","in Sections 5.6 through 5.11 of this Article V."
"8378","(d)	The Corporation's shares of stock are issued and"
"8379","sold, and all persons who shall acquire stock of the"
"8380","Corporation shall do so, subject to the condition and"
"8381","understanding that the provisions of the Corporation's"
"8382","Articles of Incorporation, as from time to time"
"8383","amended, shall be binding upon them."
"8384","	Section 5.2. Quorum Requirements and Voting Rights:"
"8385","Except as otherwise expressly provided by the Maryland General"
"8386","Corporation Law, the presence in person or by proxy of the"
"8387","holders of one-third of the shares of capital stock of the"
"8388","Corporation outstanding and entitled to vote thereat shall"
"8389","constitute a quorum at any meeting of the stockholders, except"
"8390","that where the holders of any series or class are required or"
"8391","permitted to vote as a series or class, one-third of the aggregate"
"8392","number of shares of that series or class outstanding and entitled"
"8393","to vote shall constitute a quorum."
"8394","	Notwithstanding any provision of Maryland General"
"8395","Corporation Law requiring a greater proportion than a majority of"
"8396","the votes of all series or classes or of any series or class of the"
"8397","Corporation's stock entitled to be cast in order to take or authorize"
"8398","any action, any such action may be taken or authorized upon the"
"8399","concurrence of a majority of the aggregate number of votes"
"8400","entitled to be cast thereon subject to applicable laws and"
"8401","regulations. All shares of stock of this Corporation shall have the"
"8402","voting rights provided for in Section 5.1(b) of this Article V."
"8403","	The Board of Directors from time to time, subject to such"
"8404","procedures as may be adopted by the Board of Directors, and"
"8405","consistent with applicable laws and regulations, may authorize the"
"8406","holders of shares of any series or class to take action or consent"
"8407","to any action by delivering a consent, in writing or by electronic"
"8408","transmission, of the holders entitled to cast not less than the"
"8409","minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or"
"8410","take the action at a meeting of the holders of shares of such"

"10354","entitled to receive, as a series or class, when"
"10355","and as declared by the Board of Directors, the"
"10356","excess of the assets belonging to that series or"
"10357","class over the liabilities belonging to that series"

"10359","class shall not be entitled thereby to any"

"10363","shall be distributed among such stockholders"
"10364","according to their respective rights taking into"

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to each
Fund of the Principal  Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end management
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the 1940 Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it with
portfolio selection and related research and statistical services in
connection with the investment advisory services for each series identified
in Appendix A ( hereinafter called the Series), which the Manager has
agreed to provide to the Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to furnish such
services; and

WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies
properly certified or authenticated of each of the following and will promptly
provide the Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or authenticated of
any amendment or supplement thereto:

 	(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement)
with the Fund;

 	(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements
as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

 	(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the
Board of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and services
provided by the Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the
Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the services
described in Section 2 below for investment and reinvestment of
the securities and other assets of the Series, subject to the control
and direction of the Manager and the Fund's Board of Directors, for
the period and on the terms hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor
accepts such appointment and agrees to furnish the services
hereinafter set forth for the compensation herein provided. The
Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an
independent contractor and shall, except as expressly provided or
authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the Fund or the
Manager in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund
or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

		The Sub-Advisor will:

(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited
to research, advice and supervision for the Series.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval (or
any appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from
time to time as economic conditions require, a recommended
investment program for the Fund consistent with the Series'
investment objective and policies.

(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing
orders for the purchase and sale of securities without prior
consultation with the Manager and without regard to the length
of time the securities have been held, the resulting rate of
portfolio turnover or any tax considerations, subject always to
the provisions of the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws, the requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the
same shall be from time to time in effect.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the
officers, in taking such steps as are reasonably necessary or
appropriate to carry out the decisions of its Board of Directors,
and any appropriate committees of such Board, regarding the
general conduct of the investment business of the Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment
advisory services provided to the Series, its compliance with
the 1940 Act and the regulations adopted by the Securities
and Exchange Commission thereunder and the Series'
investment strategies and restrictions as stated in the Fund's
prospectus and statement of additional information, subject to
receipt of such additional information as may be required from
the Manager and provided in accordance with Section 11(d) of
this Agreement. The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility for the
maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is directly
related to the services it provides to the Series.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and
in such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem
appropriate in order to enable it to determine that the
investment policies, procedures and approved investment
program of the Series are being observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination of the
fair value of certain securities when reliable market quotations
are not readily available for purposes of calculating net asset
value in accordance with procedures and methods established
by the Fund's Board of Directors.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and
management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other
personnel required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii)
administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical
personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct
of its duties under this Agreement.

(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission
merchants (broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect
all transactions for the Series, place all necessary orders with
broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated broker-dealers),
and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the extent
consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders for the
Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or
sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event
allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as the
expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the
Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be
the most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations
to the Fund and to other clients.  The Manager recognizes
that, in some cases, this procedure may limit the size of the
position that may be acquired or sold for the Series.  The Sub-
Advisor will report on such allocations at the request of the
Manager, the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors providing
such information as the number of aggregated trades to which
the Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such
trades were directed and the basis for the allocation for the
aggregated trades.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts
to obtain execution of transactions for the Series at prices
which are advantageous to the Series and at commission
rates that are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.
However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on
the basis that they provide brokerage, research or other
services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent
consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a
broker or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a
securities transaction in excess of the amount of commission
or dealer spread another broker or dealer would have charged
for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in
good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in
relation to the value of the brokerage and research products
and/or services provided by such broker or dealer. This
determination, with respect to brokerage and research
products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either
that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which
the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to the
Series as well as to accounts over which they exercise
investment discretion. Not all such services or products need
be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the Series. In
addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be
utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under any
exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all
conditions of such order are complied with.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the
Series as are required of an investment advisor of a registered
investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment
Advisor's Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisor's Act), and the
rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with
such periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager
may reasonably request.  In compliance with the requirements
of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby
agrees that all records that it maintains for the Series are the
property of the Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods
described by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that
it maintains for the Fund and that are required to be
maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further
agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it
maintains for the Series upon request by the Fund or the
Manager, understanding that the Sub-Advisor must keep a
copy for regulatory purposes.

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and
the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that
Rule as the same may be amended from time to time.  The
Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-Advisor's
current Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to
the Manager a copy of any material amendment to the Sub-
Advisor's Code of Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request,
furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio transactions
and reports on investments held by the Series, all in such
detail as the Manager or the Fund may reasonably request.
The Sub-Advisor will make available its officers and
employees to meet with the Fund's Board of Directors at the
Fund's principal place of business on due notice to review the
investments of the Series.

(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-
advisor and may be required for the Fund or the Manager to
comply with their respective obligations under applicable laws,
including, without limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment
Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and any rule or
regulation thereunder.  Manager acknowledges receipt of Sub-
Advisor's Form ADV more than 48 hours prior to the execution
of this Agreement.

(a)	Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies solicited
by, or with respect to, the issuers of securities held in the
Series.  The Manager shall cause to be forwarded to Sub-
Advisor all proxy solicitation materials that it receives and shall
assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to conduct the proxy voting
process.

    3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, as it relates
to the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor will not consult with any other
investment advisory firm that provides investment advisory services
to any investment company sponsored by Principal Life Insurance
Company regarding transactions for the Fund in securities or other
assets.

    4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations
assumed by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the Fund,
the Manager shall pay the compensation specified in Appendix A to
this Agreement.

    5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers,
employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager, the
Fund or its shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or
the Fund resulting from any error of judgment made in the good
faith exercise of the Sub-Advisor's duties under this Agreement or
as a result of the failure by the Manager or any of its affiliates to
comply with the terms of this Agreement except for losses resulting
from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of, or from
reckless disregard of, the duties of the Sub-Advisor or any of its
directors, officers, employees, agents (excluding any broker-dealer
selected by the Sub-Advisor), or affiliates.

    6.	Indemnification

The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Sub-
Advisor from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities or
damages (including reasonable attorneys' fees and other related
expenses), (Losses) howsoever arising, from or in connection
with this Agreement or the performance by the Sub-Advisor of its
duties hereunder, so long as the Sub-Advisor shall, after receipt of
notice of any claim or commencement of any action, promptly notify
the Manager in writing of the claim or commencement of such
action.  The Manager shall not be liable for any settlement of any
claim or action effected without its written consent.  Nothing
contained herein shall require the Manager to indemnify the Sub-
Advisor for Losses resulting from the Sub-Advisor's willful
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of
its duties or from its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties
under this Agreement.

    7.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other persons
affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third parties to
better enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations under this
Agreement for the provision of certain personnel and facilities to the
Sub- Advisor, subject to written notification to and approval of the
Manager and, where required by applicable law, the Board of
Directors of the Fund.

    8.	Regulation

The Sub-Advisor shall submit to all regulatory and administrative
bodies having jurisdiction over the services provided pursuant to
this Agreement any information, reports or other material which any
such body may request or require pursuant to applicable laws and
regulations.

    9.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement

This Agreement shall become effective as of the date of its
execution and, unless otherwise terminated, shall continue in effect
for a period of two years and thereafter from year to year provided
that the continuance is specifically approved at least annually either

Company, the Sub-Advisor or the Fund cast in person at a meeting
called for the purpose of voting on such approval.

If the shareholders of a Series fail to approve the Agreement or any
continuance of the Agreement in accordance with the requirements
of the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor will continue to act as Sub-Advisor
with respect to the Series pending the required approval of the
Agreement or its continuance or of any contract with the Sub-
Advisor or a different manager or Sub-Advisor or other definitive
action; provided, that the compensation received by the Sub-
Advisor in respect to the Series during such period is in compliance
with Rule 15a-4 under the 1940 Act.

This Agreement may be terminated at any time without the
payment of any penalty by the Board of Directors of the Fund or by
the Sub-Advisor, the Manager or by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Series on sixty days written
notice. This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event of
its assignment. In interpreting the provisions of this Section 9, the
definitions contained in Section 2(a) of the 1940 Act (particularly the
definitions of interested person, assignment and voting"
"12883","security) shall be applied.

    10.	Amendment of this Agreement

No material amendment of this Agreement shall be effective until
approved, if required by the 1940 Act or the rules, regulations,
interpretations or orders issued thereunder, by vote of the holders
of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Series and
by vote of a majority of the Board of Directors of the Fund who are
not interested persons of the Manager, the Sub-Advisor, Principal
Life Insurance Company or the Fund cast in person at a meeting
called for the purpose of voting on such approval, and such
amendment is signed by both parties.

    11.	General Provisions

(a)	Each party agrees to perform such further acts and execute
such further documents as are necessary to effectuate the
purposes hereof. This Agreement shall be construed and
enforced in accordance with and governed by the laws of the
State of Iowa. The captions in this Agreement are included for
convenience only and in no way define or delimit any of the
provisions hereof or otherwise affect their construction or
effect.

(b)	Any notice under this Agreement shall be in writing, addressed
and delivered or mailed postage pre-paid to the other party at
such address as such other party may designate for the
receipt of such notices. Until further notice to the other party, it
is agreed that the address of the Manager for this purpose
shall be Principal Financial Group, Des Moines, Iowa
50392-0200, and the address of the Sub-Advisor shall be 40
East 52nd Street, New York, New York, 10022.

(c)	The Sub-Advisor will promptly notify the Manager in writing of
the occurrence of any of the following events:

(1)	the Sub-Advisor fails to be registered as an investment
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act or under the
laws of any jurisdiction in which the Sub-Advisor is
required to be registered as an investment advisor in order
to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

(2)	the Sub-Advisor is served or otherwise receives notice of
any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, at law
or in equity, before or by any court, public board or body,
involving the affairs of the Fund.

(d)	The Manager shall provide (or cause the Series custodian to
provide) timely information to the Sub-Advisor regarding such
matters as the composition of the assets of the Series, cash
requirements and cash available for investment in the Series,
and all other reasonable information as may be necessary for
the Sub-Advisor to perform its duties and responsibilities
hereunder.

(e) 	The Sub-Advisor represents that it will not enter into any
agreement, oral or written, or other understanding under which
the Fund directs or is expected to direct portfolio securities
transactions, or any remuneration, to a broker or dealer in
consideration for the promotion or sale of Fund shares or
shares issued by any other registered investment company.
Sub-advisor further represents that it is contrary to the Sub-
advisor's policies to permit those who select brokers or dealers
for execution of fund portfolio securities transactions to take
into account the broker or dealer's promotion or sale of Fund
shares or shares issued by any other registered investment
company.

(f)  The Sub-Advisor agrees that neither it nor any of its affiliates
will in any way refer directly or indirectly to its relationship with
the Fund, the Series, or the Manager or any of their respective
affiliates in offering, marketing or other promotional materials
without the express written consent of the Manager.
(g)	This Agreement contains the entire understanding and
agreement of the parties.

    12.	The Sub-Advisor acknowledges Manager's representation that the
Diversified Real Asset Fund series does not rely on the exclusion from the
definition of commodity pool operator under Section 4.5 of the General
Regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA).

    The Sub-Advisor represents that it is a commodity trading advisor duly
registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and is a
member in good standing of the National Futures Association (the NFA) or
is relying on an exemption from registration as a commodity trading advisor.
As applicable, the Sub-Advisor shall maintain such registration and
membership in good standing or continue to qualify for an exemption from
registration as a commodity trading advisor during the term of this
Agreement. Further, the Sub-Advisor agrees to notify the Manager within a
commercially reasonable time upon (i) a statutory disqualification  of the
Sub-Advisor under Sections 8a(2) or 8a(3) of the CEA, (ii) a suspension,
revocation or limitation of the Sub-Advisor's commodity trading advisor
registration or NFA membership,  or (iii) the institution of an action or
proceeding that would reasonably be expected to lead to a statutory
disqualification under the CEA or an investigation by any governmental
agency or self-regulatory organization relating to Sub-Advisor's registration
as a commodity trading advisor,  in each case, subject to applicable law,
attorney-client privilege and confidentiality  restrictions.

    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have duly executed this
Agreement on the date first above written.

"12974","observed."
"12975","(vii)	Upon request, provide reasonable assistance in the"
"12976","determination of the fair value of certain securities when"
"12977","reliable market quotations are not readily available for"
"12978","purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance"
"12979","with procedures and methods established by the Board"
"12980","of Directors."
"12981","(viii)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment"
"12982","and management facilities, including salaries of clerical"
"12983","and other personnel required for it to execute its duties"
"12984","faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including"
"12985","bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment"
"12986","necessary for the efficient conduct of its duties under this"
"12987","Agreement."
"12988","(ix)	Open accounts with broker-dealers,  futures commission"
"12989","merchants, banks and other financial institutions"
"12990","(collectively broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to"
"12991","effect all transactions for the Series, place all necessary"
"12992","orders with broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated"
"12993","broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if"
"12994","applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law,"
"12995","purchase or sell orders for the Series may be"
"12996","aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell"
"12997","orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event"
"12998","allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as"
"12999","the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by"
"13000","the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor"
"13001","considers to be the most equitable and consistent with"
"13002","its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients"
"13003","of the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates over time.  The"
"13004","Manager recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure"
"13005","may limit the size of the position that may be acquired or"
"13006","sold for the Series and that aggregation of orders may"
"13007","not result in more favorable pricing or lower brokerage"
"13008","commissions in all instances. At the Manager's request,"
"13009","the Sub-Advisor will provide the Manager with the"
"13010","information required pursuant to Rule 31a-1(b)(9) of the"
"13011","1940 Act.   The Sub-Advisor will effect transactions with"
"13012","those broker-dealers which it believes provide favorable"
"13013","net prices and are capable of providing efficient"
"13014","executions, taking into consideration, among other"
"13015","things, order size, difficulty of execution, the operational"
"13016","capabilities, facilities and financial condition of the"
"13017","broker-dealer involved, whether that broker-dealer has"
"13018","risked its own capital in positioning a block of securities"
"13019","or other assets, and the prior experience of the broker-"
"13020","dealer in effecting transactions of the relevant types. The"
"13021","Sub-Advisor's primary objective will be to obtain best"
"13022","execution with respect to all transactions for the Series."
"13023","However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers-dealers"
"13024","on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or"
"13025","other services or products to the Sub-Advisor or its"
"13026","affiliates. To the extent consistent with applicable law,"
"13027","the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount"
"13028","of commission for effecting a securities transaction in"
"13029","excess of the amount of commission or dealer spread"
"13030","another broker- dealer would have charged for effecting"
"13031","that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good"
"13032","faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in"
"13033","relation to the value of the brokerage and research"
"13034","products and/or services provided by such broker-"
"13035","dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage"
"13036","and research products and/or services, may be viewed"
"13037","in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"13038","responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates"
"13039","have with respect to the Series and other accounts over"
"13040","which they exercise investment discretion. Not all such"
"13041","services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in"
"13042","managing the Series. In addition, joint repurchase or"
"13043","other accounts may not be utilized by the Series except"
"13044","to the extent permitted under any exemptive order"
"13045","obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions"
"13046","of such order are complied with."
"13047","(x)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to"
"13048","the Series as are required of an investment adviser of a"
"13049","registered investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act"

"13052","thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with"
"13053","such periodic and special reports as the Fund or"

"13056","Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it"
"13057","maintains for the Series are the property of the Fund,"
"13058","agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule"
"13059","31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains"
"13060","for the Fund and that are required to be maintained by"
"13061","Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to"
"13062","surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it"
"13063","maintains for the Series upon request by the Fund or the"
"13064","Manager. The Sub-Advisor may retain copies of any"
"13065","such records."
"13066","(xi)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act"
"13067","and the Sub-Advisor's code of ethics (the Code of
Ethics) adopted pursuant to Rule 17j-1 as the same"
"13068","may be amended from time to time.  The Manager"
"13069","acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-Advisor's current"
"13070","Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to"
"13071","the Manager a copy of any material amendment to the"
"13072","Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics."
"13073","(xii)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may"
"13074","request, furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio"
"13075","transactions and reports on investments held by the"
"13076","Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the Fund"
"13077","may reasonably request.  The Sub-Advisor will make"
"13078","available its personnel to meet with the Fund's Board of"
"13079","Directors at the Fund's principal place of business on"
"13080","reasonable prior notice to review the investments of the"
"13081","Series."
"13082","(xiii)	Provide such additional information in the possession of"
"13083","the Sub-Advisor or its affiliates may be required for the"
"13084","Fund or the Manager to comply with their respective"
"13085","obligations under applicable laws, including, without"
"13086","limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"

"13088","Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended"

"13093","Executive Officer) within a reasonable time after any"

"13101","Manager. The Sub-Advisor's obligations in the previous"
"13102","sentence are contingent upon its timely receipt of such"

"13104","Manager shall cause to be forwarded to Sub-Advisor all"
"13105","proxy solicitation materials that it receives and shall"

"13692","of and for the period ended August 31, 2017, in accordance with"
"13693","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"13694","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"13695","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"13696","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"13697","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"13698","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"13699","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"13700","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"13701","opinion."
"13702","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"13703","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"13704","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"13705","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"13706","related costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"13707","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"13708","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"13709","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"13710","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"13711","company's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"13712","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"13713","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"13714","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"13715","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"13716","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"13717","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that"
"13718","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"13719","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"13720","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"13721","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"13722","disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect"
"13723","on the financial statements."
"13724","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"13725","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"13726","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"13727","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"13728","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"13729","deteriorate."
"13730","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"13731","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"13732","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"13733","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"13734","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"13735","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"13736","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"13737","the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"13738","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"13739","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"13740","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"13741","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"13742","internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"13743","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"13744","(United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"13745","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"13746","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"13747","be a material weakness as defined above as of August 31, 2017."
"13748","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"13749","management and the Board of Directors of the Funds and the"

"14409","transactions for the Series, place all necessary orders with"
"14410","broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated broker-"
"14411","dealers), and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the"

"14413","orders for the Series may be aggregated with"
"14414","contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of other clients"
"14415","of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation of securities"
"14416","or swaps so sold or purchased, as well as the expenses"
"14417","incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Sub-Advisor"
"14418","in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the most"

"14420","Fund and to other clients. The Sub-Advisor will report on"
"14421","such allocations at the request of the Manager, the Fund"
"14422","or the Fund's Board of Directors providing such"
"14423","information as the number of aggregated trades to which"
"14424","the Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such"
"14425","trades were directed and the basis for the allocation for"
"14426","the aggregated trades. The Sub-Advisor shall use its best"
"14427","efforts to obtain execution of transactions for the Series at"
"14428","prices which are advantageous to the Series and at"
"14429","commission rates that are reasonable in relation to the"
"14430","benefits received. However, the Sub-Advisor may select"
"14431","brokers or dealers on the basis that they provide"
"14432","brokerage, research or other services or products to the"
"14433","Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable law,"
"14434","the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of"
"14435","commission for effecting a securities or derivatives"
"14436","transaction in excess of the amount of commission or"
"14437","dealer spread another broker or dealer would have"
"14438","charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor"
"14439","determines in good faith that such amount of commission is"
"14440","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"14441","research products and/or services provided by such"
"14442","broker or dealer. This determination, with respect to"
"14443","brokerage and research products and/or services, may be"
"14444","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the"
"14445","overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its"
"14446","affiliates have with respect to the Series as well as to"
"14447","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion."
"14448","Not all such services or products need be used by the"
"14449","Sub-Advisor in managing the Series. In addition, joint"
"14450","repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized by the"
"14451","Series except to the extent permitted under any"
"14452","exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that"
"14453","all conditions of such order are complied with."

"14474","and the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to"
"14475","that Rule as the same may be amended from time to"

"14502","might not be in compliance in the future. If it is determined"
"14503","that the Series is not in compliance with the"
"14504","requirements noted above, the Sub-Advisor, in"
"14505","consultation with the Manager, will take prompt action"
"14506","to bring the Series back into compliance (to the extent"
"14507","possible) within the time permitted under the Code."

an open-end management investment company registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
1940 Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor
to furnish it with the investment advisory services for a
certain designated portion of the assets in each series
identified in Appendix A (hereinafter called the Series),
which the Manager has agreed to provide to the Fund, and
the Sub-Advisor desires to furnish such services with respect to
such assets; and

WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with

as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;
(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;
(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved
by the Board of Directors of the Fund relating to
obligations and services provided by the Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as
follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

Agreement, the Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor
to perform the services described in Section 2 below for
investment and reinvestment of such portion of the
assets of each Series as may be allocated to the Sub-
Advisor by the Manager, from time to time (the
Allocated Assets), subject to the control and direction of
the Manager and the Fund's Board of Directors, for the
period and on the terms hereinafter set forth. The
Manager grants the Sub-Advisor full discretion to perform
such services. The Sub-Advisor accepts such
appointment and agrees to furnish the services hereinafter
set forth for the compensation herein provided. The Sub-
Advisor shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an
independent contractor and shall, except as expressly
provided or authorized, have no authority to act for or
represent the Fund or the Manager in any way or
otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or the
Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services
to be Provided by the Sub-
Advisor The Sub-Advisor will:
(a)	Provide investment advisory services relating to the
assets allocated to it.


(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for
approval (or any appropriate committee of such Board),
and revise from time to time as economic conditions
require, a recommended investment program for the
Fund consistent with the Series' investment objective and
policies,,
(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing
discretionary orders for the purchase and sale of
securities without prior consultation with the Manager and
without regard to the length of time the securities have
been held, the resulting rate of portfolio turnover or any
tax considerations, subject always to the provisions of
the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, the
requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same shall
be from time to time in effect.
(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested
by the officers, in taking such steps as are reasonably
necessary or appropriate to carry out the decisions of its
Board of Directors, and any appropriate committees of
such Board, regarding the general conduct of the
investment business of the Series.
(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment
advisory services provided to the Series, its compliance
with the 1940 Act and the regulations adopted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder and the
Series' investment strategies and restrictions as stated in
the Fund's prospectus and statement of additional
information as such statement may be amended from time
to time, subject to receipt of such additional information
as may be required from the Manager and provided in
accordance with Section 11(d) of this  Agreement. The
Sub-Advisor has no responsibility for the maintenance of
Fund records except insofar as is directly related to the
services it provides to the Series.
(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such
times and in such detail as the Board of Directors may
reasonably deem appropriate in order to enable it to
determine that the investment policies, procedures and
approved investment program of the Series are being
observed.
(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination of
the fair value of certain securities when reliable market
quotations are not readily available for purposes of
calculating net asset value in accordance with procedures
and methods established by the Fund's Board of Directors.
(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment
and management facilities, including salaries of clerical
and other personnel required for it to execute its duties
faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including
bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment necessary
for the efficient conduct of its duties under this Agreement.
(i)	Select broker-dealers, banks, loan traders and futures
commission merchants (broker- dealers), to effect all
transactions for the Series, place all necessary orders
with broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated
broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if
applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law,
purchase or sell orders for the Series may be aggregated
with contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of other
clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation of
securities so sold or purchased, as well as the expenses
incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Sub-
Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be
the most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Fund and to other clients. The Manager
recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure may limit
the size of the position that may be acquired or sold for
the Series. The Sub-Advisor will report on such
allocations at the request of the Manager, the Fund or the
Fund's Board of Directors providing such information as
the number of aggregated trades to which the Series
was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades
were directed and the basis for the allocation for the
aggregated trades.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best
efforts to obtain execution of


transactions for the Series at prices in accordance with its
duty of best execution and at commission rates that are
reasonable in relation to the benefits received. However,
the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the
basis that they provide brokerage, research or other
services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent
consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a
broker or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a
securities transaction in excess of the amount of
commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer
would have charged for effecting that transaction if the
Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that such amount of
commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the
brokerage and research products and/or services
provided by such broker or dealer. This determination,
with respect to brokerage and research products and/or
services, may be viewed in terms of either that particular
transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-
Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to the Series
as well as to accounts over which they exercise investment
discretion. Not all such services or products need be used
by the Sub-Advisor in managing the Series.
U) Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to
the Series as are required of an investment advisor of a
registered investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act
and Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Investment"
"14932","Advisers Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the
Fund and the Manager with such periodic and special
reports as the Fund or Manager may reasonably
request. In compliance with the requirements of Rule
31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees

Board of Directors of the Fund who are not interested
persons of the Manager, Principal Life Insurance
Company, the Sub-Advisor or the Fund cast in person at a
meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval.

If the Board of Directors or the shareholders of a Series
fail to approve the Agreement or any continuance of the
Agreement in accordance with the requirements of the
1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor will continue to act as Sub-
Advisor with respect to the Allocated Assets of such Series
pending the required approval of the Agreement or its
continuance or of any contract with the Sub-Advisor or a
different manager or Sub-Advisor or other definitive action;
provided, that the compensation received by the Sub-
Advisor in respect to the Allocated Assets of such Series
during such period is in compliance with Rule 15a-4 under
the 1940 Act.

payment of any penalty by the Board of Directors of the
Fund or by the Sub-Advisor, the Manager or by vote of a
majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Series
on sixty days written notice. This Agreement shall
automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. In
interpreting the provisions of this Section 10, the

effective date of termination will settle for the account of the
Fund. .

effective until approved, if required by the 1940 Act or the
rules, regulations, interpretations or orders issued
thereunder, by vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Series and by vote of a
majority of the Board of Directors of the Fund who are not

"15067","report on such allocations at the request of the"
"15068","Manager, the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors"

"15085","charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor"
"15086","determines in good faith that such amount of commission"
"15087","is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage"
"15088","and research products and/or services provided by such"
"15089","broker or dealer. This determination, with respect to"
"15090","brokerage and research products and/or services, may"
"15091","be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or"
"15092","the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its"
"15093","affiliates have with respect to the Series as well as to"

receipt of such additional information as may be required from
the Manager and provided in accordance with Section 11(d) of
this Agreement. The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility for the
maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is directly
related to the services it provides to the Series.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and
in such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem
appropriate in order to enable it to determine that the
investment policies, procedures and approved investment
program of the Series are being observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination of
the fair value of certain securities when reliable market
quotations are not readily available for purposes of
calculating net asset value in accordance with procedures
and methods established by the Fund's Board of Directors.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and
management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other
personnel required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and
(ii) administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical
personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct
of its duties under this Agreement.

(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission
merchants (broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect
all transactions for the Series, place all necessary orders with
broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated broker-dealers),
and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the extent
consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders for the
Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase
or sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such
event allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as
the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the
Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be
the most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations
to the Fund and to other clients. The Manager recognizes
that, in some cases, this procedure may limit the size of the
position that may be acquired or sold for the Series. The
Sub-Advisor will report on such allocations at the request of
the Manager, the Fund or the Fund's Board of .Directors
providing such information as the number of aggregated
trades to which the Series was a party, the broker-dealers to
whom such trades were directed and the basis for the
allocation for the aggregated trades. The Sub-Advisor shall
use its best efforts to obtain execution of transactions for the
Series at prices which are advantageous to the Series and
at commission rates that are reasonable in relation to the
benefits received. However, the Sub-Advisor may select
brokers or dealers on the basis that they provide brokerage,
research or other services or products to the Sub- Advisor.
To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor
may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission for
effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount of
commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would
have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-
Advisor determines in good faith that such amount of
commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the
brokerage and research products and/or services provided
by such broker or dealer. This determination, with respect
to brokerage and research products and/or services, may
be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the
overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates
have with respect to the Series as well as to accounts over
which they exercise investment discretion. Not all such
services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in
managing the Series. In addition, joint repurchase or other
accounts may not be utilized by the Series except to the
extent permitted under any exemptive order obtained by the
Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions of such order are
complied with.




(j)    Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the
Series as are required of an investment advisor of a registered
investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisers Act), and the
rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with
such periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager may
reasonably request. In compliance with the requirements of
Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby
agrees that all records that it maintains for the Series are the
property of the Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods
described by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that
it maintains for the Fund and that are required to be
maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further
agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it
maintains for the Series upon request by the Fund or the
Manager; provided, however, that the Sub-Advisor may retain
a copy of such records if required under applicable law.

(k)     Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and
the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that
Rule as the same may be amended from time to time. The
Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-Advisor's
current Code of Ethics. Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to
the Manager a copy of any material amendment to the Sub-
Advisor's Code of Ethics


(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may
request, furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio
transactions and reports on investments held by the Series,
all in such detail as the Manager or the Fund may
reasonably request. The Sub-Advisor will make available
its officers and employees to meet with the Fund's Board of
Directors at the Fund's principal place of business on due
notice to review the investments of the Series.

(m)	  Provide such information as is customarily provided by a
sub-advisor and may be required for the Fund or the
Manager to comply with their respective obligations
under applicable laws, including, without limitation, the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act, the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act),
and any state securities laws, and any rule or regulation
thereunder. Sub-Advisor will advise Manager of any
changes in Sub-Advisor's Senior Management (i.e. Chief
Investment Officer and Chief Executive Officer) within a
reasonable time after any such change. Manager
acknowledges receipt of Sub- Advisor's Form ADV more
than 48 hours prior to the execution of this Agreement.

(n)	Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies
solicited by, or with respect to, the issuers of securities held
in the Series. The Manager shall cause to be forwarded to
Sub-Advisor all proxy solicitation materials that it receives
and shall assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to conduct the
proxy voting process.

3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the
Sub-Advisor will not consult with any other investment
advisory firm that provides investment advisory services to any
investment company sponsored by Principal Life Insurance
Company regarding transactions for the Fund in securities or
other assets.

4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations
assumed by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the Fund,
the Manager shall pay the compensation specified in Appendix A
to this Agreement.

5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers,
employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager, the
Fund or its shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or
the Fund resulting from any error of judgment made in the good
faith exercise of the Sub-Advisor's duties under this Agreement or
as a result of the failure by the Manager or any of its affiliates to
comply with the terms of this Agreement except  for losses
resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross  negligence
of, or from reckless disregard of, the duties of the Sub-Advisor or
any of its directors, officers, employees, agents (excluding any
broker-dealer selected by the Sub-Advisor), or affiliates.

damages (including reasonable attorneys' fees and other related

duties hereunder, so long as the Sub-Advisor shall, after receipt of
notice of any claim or commencement of any action, promptly
notify the Manager in writing of the claim or commencement of
such action. The Manager shall not be liable for any settlement of
any claim or action effected without its written consent. Nothing
contained herein shall require the Manager to indemnify the Sub-
Advisor for Losses resulting from the Sub-Advisor's willful
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of
its duties or from its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties
under this Agreement.

7.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may engage any of its affiliates to assist it with
providing services under this Agreement, provided that the Sub-
Advisor will remain liable to the Manager at all times for the
performance of its obligations under the Agreement, will remain
responsible for the acts and omissions of such affiliates, and will
be solely responsible for any fees owed to such affiliates;
provided, that doing so will not involve an assignment as such
term is understood under the 1940 Act. The Sub-Advisor may also
enter into arrangements with unaffiliated third parties to better
enable 'the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations under this
Agreement for the provision of certain personnel and facilities to
the Sub- Advisor, subject to written notification to and approval of
the Manager and, where required by applicable law, the Board of
Directors of the Fund.

8.	Regulation

required to be registered as an investment advisor in
order to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

(2)	the Sub-Advisor is served or otherwise receives notice of
any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, at law

perform its duties and responsibilities hereunder.

(e)	The Sub-Advisor represents that it will not enter into any
agreement, oral or written, or other understanding under
which the Fund directs or is expected to direct portfolio
securities transactions, or any remuneration, to a broker or
dealer in consideration for the promotion or sale of Fund
shares or shares issued by any other registered investment
company. Sub-advisor further represents that it is contrary

promotion or sale of Fund shares or shares issued by any
other registered investment company.

(f)	The Sub-Advisor agrees that neither it nor any of its

its best efforts to ensure that any of its agents or affiliates

it as confidential.

(h)	This agreement contains the entire understanding and
agreement of the parties.


13.   CFTC

representation that the Global Multi-Strategy Fund
series is a commodity pool under the Commodity
Exchange Act (the CEA) and that the Manager does
not rely on the exclusion from the definition of

trading advisor duly registered with the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) and is a
member of the National Futures Association (the
NFA) or is relying on an exemption from registration

Advisor's commodity trading advisor registration or
NFA membership, or (iii) unless prohibited, the
institution of an action or proceeding that the Sub-
Advisor reasonably believes is likely to lead to a
statutory disqualification under the CEA or an
investigation involving the affairs of the Fund by the
CFTC or NFA.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF,   the parties have duly executed this
Agreement on the date first above written.

follows:

ARTICLE V
CAPITAL STOCK ALLOCATION

       Section 5.1. Authorized Shares: The total number of shares
of stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is eighty-
one billion eight hundred eighty million (81,880,000,000) shares of
stock, with a par value of one cent ($0.01) per share. The aggregate
par value of all the authorized shares is eight hundred eighteen
million eight hundred thousand dollars ($818,800,000). The shares
may be issued by the Board of Directors in such separate and distinct
series and classes of series as the Board of Directors shall from time
to time create and establish. The Board of Directors shall have full
power and authority, in its sole discretion, to establish and designate
series and classes of series, and to classify or reclassify any
unissued shares in separate series or classes having such
preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions,
limitations as to dividends, qualifications, and terms and conditions of
redemption as shall be fixed and determined from time to time by the
Board of Directors. Unless otherwise provided in these Articles of
Incorporation or by the Board of Directors when establishing a class,
each class of a series shall represent interests in the assets
belonging to that series and have identical voting, dividend,
liquidation and other rights and the same terms and conditions as any
other class of the series, except that expenses allocated to the class
of a series may be borne solely by such class as shall be determined
by the Board of Directors. Expenses related to the distribution of, and
other identified expenses that should properly be allocated to, the
shares of a particular series or class may be charged to and borne
solely by such series or class, and the bearing of expenses solely by
a series or class may be appropriately reflected (in a manner
determined by the Board of Directors) and cause differences in the
net asset value attributable to, and the dividend, redemption and

       A total of three hundred seventy-five million (375,000,000)
shares remain authorized but un-classified shares.

	In addition, the Board of Directors is hereby expressly granted
authority to change the designation of any series or class, to increase
or decrease the number of shares of any series or class, provided
that the number of authorized shares of any series or class shall not
be decreased by the Board of Directors below the number of shares
thereof then outstanding, and to reclassify any unissued shares into
one or more series or classes that may be established and
designated from time to time.

(a)	The Corporation may issue shares of stock in fractional
denominations to the same extent as its whole shares,
and shares in fractional denominations shall be shares of
stock having proportionately, to the respective fractions
represented thereby, all the rights of whole shares,
including without limitation, the right to vote, the right to
receive dividends and distributions and the right to
participate upon liquidation of the Corporation, but
excluding the right to receive a stock certificate
representing fractional shares.

(b)	The holder of each share of stock of the Corporation
shall be entitled to one vote for each full share, and a
fractional vote for each fractional share, of stock,
irrespective of the series or class, then standing in the
holder's name on the books of the Corporation. On any
matter submitted to a vote of stockholders, all shares of
the Corporation then issued and outstanding and entitled
to vote shall be voted in the aggregate and not by series
or class except that (1) when otherwise expressly
required by the Maryland General Corporation Law or
the Investment Company Act of 1940, shares shall be
voted by individual series or class, and (2) if the Board of
Directors, in its sole discretion, determines that a matter
(including an amendment to these Articles of
Incorporation) affects the interests of only one or more
particular series or class or classes then only the holders
of shares of such affected series or class or classes shall
be entitled to vote thereon.

(c)	Unless otherwise provided in the resolution of the Board
of Directors providing for the establishment and
designation of any new series or class or classes, each
series and class of stock of the Corporation shall have
the following powers, preferences and rights, and
qualifications, restrictions, and limitations thereof:

(1)	Assets Belonging to a Series. All consideration
received by the Corporation for the issue or sale of
shares of a particular series, together with all
assets in which such consideration is invested or
reinvested, all income, earnings, profits and
proceeds thereof, including any proceeds derived
from the sale, exchange or liquidation of such
assets, and any funds or payments derived from
any reinvestment of such proceeds in whatever
form the same may be, shall irrevocably belong to
that series for all purposes, subject only to the
rights of creditors, and shall be so recorded upon
the books and accounts of the Corporation. Such
consideration, assets, income, earnings, profits
and proceeds thereof, including any proceeds
derived from the sale, exchange or liquidation of
such assets, and any funds or payments derived
from any reinvestment of such proceeds, in
whatever form the same may be, together with any
General Items allocated to that series as provided
in the following sentence, are herein referred to as
assets belonging to that series. In the event that
there are any assets, income, earnings, profits,
proceeds thereof, funds or payments which are not
readily identifiable as belonging to any particular
series (collectively General Items), such General
Items shall be allocated by or under the
supervision of the Board of Directors to and among
any one or more of the series established and
designated from time to time in such manner and
on such basis as the Board of Directors, in its sole
discretion, deems fair and equitable, and any
General Items so allocated to a particular series
shall belong to that series. Each such allocation by
the Board of Directors shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes. The foregoing provisions
of this Section 5.1(c)(1) shall apply to each class to
the extent provided by the Board of Directors and
consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

(2)	Liabilities Belonging to a Series. The assets
belonging to each particular series shall be
charged with the liabilities of the Corporation in
respect of that series and all expenses, costs,
charges and reserves attributable to that series,
and any general liabilities, expenses, costs,
charges or reserves of the Corporation which are
not readily identifiable as belonging to any
particular series shall be allocated and charged by
or under the supervision of the Board of Directors
to and among any one or more of the series
established and designated from time to time in
such manner and on such basis as the Board of
Directors, in its sole discretion, deems fair and
equitable. The liabilities, expenses, costs, charges
and reserves allocated and so charged to a series
are herein referred to as liabilities belonging to
that series. Expenses related to the shares of a
series may be borne solely by that series (as
determined by the Board of Directors). Each
allocation of liabilities, expenses, costs, charges
and reserves by the Board of Directors shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes. The
foregoing provisions of this Section 5.1(c)(2) shall
apply to each class to the extent provided by the
Board of Directors and consistent with applicable
laws and regulations.

(3)	Dividends and Distributions. The Board of
Directors may from time to time declare and pay
dividends or distributions, in stock, property or
cash, on any or all series of stock, the amount of
such dividends and property distributions and the
payment of them being wholly in the discretion of
the Board of Directors. Dividends may be declared
daily or otherwise pursuant to a standing resolution
or resolutions adopted only once or with such
frequency as the Board of Directors may
determine, after providing for actual and accrued
liabilities belonging to that series. All dividends or
distributions on shares of a particular series shall
be paid only out of surplus or other lawfully
available assets determined by the Board of
Directors as belonging to such series. Dividends
and distributions may vary between the classes of
a series to reflect differing allocations of the
expense of each class of that series to such extent
and for such purposes as the Board of Directors
may deem appropriate. The Board of Directors
shall have the power, in its sole discretion, to
distribute in any fiscal year as dividends, including
dividends designated in whole or in part as capital
gains distributions, amounts sufficient, in the
opinion of the Board of Directors, to enable the
Corporation, or where applicable each series of
shares to qualify as a regulated investment
company under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, or any successor or
comparable statute thereto, and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and to avoid liability for
the Corporation, or each series of shares, for
Federal income and excise taxes in respect of that
or any other year.

(4)	Liquidation. In the event of the liquidation of the
Corporation or of the assets attributable to a
particular series or class, the stockholders of each
series or class that has been established and
designated and is being liquidated shall be entitled
to receive, as a series or class, when and as
declared by the Board of Directors, the excess of
the assets belonging to that series or class over
the liabilities belonging to that series or class. The
holders of shares of any series or class shall not
be entitled thereby to any distribution upon
liquidation of any other series or class. The assets
so distributable to the stockholders of any
particular series or class shall be distributed
among such stockholders according to their
respective rights taking into account the proper
allocation of expenses being borne by that series
or class. The liquidation of assets attributable to
any particular series or class in which there are
shares then outstanding and the termination of the
series or the class may be authorized by vote of a
majority of the Board of Directors then in office,
without action or approval of the stockholders, to
the extent consistent with applicable laws and
regulations. In the event that there are any general
assets not belonging to any particular series or
class of stock and available for distribution, such
distribution shall be made to holders of stock of
various series or classes in such proportion as the
Board of Directors determines to be fair and
equitable, and such determination by the Board of
Directors shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes.

(5)	Redemption. All shares of stock of the Corporation
shall be subject to the redemption, repurchase and
conversion provisions set forth in Sections 5.6
through 5.11 of this Article V.

(d)	The Corporation's shares of stock are issued and sold,
and all persons who shall acquire stock of the
Corporation shall do so, subject to the condition and
understanding that the provisions of the Corporation's
Articles of Incorporation, as from time to time amended,
shall be binding upon them.

	Section 5.2. Quorum Requirements and Voting Rights:
Except as otherwise expressly provided by the Maryland General
Corporation Law, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of
one-third of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding
and entitled to vote thereat shall constitute a quorum at any meeting
of the stockholders, except that where the holders of any series or
class are required or permitted to vote as a series or class, one-third
of the aggregate number of shares of that series or class outstanding
and entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum.

	Notwithstanding any provision of Maryland General
Corporation Law requiring a greater proportion than a majority of the
votes of all series or classes or of any series or class of the
Corporation's stock entitled to be cast in order to take or authorize
any action, any such action may be taken or authorized upon the
concurrence of a majority of the aggregate number of votes entitled to
be cast thereon subject to applicable laws and regulations. All shares
of stock of this Corporation shall have the voting rights provided for in
Section 5.1(b) of this Article V.

	The Board of Directors from time to time, subject to such
procedures as may be adopted by the Board of Directors, and
consistent with applicable laws and regulations, may authorize the
holders of shares of any series or class to take action or consent to
any action by delivering a consent, in writing or by electronic
transmission, of the holders entitled to cast not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or
take the action at a meeting of the holders of shares of such series or
class.

	Section 5.3. No Preemptive or Appraisal Rights: No holder
of shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall, as such holder,
have any right to purchase or subscribe for any shares of the capital
stock of the Corporation which the Corporation may issue or sell
(whether consisting of shares of capital stock authorized by these
Articles of Incorporation, or shares of capital stock of the Corporation
acquired by it after the issue thereof, or other shares) other than any
right which the Board of Directors of the Corporation, in its discretion,
may determine.

	No holder of shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall
be entitled to exercise the rights of an objecting stockholder under
Subtitle 2 of Title 3 of the Maryland General Corporation Law or any
successor provision.

	Section 5.4. Determination of Net Asset Value: The net
asset value of each share of each series or class of each series of
the Corporation shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the value of
the net assets of the Corporation, or if applicable of the series or
class (being the value of the assets of the Corporation or of the
particular series or class or attributable to the particular series or
class less its actual and accrued liabilities exclusive of capital stock
and surplus), by the total number of outstanding shares of the
Corporation or the series or class, as applicable. Such determination
may be made on a series-by-series basis or made or adjusted on a
class-by-class basis, as appropriate, and shall include any expenses
allocated to a specific series or class thereof. The Board of Directors
may adopt procedures for determination of net asset value consistent
with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations and, so far
as accounting matters are concerned, with generally accepted
accounting principles. The procedures may include, without limitation,
procedures for valuation of the Corporation's portfolio securities and
other assets, for accrual of expenses or creation of reserves and for
the determination of the number of shares issued and outstanding at
any given time.

	Section 5.5. Stable Net Asset Value: With respect to any
money market, stable value or other series or class that seeks to
maintain a stable net asset value per share, and pursuant to
procedures established by the Board of Directors, the Corporation
shall be entitled, without the payment of monetary compensation but
in consideration of the interest of the Corporation and its stockholders
in maintaining a stable net asset value per share of such series or
class, to redeem pro rata from all holders of record of such series or
class at the time of such redemption (in proportion to their respective
holdings of such shares) sufficient outstanding shares (or fractional
shares) of such series or class, or to take such other measures as
are not prohibited by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as shall
maintain for such series or class a stable net asset value.

	Section 5.6. Redemption by Stockholders: Any stockholder
may redeem shares of the Corporation for the net asset value of each
series or class thereof, less such fees and charges, if any, as may be
established by the Board of Directors from time to time, by
presentation of an appropriate request, together with the certificates,
if any, for such shares, duly endorsed, at the office or agency
designated by the Corporation. Redemptions as aforesaid, shall be
made in the manner and subject to the conditions contained in the
bylaws or approved by the Board of Directors.

	Section 5.7. Redemption at the Option of the Corporation:
Subject to the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
each share of the Corporation and each share of each series and
class shall be redeemable from any stockholder at the option of the
Corporation. In that regard, the Board of Directors may from time to
time authorize the Corporation to redeem all or any part of the shares
of the Corporation or of any series or class upon such terms and
conditions as the Board of Directors may determine in its sole
discretion. The Corporation's right to redeem shares includes, without
limitation, the right to redeem shares when required for the payment
of account fees or other fees, charges and expenses as set by the
Board of Directors, including without limitation any small account fees
permitted by Section 5.9 of this Article V.

	Section 5.8. Purchase of Shares: The Corporation shall be
entitled to purchase all or any part of the shares of the Corporation or
of any series or class of its capital stock, to the extent that the
Corporation may lawfully effect such purchase under Maryland
General Corporation Law, upon such terms and conditions and for
such consideration as the Board of Directors shall deem advisable.

	Section 5.9. Redemption of Minimum Amounts: The Board
of Directors may establish, from time to time, one or more minimum
investment amounts for stockholder accounts, which may be different
for each series or class and within each series or class, and may
impose account fees on, and/or require the involuntary redemption of,
those accounts the net asset value of which for any reason falls
below such established minimum amounts, or may take any other
action with respect to minimum investment amounts as may be
deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors, in each case upon
such terms as shall be established by the Board of Directors. Any
such account fee may be satisfied by the Corporation by redeeming
the requisite number of shares in any such account in the amount of
such fee.

	Section 5.10. Conversion of Shares by Stockholders and
by the Corporation: Subject to compliance with the Investment
Company Act of 1940 and applicable laws and regulations, the Board
of Directors shall have authority, without stockholder approval, to
provide that:

(a)	the holders of any series or class of shares shall have the
right to convert or exchange such shares into shares of
one or more other series or classes in accordance with
such terms and conditions as may be established by the
Board of Directors; and

(b)	the Corporation may automatically convert some or all of
the shares of a particular series or class into shares of
another series or class, at such times as may be
determined by the Board of Directors, based on the
relative net asset values of such series or class at time of
conversion and otherwise in accordance with such terms
and conditions as may be established by the Board of
Directors and which may vary within and among the
series and classes and within and among the holders of
the series or classes to the extent determined by the
Board of Directors.

	Section 5.11. Mode of Payment: Payment by the
Corporation for shares of any series or class of the capital stock of
the Corporation surrendered to it for redemption shall be made by the
Corporation within seven days of such surrender out of the funds
legally available therefor, provided that the Corporation may suspend
the right of the holders of capital stock of the Corporation to redeem
shares of capital stock and may postpone the right of such holders to
receive payment for any shares when permitted or required to do so
by law. Payment of the redemption or purchase price may be made in
cash or, at the option of the Corporation, wholly or partly in such
portfolio securities or other assets of the Corporation as the
Corporation may select in its sole discretion. The composition of any
such payments may be different among stockholders, including those
of the same series or class, as the Corporation may determine in its
sole discretion.

	Section 5.12. Rights of Holders of Shares Purchased or
Redeemed: The right of any holder of any series or class of capital
stock of the Corporation purchased or redeemed by the Corporation
as provided in this Article V to receive dividends thereon and all other
rights of such holder with respect to such shares shall terminate at
the time as of which the purchase or redemption price of such shares
is determined, except the right of such holder to receive (i) the
purchase or redemption price of such shares from the Corporation or
its designated agent and (ii) any dividend or distribution or voting
rights to which such holder has previously become entitled as the
record holder of such shares on the record date for the determination
of the stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution or
to vote at the meeting of stockholders.

	Section 5.13. Status of Shares Purchased or Redeemed:
In the absence of any specification as to the purpose for which such
shares of any series or class of capital stock of the Corporation are
redeemed or purchased by it, all shares so redeemed or purchased
shall be deemed to be retired in the sense contemplated by the laws
of the State of Maryland and may be reissued. The number of
authorized shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall not be
reduced by the number of any shares redeemed or purchased by it.

	Section 5.14. Additional Limitations and Powers: The
following provisions are inserted for the purpose of defining, limiting
and regulating the powers of the Corporation and of the Board of
Directors and stockholders:

(a)	Any determination made in good faith and, so far as
accounting matters are involved, in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles by or pursuant
to the direction of the Board of Directors, as to the
amount of the assets, debts, obligations or liabilities of
the Corporation, as to the amount of any reserves or
charges set up and the propriety thereof, as to the time
of or purpose for creating such reserves or charges, as
to the use, alteration or cancellation of any reserves or
charges (whether or not any debt, obligation or liability
for which such reserves or charges shall have been
created shall have been paid or discharged or shall be
then or thereafter required to be paid or discharged), as
to the establishment or designation of procedures or
methods to be employed for valuing any investment or
other assets of the Corporation and as to the value of
any investment or other asset, as to the allocation of any
asset of the Corporation to a particular series or class or
classes of the Corporation's stock, as to the funds
available for the declaration of dividends and as to the
declaration of dividends, as to the charging of any
liability of the Corporation to a particular series or class
or classes of the Corporation's stock, as to the number of
shares of any series or class or classes of the
Corporation's outstanding stock, as to the estimated
expense to the Corporation in connection with purchases
or redemptions of its shares, as to the ability to liquidate
investments in orderly fashion, or as to any other matters
relating to the issue, sale, purchase or redemption or
other acquisition or disposition of investments or shares
of the Corporation, or in the determination of the net
asset value per share of shares of any series or class of
the Corporation's stock shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes.

(b)	Except to the extent prohibited by the Investment
Company Act of 1940, or rules, regulations or orders
thereunder promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission or any successor thereto or by the bylaws
of the Corporation, a director, officer or employee of the
Corporation shall not be disqualified by his position from
dealing or contracting with the Corporation, nor shall any
transaction or contract of the Corporation be void or
voidable by reason of the fact that any director, officer or
employee or any firm of which any director, officer or
employee is a member, or any corporation of which any
director, officer or employee is a stockholder, officer or
director, is in any way interested in such transaction or
contract; provided that in case a director, or a firm or
corporation of which a director is a member, stockholder,
officer or director is so interested, such fact shall be
disclosed to or shall have been known by the Board of
Directors or a majority thereof. Nor shall any director or
officer of the Corporation be liable to the Corporation or
to any stockholder or creditor thereof or to any person for
any loss incurred by it or him or for any profit realized by
such director or officer under or by reason of such
contract or transaction; provided that nothing herein shall
protect any director or officer of the Corporation against
any liability to the Corporation or to its security holders to
which he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless
disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his
office; and provided always that such contract or
transaction shall have been on terms that were unfair to
the Corporation at the time at which it was entered into.
Any director of the Corporation who is so interested, or
who is a member, stockholder, officer or director of such
firm or corporation, may be counted in determining the
existence of a quorum at any meeting of the Board of
Directors of the Corporation which shall authorize any
such transaction or contract, with like force and effect as
if he were not such director, or member, stockholder,
officer or director of such firm or corporation.

(c)	Specifically and without limitation of the foregoing
paragraph (b) but subject to the exception therein
prescribed, the Corporation may enter into management
or advisory, underwriting, distribution and administration
contracts, custodian contracts and such other contracts
as may be appropriate.

	Section 5.15. Reorganization: The Board of Directors may
merge or consolidate one of more series of shares with, and may sell,
convey and transfer the assets belonging to any one or more series
of shares to, another corporation, trust, partnership, association or
other organization, or to the Corporation to be held as assets
belonging to another series of shares, in exchange for cash,
securities or other consideration (including, in the case of a transfer to
another series of shares of the Corporation, shares of such other
series of shares) with such transfer being made subject to, or with the
assumption by the transferee of, the liabilities belonging to each
transferor series of shares if deemed appropriate by the Board of
Directors. The Board of Directors shall have the authority to effect
any such merger, consolidation or transfer of assets, without action or
approval of the stockholders, to the extent consistent with applicable
laws and regulations.

	Section 5.16. Classes of Shares: The Board of Directors
shall also have the authority, subject to applicable laws and
regulations and without action or approval of the stockholders, from
time to time to designate any class of shares of a series of shares as
a separate series of shares as it deems necessary or desirable. The
designation of any class of shares of a series of shares as a separate
series of shares shall be effective at the time specified by the Board
of Directors. The Board of Directors shall allocate the assets,
liabilities and expenses attributable to any class of shares designated
as a separate series of shares to such separate series of shares and
shall designate the relative rights and preferences of such series of
shares, provided that such relative rights and preferences may not be
materially adversely different from the relative rights and preferences
of the class of shares designated as a separate series of shares.

	Section 5.17. Fees and Expenses. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in these Articles of Incorporation, each
share of any series or class of a series may be subject to such sales
loads or charges, whether initial, deferred or contingent, or any
combination thereof, or any other type of sales load or charge; to
such expenses and fees (including, without limitation, distribution
expenses, administrative expenses under an administrative or service
agreement, plan or other arrangement, however designated, and
other administrative, recordkeeping, redemption, service and other
fees, however designated); to such account size requirements; and to
such other rights and provisions; which may be the same or different
from any other share of any series or class, including any other share
of the same series or class, all as the Board of Directors may from
time to time establish and/or change in accordance with applicable
laws and regulations.

SECOND: The Corporation is registered as an open-end company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

THIRD: The Articles Supplementary shall become effective
immediately upon filing.

       This Agreement is effective this 17th day of April, 2017 by and
between BLACKROCK FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, INC., a
Delaware Corporation, a Delaware corporation and registered
investment adviser (Sub-Advisor) , and BlackRock International
Limited, a corporation organized under the laws of Scotland and a
registered investment adviser (Sub-Sub-Advisor and collectively
with the Sub-Advisor, the parties and individually each, a party).
W I T N E S S E T H:

       WHEREAS, the Principal Funds, Inc. (the Fund) is a
Maryland corporation registered under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as an open-end management
investment company;
       WHEREAS, Principal Management Corporation (the
Manager), an Iowa Corporation, and the Sub-Advisor are parties to
a Sub-Advisory Agreement, dated January 1, 2010 (the Sub-"
"15472","Advisory Agreement), whereas the Sub-Advisor provides investment
advisory services to for all or a portion of the assets of each series of
the Fund identified in Appendix A (each, a Series);
       WHEREAS, the Sub-Advisor desires to retain Sub-Sub-
Advisor to provide certain investment services with respect to the
Fund upon the terms and conditions set forth below and has
furnished the Sub-Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or
authenticated of each of the following and will promptly provide the
Sub-Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or authenticated of
any amendment or supplement thereto:
(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement)
with the Fund
(b)	Sub-Advisory Agreement
(c) 	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements
as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
SEC);
(d)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws
(e)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by
the Board of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and
services to be provided by the Sub-Advisor and Sub-Sub-
Advisor.
	WHEREAS, the Fund and the Manager have agreed that
Sub-Advisor may retain an affiliated investment adviser to provide
certain advisory activities with respect to the Series so long as Sub-
Advisor shall be as fully responsible to the Fund for the acts and
omissions of the Sub-Sub-Advisor as it is for its own acts and
omissions;
	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and
the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as
follows:
1.	Appointment of Sub-Sub-Advisor
The Sub-Advisor hereby appoints the Sub-Sub-Advisor,
consistent with the terms of this Agreement and Sub-
Advisory Agreement, to act as a discretionary investment
manager with respect to such portion of the assets of the
Series as the Sub-Advisor shall allocate to the Sub-Sub-
Advisor for the period and pursuant to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement (the Allocated"
"15473","Assets), subject to the control and direction of the Manager
and the Fund's Board of Directors, for the period and on the
terms hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Sub-Advisor accepts
such appointment and agrees to provide the services
contemplated herein for the compensation herein provided.
For the purposes of the rules of the Financial Conduct
Authority of the United Kingdom and based on the
information obtained in respect of the Sub-Advisor, the Sub-
Advisor will be treated by the Sub-Sub-Advisor as a
professional client.  The Sub-Advisor acknowledges and
accepts this categorization.  The Sub-Advisor has the right to
request a different categorization at any time from the Sub-
Sub-Advisor, however, the Sub-Sub-Advisor only provides
the services to professional clients and will no longer be able
to provide services to the Sub-Advisor in the event of a
request for a change in categorization.
The Sub-Sub-Advisor represents, warrants and covenants
that it is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct
Authority (FCA and the applicable rules promulgated by the
FCA, the FCA Rules).
2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Sub-
Advisor
The Sub-Sub-Advisor will provide certain of the day-to-day
operations of the Series, which may include one or
more of the following services, at the request of the
Sub-Advisor:

(a) 	Provide investment advisory services, including but
not limited to research, advice and supervision for the
Allocated Assets of each Series.
(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for
approval (or any appropriate committee of such
Board), and revise from time to time as conditions
require, a recommended investment program for
each Series consistent with each Series' respective
investment objective(s) and policies and any
specific criteria applicable to the Allocated Assets.
(c)	Implement the approved investment program for the
Allocated Assets by placing orders for the purchase
and sale of securities without prior consultation with
the Manager and without regard to the length of time
the securities have been held, the resulting rate of
portfolio turnover or any tax considerations, subject
always to the provisions of the Fund's registration
statement, Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and
the requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the
same shall be from time to time in effect.
(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as
requested by the officers, in taking such steps as are
reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the
decisions of its Board of Directors, and any
appropriate committees of such Board, regarding the
general conduct of the investment business of each
Series.
(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Sub-Advisor's
investment advisory services provided to the
Allocated Assets, compliance with the 1940 Act and
the regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder and
the Series' investment strategies and restrictions as
stated in the Fund's prospectus and statement of
additional information, subject to receipt of such
additional information as may be required from the
Manager and provided in accordance with Section
12(d) of this Agreement and any specific criteria
applicable to the Allocated Assets.
(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such
times and in such detail as the Board of Directors
may reasonably deem appropriate in order to enable
it to determine that the investment policies,
procedures and approved investment program of
each Series (and any specific criteria applicable to
the Allocated Assets) are being observed.
(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the
determination of the fair value of certain securities
when reliable market quotations are not readily
available for purposes of calculating net asset value
in accordance with procedures and methods
established by the Fund's Board of Directors.
(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary
investment and management facilities, including
salaries of clerical and other personnel required for it
to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii) administrative
facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical personnel
and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of
the investment advisory affairs of each Series.
(i)	Open accounts with Foreign Account Tax Compliance
Act compliant broker-dealers and futures commission
merchants (broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to
effect all transactions for each Series, place all
necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers
(including affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate
commissions, if applicable. To the extent consistent
with applicable law and permitted by the FCA Rules,
purchase or sell orders for each Series may be
aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell
orders of other clients of the Sub-Sub-Advisor. In
such event allocation of securities so sold or
purchased, as well as the expenses incurred in the
transaction, will be made by the Sub-Sub-Advisor in
the manner the Sub-Sub-Advisor considers to be the
most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Fund and to other clients. The Sub-
Sub-Advisor will report on such allocations at the
request of the Manager, the Fund or the Fund's
Board of Directors providing such information as the
number of aggregated trades to which each Series
was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades
were directed and the basis for the allocation for the
aggregated trades. The Sub-Sub-Advisor shall use its
best efforts to obtain execution of transactions for
each Series at prices which are advantageous to the
Series and at commission rates that are reasonable
in relation to the benefits received. However, the Sub-
Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the
basis that they provide brokerage, research or other
services or products to the Sub-Sub-Advisor. To the
extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Sub-
Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of
commission for effecting a securities transaction in
excess of the amount of commission or dealer spread
another broker or dealer would have charged for
effecting that transaction if the Sub-Sub-Advisor
determines in good faith that such amount of
commission is reasonable in relation to the value of
the brokerage and research products and/or services
provided by such broker or dealer. This
determination, with respect to brokerage and
research products and/or services, may be viewed in
terms of either that particular transaction or the
overall responsibilities which the Sub-Sub-Advisor
and its affiliates have with respect to each Series as
well as to accounts over which they exercise
investment discretion. Not all such services or
products need be used by the Sub-Sub-Advisor in
managing the Allocated Assets. In addition, joint
repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized by
the Series except to the extent permitted under any
exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Sub-Advisor
provided that all conditions of such order are
complied with.
(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect
to the Allocated Assets as are required of an
investment advisor of a registered investment
company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers"

of any material pending or threatened action, suit,
proceeding, inquiry or investigation that is

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to
furnish it with portfolio selection and related research and
statistical services in connection with the investment advisory
services for each series identified in Appendix A (hereinafter
called the Series), which the Manager has agreed to provide
to the Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to furnish such
services; and

WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with

perform the services described in Section 2 below for
investment and reinvestment such portion of the assets of
each Series as may be allocated to the Sub-Advisor by the
Manager, from time to time (the Allocated Assets), subject
to the control and direction of the Manager and the Fund's
Board of Directors, for the period and on the terms
hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor accepts such
appointment and agrees to furnish the services hereinafter
set forth for the compensation herein provided. The Sub-
Advisor shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an
independent contractor and shall, except as expressly
provided or authorized, have no authority to act for or
represent the Fund or the Manager in any way or
otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services
to be Provided by the Sub-
Advisor The Sub-Advisor will:
(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but
not limited to research, advice and supervision for the
Series.


(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for
approval (or any appropriate committee of such Board),
and revise from time to time as economic conditions
require, a recommended investment program for the
Fund consistent with the Series' investment objective
and policies.
(c)	Implement the approved investment program by
placing orders for the purchase and sale of securities
without prior consultation with the Manager and without
regard to the length of time the securities have been
held, the resulting rate of portfolio turnover or any tax
considerations, subject always to the provisions of the
Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, the
requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same
shall be from time to time in effect.
(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as
requested by the officers, in taking such steps as are
reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the
decisions of its Board of Directors, and any
appropriate committees of such Board, regarding the
general conduct of the investment business of the
Series.
(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's
investment advisory services provided to the Series, its
compliance with the 1940 Act and the regulations
adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission
thereunder and the Series' investment strategies and
restrictions as stated in the Fund's prospectus and
statement of additional information, subject to receipt
of such additional information as may be required from
the Manager and provided in accordance with
Section 11(d) of this Agreement. The Sub-Advisor
has no responsibility for the maintenance of Fund
records except insofar as is directly related to the
services it provides to the Series.
(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such
times and in such detail as the Board of Directors may
reasonably deem appropriate in order to enable it to
determine that the investment policies, procedures and
approved investment program of the Series are being
observed.
(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination
of the fair value of certain securities when reliable
market quotations are not readily available for
purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance
with procedures and methods established by the
Fund's Board of Directors.
(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary
investment and management facilities, including
salaries of clerical and other personnel required for it
to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii) administrative
facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical personnel and
equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of its
duties under this Agreement.
(i)	Open accounts with Foreign Account Tax Compliance
Act (FATCA) compliant broker- dealers and futures
commission merchants (broker-dealers), select
broker-dealers to effect all transactions for the Series,
place all necessary orders with broker-dealers or
issuers (including affiliated broker-dealers), and
negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the extent
consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders
for the Series may be aggregated with
contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of other
clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation of
securities so sold or purchased, as well as the
expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by
the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor
considers to be the most equitable and consistent
with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other
clients. The Manager recognizes that, in some cases,
this procedure may limit the size of the position that
may be acquired or sold for the Series. The Sub-
Advisor will report on such allocations at the request
of the Manager, the Fund or the Fund's Board of
Directors providing such information as the number of
aggregated trades to which the Series was a party,
the broker-dealers to


whom such trades were directed and the basis for
the allocation for the aggregated trades. The Sub-
Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain execution of
transactions for the Series at prices which are
advantageous to the Series and at commission rates
that are reasonable in relation to the benefits
received. However, the Sub-Advisor may select
brokers or dealers on the basis that they provide
brokerage, research or other services or products to
the Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with
applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or
dealer an amount of commission for effecting a
securities transaction in excess of the amount of
commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer
would have charged for effecting that transaction if
the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that such
amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the
value of the brokerage and research products and/or
services provided by such broker or dealer. This
determination, with respect to brokerage and research
products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of
either that particular transaction or the overall
responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates
have with respect to the Series as well as to accounts
over which they exercise investment discretion. Not all
such services or products need be used by the Sub-
Advisor in managing the Series. In addition, joint
repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized by the
Series except to the extent permitted under applicable
law or under any exemptive order obtained by the Sub-
Advisor provided that all conditions of such order are
complied with.
U) Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to
the Series as are required of an investment advisor of
a registered investment company pursuant to the
1940 Act and Investment Adviser's Act of 1940 (the
Investment Adviser's Act), and the rules thereunder,
and furnish the Fund and the Manager with such
periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager
may reasonably request. In compliance with the
requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the
Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it
maintains for the Series are the property of the Fund,
agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule
31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains
for the Fund and that are required to be maintained by
Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to
surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it
maintains for the Series upon request by the Fund or the
Manager.
(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act
and the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant
to that Rule as the same may be amended from time
to time. The Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy
of Sub-Advisor's current Code of Ethics. Sub-Advisor
shall promptly forward to the Manager a copy of any
material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code of
Ethics.
(I)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may
request, furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio
transactions and reports on investments held by the
Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the Fund
may reasonably request. The Sub-Advisor will make
available its officers and employees to meet with the
Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's principal place
of business on due notice to review the investments
of the Series.
(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided
by a sub-advisor and may be required for the Fund or
the Manager to comply with their respective obligations
under applicable laws, including, without limitation, the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act, the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities"
"15477","Act), and any state securities laws, and any rule or
regulation thereunder. Such information includes, but is
not limited to; the Sub-Advisor's compliance manual and
policies and procedures adopted to comply with Rule
206(4)-7 of the Investment Advisers Act; the Sub-
advisor's most recent annual compliance report or a
detailed summary of such report; timely and
complete responses to Quarterly Compliance
Questionnaires (including the identification of any
material compliance


matters and a copy of any material changes to the
Sub-advisor's Rule 206(4)-7 compliance policies and
procedures marked to show changes along with a
written summary of the purpose of such changes),
Annual Proxy Voting Questionnaires, Annual Best
Execution and Soft Dollar Questionnaire, and other
ad-hoc compliance requests the Manager deems
necessary. Sub-advisor agrees to make available for
review, deficiency letters issued by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Sub-advisor's
response to such deficiency letters. Sub-Advisor will
advise Manager of any material changes in Sub-
Advisor's ownership within a reasonable time after
any such change. Manager acknowledges receipt of
Sub-Advisor's Form ADV more than 48 hours prior to
the execution of this Agreement.
(n)	Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies
solicited by, or with respect to, the issuers of securities
held in the Series. The Manager shall cause to be
forwarded to Sub-Advisor all proxy solicitation
materials that it receives and shall assist Sub-Advisor
in its efforts to conduct the proxy voting process.

3.	Prohibited Conduct
In providing the services described in this agreement, the
Sub-Advisor will not consult with any other investment
advisory firm that provides investment advisory services to
any investment company sponsored by Principal Life
Insurance Company regarding transactions for the Fund in
securities or other assets; provided, however, that Sub-
Adviser may engage an affiliate to perform investment
advisory services for the Fund (the Sub-Advisory Affiliate)
and this prohibition shall not apply to consultations with the
Sub-Advisory Affiliate.

4.	Compensation
As full compensation for all services rendered and

PLAN OF ACQUISITION

LargeCap Growth Fund II and Blue Chip Fund


   The Board of Directors of Principal Funds, Inc., a Maryland
corporation (the Fund), deems it advisable that the Blue Chip Fund
series of the Fund (BLC) acquire all of the assets of the LargeCap
Growth Fund II series of the Fund (LCGII), in exchange for the
assumption by BLC of all of the liabilities of LCGII and for shares
issued by BLC which are thereafter to be distributed by LCGII pro
rata to its shareholders in complete liquidation and termination of
LCGII and in exchange for all of LCGII's outstanding shares.

   LCGII will transfer to BLC, and BLC will acquire from LCGII, all of
the assets of LCGII on the Closing Date and will assume from LCGII
all of the liabilities of LCGII in exchange for the issuance of the
number of shares of BLC determined as provided in the following
paragraphs, which shares will be subsequently distributed pro rata to
the shareholders of LCGII in complete liquidation and termination of
LCGII and in exchange for all of LCGII's outstanding shares.  LCGII
will not issue, sell or transfer any of its shares after the Closing Date,
and only redemption requests received by LCGII in proper form prior
to the Closing Date shall be fulfilled by LCGII.  Redemption requests
received by LCGII thereafter will be treated as requests for
redemption of those shares of BLC allocable to the shareholder in
question.

   LCGII will declare, and BLC may declare, to its shareholders of
record on or prior to the Closing Date a dividend or dividends which,
together with all previous such dividends, shall have the effect of
distributing to its shareholders all of its income (computed without
regard to any deduction for dividends paid) and all of its net realized
capital gains, if any, as of the Closing Date.

   On the Closing Date, BLC will issue to LCGII a number of full and
fractional shares of BLC, taken at their then net asset value, having
an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate value of the net
assets of LCGII.  The aggregate value of the net assets of LCGII and
BLC shall be determined in accordance with the then current
Prospectus of BLC as of close of regularly scheduled trading on the
New York Stock Exchange on the Closing Date.

   The closing of the transactions contemplated in this Plan (the
Closing) shall be held at the offices of Principal Global Investors,
LLC, 711 High Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50392 at 3:00 p.m. Central
Time on September 20, 2017, or on such other date as fund
management may determine. The date on which the Closing is to be
held as provided in this Plan shall be known as the Closing Date.

   In the event that on the Closing Date (a) the New York Stock
Exchange is closed for other than customary weekend and holiday
closings or (b) trading on said Exchange is restricted or (c) an
emergency exists as a result of which it is not reasonably practicable
for BLC or LCGII to fairly determine the value of its assets, the
Closing Date shall be postponed until the first business day after the
day on which trading shall have been fully resumed.

   As soon as practicable after the Closing, LCGII shall (a) distribute
on a pro rata basis to the shareholders of record of LCGII at the close
of business on the Closing Date the shares of BLC received by LCGII
at the Closing in exchange for all of LCGII's outstanding shares, and
(b) be liquidated in accordance with applicable law and the Fund's
Articles of Incorporation.

   For purposes of the distribution of shares of BLC to shareholders
of LCGII, BLC shall credit its books an appropriate number its shares
to the account of each shareholder of LCGII. No certificates will be
issued for shares of BLC. After the Closing Date and until
surrendered, each outstanding certificate, if any, which, prior to the
Closing Date, represented shares of LCGII, shall be deemed for all
purposes of the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to
evidence the appropriate number of shares of BLC to be credited on
the books of BLC in respect of such shares of LCGII as provided
above.

   LCGII will, within a reasonable period of time before the Closing
Date, furnish BLC with a list of LCGII's portfolio securities and other
investments. BLC will, within a reasonable period of time before the
Closing Date, identify the securities, if any, on LCGII's list referred to
in the foregoing sentence that BLC wishes to receive from LCGII and
otherwise how BLC wishes LCGII's portfolio to be repositioned prior
to the Closing in accordance with BLC's investment objective, policies
and strategies.  LCGII, if requested by BLC, will reposition its portfolio
as directed by BLC prior to the Closing. In addition, if it is determined
that the portfolios of LCGII and BLC, when aggregated, would contain
investments exceeding certain percentage limitations applicable to
BLC with respect to such investments, LCGII, if requested by BLC,
will dispose of a sufficient amount of such investments as may be
necessary to avoid violating such limitations as of the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein will require LCGII to
dispose of or purchase any investments or securities if, in the
reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors or Principal Global
Investors, LLC, the investment adviser to LCGII and BLC, such
disposition would adversely affect the status of the transactions
contemplated in this Plan as a reorganization, as such term is used
in Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
or would otherwise not be in the best interests of LCGII.

   Prior to the Closing Date, LCGII shall deliver to BLC a list setting
forth the assets to be assigned, delivered and transferred to BLC,
including the securities then owned by LCGII and the respective
federal income tax bases (on an identified cost basis) thereof, and the
liabilities to be assumed by BLC pursuant to this Plan.

   All of LCGII's portfolio securities shall be delivered by LCGII's
custodian on the Closing Date to BLC or its custodian, either
endorsed in proper form for transfer in such condition as to constitute
good delivery thereof in accordance with the practice of brokers or, if
such securities are held in a securities depository within the meaning
of Rule 17f-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, transferred
to an account in the name of BLC or its custodian with said
depository. All cash to be delivered pursuant to this Plan shall be
transferred from LCGII's account at its custodian to BLC's account at
its custodian. If on the Closing Date LCGII is unable to make good
delivery to BLC's custodian of any of LCGII's portfolio securities
because such securities have not yet been delivered to LCGII's
custodian by its brokers or by the transfer agent for such securities,
then the delivery requirement with respect to such securities shall be
waived, and LCGII shall deliver to BLC's custodian on or by said
Closing Date with respect to said undelivered securities executed
copies of an agreement of assignment in a form satisfactory to BLC,
and a due bill or due bills in form and substance satisfactory to the
custodian, together with such other documents including brokers'
confirmations, as may be reasonably required by BLC.

   This Plan may be abandoned and terminated, whether before or
after action thereon by the shareholders of LCGII and notwithstanding
favorable action by such shareholders, if the Board of Directors
believe that the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereunder would not be in the best interests of the shareholders of
either fund. This Plan may be amended by the Board of Directors at
any time, except that after approval by the shareholders of LCGII no
amendment may be made with respect to the Plan which in the
opinion of the Board of Directors materially adversely affects the
interests of the shareholders of LCGII.

   Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Plan, LCGII will
pay or cause to be paid all out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated under this Plan,
including, but not limited to, accountants' fees, legal fees, registration
fees, and printing expenses.

   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties hereto has caused
this Plan to be executed by its President & Chief Executive Officer
and Vice President & Secretary as of the 14th day of June, 2017.

"15615","Series at prices which are"
"15616","advantageous to the Series and at commission rates that"

"15618","However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers"

"15627","that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation"
"15628","to the value of the brokerage and research products"
"15629","and/or services provided by such broker or dealer. This"
"15630","determination, with respect to brokerage and research"
"15631","products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of"
"15632","either that particular transaction or the overall"
"15633","responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates"
"15634","have with respect to the Series as well as to accounts"
"15635","over which they exercise investment discretion. Not all"

"15639","Series except to the extent permitted under any"
"15640","exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided"
"15641","that all conditions of such order are complied with."

"15655","and that are required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1"
"15656","under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to surrender"
