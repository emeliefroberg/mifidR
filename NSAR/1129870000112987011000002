"1887","Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"1888","we considered the Funds internal control over"
"1889","financial reporting, including controls over"
"1890","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"1891","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"1892","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"

"1894","the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1895","the effectiveness of the Funds internal control"
"1896","over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"1897","we express no such opinion."

"1912","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1913","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"

"1915","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"1916","as necessary to permit preparation of financial"

"1923","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1924","of the funds assets that could have a material"
"1925","effect on the financial statements."
"1926","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
