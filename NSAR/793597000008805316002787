"1601","Effective October 3, 2016, the Fund's principal"
"1602","investment strategy was amended to the following:"
"1603","Main Investments. The fund invests at least 65% of"

"1617","management utilizes a proprietary investment process"
"1618","designed to identify attractive investments utilizing"
"1619","proprietary research, including regional and sector"
"1620","research, conducted by in-house analysts. The"
"1621","investment process also takes into consideration"
"1622","various valuation metrics to assess the attractiveness"
"1623","of stocks and assists portfolio management in devising"
"1624","allocations among investable securities."
"1625","Portfolio management uses analytical tools to"
"1626","actively monitor the risk profile of the portfolio as"
"1627","compared to appropriate benchmarks. Portfolio"
"1628","management will normally sell a stock when its"
