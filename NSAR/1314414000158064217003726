"979","Lights Fund Trust"
"980","and Shareholders of"
"981","Eagle MLP Strategy"
"982","Fund"
"983","In planning and"

"986","of Eagle MLP Strategy"
"987","Fund (the Fund), as of"
"988","and for the year ended"
"989","April 30, 2017, in"
"990","accordance with the"
"991","standards of the Public"
"992","Company Accounting"
"993","Oversight Board (United"
"994","States), we considered"
"995","the Fund's internal"
"996","control over financial"
"997","reporting, including"
"998","controls over"
"999","safeguarding securities,"
"1000","as a basis for designing"
"1001","our auditing procedures"
"1002","for the purpose of"
"1003","expressing our opinion"
"1004","on the financial"
"1005","statements and to"
"1006","comply with the"
"1007","requirements of Form"
"1008","N-SAR, but not for the"
"1009","purpose of expressing"
"1010","an opinion on the"
"1011","effectiveness of the"
"1012","Fund's internal control"
"1013","over financial reporting."
"1014","Accordingly, we express"
"1015","no such opinion."
"1016","The management of the"
"1017","Fund is responsible for"
"1018","establishing and"
"1019","maintaining effective"
"1020","internal control over"
"1021","financial reporting. In"
"1022","fulfilling this"
"1023","responsibility, estimates"
"1024","and judgments by"
"1025","management are"
"1026","required to assess the"
"1027","expected benefits and"
"1028","related costs of"
"1029","controls. A fund's"
"1030","internal control over"
"1031","financial reporting is a"
"1032","process designed to"
"1033","provide reasonable"
"1034","assurance regarding the"
"1035","reliability of financial"
"1036","reporting and the"
"1037","preparation of financial"
"1038","statements for external"
"1039","purposes in accordance"
"1040","with generally accepted"
"1041","accounting principles"
"1042","(GAAP). A fund's"
"1043","internal control over"
"1044","financial reporting"
"1045","includes those policies"
"1046","and procedures that (a)"
"1047","pertain to the"
"1048","maintenance of records"
"1049","that, in reasonable"
"1050","detail, accurately and"
"1051","fairly reflect the"
"1052","transactions and"
"1053","dispositions of the"
"1054","assets of the fund; (b)"
"1055","provide reasonable"
"1056","assurance that"
"1057","transactions are"
"1058","recorded as necessary"
"1059","to permit preparation of"
"1060","financial statements in"
"1061","accordance with GAAP,"
"1062","and that receipts and"
"1063","expenditures of the fund"
"1064","are being made only in"
"1065","accordance with"
"1066","authorizations of"
"1067","management and"
"1068","directors of the fund;"
"1069","and (c) provide"
"1070","reasonable assurance"
"1071","regarding prevention or"
"1072","timely detection of"
"1073","unauthorized"
"1074","acquisition, use or"
"1075","disposition of a fund's"
"1076","assets that could have a"
"1077","material effect on the"
"1078","financial statements."
"1079","Because of inherent"
"1080","limitations, internal"
"1081","control over financial"
"1082","reporting may not"
"1083","prevent or detect"
"1084","misstatements. Also,"
"1085","projections of"
"1086","effectiveness to future"
"1087","periods are subject to"
"1088","the risk that controls"
"1089","may become"
"1090","inadequate because of"
"1091","changes in conditions,"
"1092","or that the degree of"
"1093","compliance with the"
"1094","policies or procedures"
"1095","may deteriorate."
"1096","A deficiency in internal"
"1097","control over financial"
"1098","reporting exists when"
"1099","the design or operation"
"1100","of a control does not"
"1101","allow management or"
"1102","employees, in the"
"1103","normal course of"
