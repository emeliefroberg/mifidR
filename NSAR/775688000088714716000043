"540","<FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of T. Rowe Price Equity Income Fund (the Company) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United S</FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>tates), we considered the Company&#146;s internal </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.</FONT></P>"
"541","<P style=text-align: left;>"
"542","<FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are requir</FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>ed to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company&#146;s </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company&#146;s assets that could have </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>a material effect on the financial statements.</FONT></P>"
"543","<P style=text-align: left;>"
"544","<FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</FONT></P>"
"545","<P style=text-align: left;>"
"546","<FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</FONT></P>"

<FONT size=2 face=MetaNormalLF-Roman,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>T. Rowe Price Equity Income Fund (the fund), is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act) as a diversified, open-end management investment company. The fund seeks a high level of dividend income and long-term capital growth primarily through investments in stocks. The fund has four classes of shares: the Equity Income Fund original share class, referred to in this report as the Investor Class, offered since October 31, 1985; the Equity Income Fund&#150;Advisor Class (Advisor Class), offered since March 31, 2000; the Equity Income Fund&#150;R Class (R Class), offered since September 30, 2002; and the Equity Income Fund&#150;I Class (I Class), offered since December 17, 2015. Advisor Class shares are sold only through unaffiliated brokers and other unaffiliated financial intermediaries, and R Class shares are available to retirement plans serviced by intermediaries. I Class shares generally are available only to investors meeting a &#36;1,000,000 minimum investment or certain other criteria.</FONT></P>
<P style=text-align: left;>
<FONT size=2 face=MetaNormalLF-Roman,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>The Advisor Class and R Class each operate under separate Board-approved</FONT></P>
<P style=text-align: left;>
<FONT size=2 face=MetaNormalLF-Roman,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>Rule 12b-1 plans, pursuant to which each class compensates financial intermediaries for distribution, shareholder servicing, and/or certain administrative services; the Investor and I Classes do not pay Rule 12b-1 fees. Each class has exclusive voting rights on matters related solely to that class; separate voting rights on matters that relate to all classes; and, in all other respects, the same rights and obligations as the other classes.</FONT></P>

<FONT size=2 face=MetaNormalLF-Roman,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>Currency Translation </FONT><FONT size=2 face=MetaNormalLF-Roman,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>Assets, including investments, and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollar values each day at the prevailing exchange rate, using the mean of the bid and asked prices of such currencies against U.S. dollars as quoted by a major bank. Purchases and sales of securities, income, and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rate on the date of the transaction. The effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on realized and unrealized security gains and losses is reflected as a component of security gains and losses.</FONT></P>

<FONT size=2 face=MetaNormalLF-Roman,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>The I Class is subject to an operating expense limitation (I Class limit) pursuant to which Price Associates is contractually required to pay all operating expenses of the I Class, excluding management fees, interest, borrowing-related expenses, taxes, brokerage commissions, and extraordinary expenses, to the extent such operating expenses, on an annualized basis, exceed 0.05% of average net assets. This agreement will continue until April, 30, 2018, and may be renewed, revised or revoked only with approval of the fund&#146;s Board. The I Class is required to repay Price Associates for expenses previously paid to the extent the class&#146;s net assets grow or expenses decline sufficiently to allow repayment without causing the class&#146;s operating expenses to exceed the I Class limit. However, no repayment will be made more than three years after the date of a payment or waiver. Pursuant to this agreement, less than &#36;1,000 of expenses were waived/paid by Price Associates during the period ended December 31, 2015 and remain subject to repayment by the fund.</FONT></P>
