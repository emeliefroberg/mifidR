"667","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"668","Accounting Firm"
"669","To the Board of Trustees of Vanguard New Jersey"
"670","Tax-Free Funds and the Shareholders of"
"671","Vanguard New Jersey Tax-Exempt Money Market"
"672","Fund and"
"673","Vanguard New Jersey Long-Term Tax-Exempt Fund"
"674","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"675","statements of Vanguard New Jersey Tax-Exempt"
"676","Money Market Fund and Vanguard New Jersey"
"677","Long-Term Tax-Exempt Fund (constituting Vanguard"
"678","New Jersey Tax-Free Funds, hereafter referred to as"
"679","the ?Trust?) as of and for the year ended November"
"680","30, 2009, in accordance with the standards of the"
"681","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"682","States), we considered the Trust?s internal control"
"683","over financial reporting, including controls over"
"684","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"685","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"686","our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"687","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"688","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"689","effectiveness of the Trust?s internal control over"
"690","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express"
"691","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal"
"692","control over financial reporting."
"693","The management of the Trust is responsible for"
"694","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"695","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"696","estimates and judgments by management are"
"697","required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"698","costs of controls.  A company?s internal control over"
"699","financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"700","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"701","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"702","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"703","generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"704","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"705","includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"706","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"707","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"708","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"709","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"710","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"711","preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"712","with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"713","that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"714","being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"715","management and trustees of the company; and (3)"
"716","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"717","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"718","or disposition of a company?s assets that could have"
"719","a material effect on the financial statements."
"720","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"721","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"722","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"723","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"724","risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"725","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"726","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"727","deteriorate."
"728","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"729","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"730","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"731","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"732","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"733","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"734","a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"735","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"736","possibility that a material misstatement of the Trust's"
"737","annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"738","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"739","Our consideration of the Trust?s internal control over"
"740","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"741","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"742","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"743","control over financial reporting that might be material"
"744","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"745","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"746","States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"747","Trust?s internal control over financial reporting and its"
"748","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"749","securities that we consider to be material"
"750","weaknesses as defined above as of November 30,"
"751","2009."

"854","The shareholders of the Vanguard funds approved changes to the funds'"
"855","fundamental policies (i.e., policies that cannot be changed without a"
"856","shareholder vote). The newly adopted standardized fundamental policies for each"
"857","of the Vanguard funds are as follows:"
"858","Borrowing. The Fund may borrow money only as permitted by the 1940 Act or other"
"859","governing statute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other regulatory"
"860","agency with authority over the Fund."
"861","Commodities. The Fund may invest in commodities only as permitted by the 1940"
"862","Act or other governing statute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other"
"863","regulatory agency with authority over the Fund."
"864","Industry Concentration."
"865","[For funds, other than index funds and money market funds, that do not"
"866","concentrate.] The Fund will not concentrate its investments in the securities of"
"867","issuers whose principal business activities are in the same industry."
"868","[For index funds that do not concentrate.] The Fund will not concentrate its"
"869","investments in the securities of issuers whose principal business activities are"
"870","in the same industry, except as may be necessary to approximate the composition"
"871","of its target index."
"872","[For funds, other than money market funds, that concentrate.] The Fund will"
"873","concentrate its investments in the securities of issuers whose principal"
"874","business activities are in the ________ industry, as defined in the prospectus"
"875","or Statement of Additional Information (SAI) (the blank to be consistent with"
"876","the fund's name, such as energy, health care, etc.)."
"877","<PAGE>"
"878","[For the Prime Money Market Fund, Vanguard Variable Insurance Fund--Money Market"
"879","Portfolio, and Market Liquidity Fund.] The Fund will concentrate its assets in"
"880","the securities of issuers whose principal business activities are in the"
"881","financial services industry. For the purposes of this policy, the financial"
"882","services industry is deemed to include the group of industries within the"
"883","financial services sector. In addition, the Fund reserves the right to"
"884","concentrate its investments in government securities, as defined in the 1940"
"885","Act."
"886","[For all other money market funds.] The Fund will not concentrate its"
"887","investments in the securities of issuers whose principal business activities are"
"888","in the same industry, except that the Fund reserves the right to concentrate its"
"889","investments in government securities, as defined in the 1940 Act, and"
"890","certificates of deposit and bankers' acceptances issued by domestic banks (which"
"891","may include U.S. branches of non-U.S. banks)."
"892","Loans. The Fund may make loans to another person only as permitted by the 1940"
"893","Act or other governing statute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other"
"894","regulatory agency with authority over the Fund."
"895","Real Estate. The Fund may not invest directly in real estate unless it is"
"896","acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments. This"
"897","restriction shall not prevent the Fund from investing in securities or other"
"898","instruments (1) issued by companies that invest, deal, or otherwise engage in"
"899","transactions in real estate, or (2) backed or secured by real estate or"
"900","interests in real estate."
"901","Senior Securities. The Fund may not issue senior securities except as permitted"
"902","by the 1940 Act or other governing statute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the"
"903","SEC or other regulatory agency with authority over the Fund."
"904","The funds' current fundamental policies with respect to diversification,"
"905","investment objective, and underwriting, if  applicable, remain unchanged."
