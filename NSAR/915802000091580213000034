"6525","<P style=margin:0px; padding-left:24px; font-size:11pt align=justify>The Fund pursues its objective primarily by allocating its assets among (i) investment sub-advisers (the <font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8220;</font>Sub-Advisers&quot;, also referred to as <font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8220;</font>Managers<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8221;</font>) who manage alternative or hedging investment strategies and (ii) other open-end investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &quot;1940 Act&quot;) that use alternative or hedging strategies. &nbsp;The Fund may also invest in closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds and exchange-traded notes, which provide exposure to hedging or alternative strategies. &nbsp;Collectively, the open-end funds, closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds in which the Fund may invest are referred to as <font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8220;</font>Underlying Funds.<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8221;</font> </P>"
"6526","<P style=margin:0px align=justify><BR></P>"
"6527","<P style=margin:0px; padding-left:24px; font-size:11pt align=justify>Hedging strategies used by the Sub-Advisers and the Underlying Funds may include, among other techniques, the use of short selling, options, futures, derivatives or similar instruments. &nbsp;Alternative investment strategies may include, among others, long/short, market neutral and arbitrage strategies; commodities or commodity-linked investments; leverage; derivatives; distressed securities; and other investment techniques that are expected to achieve the Fund's investment objective. &nbsp;These strategies are common hedge fund-type strategies and may attempt to exploit disparities or inefficiencies in the markets, geographical areas, and companies; take advantage of security mispricings or anticipated price movements; and/or benefit from cyclical themes or special situations or events (such as spin-offs or reorganizations). Through its use of the Sub-Advisers and the Fund<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s investment in the Underlying Funds, the Fund generally seeks to maintain net equity exposure ranging between ten percent (10%) to sixty percent (60%) of net assets. &nbsp;For example, an Underlying Fund that uses a long/short strategy may be 100% long equities and 40% short equities, resulting in a net equity exposure of 60%, with the balance held in cash. &nbsp;The remainder of the Fund<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s exposure (i.e., other than net equity) is expected to come primarily from the investment in investment grade fixed-income securities of varying maturities, cash, non-equity derivatives or similar instruments by one or more Sub-Advisers or Underlying Funds.</P>"
"6528","<P style=margin:0px align=justify><BR></P>"
"6529","<P style=margin:0px; padding-left:24px; font-size:11pt align=justify>The Adviser determines the allocation of the Fund's assets among the various Sub-Advisers and Underlying Funds. In selecting and weighting investment options, the Adviser seeks to identify Sub-Advisers and Underlying Funds which, based on their investment styles and historical performance, have the potential, in the opinion of the Adviser, to perform independently of each other and achieve positive risk-adjusted returns in various market cycles. This is referred to as &quot;low correlation.&quot; The degree of correlation of any given investment strategy of a Sub-Adviser or an Underlying Fund will, with other investment strategies and the market as a whole, vary as a result of market conditions and other factors, and some Sub-Advisers and Underlying Funds will have a greater degree of correlation with each other and with the market than others. By allocating its assets among a number of investment options, the Fund seeks to achieve diversification, less risk and lower volatility than if the Fund utilized a single Manager or a single strategy approach. The Fund is not required to invest with any minimum number of Sub-Advisers or Underlying Funds, and does not have minimum or maximum limitations with respect to allocations of assets to any Sub-Adviser, investment strategy or market sector. The Adviser may change the allocation of the Fund's assets among the available investment options, and may add or remove Sub-Advisers, at any time. For a variety of reasons, including capacity and regulatory limitations, not all the Sub-Advisers may be available to the Fund if it chooses to use them in the future.</P>"

"6533","<P style=margin:0px; padding-left:24px; font-size:11pt; page-break-before:always align=justify>Each Sub-Adviser is responsible for the day-to-day management of its allocated portion of Fund assets. The Adviser has ultimate responsibility, subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of the Fund, to oversee the Sub-Advisers, and to recommend their hiring, termination and replacement. &nbsp;The Adviser may hire and terminate Sub-Advisers in accordance with the terms of an exemptive order obtained by the Fund and the Adviser from the SEC, under which the Adviser is permitted, subject to supervision and approval of the Board of Trustees, to enter into and materially amend sub-advisory agreements without shareholder approval. The Adviser will furnish shareholders of the Fund with information regarding a new Sub-Adviser within 90 days of the hiring of the new Sub-Adviser. As of the date of this Prospectus, the Adviser has not entered into any sub-advisory agreements with respect to the Fund. </P>"

The Fund may invest in Underlying Funds in excess of the limitations under the 1940 Act, pursuant to an exemptive order obtained by the Fund and the Adviser from the SEC and consistent with the conditions specified in such order. &nbsp;Investments in the securities of Underlying Funds involve duplication of advisory fees and certain other expenses. By investing in an Underlying Fund, the Fund becomes a shareholder of that Underlying Fund. As a result, the Fund's shareholders will indirectly bear the Fund's proportionate share of the fees and expenses paid by shareholders of the Underlying Fund, in addition to the fees and expenses the Fund's shareholders directly bear in connection with the Fund's own operations.</P>"

In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
