"1237","considered  the Funds  internal  control over  financial  reporting,  including"
"1238","controls  over  safeguarding  securities,  as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1239","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"1240","and to comply with the  requirements  of Form N-SAR,  but not for the purpose of"
"1241","expressing an opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Funds internal control over"

"1246","expected  benefits and related costs of controls.  A companys  internal control"
"1247","over financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance"
"1248","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"1249","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1250","accounting  principles.  A companys  internal control over financial  reporting"
"1251","includes those policies and  procedures  that (1) pertain to the  maintenance of"
"1252","records  that,  in  reasonable   detail,   accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the"
"1253","transactions  and  dispositions  of the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide"
"1254","reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded as  necessary to permit"

"1256","accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are"

"1259","detection of unauthorized acquisition,  use or disposition of a companys assets"
"1260","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1261","Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting"
"1262","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1263","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1264","inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the degree of compliance"
"1265","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1266","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"1267","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,  in the normal"
"1268","course  of  performing   their   assigned   functions,   to  prevent  or  detect"
