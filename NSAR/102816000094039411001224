"673","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT"
"674","REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"675","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"676","To the Trustees of Eaton Vance Growth"
"677","Trust and Shareholders of Eaton Vance"
"678","Atlanta Capital Focused Growth Fund:"
"679","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"680","financial statements of Eaton Vance Atlanta"
"681","Capital Focused Growth Fund (the Fund)"
"682","(one of the funds constituting Eaton Vance"
"683","Growth Trust) as of and for the year ended"
"684","September 30, 2011, in accordance with the"
"685","standards of the Public Company"
"686","Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"687","States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"688","control over financial reporting, including"
"689","controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"690","basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"691","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"692","the financial statements and to comply with"
"693","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"694","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"695","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"696","control over financial reporting."
"697","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"698","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"699","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"700","internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"701","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"702","judgments by management are required to"
"703","assess the expected benefits and related"
"704","costs of controls.  A fund's internal control"
"705","over financial reporting is a process designed"
"706","to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"707","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"708","preparation of financial statements for"
"709","external purposes in accordance with"
"710","generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"711","fund's internal control over financial"
"712","reporting includes those policies and"
"713","procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"714","maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"715","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"716","transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"717","the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"718","that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"719","permit preparation of financial statements in"
"720","accordance with generally accepted"
"721","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"722","expenditures of the fund are being made"
"723","only in accordance with authorizations of"
"724","management of the fund and trustees of the"
"725","trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"726","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"727","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition"
"728","of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"729","effect on the financial statements."
"730","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"731","control over financial reporting may not"

"789","Trust and Shareholders of Eaton Vance"
"790","Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap Fund:"
"791","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"792","financial statements of Eaton Vance Atlanta"
"793","Capital SMID-Cap Fund (the Fund) (one"
"794","of the funds constituting Eaton Vance"
"795","Growth Trust) as of and for the year ended"
"796","September 30, 2011, in accordance with the"
"797","standards of the Public Company"
"798","Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"799","States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"800","control over financial reporting, including"
"801","controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"802","basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"803","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"804","the financial statements and to comply with"
"805","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"806","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"807","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"808","control over financial reporting."
"809","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"810","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"811","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"812","internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"813","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"814","judgments by management are required to"
"815","assess the expected benefits and related"
"816","costs of controls.  A fund's internal control"
"817","over financial reporting is a process designed"
"818","to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"819","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"820","preparation of financial statements for"
"821","external purposes in accordance with"
"822","generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"823","fund's internal control over financial"
"824","reporting includes those policies and"
"825","procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"826","maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"827","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"828","transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"829","the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"830","that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"831","permit preparation of financial statements in"
"832","accordance with generally accepted"
"833","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"834","expenditures of the fund are being made"
"835","only in accordance with authorizations of"
"836","management of the fund and trustees of the"
"837","trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"838","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"839","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition"
"840","of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"841","effect on the financial statements."
"842","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"843","control over financial reporting may not"
"844","prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"845","projections of any evaluation of"
