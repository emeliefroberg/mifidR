"1485","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"1486","Firm"
"1487","To the Trustees of DWS Advisor Funds and"
"1488","Shareholders of DWS Lifecycle Long Range Fund:"
"1489","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1490","statements of DWS Lifecycle Long Range Fund (the"
"1491","Fund), as of and for the year ended March 31, 2010, in"
"1492","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1493","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1494","considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1495","reporting, including control activities for safeguarding"
"1496","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1497","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1498","the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1499","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1500","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"1501","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"1502","do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1503","Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"1504","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"1505","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1506","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1507","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"1508","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1509","controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"1510","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1511","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1512","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1513","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1514","principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"1515","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1516","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1517","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1518","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1519","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1520","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"1521","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1522","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"1523","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1524","management and trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide"
"1525","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1526","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1527","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1528","financial statements."
"1529","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1530","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1531","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1532","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1533","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1534","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1535","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1536","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1537","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1538","allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"1539","of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1540","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"1541","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1542","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1543","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1544","misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial"
"1545","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"1546","basis."
"1547","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"1548","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"1549","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1550","all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting"
"1551","that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"1552","established by the Public Company Accounting"
"1553","Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"1554","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1555","reporting and its operation, including controls for"
"1556","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material"
"1557","weaknesses as defined above as of March 31, 2010."

"1595","Federal Court Market Timing Litigation:"
"1596","A number of private lawsuits have been filed including"
"1597","purported class and derivative lawsuits,"
"1598","making various allegations and naming as defendants"
"1599","various persons, including certain Scudder"
"1600","and Deutsche (now DWS) funds (singularly, a Fund and"
"1601","collectively, the Funds), the Funds'"
"1602","investment advisors and their affiliates, certain"
"1603","individuals (including in some cases Fund"
"1604","Trustees/Directors, officers), and other parties."
"1605","Each Fund's investment advisor has agreed to"
"1606","indemnify the applicable Funds in connection with"
"1607","these lawsuits, or other lawsuits or regulatory"
"1608","actions that may be filed making allegations similar"
"1609","to these lawsuits regarding market timing,"
"1610","revenue sharing, fund valuation or other subjects"
"1611","related to investigations of the foregoing"
"1612","matters.  Based on currently available information,"
"1613","the Funds' investment advisors believe the"
"1614","likelihood that the pending lawsuits will have a"
"1615","material adverse financial impact on a Fund is"
"1616","remote and such actions are not likely to materially"
"1617","affect their ability to perform under their"
"1618","investment management agreements with the Funds."
"1619","Fifteen class and derivative actions pertaining to"
"1620","market timing have been consolidated and"
"1621","transferred to a Multidistrict Litigation Panel in the"
"1622","District of Maryland (MDL) (Multidistrict"
"1623","Litigation 1586-In re Mutual Funds Investment"
"1624","Litigation).  The 11 Complaints originally filed"
"1625","in the Southern District of New York that were"
"1626","transferred to the MDL were virtually identical"
"1627","and each asserted claims against Deutsche Bank AG,"
"1628","Deutsche Investment Management"
"1629","Americas Inc. (DIMA) and Deutsche Asset Management,"
"1630","Inc. as well as approximately 85"
"1631","Funds in the Scudder and Deutsche family of funds and"
"1632","John Doe defendants.  The three cases"
"1633","that were originally filed in the Eastern District of"
"1634","New York and the one case originally filed in"
"1635","the District of Delaware are derivative actions"

"1641","complaints, one a Consolidated Amended"
"1642","Class Action Complaint and the other a Consolidated"
"1643","Amended Fund Derivative Complaint,"
"1644","were filed in the MDL."
"1645","On January 11, 2006, Plaintiffs filed a Second"
"1646","Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint"
"1647","in the MDL.  The officer defendants have been"
"1648","voluntarily dismissed from the class action"
"1649","pursuant to a tolling agreement with Plaintiffs."
"1650","Deutsche Bank AG has been dismissed from the"
"1651","derivative action.  On March 16, 2007, the Court"
"1652","issued an opinion in the MDL granting in part"
"1653","and denying in part the Deutsche Defendants' motion to"
"1654","dismiss the Second Consolidated"
"1655","Amended Class Action Complaint."
"1656","Plaintiffs filed a Third Consolidated Amended Class"

"1662","order, the Third Amended Complaint"
"1663","added a new Plaintiff in an attempt to address"
"1664","standing challenges raised by the Defendants.  On"
"1665","January 16, 2008, the Court granted in part and denied"
"1666","in part the Defendants' motion to dismiss"
"1667","certain claims on standing grounds.  The parties"
"1668","conducted extensive discovery.  The Defendants"
"1669","filed a motion for summary judgment and various"
"1670","related motions, and Class Plaintiffs"
"1671","contemporaneously filed a motion for class"
"1672","certification. The Court heard oral argument on these"
"1673","motions on December 10-11, 2008."
"1674","On February 12, 2010, the parties agreed to a"
"1675","stipulation and agreement of settlement, which is"
"1676","subject to approval by the Court.  Plaintiffs filed"
"1677","their motions for preliminary approval of the"
"1678","settlement with the Court on April 21, 2010.  The"
"1679","Court conducted a hearing on May 7, 2010 on"
"1680","those motions and granted preliminary approval of the"

"1686","Circuit Court for Madison County,"
"1687","Illinois, entitled Potter v. Janus Investment Fund, et"
"1688","al.  Defendants include, among others,"
"1689","DIMA and the Scudder International Fund. On October"
"1690","23, 2003, Defendants removed the action"

"1692","District of Illinois. On February 9, 2004 the"
"1693","District Court remanded the case back to the Circuit"
"1694","Court for Madison County.  Defendants"
"1695","appealed this decision.  On April 5, 2005 the Seventh"
"1696","Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the"
"1697","District Court's decision and instructed the District"
"1698","Court to undo the remand order and dismiss"
"1699","the complaint.  On May 27, 2005, the District Court,"
"1700","in accord with the Seventh Circuit's"
"1701","mandate, dismissed the action with prejudice.  On"
"1702","September 29, 2005, Plaintiffs filed a petition"
"1703","for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the"
"1704","United States.  On January 6, 2006, the"
"1705","Supreme Court granted the petition to address"
"1706","jurisdictional questions.  On June 15, 2006, the"
"1707","Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Seventh"
"1708","Circuit and held that the Court of Appeals"
"1709","did not have jurisdiction to address the District"

"1711","and reopened in the Circuit Court for Madison County."
"1712","On November 13, 2006, Defendants"

"1714","second time.  On April 6, 2007, the District"
"1715","Court remanded the case back to the Circuit Court for"
"1716","Madison County.  Defendants appealed"
"1717","this decision to the Seventh Circuit, which dismissed"
"1718","the appeal for lack of jurisdiction on July"
"1719","13, 2007.  The case is now back in the Circuit Court"
"1720","for Madison County.  Argument on"
"1721","Defendants' motion to dismiss occurred in August 2007,"
"1722","and the parties are awaiting the Circuit"
"1723","Court's decision.  The Circuit Court issued an Order"
"1724","dated July 16, 2008 stating that the issues"
"1725","raised by the motion to dismiss are nearly identical"
"1726","to those in a pending appeal in an action"
"1727","involving the Putnam funds, and that the Court would"
"1728","therefore wait for the decision of the"
"1729","Illinois Appellate Court in that case before ruling on"
"1730","the motion to dismiss."
"1731","On January 6, 2010, the Illinois Appellate Court ruled"
"1732","in favor of the Putnam fund defendants"
"1733","and against Plaintiffs in that action, holding that"
"1734","Plaintiffs' claims are precluded by the Securities"
"1735","Litigation Uniform Standards Act.  Plaintiffs filed a"
"1736","motion for rehearing in the Illinois Appellate"
"1737","Court, which was denied on February 16, 2010.  The"
"1738","Illinois Appellate Court issued its mandate"
"1739","on March 30, 2010, and on April 5, 2010, the Circuit"
"1740","Court dismissed the Putnam action with"
"1741","prejudice.  On April 15, 2010, Defendants in the"
"1742","Scudder action filed a supplemental"
"1743","memorandum in support of their pending motion to"
"1744","dismiss.  On April 15, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a"
"1745","motion in the Putnam case to modify the order"
"1746","dismissing that action and for leave to file an"
"1747","amended complaint.  On April 20, 2010, Plaintiffs"
"1748","filed a motion for leave to file a Second"
"1749","Amended Complaint in the Scudder action, which"
"1750","Defendants have opposed.  The parties"
"1751","appeared for a hearing before the Circuit Court on"
"1752","April 23, 2010 and await the decision of that"
"1753","court on the pending motions."
"1754","Federal Court Revenue Sharing Litigation:"
