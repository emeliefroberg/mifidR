"2021","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"2022","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM Equity Funds (Invesco Equity"
"2023","Funds):"
"2024","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Invesco"
"2025","Charter Fund, Invesco Constellation Fund, Invesco Disciplined Equity Fund,"
"2026","Invesco Summit Fund and Invesco Diversified Dividend Fund (hereafter referred"
"2027","to as the Funds), as of and for the year ended October 31, 2012, in"
"2028","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"2029","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2030","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"2031","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"2032","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"2033","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"2034","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an"
"2035","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2036","reporting."
"2037","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"2038","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"2039","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"2040","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"2041","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2042","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"2043","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"2044","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"2045","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2046","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2047","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"2048","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"2049","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"2050","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"2051","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"2052","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"2053","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"2054","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2055","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2056","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2057","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"2058","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"2059","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2060","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"2061","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"2062","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2063","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2064","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"2065","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2066","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"2067","on a timely basis."
"2068","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"2069","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"2070","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"2071","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"2072","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"2073","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"2074","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"2075","be material weaknesses as defined above as of October 31, 2012."
"2076","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"2077","the Board of Trustees of AIM Equity Funds (Invesco Equity Funds) and the"
"2078","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be"
"2079","used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"2094","                               LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"2095","On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Securities Commissioner (WVSC) issued a"
"2096","Summary Order to Cease and Desist and Notice of Right to Hearing to AIM"
"2097","Advisors, Inc. and AIM Distributors, Inc. (predecessors to Invesco Advisers,"
"2098","Inc. and Invesco Distributors, Inc., respectively) (collectively, Invesco)"
"2099","(Order No. 05-1318). The WVSC alleged that Invesco entered into certain"
"2100","arrangements permitting market timing and failed to disclose these arrangements"
"2101","in violation of the West Virginia securities laws. The WVSC ordered Invesco to"
"2102","cease any further violations and sought to impose monetary sanctions, including"
"2103","restitution to affected investors, disgorgement of fees, reimbursement of"
"2104","investigatory, administrative and legal costs and an administrative
assessment to be determined by the Commissioner. On October 27, 2011, a"
"2105","hearing examiner was appointed to this matter. This matter continues to be"
"2106","indefinitely suspended."
"2107","Management of Invesco and the Trust believe that the outcome of the proceedings"
"2108","described above will not have a material adverse effect on the Trust or on the"
"2109","ability of Invesco to provide ongoing services to the Trust."

"2121","                    AIM EQUITY FUNDS (INVESCO EQUITY FUNDS)"
"2122","INVESCO CHARTER FUND AND INVESCO DIVERSIFIED DIVIDEND FUND"
"2123","On September 24, 2012, AIM Equity Funds (Invesco Equity Funds) (the Trust)"
"2124","commenced operations of Class R6 shares for the following funds:"
"2125","Invesco Charter Fund and Invesco Diversified Dividend Fund (each a Fund and"
"2126","collectively the Funds) Class R6 shares are sold at net asset value, and are"
"2127","not subject to an initial sales charge or to a CDSC. Shares of beneficial"
"2128","interest of the Trust are redeemable at their net asset value at the option of"
"2129","the shareholder or at the option of the Trust in certain circumstances, subject"
"2130","in certain circumstances to a contingent deferred sales charge. Each class of"
"2131","shares represents an interest in the same portfolio of investments. Differing"
"2132","sales charges and expenses will result in differing net asset values and"
"2133","dividends and distributions. Each share of a Fund generally has the same"
"2134","voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights; however, each class of shares"
"2135","of a Fund is subject to different sales loads, conversion features, exchange"
"2136","privileges and class-specific expenses. Only shareholders of a specific class"
"2137","may vote on matters relating to that class's distribution plan. Shareholders of"
"2138","each Fund are entitled to one vote per share (with proportionate voting for"
"2139","fractional shares), irrespective of the relative net asset value of the shares"
"2140","of a Fund. However, on matters affecting an individual Fund or class of shares,"
"2141","a separate vote of shareholders of that Fund or class is required. Shareholders"
"2142","of a Fund or class are not entitled to vote on any matter which does not affect"
"2143","that Fund or class but that requires a separate vote of another Fund or class."
"2144","When issued, shares of each Fund are fully paid and nonassessable, have no"
"2145","preemptive or subscription rights, and are freely transferable. Class R6 shares"
"2146","do not have conversion rights. Class R6 shares do not have cumulative voting"
"2147","rights, which means that when shareholders elect trustees, holders of more than"
"2148","50% of the shares voting for the election of trustees can elect all of the"
"2149","trustees of the Trust, and the holders of fewer than 50% of the shares voting"
"2150","for the election of trustees will not be able to elect any trustees. Upon any"
"2151","liquidation of the Trust, shareholders of each class are entitled to share pro"
"2152","rata in the net assets belonging to the applicable Fund allocable to such class"
"2153","available for distribution after satisfaction of outstanding liabilities of the"
"2154","Fund allocable to such class."
"2155","Under Delaware law, shareholders of a Delaware statutory trust shall be"
"2156","entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to shareholders"
"2157","of private for-profit corporations organized under Delaware law. There is a"
"2158","remote possibility, however, that shareholders could, under certain"
"2159","circumstances, be held liable for the obligations of the Trust to the extent"
"2160","the courts of another state, which does not recognize such limited liability,"
"2161","were to apply the laws of such state to a controversy involving such"
"2162","obligations. The Trust Agreement disclaims shareholder liability for acts or"
"2163","obligations of the Trust and requires that notice of such disclaimer be given"
"2164","in each agreement, obligation or instrument entered into or executed by the"
"2165","Trust or the trustees to all parties. The Trust Agreement provides for"
"2166","indemnification out of the property of the Fund for all losses and expenses of"
"2167","any shareholder of such Fund held liable on account of being or having been a"
"2168","shareholder. Thus, the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss due to"
"2169","shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which the Fund is unable"
"2170","to meet its obligations and the complaining party is not held to be bound by"
"2171","the disclaimer."
