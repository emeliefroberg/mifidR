"21435","purposes."
"21436","(5)	Redemption.  All shares of stock of the Corporation"

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


The Shareholders and Board of Directors
Principal Funds, Inc.

In planning and performing our audits of the
financial statements of each of the
Principal Funds, Inc. listed in Exhibit A
attached hereto (the Funds) as of and
for the period ended October 31, 2013, in
accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
we considered
the Funds' internal controls over financial reporting,
including controls over
safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our
auditing procedures for the
purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements
and to comply
with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose
of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'  internal control
over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and
maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting. In
fulfilling this responsibility,
estimates and judgments by management are required to
assess the expected
benefits and related costs of controls. A company's
internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that

receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's
assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may
not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists
when the design
or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,
in the
normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent
or detect
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a
deficiency, or a
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial
reporting, such
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the
company's annual or interim financial statements will not be
prevented or
detected on a timely basis.

Our consideration of Funds'  internal control over financial
reporting was for the

limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not
necessarily
disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material
weaknesses
under standards established by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). However, we noted no
deficiencies in the Funds'
internal
control over financial reporting and its operation,
including controls for
safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material
weakness as
defined
above as of October 31, 2013.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of
management and
the Board of Directors of the Funds and the Securities and Exchange
Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by
anyone other
than these specified parties.
