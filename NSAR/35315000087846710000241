"664","</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>To the Trustees of Fidelity Fixed-Income Trust and the Shareholders of Fidelity Strategic Real Return Fund:</P>"
"665","<P>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Fidelity Strategic Real Return Fund (the &quot;Fund&quot;), a fund of Fidelity Fixed-Income Trust, as of and for the year ended September 30, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered its internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. </P>"
"666","<P>The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A funds internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A funds internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and "
"667","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a funds assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
"668","<P>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"
"669","<P>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.&nbsp; A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</P>"
"670","<P>Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls for safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as of September 30, 2010.</P>"
"671","<P>This report is intended solely for the information and use of management, the Trustees of Fidelity Fixed-Income Trust, including Fidelity Strategic Real Return Fund, and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.</P>"

"2182","<P ALIGN=CENTER>FIDELITY MANAGEMENT &amp; RESEARCH COMPANY"
"2183","</P>"
"2184","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	AGREEMENT made this 24th day of September, 2010, by and between Fidelity Investments Money"
"2185","Management, Inc., a New Hampshire corporation with principal offices at 1 Spartan Way, Merrimack, New"
"2186","Hampshire (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Sub-Adviser&quot;) and Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, a Massachusetts corporation with principal offices at 82 Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts (hereinafter called the"
"2187","&acute;&acute;Adviser&quot;)."
"2188","</P>"
"2189","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Adviser has entered into a Management Contract with Fidelity Fixed-Income Trust, a"
"2190","Massachusetts business trust which may issue one or more series of shares of beneficial interest (hereinafter"
"2191","called the &acute;&acute;Fund&quot;), on behalf of Fidelity Strategic Real Return Fund (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Portfolio&quot;), pursuant to which the Adviser is to act as investment manager and adviser to the Portfolio, and"
"2192","</P>"
"2193","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Sub-Adviser was formed for the purpose of providing investment management of money"
"2194","market and fixed-income mutual funds, both taxable and tax-exempt, advising generally with respect to money"
"2195","market and fixed-income instruments, and managing or providing advice with respect to cash management."
"2196","</P>"
"2197","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises hereinafter set forth, the"
"2198","Adviser and the Sub-Adviser agree as follows:"
"2199","</P>"
"2200","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	1.	(a)  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Adviser, direct the investments of all"
"2201","or such portion of the Portfolio's assets as the Adviser shall designate in accordance with the investment objective, policies and limitations as provided in the Portfolio's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as"
"2202","amended from time to time, the Investment Company Act of l940 and rules thereunder, as amended from time to"
"2203","time (the &acute;&acute;l940 Act&quot;), and such other limitations as the Portfolio may impose by notice in writing to the Adviser"
"2204","or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish for the use of the Portfolio office space and all necessary"
"2205","office facilities, equipment and personnel for servicing the investments of the Portfolio; and shall pay the salaries"
"2206","and fees of all personnel of the Sub-Adviser performing services for the Portfolio relating to research, statistical"
"2207","and investment activities.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with the"
"2208","Portfolio or the Adviser, to buy, sell, lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment instruments on behalf of the Portfolio.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Portfolio are"
"2209","and shall at all times be subject to the control and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."
"2210","</P>"
"2211","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(b)  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations, information or analyses to the Fund and"
"2212","the Adviser as the Fund's Board of Trustees or the Adviser may request from time to time or as the Sub-Adviser"
"2213","may deem to be desirable.  The Sub-Adviser shall make recommendations to the Fund's Board of Trustees with"
"2214","respect to Portfolio policies, and shall carry out such policies as are adopted by the Trustees.  The Sub-Adviser"
"2215","shall, subject to review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other services as the Sub-Adviser shall from time"
"2216","to time determine to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under this Agreement and which are not"
"2217","otherwise furnished by the Adviser."
"2218","</P>"
"2219","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(c)  The Sub-Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's account with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated"
"2220","with the Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation"
"2221","to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or"
"2222","dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section"
"2223","28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of l934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser, Adviser or their affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or"
"2224","dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for"
"2225","the Portfolio which is in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"2226","effecting that transaction if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the"
"2227","Sub-Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  The"
"2228","Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio."
"2229","</P>"
"2230","<P ID=c__\desktop\q77q1_subadvisorycontract.htm.html.2 ALIGN=LEFT>	2.	As compensation for the services to be furnished by the Sub-Adviser hereunder, the Adviser"
"2231","agrees to pay the Sub-Adviser a monthly fee equal to 50% of the management fee which the Portfolio is obligated to pay the Adviser under the Portfolio's Management Contract with the Adviser in respect of that portion"
"2232","of the Portfolio's assets managed by the Sub-Adviser during such month.  Such fee shall not be reduced to reflect"
"2233","expense reimbursements or fee waivers by the Adviser, if any, in effect from time to time."
"2234","</P>"
"2235","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	3.	It is understood that Trustees, officers, and shareholders of the Fund are or may be or become"
"2236","interested in the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser as directors, officers or otherwise and that directors, officers and"
"2237","stockholders of the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser are or may be or become similarly interested in the Fund, and"
"2238","that the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser may be or become interested in the Fund as a shareholder or otherwise."
"2239","</P>"
"2240","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	4.	It is understood that the Portfolio will pay all its expenses other than those expressly stated to be"
"2241","payable by the Sub-Adviser hereunder or by the Adviser under the Management Contract with the Portfolio."
"2242","</P>"
"2243","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	5.	The Services of the Sub-Adviser to the Adviser are not to be deemed to be exclusive, the Sub-Adviser being free to render services to others and engage in other activities, provided, however, that such other"
"2244","services and activities do not, during the term of this Agreement, interfere, in a material manner, with the Sub-Adviser's ability to meet all of its obligations with respect to rendering investment advice hereunder.  The Sub-Adviser shall for all purposes be an independent contractor and not an agent or employee of the Adviser or the"
"2245","Fund."
"2246","</P>"
"2247","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	6.	In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of obligations or duties hereunder on the part of the Sub-Adviser, the Sub-Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the"
"2248","Advisor, the Trust or to any shareholder of the Portfolio for any act or omission in the course of, or connected"
"2249","with, rendering services hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any"
"2250","security."
"2251","</P>"
"2252","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	7.	(a)	Subject to prior termination as provided in sub-paragraph (d) of this paragraph 7, this"
"2253","Agreement shall continue in force until September 30, 2011, and indefinitely thereafter,"
"2254","but only so long as the continuance after such period shall be specifically approved at"
"2255","least annually by vote of the Fund's Board of Trustees or by vote of a majority of the"
"2256","outstanding voting securities of the Portfolio."
"2257","</P>"
"2258","<P ALIGN=LEFT>(b)	This Agreement may be modified by mutual consent subject to the provisions of Section 15 of the 1940 Act, as modified by or interpreted by any applicable order or orders"
"2259","of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &quot;Commission&quot;) or any rules or regulations adopted by, or interpretive releases or no-action letters of, the Commission or its"
"2260","staff."
"2261","</P>"
"2262","<P ALIGN=LEFT>(c)	In addition to the requirements of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph 7, the"
"2263","terms of any continuance or modification of the Agreement must have been approved"
"2264","by the vote of a majority of those Trustees of the Fund who are not parties to such"
"2265","Agreement or interested persons of any such party, cast in person at a meeting called for"
"2266","the purpose of voting on such approval."
"2267","</P>"
"2268","<P ID=c__\desktop\q77q1_subadvisorycontract.htm.html.3 ALIGN=LEFT>(d)	Either the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser or the Portfolio may, at any time on sixty (60) days'"
"2269","prior written notice to the other parties, terminate this Agreement, without payment of"
"2270","any penalty, by action of its Board of Trustees or Directors, or by vote of a majority of"
"2271","its outstanding voting securities.  This Agreement shall terminate automatically upon"
"2272","the termination of the Management Contract between the Fund, on behalf of the Portfolio, and the Adviser.  This Agreement shall terminate automatically in the event of its"
"2273","assignment."
"2274","</P>"
"2275","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	8.	The Sub-Adviser is hereby expressly put on notice of the limitation of shareholder liability as set"
