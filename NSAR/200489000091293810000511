"1336","REPORTOF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1337","To the Board of Trustees of MFS Series Trust V and  Shareholders of MFS Research"
"1338","Fund and MFS Total Return Fund:"
"1339","In  planning  and  performing  our  audits of the  financial  statements  of MFS"
"1340","Research  Fund  and MFS  Total  Return  Fund  (the  Funds)  (each a  portfolio"
"1341","comprising MFS Series Trust V) as of and for the year ended  September 30, 2010,"
"1342","in accordance  with the  standards of the Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight"
"1343","Board (United States),  we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1344","reporting,  including  controls  over  safeguarding  securities,  as a basis for"
"1345","designing our auditing  procedures  for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1346","the financial  statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"1347","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the  effectiveness of the Funds'"
"1348","internal  control over  financial  reporting.  Accordingly,  we express no such"
"1349","opinion."
"1350","The  management of the Funds is responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining"
"1351","effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  In  fulfilling  this"
"1352","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1353","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"1354","financial  reporting  is a process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance"
"1355","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"1356","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1357","accounting  principles.  A fund's  internal  control over  financial  reporting"
"1358","includes those policies and  procedures  that (1) pertain to the  maintenance of"
"1359","records  that,  in  reasonable   detail,   accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the"
"1360","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide  reasonable"
"1361","assurance that  transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of"
"1362","financial   statements  in  accordance   with  generally   accepted   accounting"
"1363","principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"1364","in accordance with  authorizations  of management and trustees of the trust; and"
"1365","(3) provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection of"
"1366","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"1367","a material effect on the financial statements."
"1368","Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting"
"1369","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1370","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1371","inadequate  because of changes in  conditions  or that the degree of  compliance"
"1372","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1373","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"1374","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,  in the normal"
"1375","course  of  performing   their   assigned   functions,   to  prevent  or  detect"
"1376","misstatements  on a timely  basis. A material  weakness is a  deficiency,  or a"
"1377","combination of deficiencies,  in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1378","that  there is a  reasonable  possibility  that a material  misstatement  of the"
"1379","fund's annual or interim financial  statements will not be prevented or detected"
"1380","on a timely basis."
"1381","Our  consideration of the Funds' internal  control over financial  reporting was"
"1382","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in the  first  paragraph  and  would  not"
"1383","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1384","weaknesses  under  standards   established  by  the  Public  Company  Accounting"
"1385","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"1386","internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  their  operation,  including"
"1387","controls  for  safeguarding  securities,  that  we  consider  to  be a  material"
"1388","weakness, as defined above, as of September 30, 2010."
"1389","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"1390","Board of  Trustees  of MFS  Research  Fund  and MFS  Total  Return  Fund and the"
"1391","Securities  and Exchange  Commission and is not intended to be and should not be"
"1392","used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1416","The  management of the Fund is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining"
"1417","effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.   In  fulfilling  this"
"1418","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1419","expected  benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's  internal control"
"1420","over financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance"
"1421","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"1422","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1423","accounting  principles.  A company's  internal control over financial  reporting"
"1424","includes those policies and  procedures  that (1) pertain to the  maintenance of"
"1425","records  that,  in  reasonable   detail,   accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the"
"1426","transactions  and  dispositions  of the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide"
"1427","reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded as  necessary to permit"
"1428","preparation  of financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted"
"1429","accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are"
"1430","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"1431","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1432","detection of unauthorized acquisition,  use or disposition of a company's assets"
"1433","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1434","Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting"
"1435","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1436","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1437","inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the degree of compliance"
"1438","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1439","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"1440","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,  in the normal"
"1441","course  of  performing   their   assigned   functions,   to  prevent  or  detect"
"1442","misstatements  on a timely  basis.  A material  weakness is a  deficiency,  or a"
"1443","combination of deficiencies,  in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1444","that  there is a  reasonable  possibility  that a material  misstatement  of the"
"1445","company's  annual or  interim  financial  statements  will not be  prevented  or"
"1446","detected on a timely basis."
"1447","Our  consideration of the Fund's internal  control over financial  reporting was"
"1448","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in the  first  paragraph  and  would  not"
"1449","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1450","weaknesses  under  standards   established  by  the  Public  Company  Accounting"
"1451","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"1452","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,  including controls"
"1453","over  safeguarding  securities  that we  consider  to be a material  weakness as"
"1454","defined above as of September 30, 2010."

"1458","these specified parties."
