"1647","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1648","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's"

"1650","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1651","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"1652","on the financial statements and to comply with the"

"1657","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"

"1661","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal"
"1662","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1663","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1664","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1665","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1666","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over"
"1667","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"1668","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1669","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1670","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"1671","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1672","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"

"1677","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1678","use, or disposition of the fund's assets that could have a"
"1679","material effect on the financial statements."
"1680","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1681","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1682","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1683","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1684","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"1685","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1686","deteriorate."
"1687","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1688","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1689","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1690","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"

"1697","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"

"1833","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1834","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"1835","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1836","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1837","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1838","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"1839","in accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"1840","of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1841","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1842","use, or disposition of the fund's assets that could have a"
"1843","material effect on the financial statements."
"1844","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1845","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1846","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1847","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1848","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"1849","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1850","deteriorate."
"1851","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1852","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1853","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1854","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1855","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"1856","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1857","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1858","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1859","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1860","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1861","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"1862","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"1863","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"1864","deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1865","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1866","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted"
"1867","no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1868","reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"1869","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material"
"1870","weakness as defined above as of November 30, 2013."
