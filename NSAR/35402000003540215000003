"2973","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises hereinafter set forth, the"

"2988","thereunder, as amended from time to time, and such other limitations as the Trust or Advisor may impose"
"2989","with respect to the Portfolio by notice to the Sub-Advisor.  With respect to the portion of the investments of"

"2991","the Portfolio with regard to any stock, bond, other security or investment instrument, and to place orders for"
"2992","the purchase and sale of such securities through such broker-dealers as the Sub-Advisor may select.  The Sub-Advisor may also be authorized, but only to the extent such duties are delegated in writing by the Advisor, to"

"3008","Advisor or Sub-Advisor.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices"
"3009","which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"3010","Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or to the other accounts over which the Sub-Advisor or Advisor exercise"
"3011","investment discretion.  The Sub-Advisor is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and"
"3012","research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess of the"
"3013","amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor"
"3014","determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"3015","research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor has with respect to accounts over which it"
"3016","exercises investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Trust shall periodically review the commissions paid by the"
"3017","Portfolio to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the"

"3024","the Advisor agrees to pay the Sub-Advisor a monthly Sub-Advisory Fee.  The Sub-Advisory Fee shall be"
"3025","equal to 110% of the Sub-Advisor's costs incurred in connection with rendering the services referred to in"
"3026","subparagraph (a) of paragraph 1 of this Agreement.  The Sub-Advisory Fee shall not be reduced to reflect"
"3027","expense reimbursements or fee waivers by the Advisor, if any, in effect from time to time."
"3028","</P>"
"3029","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(b) <I><U>Investment Management Fee</U>:</I>  For services provided under subparagraph (b) of paragraph 1 of this Agreement, the Advisor agrees to pay the Sub-Advisor a monthly Investment Management Fee.  The Investment"
"3030","Management Fee shall be equal to: (i) 50% of the monthly management fee rate (including performance adjustments, if any) that the Portfolio is obligated to pay the Advisor under its Management Contract with the"
"3031","Advisor, multiplied by: (ii) the fraction equal to the net assets of the Portfolio as to which the Sub-Advisor"
"3032","shall have provided investment management services divided by the net assets of the Portfolio for that month;"
"3033","provided, however, that the Investment Management Fee paid to the Sub-Advisor for any period hereunder"
"3034","shall in all circumstances be an amount not less than 110% of the Sub-Advisor's costs incurred in connection"
"3035","with rendering the services referred to in subparagraph (b) of paragraph 1 of this Agreement (but in no event"
"3036","will the Investment Management Fee paid to the Sub-Advisor exceed the management fee paid to the Advisor"
"3037","pursuant to its management contract with respect to the Portfolio) (the minimum fee described in this proviso"
"3038","being referred to herein as the &quot;Minimum Investment Management Fee&quot;).  If in any fiscal year the aggregate"
"3039","expenses of the Portfolio exceed any applicable expense limitation imposed by any state or federal securities"
"3040","laws or regulations, and the Advisor waives all or a portion of its management fee or reimburses the Portfolio"
"3041","for expenses to the extent required to satisfy such limitation, the Investment Management Fee paid to the"
"3042","Sub-Advisor will be reduced by 50% of the amount of such waivers or reimbursements multiplied by the fraction determined in (ii), subject to the Minimum Investment Management Fee.  If the Sub-Advisor reduces its"
"3043","fees to reflect such waivers or reimbursements and the Advisor subsequently recovers all or any portion of"
"3044","such waivers or reimbursements, then the Sub-Advisor shall be entitled to receive from the Advisor a proportionate share of the amount recovered."

"3058","</P>"
"3059","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	7.  <U>Services to Other Companies or Accounts</U>:  The services of the Sub-Advisor to the Advisor are not to be"
"3060","deemed to be exclusive, the Sub-Advisor being free to render services to others and engage in other activities, provided, however, that such other services and activities do not, during the term of this Agreement, interfere, in a material manner, with the Sub-Advisor's ability to meet all of its obligations hereunder.  The Sub-Advisor shall for all"
"3061","purposes be an independent contractor and not an agent or employee of the Advisor or the Trust."

"3233","<P ALIGN=LEFT>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Fidelity Trend Fund (the &quot;Fund&quot;) as of and for the"
"3234","year ended December 31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"3235","Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"3236","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"3237","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"

"3239","</P>"
"3240","<P ALIGN=LEFT>The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"3241","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed"
"3242","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control"
"3243","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"3244","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"3245","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"

"3255","<P ALIGN=LEFT>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.
