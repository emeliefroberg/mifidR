"615","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"616","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A company's internal"
"617","control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"618","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"619","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and"
"620","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"621","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,"
"622","or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
