"1218","Firm"
"1219","To the Board of Trustees of Vanguard Tax-Managed Funds and"
"1220","the Shareholders of"
"1221","Vanguard Tax-Managed Capital Appreciation Fund"
"1222","Vanguard Tax-Managed Balanced Fund"
"1223","Vanguard Tax-Managed Small-Cap Fund and"
"1224","Vanguard Developed Markets Index Fund"
"1225","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1226","statements of Vanguard Tax-Managed Capital Appreciation"
"1227","Fund, Vanguard Tax-Managed Balanced Fund, Vanguard Tax-"
"1228","Managed Small-Cap Fund and Vanguard Developed Markets"
"1229","Index Fund (constituting Vanguard Tax-Managed Funds,"
"1230","hereafter referred to as the ?Trust?) as of and for the year ended"
"1231","December 31, 2015, in accordance with the standards of the"
"1232","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1233","considered the Trust?s internal control over financial reporting,"
"1234","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1235","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"1236","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1237","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1238","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust?s internal"
"1239","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express"
"1240","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control"
"1241","over financial reporting."
"1242","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"1243","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"1244","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1245","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1246","related costs of controls.  A company?s internal control over"
"1247","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1248","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1249","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1250","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1251","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1252","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1253","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"1254","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"1255","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"1256","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1257","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1258","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"1259","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1260","trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1261","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1262","acquisition, use or disposition of a company?s assets that could"
"1263","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1264","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1265","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"1266","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"1267","are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"1268","because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1269","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1270","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1271","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1272","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1273","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1274","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1275","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1276","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1277","material misstatement of the Trust's annual or interim financial"
"1278","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1279","Our consideration of the Trust?s internal control over financial"
"1280","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1281","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1282","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"1283","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1284","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"1285","no deficiencies in the Trust?s internal control over financial"
"1286","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1287","securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"1288","above as of December 31, 2015."
"1289","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1290","management and the Board of Trustees of Vanguard Tax-"

"1360","Vanguard Developed Markets Index Fund"
"1361","Supplement to the Prospectus and Summary Prospectus"
"1362","Dated April 29, 2015"
"1363","New Target Index"
"1364","Effective as of the start of business on December 21, 2015, Vanguard"
"1365","Developed Markets Index Fund has begun tracking the FTSE Developed All"
"1366","Cap ex US Transition Index (the Transition Index), on an interim basis, in"
"1367","the first phase of a two-phased index change as previously approved by the"
"1368","Fund's board of trustees."
"1369","The board of trustees has approved the FTSE Developed All Cap ex US"
"1370","Index as the new target index for the Fund, replacing the FTSE Developed"
"1371","ex North America Index. The board has also approved the addition of the"
"1372","Canadian market to the Fund's investment objective. The board believes"
"1373","that the new index will result in a more comprehensive representation of"
"1374","the Fund's market segment due to the addition of small-capitalization"
"1375","equity securities and Canadian equities."
"1376","The Fund is expected to begin tracking the FTSE Developed All Cap ex US"
"1377","Index in approximately the next six months, and the current change to the"
"1378","Transition Index is the first of two phases. This approach is intended to"
"1379","enable the Fund's advisor, The Vanguard Group, Inc., to make the necessary"
"1380"," adjustments to portfolio holdings in a manner that minimizes impact to"
"1381","Fund shareholders. In this first phase, the Fund has ceased tracking its"
"1382","former target index and has begun temporarily tracking the Transition Index,"
"1383","an interim index that will gradually increase exposure to small-capitalization"
"1384","stocks and Canadian equities while proportionately reducing exposure to other"
"1385","stocks based on their weightings in the new index. In the second phase, the"
"1386","Fund will begin tracking the final target index, the FTSE Developed All Cap ex"
"1387","US Index. During the transition phase, the Fund will invest by sampling the"
"1388","index, meaning that it will hold a broadly diversified collection of"
"1389","securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full index in terms of key"
"1390","characteristics. The Fund is expected to replicate the final target index."
"1391","Prospectus and Summary Prospectus Text Changes"
"1392","The paragraph under Investment Objective is replaced with the following:"
"1393","The Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that"
"1394","measures the investment return of stocks issued by companies located in"
"1395","Canada and the major markets of Europe and the Pacific region."
"1396","The paragraph under Principal Investment Strategies is replaced with"
"1397","the following:"
"1398","The Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the"
"1399","performance of the FTSE Developed All Cap ex US Transition Index, an"
"1400","interim index that will gradually increase exposure to small-capitalization"
"1401"," stocks and Canadian equities while proportionately reducing exposure to"
"1402","other stocks based on their weightings in the FTSE Developed All Cap ex"
"1403","US Index. The FTSE Developed All Cap ex US Index is a"
"1404","market-capitalization-weighted index that is made up of approximately"
"1405","3,700 common stocks of large-, mid-, and small-cap companies located in"
"1406","Canada and the major markets of Europe and the Pacific region. The Fund"
"1407","invests by sampling the Index, meaning that it holds a broadly"
"1408","diversified collection of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the"
"1409","interim index in terms of key characteristics. These key characteristics"
"1410","include industry weightings and market capitalization, as well as certain"
"1411","financial measures, such as price/earnings ratio and dividend yield."
"1412","The following is added under Principal Risks:"
"1413","- Index sampling risk, which is the chance that the securities selected"
"1414","for the Fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance"
"1415","matching that of the Fund's target index."
"1416","Prospectus Text Changes"
"1417","The following replaces the first sentence under Market Exposure in the"
"1418","More on the Fund section:"
"1419","The Fund invests all, substantially all, or a representative sample of its"
"1420","assets in the stocks included in the FTSE Developed All Cap ex US"
"1421","Transition Index."
"1422","Within the same section, the first paragraph under Security Selection is"
"1423","replaced with the following:"
"1424","The Fund uses the sampling method of indexing, meaning that the Fund's"
"1425","advisor, using computer programs, generally selects from the target index"
"1426","a representative sample of securities that will resemble the target index in"
"1427","terms of key risk factors and other characteristics. These include industry"
"1428","weightings, market capitalization, and other financial characteristics of"
"1429","stocks."
"1430","The Fund is subject to index sampling risk, which is the chance that"
"1431","the securities selected for the Fund, in the aggregate, will not provide"
"1432","investment performance matching that of the Fund's target index."
