"861","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"862","Accounting Firm"
"863","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"864","Federated Income Securities Trust:"
"865","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"866","financial statements of Federated Intermediate"
"867","Corporate Bond Fund and Federated Short-Term"
"868","Income Fund (two of the portfolios constituting"
"869","Federated Income Securities Trust) (collectively the"
"870","Funds) as of and for the year ended April 30,"
"871","2017, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"872","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"873","States), we considered the Funds' internal control"
"874","over financial reporting, including controls over"
"875","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"876","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"877","our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"878","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"879","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"880","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"881","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"882","such opinion."
"883","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"884","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"885","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"886","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"887","management are required to assess the expected"
"888","benefits and related costs of controls. The"
"889","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"890","is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"891","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"892","reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"893","for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"894","accepted accounting principles. A company's"
"895","internal control over financial reporting includes"
"896","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"897","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"898","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"899","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"900","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"901","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"902","financial statements in accordance with generally"
"903","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"904","and expenditures of the company are being made"
"905","only in accordance with authorizations of"
"906","management and directors of the company; and (3)"
"907","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"908","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"909","or disposition of a company's assets that could have"
"910","a material effect on the financial statements."
"911","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"912","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"913","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"914","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"915","risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"916","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"917","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"918","deteriorate."
"919","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"920","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"921","control does not allow management or employees,"
"922","in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"923","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"924","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"925","a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"926","over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"927","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"928","of the company's annual or interim financial"
"929","statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"930","timely basis."
"931","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control"
"932","over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"933","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"934","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"935","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"936","standards established by the Public Company"
"937","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"938","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"939","internal control over financial reporting and its"
"940","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"941","securities, that we consider to be a material"
"942","weakness as defined above as of April 30, 2017."
"943","This report is intended solely for the information"
"944","and use of management and the Board of Trustees"
"945","of the Funds and the Securities and Exchange"
"946","Commission and is not intended to be, and should"
"947","not be, used by anyone other than these specified"
"948","parties."

basis points (0.75%) of the public offering price. In such
event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan or
this Exhibit, such Class A Shares shall be subject to a
contingent deferred sales charge upon redemption within 24
months of purchase equal to 75 basis points (0.75%) of the
lesser of (x) the purchase price of the Class A Shares or (y) the

investor's children under age 21 (regardless
of whether the purchases or investments are
made or held directly or through an
investment professional or through a single-
participant retirement account); provided that
such purchases and investments can be linked
using tax identification numbers (TINs),

Intermediary that provides for the purchase of
Shares without imposition of a sales charge (for
example, a wrap account, self-directed
brokerage account, retirement or other fee-
based program offered by the Financial
Intermediary) and where the Financial
Intermediary has agreed with the principal
underwriter not to receive a dealer reallowance
on purchases under such program;
*
	with reinvested dividends or capital gains;
*
	or Class A Shares, issued in connection with
the merger, consolidation, or acquisition of the

terms of an agreement and plan of

acquire Shares at NAV provided that such
Shares are held directly with the Fund's transfer
agent.  If the Shares are held through a financial
intermediary the sales charge waiver will not
apply;
*

shareholders who originally were issued shares
through the Liberty Account, which was an

affinity group prior to August 1, 1987, into the
Liberty Account);
*
	by Directors, Trustees, employees, former
employees and sales representatives of the
Fund, the Adviser, the principal underwriter
and their affiliates, employees of any
investment professional that sells Shares
according to a sales agreement with the

*
	following the death of the last surviving
shareholder or post-purchase disability, as
defined in Section 72(m)(7) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986;
*
	due to the termination of a trust following the
death of the trustor/grantor or beneficiary,
provided that the trust document specifically
states that the trust is terminated upon the death
*
	representing minimum required distributions
(RMD) from an Individual Retirement
Account or other retirement plan as required
under the Internal Revenue Code;
*
	of Shares that were reinvested within 120 days
of a previous redemption;
*
	of Shares held by the Directors, Trustees,
employees, former employees and sales
representatives of the Fund, the Adviser, the

program offered by a Financial Intermediary
that provides for the purchase of Shares without
imposition of a sales charge (for example, a
wrap account, self-directed brokerage account,
retirement, or other fee-based program offered
by the Financial Intermediary) and where the
Financial Intermediary has agreed with the
principal underwriter not to receive an
advanced commission on purchases under such
program;
*
	of Shares purchased with reinvested dividends
or capital gains;
*
	imposed by the Fund when it closes an account

4.	SPECIAL OFFER PROGRAM

[NOTE: The 30 month CDSC period connected with of this
program expired in September of 2002]

2000, the sales load was waived on purchases of Class A
Shares of Federated Aggressive Growth Fund, Federated
Communications Technology Fund, Federated Large Cap
Growth Fund, and Federated International Small Company
Fund (the Special Offer Funds).  Instead, the principal
underwriter paid an advance commission of 2.00% of the
offering price of the Special Offer Funds to intermediaries
participating in the Special Offer Program.  Class A Shares
purchased through this Special Offer were subject to a CDSC
of 2.00% on redemptions which occurred within 30 months
after the purchase, which amount was to be paid to the
principal underwriter in consideration for advancing the
commission to intermediaries.  Class A Shares of the Special
Offer Funds purchased during the Special Offer Program
could be exchanged with Class A Shares of other Special
Offer Funds with no imposition of a sales load or CDSC fee.
Class A Shares of the Special Offer Funds purchased during
the Special Offer Program which were exchanged for Class A
Shares of other Funds during the 30 month CDSC period
incurred the CDSC fee upon redemption.  However, no sales
load was charged for such an exchange.

received upon the redemption or exchange of Class A Shares
will be applied to fees incurred or amount expended in

any redemption fees shall be paid to the Fund.

A Fund shall waive any redemption fee with respect to (i) non-
participant directed redemptions or exchanges involving Class
A Shares held in retirement plans established under Section
401(a) or 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code),
custodial plan accounts established under Section 493(b)(7) of
