"487","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT"
"488","REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING"
"489","FIRM"
"490","To the Board of Trustees of Northern"
"491","Lights Fund Trust III"
"492","and the Shareholders of The Covered"
"493","Bridge Fund"
"494","In planning and performing our audit of"
"495","the financial statements of The Covered"
"496","Bridge Fund (the Fund), a series of"
"497","shares of beneficial interest in Northern"
"498","Lights Fund Trust III, as of September"
"499","30, 2016 and for the year then ended, in"
"500","accordance with the standards of the"
"501","Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"502","Board (United States) (PCAOB), we"
"503","considered the Fund's internal control"
"504","over financial reporting, including"
"505","controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"506","a basis for designing our auditing"
"507","procedures for the purpose of"
"508","expressing our opinion on the financial"
"509","statements and to comply with the"
"510","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"511","for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"512","on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"513","internal control over financial reporting."
"514","Accordingly, we express no such"
"515","opinion."
"516","The management of the Fund is"
"517","responsible for establishing and"
"518","maintaining effective internal control"
"519","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"520","responsibility, estimates and judgments"
"521","by management are required to assess"
"522","the expected benefits and related costs"
"523","of controls.  A company's internal"
"524","control over financial reporting is a"
"525","process designed to provide reasonable"
"526","assurance regarding the reliability of"
"527","financial reporting and the preparation of"
"528","financial statements for external"
"529","purposes in accordance with accounting"
"530","principles generally accepted in the"
"531","United States of America (GAAP).  A"
"532","company's internal control over financial"
"533","reporting includes those policies and"
"534","procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"535","maintenance of records that, in"
"536","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"537","reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"538","of the assets of the company; (2)"
"539","provide reasonable assurance that"
"540","transactions are recorded as necessary"
"541","to permit preparation of the financial"
"542","statements in accordance with GAAP,"
"543","and that receipts and expenditures of"
"544","the company are being made only in"
"545","accordance with authorizations of"
"546","management and trustees of the"
"547","company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"548","assurance regarding prevention or"
"549","timely detection of unauthorized"
"550","acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"551","company's assets that could have a"
"552","material effect on the financial"
"553","statements."
"554","Because of inherent limitations, internal"
"555","control over financial reporting may not"
"556","prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"557","projections of any evaluation of"
"558","effectiveness to future periods are"
"559","subject to the risk that controls may"
"560","become inadequate because of"
"561","changes in conditions or that the degree"
"562","of compliance with the policies or"
"563","procedures may deteriorate."
"564","A deficiency in internal control over"
"565","financial reporting exists when the"
"566","design or operation of a control does not"
"567","allow management or employees, in the"
"568","normal course of performing their"
"569","assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"570","misstatements on a timely basis.  A"
"571","material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"572","combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"573","control over financial reporting, such"
"574","that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"575","a material misstatement of the Fund's"
"576","annual or interim financial statements"
"577","will not be prevented or detected on a"
"578","timely basis."
"579","Our consideration of the Fund's internal"
"580","control over financial reporting was for"
"581","the limited purpose described in the first"
"582","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"583","disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"584","control that might be material"
"585","weaknesses under standards"
"586","established by the PCAOB.  However,"
"587","we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"588","internal control over financial reporting"
"589","and its operation, including controls over"
"590","safeguarding securities that we consider"
"591","to be a material weakness, as defined"
"592","above, as of September 30, 2016."
"593","This report is intended solely for the"
"594","information and use of management, the"
"595","shareholders of The Covered Bridge"
"596","Fund, the Board of Trustees of Northern"
"597","Lights Fund Trust III and the Securities"
"598","and Exchange Commission and is not"
"599","intended to be and should not be used"
"600","by anyone other than these specified"
"601","parties."
