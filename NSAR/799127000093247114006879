"1018","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"1019","Firm"
"1020","To the Board of Trustees of Vanguard Quantitative Funds and the"
"1021","Shareholders of"
"1022","Vanguard Structured Large-Cap Equity Fund and"
"1023","Vanguard Structured Broad Market Fund"
"1024","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1025","statements of Vanguard Structured Large-Cap Equity Fund and"
"1026","Vanguard Structured Broad Market Fund (constituting separate"
"1027","portfolios of Vanguard Quantitative Funds, hereafter referred to"
"1028","as the ?Funds?) as of and for the year ended September 30, 2014,"
"1029","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1030","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1031","Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1032","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1033","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1034","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"1035","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1036","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1037","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"1038","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1039","reporting."
"1040","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"1041","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"1042","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1043","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1044","related costs of controls.  A company?s internal control over"
"1045","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1046","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1047","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1048","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1049","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1050","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1051","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"1052","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"1053","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"1054","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1055","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1056","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"1057","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1058","trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1059","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1060","acquisition, use or disposition of a company?s assets that could"

"1105","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"1106","Firm"
"1107","To the Board of Trustees of Vanguard Quantitative Funds and the"
"1108","Shareholders of"
"1109","Vanguard Growth and Income Fund"
"1110","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"1111","of Vanguard Growth and Income Fund (constituting a separate"
"1112","portfolio of Vanguard Quantitative Funds, hereafter referred to"
"1113","as the ?Fund?) as of and for the year ended September 30, 2014,"
"1114","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1115","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1116","Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1117","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1118","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1119","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"1120","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1121","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1122","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"1123","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1124","reporting."
"1125","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1126","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"1127","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1128","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1129","related costs of controls.  A company?s internal control over"
"1130","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1131","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1132","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1133","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1134","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1135","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1136","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"1137","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"1138","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"1139","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1140","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1141","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"1142","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1143","trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1144","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1145","acquisition, use or disposition of a company?s assets that could"
"1146","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1147","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1148","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"1149","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"1150","are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
