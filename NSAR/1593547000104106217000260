"852","Report of Independent"
"853","Registered Public"
"854","Accounting Firm"
"855","To the Board of Trustees of The"
"856","Advisors Inner Circle Fund III and"
"857","the Shareholders of the Companies, as"
"858","defined:"
"859","In planning and performing our audits"
"860","of the financial statements of SGA"
"861","International Equity Fund and GQG"
"862","Partners Emerging Markets Equity Fund"
"863","(two of the funds constituting The"
"864","Advisors Inner Circle Fund III,"
"865","hereafter referred to as the"
"866","Companies) as of and for the period"
"867","ended July 31, 2017, in accordance"
"868","with the standards of the Public"
"869","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"870","(United States), we considered the"
"871","Companies internal control over"
"872","financial reporting, including"
"873","controls over safeguarding"
"874","securities, as a basis for designing"
"875","our auditing procedures for the"
"876","purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"877","the financial statements and to"
"878","comply with the requirements of Form"
"879","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"880","expressing an opinion on the"
"881","effectiveness of the Companies"
"882","internal control over financial"
"883","reporting."
"884","Accordingly, we do not express an"
"885","opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"886","Companies internal control over"
"887","financial reporting."
"888","The management of the Companies is"
"889","responsible for establishing and"
"890","maintaining effective internal"
"891","control over financial reporting. In"
"892","fulfilling this responsibility,"
"893","estimates and judgments by management"
"894","are required to assess the expected"
"895","benefits and related costs of"
"896","controls. A companys internal control"
"897","over financial reporting is a process"
"898","designed to provide reasonable"
"899","assurance regarding the reliability"
"900","of financial reporting and the"
"901","preparation of financial statements"
"902","for external purposes in accordance"
"903","with generally accepted accounting"
"904","principles. A companys internal"
"905","control over financial reporting"
"906","includes those policies and"
"907","procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"908","maintenance of records that, in"
"909","reasonable detail, accurately and"
"910","fairly reflect the transactions and"
"911","dispositions of the assets of the"
"912","company; (2) provide reasonable"
"913","assurance that transactions are"
"914","recorded as necessary to permit"
"915","preparation of financial statements"
"916","in accordance with generally accepted"
"917","accounting principles, and that"
"918","receipts and  expenditures of the"
"919","company are being made only in"
"920","accordance with authorizations of"
"921","management and trustees of the"
"922","company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"923","assurance regarding prevention or"
"924","timely detection of unauthorized"
"925","acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"926","companys assets that could have a"
"927","material effect on the financial"
"928","statements."
"929","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"930","internal control over financial"
"931","reporting may not prevent or detect"
"932","misstatements. Also, projections of"
"933","any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"934","future periods are subject to the"
"935","risk that controls may become"
"936","inadequate because of changes in"
"937","conditions, or that the degree of"
"938","compliance with the policies or"
"939","procedures may deteriorate."
"940","A deficiency in internal control over"
"941","financial reporting exists when the"
"942","design or operation of a control does"
"943","not allow management or employees, in"
"944","the normal course of performing their"
"945","assigned functions, to prevent or"
"946","detect misstatements on a timely"
"947","basis. A material weakness is a"
"948","deficiency, or a combination of"
"949","deficiencies, in internal control"
"950","over financial reporting, such that"
"951","there is a reasonable possibility"
"952","that a material misstatement of the"
"953","Companies annual or interim financial"
"954","statements will not be prevented or"
"955","detected on a timely basis"
"956","Our consideration of the Companies"
"957","internal control over financial"
"958","reporting was for the limited purpose"
"959","described in the first paragraph and"
"960","would not necessarily disclose all"
"961","deficiencies in internal control"
"962","over financial reporting that might"
"963","be material weaknesses under"
"964","standards established by the Public"
"965","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"966","(United States). However, we noted"
"967","no deficiencies in the Companies"
"968","internal control over financial"
"969","reporting and its operation,"
"970","including controls over safeguarding"
"971","securities, that we consider to be"
"972","material weaknesses as defined above"
"973","as of July 31, 2017."
"974","This report is intended solely for the"
"975","information and use of management and"
