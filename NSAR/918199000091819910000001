"1922","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1923","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"1924","Federated World Investment Series, Inc.:"
"1925","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"1926","financial statements of Federated International High"
"1927","Income Fund, Federated International Small-Mid"
"1928","Company Fund and Federated International"
"1929","Leaders Fund (formerly Federated International"
"1930","Value Fund) (the three portfolios comprising"
"1931","Federated World Investment Series, Inc.) (the Funds)"
"1932","as of and for the year ended November"
"1933","30, 2009, in accordance with the standards of the"
"1934","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1935","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"1936","control over financial reporting, including"
"1937","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"1938","for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1939","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1940","statements and to comply with the"
"1941","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"1942","of expressing an opinion on the"
"1943","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"1944","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no"
"1945","such opinion."
"1946","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"1947","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1948","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1949","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1950","management are required to assess the expected benefits"
"1951","and related costs of controls. A"
"1952","company's internal control over financial reporting is"
"1953","a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1954","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"1955","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1956","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1957","generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1958","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"1959","includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1960","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1961","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1962","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"1963","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1964","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1965","preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"1966","with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1967","that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"1968","are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"1969","of management and directors of the"
"1970","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1971","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1972","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"1973","company's assets that could have a material"
"1974","effect on the financial statements."
"1975","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1976","over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"1977","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1978","of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1979","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1980","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"1981","the degree of compliance with the policies"
"1982","or procedures may deteriorate."
"1983","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1984","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1985","control does not allow management or employees,"
"1986","in the normal course of performing their"
"1987","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"1988","on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1989","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"1990","internal control over financial reporting, such that"
"1991","there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1992","misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"1993","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1994","detected on a timely basis."
"1995","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control"
"1996","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"1997","purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"1998","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1999","internal control that might be material weaknesses"
"2000","under standards established by the Public"
"2001","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"2002","However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"2003","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"2004","and its operation, including controls over"
"2005","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"2006","material weakness as defined above as of"
"2007","November 30, 2009."
"2008","This report is intended solely for the information"
"2009","and use of management and the Board of"

"2024","SUB-ITEM 77E:  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"2025","Since October 2003, Federated and related entities"
"2026","(collectively, Federated), and various Federated funds"
"2027","(Funds), have been named as defendants in several"
"2028","class action lawsuits now pending in the United States"
"2029","District Court for the District of Maryland. The"
"2030","lawsuits were purportedly filed on behalf of people who"
"2031","purchased, owned and/or redeemed shares of"
"2032","Federated-sponsored mutual funds during specified periods"
"2033","beginning November 1, 1998. The suits are generally"
"2034","similar in alleging that Federated engaged in illegal"
"2035","and improper trading practices including market timing"
"2036","and late trading in concert with certain institutional"
"2037","traders, which allegedly caused financial injury to the"
"2038","mutual fund shareholders. These lawsuits began to be"
"2039","filed shortly after Federated's first public announcement"
"2040","that it had received requests for information on"
"2041","shareholder trading activities in the Funds from"
"2042","the SEC, the Office of the New York State Attorney"
"2043","General (NYAG), and other authorities. In that"
"2044","regard, on November 28, 2005, Federated announced that"
"2045","it had reached final settlements with the SEC and"
"2046","the NYAG with respect to those matters. Specifically, the"
"2047","SEC and NYAG settled proceedings against three"
"2048","Federated subsidiaries involving undisclosed market"
"2049","timing arrangements and late trading. The SEC made"
"2050","findings: that Federated Investment Management"
"2051","Company (FIMC), an SEC-registered investment"
"2052","adviser to various Funds, and Federated Securities"
"2053","Corp., an SEC-registered broker-dealer and distributor"
"2054","for the Funds, violated provisions of the Investment"
"2055","Advisers Act and Investment Company Act by approving,"
"2056","but not disclosing, three market timing"
"2057","arrangements, or the associated conflict of interest"
"2058","between FIMC and the funds involved in the"
"2059","arrangements, either to other fund shareholders or"
"2060","to the funds' board; and that Federated Shareholder"
"2061","Services Company, formerly an SEC-registered transfer"
"2062","agent, failed to prevent a customer and a Federated"
"2063","employee from late trading in violation of provisions"
"2064","of the Investment Company Act. The NYAG found"
"2065","that such conduct violated provisions of New York"
"2066","State law. Federated entered into the settlements"
"2067","without admitting or denying the regulators' findings."
"2068","As Federated previously reported in 2004, it has"
"2069","already paid approximately $8.0 million to certain"
"2070","funds as determined by an independent consultant. As"
"2071","part of these settlements, Federated agreed to pay"
"2072","disgorgement and a civil money penalty in the aggregate"
"2073","amount of an additional $72 million and, among other things,"
"2074","agreed that it would not serve as investment"
"2075","adviser to any registered investment company"
"2076","unless (i) at least 75% of the fund's directors are independent"
"2077","of Federated, (ii) the chairman of each such"
"2078","fund is independent of Federated, (iii)"
"2079","no action may be taken"
"2080","by the fund's board or any committee thereof"
"2081","unless approved by a majority of the independent trustees of"
"2082","the fund or committee, respectively, and (iv) the"
"2083","fund appoints a senior officer who reports to the"
"2084","independent trustees and is responsible for"
"2085","monitoring compliance by the fund with applicable laws and"
"2086","fiduciary duties and for managing the process"
"2087","by which management fees charged to a fund are approved."
"2088","The settlements are described in Federated's"
"2089","announcement which, along with previous press releases and"
"2090","related communications on those matters, is"
"2091","available in the About Us section of"
"2092","Federated's website at"
"2093","FederatedInvestors.com."
"2094","Federated entities have also been named as"
"2095","defendants in several additional lawsuits that are now pending"
"2096","in the United States District Court for the"
"2097","Western District of Pennsylvania, alleging, among other things,"
"2098","excessive advisory and Rule 12b-1 fees."
"2099","The Board of the Funds retained the law firm"
"2100","of Dickstein Shapiro LLP to represent the Funds in each of"
"2101","the lawsuits described in the preceding two paragraphs."
"2102","Federated and the Funds, and their respective"
"2103","counsel, have been defending this litigation,"
"2104","and none of the Funds remains a defendant in any of the"
"2105","lawsuits (though some could potentially receive"
"2106","any recoveries as nominal defendants)."
"2107","Additional lawsuits"
"2108","based upon similar allegations may be filed in the"
"2109","future. The potential impact of these lawsuits, all of"
"2110","which seek unquantified damages, attorneys' fees,"
"2111","and expenses, and future potential similar suits is"
"2112","uncertain. Although we do not believe that these"
"2113","lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Funds,"
"2114","there can be no assurance that these suits, ongoing"
"2115","adverse publicity and/or other developments resulting"
"2116","from the regulatory investigations will not result in"
"2117","increased Fund redemptions, reduced sales of Fund"
"2118","shares, or other adverse consequences for the Funds."
