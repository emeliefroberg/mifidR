"601","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"602","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"603","Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund, Inc."
"604","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"605"," of the Equity Growth Portfolio of Morgan Stanley Institutional"
"606","Fund, Inc. (the Fund) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2010,"
"607","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"608","Oversight Board (United States), we considered its internal control"
"609","over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"610","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"611","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"612","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"613","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"614","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express"
"615","no such opinion."
"616","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"617","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"618","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"619","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"620","related costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"621","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"622","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"623","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"624","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"625","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"626","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"627","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"628","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"629","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"630","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"631","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"632","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"633","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"634"," and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"635"," regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"636"," use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material"
"637"," effect on the financial statements."
"638","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"639"," reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"640"," of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject"
"641","to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes"
"642","in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"643","or procedures may deteriorate."
"644","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"645"," the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"646","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"647"," to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"648","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"649","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"650","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's"
"651","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"652","detected on a timely basis."
"653","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"654","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"655","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"656","in internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"657","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"658","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"659","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"660","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider"
"661","to be a material weakness as defined above as of June 30, 2010."
"662","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"663","management and the Board of Directors of Morgan Stanley"
"664","Institutional Fund, Inc., and the Securities and Exchange"
"665","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used"

          waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party of any
          such right, power or privilege, or any single or partial exercise of
          any such right, power or privilege, preclude any further exercise
          thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.

     C.   This Agreement may be terminated, and the transactions contemplated
          herein may be abandoned with respect to one or more (or all)
          Reorganizations at any time prior to the Closing Date:

          1.   by the consent of the Target Entity Board and the Acquiring
               Entity Board;

          2.   by the Target Fund, if the Acquiring Fund breaches in any

               covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

          3.   by the Acquiring Fund, if the Target Fund breaches in any

               failure to fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement
               has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the closing

               precedent to the Target Fund's obligation to close, as set forth
               in Section VII of this Agreement, have been fully satisfied (or
               can be fully satisfied at the Closing); (b) the Acquiring Fund
               gives the Target Fund written assurance of its intent to close
               irrespective of the satisfaction or nonsatisfaction of all
               conditions precedent to the Acquiring Fund's obligation to close,
               as set forth in Section VIII of this Agreement; and (c) the
               Target Fund then fails or refuses to


                                       22

               close within the earlier of five (5) business days or December

               satisfied (or can be fully satisfied at the Closing); (b) the
               Target Fund gives the Acquiring Fund written assurance of its
               intent to close irrespective of the satisfaction or
               nonsatisfaction of all the conditions precedent to the Target
               Fund's obligation to close, as set forth in Section VII of this
               Agreement; and (c) the Acquiring Fund then fails or refuses to
               close within the earlier of five (5) business days or December
               31, 2010.

X.   REMEDIES.

     In the event of termination of this Agreement by either or both of the
Target Fund and Acquiring Fund pursuant to Section IX.C., written notice thereof
shall forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other party hereto, and
this Agreement shall therefore terminate and become void and have no effect, and
the transactions contemplated herein and thereby shall be abandoned, without
further action by the parties hereto.

XI.  SURVIVAL OF WARRANTIES AND INDEMNIFICATION.

     A.   SURVIVAL. The representations and warranties included or provided for
          herein, or in the schedules or other instruments delivered or to be
          delivered pursuant hereto, shall survive the Closing Date for a three
          (3) year period except that any representation or warranty with
          respect to taxes shall survive for the expiration of the statutory
          period of limitations for assessments of tax deficiencies as the same
          may be extended from time to time by the taxpayer. The covenants and
          agreements included or provided for herein shall survive and be
          continuing obligations in accordance with their terms. The period for
          which a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement survives shall
          be referred to hereinafter as the Survival Period. Notwithstanding
          anything set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the right of
          the Acquiring Fund and the Target Fund to seek indemnity pursuant to
          this Agreement shall survive for a period of ninety (90) days beyond
          the expiration of the Survival Period of the representation, warranty,
          covenant or agreement upon which indemnity is sought. In no event
          shall the Acquiring Fund or the Target Fund be obligated to indemnify
          the other if indemnity is not sought within ninety (90) days of the
          expiration of the applicable Survival Period.

     B.   INDEMNIFICATION. Each party (an Indemnitor) shall indemnify and hold
          the other and its directors, trustees, officers, agents and persons


                                       23

<PAGE>

          controlled by or controlling any of them (each an Indemnified Party)
          harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities,
          claims, demands, judgments, settlements, deficiencies, taxes,
          assessments, charges, costs and expenses of any nature whatsoever
          (including reasonable attorneys' fees), including amounts paid in
          satisfaction of judgments, in compromise or as fines and penalties,
          and counsel fees reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in
          connection with the defense or disposition of any claim, action, suit
          or other proceeding, whether civil or criminal, before any court or
          administrative or investigative body in which such Indemnified Party
          may be or may have been involved as a party or otherwise or with which
          such Indemnified Party may be or may have been threatened
          (collectively, the Losses) arising out of or related to any claim of
          a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant made herein by
          the Indemnitor, provided, however, that no Indemnified Party shall be
          indemnified hereunder against any Losses arising directly from such
          Indemnified Party's (i) willful misfeasance, (ii) bad faith, (iii)
          gross negligence or (iv) reckless disregard of the duties involved in
          the conduct of such Indemnified Party's position.

     C.   INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURE. The Indemnified Party shall use its best
          efforts to minimize any liabilities, damages, deficiencies, claims,
          judgments, assessments, costs and expenses in respect of which
          indemnity may be sought hereunder. The Indemnified Party shall give
          written notice to the Indemnitor within the earlier of ten (10) days
          of receipt of written notice to the Indemnified Party or thirty (30)
          days from discovery by the Indemnified Party of any matters which may
          give rise to a claim for indemnification or reimbursement under this
          Agreement. The failure to give such notice shall not affect the right
          of the Indemnified Party to indemnity hereunder unless such failure
          has materially and adversely affected the rights of the Indemnitor;
          provided that in any event such notice shall have been given prior to
          the expiration of the Survival Period. At any time after ten (10) days
          from the giving of such notice, the Indemnified Party may, at its
          option, resist, settle or otherwise compromise, or pay such claim
          unless it shall have received notice from the Indemnitor that the
          Indemnitor intends, at the Indemnitor's sole cost and expense, to
          assume the defense of any such matter, in which case the Indemnified
          Party shall have the right, at no cost or expense to the Indemnitor,
          to participate in such defense. If the Indemnitor does not assume the
          defense of such matter, and in any event until the Indemnitor states
          in writing that it will assume the defense, the Indemnitor shall pay
          all costs of the Indemnified Party arising out of the defense until
          the defense is assumed; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party
          shall consult with the Indemnitor and obtain the Indemnitor's prior
          written consent to any payment or settlement of any such claim. The
          Indemnitor shall keep the Indemnified Party fully apprised at all
          times as to the


                                       24
<PAGE>

          status of the defense. If the Indemnitor does not assume the defense,
          the Indemnified Party shall keep Indemnitor apprised at all times as
          to the status of the defense. Following indemnification as provided
          for hereunder, the Indemnitor shall be subrogated to all rights of the
          Indemnified Party with respect to all third parties, firms or
          corporations relating to the matter for which indemnification has been
          made.

XII. SURVIVAL.

     The provisions set forth in Sections X, XI and XVI hereof shall survive the
termination of this Agreement for any cause whatsoever.

XIII. NOTICES.

     All notices hereunder shall be sufficiently given for all purposes
hereunder if in writing and delivered personally or sent by registered mail or
certified mail, postage prepaid. Notice to the Target Entity, with respect to
its corresponding Target Fund shall be addressed to the Target Entity c/o Van
Kampen Asset Management, 522 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10036, Attention:

attention of such other person as the Acquiring Entity may designate by written
notice to the Target Entity. Any notice shall be deemed to have been served or
given as of the date such notice is delivered personally or mailed.

XIV. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

     This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their successors and assigns. This Agreement shall not be
assigned by any party without the prior written consent of the other party
hereto.

XV.  BOOKS AND RECORDS.

     The Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund agree that copies of the books and
records of the Target Fund relating to the Assets including, but not limited to,
all files, records, written materials (e.g., closing transcripts, surveillance
files and credit reports) shall be delivered by the Target Fund to the Acquiring
Fund on or prior to the Closing Date. In addition to, and without limiting the
foregoing, the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund agree to take such action as
may be necessary in order that the Acquiring Fund shall have reasonable access
to such other books and records as may be reasonably requested, all for three
(3) complete fiscal and tax years after the Closing Date; namely, general
ledgers, journal entries, voucher registers, distribution journals, payroll
registers, monthly balance owing reports, income tax returns, tax depreciation
