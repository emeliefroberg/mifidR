"916","of MFS Series  Trust XI and  Shareholders  of MFS Blended  Research  Core Equity"
"917","Fund: In planning and  performing  our audit of the financial  statements of MFS"
"918","Blended  Research  Core Equity Fund (the  Fund) (a  portfolio  comprising  MFS"
"919","Series Trust XI) as of and for the year ended  September 30, 2009, in accordance"
"920","with the  standards of the Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board (United"
"921","States),  we considered the Funds  internal  control over financial  reporting,"
"922","including  controls over safeguarding  securities,  as a basis for designing our"
"923","auditing  procedures  for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"924","statements and to comply with the  requirements  of Form N-SAR,  but not for the"
"925","purpose of expressing  an opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Funds  internal"
"926","control over financial reporting.Accordingly,  we express no such opinion. The"
"927","management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective"
"928","internal control over financial  reporting. In fulfilling this  responsibility,"
"929","estimates  and  judgments  by  management  are  required to assess the  expected"
"930","benefits  and  related  costs of  controls. A  funds  internal  control  over"
"931","financial  reporting  is a process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance"
"932","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"933","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"934","accounting  principles. A funds  internal  control over  financial  reporting"
"935","includes those policies and  procedures  that (1) pertain to the  maintenance of"
"936","records  that,  in  reasonable   detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the"
"937","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide  reasonable"
"938","assurance that  transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of"
"939","financial   statements  in  accordance   with  generally   accepted   accounting"
"940","principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"941","in accordance with  authorizations  of management and trustees of the trust; and"
"942","(3) provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection of"
"943","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a funds assets that could have"
"944","a  material  effect  on  the  financial  statements.  Because  of  its  inherent"
"945","limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"946","misstatements. Also,  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"947","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become  inadequate  because of"
"948","changes in  conditions  or that the degree of  compliance  with the  policies or"
"949","procedures  may  deteriorate.  A deficiency in internal  control over  financial"
"950","reporting  exists  when the  design or  operation  of a  control  does not allow"
"951","management or  employees,  in the normal  course of  performing  their  assigned"
"952","functions,  to prevent or detect  misstatements  on a timely  basis. A material"
"953","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,  in internal control"
"954","over financial  reporting,  such that there is a reasonable  possibility  that a"
"955","material  misstatement of the funds annual or interim financial statements will"
"956","not be  prevented  or detected on a timely  basis."
"957","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial reporting was for"
"958","the limited  purpose  described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily"
"959","disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material  weaknesses"
"960","under  standards  established by the Public Company  Accounting  Oversight Board"
"961","(country-regionplaceUnited  States). However,  we noted no deficiencies in the"
"962","Funds internal  control over financial  reporting and its operation,  including"
"963","controls  for  safeguarding  securities,  that  we  consider  to  be a  material"
"964","weakness,  as defined above,  as of September 30, 2009.  This report is intended"
