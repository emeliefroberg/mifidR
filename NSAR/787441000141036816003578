"4408","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"4409","Accounting Firm"
"4410","To the Shareholders and"
"4411","Board of Trustees of"
"4412","The MainStay Funds:"
"4413","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"4414","statements of The MainStay Funds, comprising the"
"4415","MainStay Common Stock Fund, MainStay Convertible"
"4416","Fund, MainStay Global High Income Fund, MainStay"
"4417","Government Fund, MainStay High Yield Corporate"
"4418","Bond Fund, MainStay Income Builder Fund, MainStay"

"4420","Fund, MainStay MAP Fund, MainStay Money Market"
"4421","Fund, MainStay Tax Free Bond Fund, and MainStay"
"4422","Unconstrained Bond Fund (collectively, the Funds), as"
"4423","of and for the year ended October 31, 2016, in"
"4424","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"4425","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"4426","considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"4427","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"4428","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"4429","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"4430","the financial statements and to comply with the"
"4431","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"4432","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"4433","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"4434","we express no such opinion."
"4435","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"4436","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"4437","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"4438","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"4439","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"4440","company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"4441","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"4442","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"4443","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"4444","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"4445","principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"4446","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"4447","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"4448","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"4449","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"4450","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"4451","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"4452","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"4453","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"4454","company are being made only in accordance with"
"4455","authorizations of management and directors of the"
"4456","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"4457","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"4458","acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets"
"4459","that could have a material effect on the financial"
"4460","statements."
"4461","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"4462","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"4463","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"4464","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"4465","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"4466","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"4467","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"4468","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"4469","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"4470","allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"4471","of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"4472","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"4473","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"4474","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"4475","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"4476","misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial"
"4477","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"4478","basis."
"4479","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"4480","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"4481","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"4482","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"4483","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"4484","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"4485","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"4486","internal control over financial reporting and its"
"4487","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"4488","securities that we consider to be a material weakness as"
"4489","defined above as of October 31, 2016."
"4490","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"4491","of management and the Board of Trustees of The"
"4492","MainStay Funds and the Securities and Exchange"
"4493","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be"

"4591","      1.	Appointment.  The Manager hereby"
"4592","appoints Cornerstone Capital Management Holdings LLC"
"4593","to act as Subadvisor to the series of each Registrant"
"4594","designated on Schedule A of this Agreement (each a"
"4595","Series) with respect to the assets of such Series, or a"
"4596","portion of the assets designated by the Manager, in the"
"4597","case of the MainStay Absolute Return Multi-Strategy"

"4605","and on the terms set forth in this Agreement.  The"
"4606","Subadvisor accepts such appointment and agrees to"
"4607","furnish the services herein set forth for the compensation"
"4608","herein provided."
"4609","	In the event that any Registrant designates one or"
"4610","more series other than the Series with respect to which the"
"4611","Manager wishes to retain the Subadvisor to render"
"4612","investment advisory services hereunder, it shall notify the"
"4613","Subadvisor in writing.  If the Subadvisor is willing to"
"4614","render such services, it shall notify the Manager in"
"4615","writing, whereupon such series shall become a Series"
"4616","hereunder, and be subject to this Agreement, and"
"4617","Schedule A shall be revised accordingly."
"4618","      2.	Portfolio Management Duties.  Subject to"
"4619","the supervision of each Registrant's Board of Trustees"
"4620","(Board) and the Manager, the Subadvisor will provide a"
"4621","continuous investment program for the Series' Allocated"
"4622","Assets and determine the composition of the assets of the"
"4623","Series' Allocated Assets, including determination of the"
"4624","purchase, retention or sale of the securities, cash and other"
"4625","investments contained in the portfolio.  The Subadvisor"
"4626","will conduct investment research and conduct a"
"4627","continuous program of evaluation, investment, sales and"
"4628","reinvestment of the Series' Allocated Assets by"
"4629","determining the securities and other investments that shall"
"4630","be purchased, entered into, sold, closed or exchanged for"
"4631","the Series, when these transactions should be executed,"
"4632","and what portion of the Allocated Assets of the Series"
"4633","should be held in the various securities and other"
"4634","investments in which it may invest, and the Subadvisor is"
"4635","hereby authorized to execute and perform such services"
"4636","on behalf of the Series.  The Subadvisor will provide the"
"4637","services under this Agreement in accordance with the"
"4638","Series' investment objective or objectives, policies and"
"4639","restrictions as stated in each Registrant's Registration"
"4640","Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange"
"4641","Commission (the SEC), as amended, copies of which"
"4642","shall be delivered to the Subadvisor by the Manager.  The"
"4643","Subadvisor further agrees as follows:"
"4644","      (a)	The Subadvisor understands that the"
"4645","Allocated Assets of the Series need to be managed so as"
"4646","to permit the Series to qualify or continue to qualify as a"
"4647","regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the"
"4648","Internal Revenue Code (Code), and will coordinate"
"4649","efforts with the Manager to achieve that objective."
"4650","      (b)	The Subadvisor will conform with the"
"4651","1940 Act and all rules and regulations thereunder, all"
"4652","other applicable federal and state laws and regulations,"
"4653","any applicable procedures adopted by each Registrant's"
"4654","Board of which a copy has been delivered to the"
"4655","Subadvisor, and the provisions of the Registration"
"4656","Statement of each Registrant under the Securities Act of"
"4657","1933, as amended (the 1933 Act), and the 1940 Act, as"
"4658","supplemented or amended, copies of which shall be"
"4659","delivered to the Subadvisor by the Manager."
"4660","      (c)	On occasions when the Subadvisor deems"
"4661","the purchase or sale of a security to be in the best interest"
"4662","of the Series as well as of other investment advisory"
"4663","clients of the Subadvisor or any of its affiliates, the"
"4664","Subadvisor may, to the extent permitted by applicable"
"4665","laws and regulations, but shall not be obligated to,"
"4666","aggregate the securities to be so sold or purchased with"
"4667","those of its other clients where such aggregation is not"
"4668","inconsistent with the policies set forth in the Registration"
"4669","Statement.  In such event, allocation of the securities so"
"4670","purchased or sold, as well as the expenses incurred in the"
"4671","transaction, will be made by the Subadvisor in a manner"
"4672","that, over time, is fair and equitable in the judgment of the"
"4673","Subadvisor in the exercise of its fiduciary obligations to"
"4674","each Registrant and to such other clients, subject to"
"4675","review by the Manager and the Board.  The Manager"
"4676","recognizes that in some cases this procedure may"
"4677","adversely affect the results obtained for the Registrant."
"4678","      (d)	In connection with the purchase and sale of"
"4679","securities for the Series, the Subadvisor will arrange for"
"4680","the transmission to the custodian and portfolio accounting"
"4681","agent for the Series, on a daily basis, such confirmation,"
"4682","trade tickets and other documents and information,"
"4683","including, but not limited to, CUSIP, Sedol or other"
"4684","numbers that identify securities to be purchased or sold on"
"4685","behalf of the Series, as may be reasonably necessary to"
"4686","enable the custodian and portfolio accounting agent to"
"4687","perform their administrative and recordkeeping"
"4688","responsibilities with respect to the Series.  With respect to"
"4689","portfolio securities to be purchased or sold through the"
"4690","Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, the"
"4691","Subadvisor will arrange for the automatic transmission of"
"4692","the confirmation of such trades to the Registrant's"
"4693","custodian and portfolio accounting agent."
"4694","      (e)	The Subadvisor will assist the custodian"
"4695","and portfolio accounting agent in determining or"
"4696","confirming, consistent with the procedures and policies"
"4697","stated in the Registration Statement for each Registrant,"
"4698","the value of any portfolio securities or other Allocated"
"4699","Assets of the Series for which the custodian and portfolio"
"4700","accounting agent seek assistance from, or which they"
"4701","identify for review by, the Subadvisor."
"4702","      (f)	The Subadvisor will make available to"
"4703","each Registrant and the Manager, promptly upon request,"
"4704","all of the Series' investment records and ledgers"
"4705","maintained by the Subadvisor (which shall not include the"
"4706","records and ledgers maintained by the relevant custodian"
"4707","or portfolio accounting agent), as are necessary to assist"
"4708","the applicable Registrant and the Manager to comply with"
"4709","requirements of the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers"
"4710","Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act), as well as"
"4711","other applicable laws.  The Subadvisor will furnish to"
"4712","regulatory agencies having the requisite authority any"
"4713","information or reports in connection with such services"
"4714","that may be requested in order to ascertain whether the"
"4715","operations of the Registrant are being conducted in a"
"4716","manner consistent with applicable laws and regulations."
"4717","      (g)	The Subadvisor will provide reports to"
"4718","each Registrant's Board, for consideration at meetings of"
"4719","the Board, on the investment program for the Series and"
"4720","the issuers and securities represented in the Series'"
"4721","Allocated Assets, and will furnish each Registrant's"
"4722","Board with respect to the Series such periodic and special"
"4723","reports as each Registrant and the Manager may"
"4724","reasonably request."
"4725","      (h)	In rendering the services required under"
"4726","this Agreement, the Subadvisor may, from time to time,"
"4727","employ or associate with itself such entity, entities, person"
"4728","or persons as it believes necessary to assist it in carrying"
"4729","out its obligations under this Agreement.  The Subadvisor"
"4730","may not, however, retain as subadvisor any company that"
"4731","would be an investment adviser as that term is defined"
"4732","in the 1940 Act, to the Series unless the contract with"
"4733","such company is approved by a majority of the applicable"
"4734","Registrant's Board and by a majority of the applicable"
"4735","Trustees who are not parties to any agreement or contract"
"4736","with such company and who are not interested persons"
"4737","as defined in the 1940 Act, of the Trust, the Manager, the"
"4738","Subadvisor or any such company that is retained as"
"4739","subadvisor, and also is approved by the vote of a majority"
"4740","of the outstanding voting securities of the applicable"
"4741","Series of each Registrant to the extent required by the"
"4742","1940 Act.  The Subadvisor shall be responsible for"
"4743","making reasonable inquiries and for reasonably ensuring"
"4744","that any employee of the Subadvisor, any subadvisor that"
"4745","the Subadvisor has employed or with which it has"
"4746","associated with respect to the Series, or any employee"
"4747","thereof has not, to the best of the Subadvisor's"
"4748","knowledge, in any material connection with the handling"
"4749","of Trust assets:"
"4750","      (i)	been convicted, within the last ten (10)"
"4751","years, of any felony or misdemeanor arising out of"
"4752","conduct involving embezzlement, fraudulent conversion"
"4753","or misappropriation of funds or securities, involving"
"4754","violations of Sections 1341, 1342, or 1343 of Title 18,"
"4755","United States Code, or involving the purchase or sale of"
"4756","any security; or"
"4757","      (ii)	been found by any state regulatory"
"4758","authority, within the last ten (10) years, to have violated"
"4759","or to have acknowledged violation of any provision of"
"4760","any state insurance law involving fraud, deceit or"
"4761","knowing misrepresentation; or"
"4762","      (iii)	been found by any federal or state"
"4763","regulatory authorities, within the last ten (10) years, to"
"4764","have violated or to have acknowledged violation of any"
"4765","provision of federal or state securities laws involving"
"4766","fraud, deceit or knowing misrepresentation."
"4767","      3.	Compensation.  For the services provided"
"4768","and the expenses assumed pursuant to this Agreement, the"
"4769","Manager shall pay the Subadvisor as compensation"
"4770","therefor, a fee equal to the percentage of the Allocated"
"4771","Assets constituting the respective Series' average daily"
"4772","net assets as described in the attached Schedule A."
"4773","Liability for payment of compensation by the Manager to"
"4774","the Subadvisor under this Agreement is contingent upon"
"4775","the Manager's receipt of payment from the applicable"
"4776","Registrant for management services described under the"
"4777","Management Agreement between each Registrant and the"
"4778","Manager.  Expense caps or fee waivers for the Series that"
"4779","may be agreed to by the Manager, but not agreed to in"
"4780","writing by the Subadvisor, shall not cause a reduction in"
"4781","the amount of the payment to the Subadvisor."
"4782","      4.	Broker-Dealer Selection.  The Subadvisor"
"4783","is responsible for decisions to buy and sell securities and"
"4784","other investments for the Series' Allocated Assets, for"
"4785","broker-dealer selection and for negotiation of brokerage"
"4786","commission rates.  The Subadvisor's primary"
"4787","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to"
"4788","obtain the best execution for the Series, taking into"
"4789","account the factors specified in the Prospectus and/or"
"4790","Statement of Additional Information for each Registrant,"
"4791","which include the following:  price (including the"
"4792","applicable brokerage commission or dollar spread); the"
"4793","size of the order; the nature of the market for the security;"
"4794","the timing of the transaction; the reputation, experience"
"4795","and financial stability of the broker-dealer involved; the"
"4796","quality of the service; the difficulty of execution, and the"
"4797","execution capabilities and operational facilities of the firm"
"4798","involved; and the firm's risk in positioning a block of"
"4799","securities.  Accordingly, the price to the Series in any"
"4800","transaction may be less favorable than that available from"
"4801","another broker-dealer if the difference is reasonably"
"4802","justified, in the judgment of the Subadvisor in the exercise"
"4803","of its fiduciary obligations to each Registrant, by other"
"4804","aspects of the portfolio execution services offered."
"4805","Subject to such policies as the Board may determine, and"
"4806","consistent with Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange"
"4807","Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and interpretations"
"4808","of the SEC thereunder, the Subadvisor shall not be"
"4809","deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any"
"4810","duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by"
"4811","reason of its having caused the Series to pay a broker-"
"4812","dealer for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in"
"4813","excess of the amount of commission another broker-"
"4814","dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction,"
"4815","if the Subadvisor or its affiliate determines in good faith"
"4816","that such amount of commission was reasonable in"
"4817","relation to the value of the brokerage and research"
"4818","services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms"
"4819","of either that particular transaction or the Subadvisor's or"
"4820","its affiliate's overall responsibilities with respect to the"
"4821","Series and to their other clients as to which they exercise"
"4822","investment discretion.  To the extent consistent with these"
"4823","standards and each Registrant's Procedures for Securities"
"4824","Transactions with Affiliated Brokers pursuant to Rule"
"4825","17e-1, the Subadvisor is further authorized to allocate the"
"4826","orders placed by it on behalf of the Series to the (i)"
"4827","Subadvisor if it is registered as a broker-dealer with the"
"4828","SEC, (ii) its affiliated broker-dealer, or (iii) such brokers"
"4829","and dealers who also provide research, statistical material"
"4830","or other services to the Series, the Subadvisor or an"
"4831","affiliate of the Subadvisor.  Such allocation shall be in"
"4832","such amounts and proportions as the Subadvisor shall"
"4833","determine consistent with the above standards and the"
"4834","Subadvisor will report on said allocation regularly to the"
"4835","Board, indicating the broker-dealers to which such"
"4836","allocations have been made and the basis therefor."
"4837","      5.	Disclosure about Subadvisor.  The"
"4838","Subadvisor has reviewed the post-effective amendment to"
"4839","the Registration Statement for each Registrant filed with"
"4840","the SEC that contains disclosure about the Subadvisor and"
"4841","represents and warrants that, with respect to the disclosure"
"4842","about the Subadvisor or information relating directly or"
"4843","indirectly to the Subadvisor, such Registration Statement"
"4844","contains, as of the date hereof, no untrue statement of any"
"4845","material fact and does not omit any statement of a"
"4846","material fact which was required to be stated therein or"
"4847","necessary to make the statements contained therein not"
"4848","misleading.  The Subadvisor further represents and"
"4849","warrants that it is a duly registered investment adviser"
"4850","under the Advisers Act and has notice filed in all states in"
"4851","which the Subadvisor is required to make such filings."
"4852","      6.	Expenses.  During the term of this"
"4853","Agreement, the Subadvisor will pay all expenses incurred"
"4854","by it and its staff for their activities in connection with its"
"4855","portfolio management duties under this Agreement.  The"
"4856","Manager or each Registrant shall be responsible for all the"
"4857","expenses of that Registrant's operations, including, but"
"4858","not limited to:"
"4859","      (a)	the fees and expenses of Trustees who are"
"4860","not interested persons of the Manager or of the Registrant;"
"4861","      (b)	the fees and expenses of each Series which"

"4870","issuance and redemption of the Series' shares;"
"4871","      (c)	the fees and expenses of the Registrant's"
"4872","transfer and dividend disbursing agent, that may be the"
"4873","custodian, which relate to the maintenance of each"
"4874","shareholder account;"
"4875","      (d)	the charges and expenses of legal counsel"

"4884","the Registrant may be a member;"
"4885","      (h)	the cost of share certificates representing"

"4891","securities laws, including the preparation and printing of"
"4892","the Registrant's registration statements and prospectuses"
"4893","for filing under federal and state securities laws for such"
"4894","purposes;"
"4895","      (j)	allocable communications expenses with"

"4904","pursuant to a Plan of Distribution adopted in conformity"

"5002","The Manager and each Registrant agree that neither that"
"5003","Registrant, the Manager, nor affiliated persons of that"
"5004","Registrant, or the Manager shall, except with the prior"

"5028","records and information pertaining to the Series and their"
"5029","prior, present or potential shareholders, unless required by"
"5030","law.  The Subadvisor will not use such information for"

"5053","rendered under this Agreement, except by reason of"
"5054","willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the"
"5055","performance of the Subadvisor's duties, or by reason of"
"5056","reckless disregard of the Subadvisor's obligations and"

"5058","Nothing in this section shall be deemed a limitation or"
"5059","waiver of any obligation or duty that may not by law be"

"5061","      15.	Indemnification."
"5062","      (a)	The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold"

"5093","Indemnified Person; provided, however, that in no case"

"5097","otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad"
"5098","faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties,"
"5099","or by reason of its reckless disregard of obligations and"

"5101","      (b)	Notwithstanding Section 14 of this"
"5102","Agreement, the Subadvisor agrees to indemnify and hold"

"5113","otherwise, arising out of the Subadvisor's responsibilities"
"5114","as Subadvisor of the Series, which:  (i) is based upon any"

"5127","alleged omission to state therein a material fact known or"
"5128","which should have been known to the Subadvisor and was"
"5129","required to be stated therein or necessary to make the"
"5130","statements therein not misleading, if such a statement or"
"5131","omission was made in reliance upon information"
"5132","furnished to the Manager, a Registrant or any affiliated"
"5133","person of the Manager or a Registrant by the Subadvisor"
"5134","or any affiliated person of the Subadvisor; provided,"
"5135","however, that in no case shall the indemnity in favor of a"
"5136","Manager Indemnified Person be deemed to protect such"
"5137","person against any liability to which any such person"
"5138","would otherwise be subject by reason of willful"
"5139","misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the"
"5140","performance of its duties, or by reason of its reckless"
"5141","disregard of its obligations and duties under this"
"5142","Agreement."
"5143","      (c)	The Manager shall not be liable under"
"5144","Paragraph (a) of this Section 15 with respect to any claim"
"5145","made against a Subadvisor Indemnified Person unless"
"5146","such Subadvisor Indemnified Person shall have notified"
"5147","the Manager in writing within a reasonable time after the"
"5148","summons, notice or other first legal process or notice"
"5149","giving information of the nature of the claim shall have"
"5150","been served upon such Subadvisor Indemnified Person (or"
"5151","after such Subadvisor Indemnified Person shall have"
"5152","received notice of such service on any designated agent),"
"5153","but failure to notify the Manager of any such claim shall"
"5154","not relieve the Manager from any liability that it may"
"5155","have to the Subadvisor Indemnified Person against whom"
"5156","such action is brought otherwise than on account of this"
"5157","Section 15.  In case any such action is brought against the"
"5158","Subadvisor Indemnified Person, the Manager will be"
"5159","entitled to participate, at its own expense, in the defense"
"5160","thereof or, after notice to the Subadvisor Indemnified"
"5161","Person, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel"
"5162","reasonably satisfactory to the Subadvisor Indemnified"
"5163","Person.  If the Manager assumes the defense of any such"
"5164","action and the selection of counsel by the Manager to"
"5165","represent both the Manager and the Subadvisor"
"5166","Indemnified Person would result in a conflict of interest"
"5167","and, therefore, would not, in the reasonable judgment of"
"5168","the Subadvisor Indemnified Person, adequately represent"
"5169","the interests of the Subadvisor Indemnified Person, the"
"5170","Manager will, at its own expense, assume the defense"
"5171","with counsel to the Manager and, also at its own expense,"
"5172","with separate counsel to the Subadvisor Indemnified"
"5173","Person, which counsel shall be satisfactory to the"
"5174","Manager and to the Subadvisor Indemnified Person.  The"
"5175","Subadvisor Indemnified Person shall bear the fees and"
"5176","expenses of any additional counsel retained by it, and the"
"5177","Manager shall not be liable to the Subadvisor Indemnified"
"5178","Person under this Agreement for any legal or other"
"5179","expenses subsequently incurred by the Subadvisor"
"5180","Indemnified Person independently in connection with the"
"5181","defense thereof other than reasonable costs of"
"5182","investigation.  The Manager shall not have the right to"
"5183","compromise on or settle the litigation without the prior"
"5184","written consent of the Subadvisor Indemnified Person if"
"5185","the compromise or settlement results, or may result, in a"
"5186","finding of wrongdoing on the part of the Subadvisor"
"5187","Indemnified Person."
"5188","      (d)	The Subadvisor shall not be liable under"
"5189","Paragraph (b) of this Section 15 with respect to any claim"
"5190","made against a Manager Indemnified Person unless such"
"5191","Manager Indemnified Person shall have notified the"
"5192","Subadvisor in writing within a reasonable time after the"
"5193","summons, notice or other first legal process or notice"
"5194","giving information of the nature of the claim shall have"
"5195","been served upon such Manager Indemnified Person (or"
"5196","after such Manager Indemnified Person shall have"
"5197","received notice of such service on any designated agent),"
"5198","but failure to notify the Subadvisor of any such claim"
"5199","shall not relieve the Subadvisor from any liability that it"
"5200","may have to the Manager Indemnified Person against"
"5201","whom such action is brought otherwise than on account of"
"5202","this Section 15.  In case any such action is brought against"
"5203","the Manager Indemnified Person, the Subadvisor will be"
"5204","entitled to participate, at its own expense, in the defense"
"5205","thereof or, after notice to the Manager Indemnified"
"5206","Person, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel"
"5207","reasonably satisfactory to the Manager Indemnified"
"5208","Person.  If the Subadvisor assumes the defense of any"
"5209","such action and the selection of counsel by the Subadvisor"
"5210","to represent both the Subadvisor and the Manager"
"5211","Indemnified Person would result in a conflict of interest"
"5212","and, therefore, would not, in the reasonable judgment of"
"5213","the Manager Indemnified Person, adequately represent the"
"5214","interests of the Manager Indemnified Person, the"
"5215","Subadvisor will, at its own expense, assume the defense"
"5216","with counsel to the Subadvisor and, also at its own"
"5217","expense, with separate counsel to the Manager"
"5218","Indemnified Person, which counsel shall be satisfactory to"
"5219","the Subadvisor and to the Manager Indemnified Person."
"5220","The Manager Indemnified Person shall bear the fees and"
"5221","expenses of any additional counsel retained by it, and the"
"5222","Subadvisor shall not be liable to the Manager Indemnified"
"5223","Person under this Agreement for any legal or other"
"5224","expenses subsequently incurred by the Manager"
"5225","Indemnified Person independently in connection with the"
"5226","defense thereof other than reasonable costs of"
"5227","investigation.  The Subadvisor shall not have the right to"
"5228","compromise on or settle the litigation without the prior"
"5229","written consent of the Manager Indemnified Person if the"
"5230","compromise or settlement results, or may result, in a"
"5231","finding of wrongdoing on the part of the Manager"
"5232","Indemnified Person."
"5233","      16.	Services Not Exclusive.  The services"
"5234","furnished by the Subadvisor hereunder are not to be"
"5235","deemed exclusive, and except as the Subadvisor may"
"5236","otherwise agree in writing, the Subadvisor shall be free to"
"5237","furnish similar services to others so long as its services"
"5238","under this Agreement are not impaired thereby.  Nothing"
"5239","in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any"
"5240","director, officer or employee of the Subadvisor, who may"
"5241","also be a Trustee, officer or employee of a Registrant, to"
"5242","engage in any other business or to devote his or her time"
"5243","and attention in part to the management or other aspects"
"5244","of any other business, whether of a similar nature or a"
"5245","dissimilar nature."
"5246","      17.	Duration and Termination.  This"
"5247","Agreement shall become effective on the date first"
"5248","indicated above.  Unless terminated as provided herein,"
"5249","the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect for an"

"5260","term is defined in the 1940 Act) of any such party to this"
"5261","Agreement cast in person at a meeting called for the"
"5262","purpose of voting on such approval.  Any approval of this"
"5263","Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding"
"5264","shares (as defined in the 1940 Act) of a Series shall be"
"5265","effective to continue this Agreement with respect to the"
