"2672","To the Shareholders and"
"2673","Board of Directors of"
"2674","Hartford HLS Series Fund II, Inc."
"2675","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Hartford HLS Series Fund II, Inc. (the Funds) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2676","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A fund&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that recei"
"2677","pts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2678","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2679","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the fund&#146;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2680","Our consideration of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of December 31, 2009."
"2681","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the Board of Directors of Hartford HLS Series Fund II, Inc. and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"2750","This Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization and liquidation within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code).  The reorganization and liquidation will consist of (1) the sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer and delivery of all of the property and assets of the Acquired Fund to the Acquiring Fund in exchange solely for shares of common stock of the Acquiring Fund (Acquiring Fund Shares) corresponding to the class of outstanding shares of common stock of the Acquired Fund (Acquired Fund Shares), as described herein, (2) the assumption by the Acquiring Fund of all liabilities of the Acquired Fund, and (3) the distribution of the Acquiring Fund Shares to the shareholders of the Acquired Fund in complete liquidation of the Acquired Fund, as provided herein (Reorganization), all upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth in this Agreement."
"2751","WHEREAS, the Acquired Fund and the Acquiring Fund are each separate series of the Company, a registered investment company classified as a management company of the open-end type, and the Acquired Fund owns securities that generally are assets of the character in which the Acquiring Fund is permitted to invest;"

"2754","NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto covenant and agree as follows:"
"2755","1.	Transfer of Assets of the Acquired Fund to the Acquiring Fund in Exchange for Acquiring Fund Shares, the Assumption of All Acquired Fund Liabilities and the Liquidation of the Acquired Fund"
"2756","1.1.	Subject to the requisite approval of the Acquired Fund shareholders and the other terms and conditions herein set forth and on the basis of the representations and warranties contained herein, the Acquired Fund agrees to sell, assign, convey, transfer and deliver all of the property and assets of the Acquired Fund, as set forth in paragraph 1.2 herein, to the Acquiring Fund, and the Acquiring Fund agrees in exchange therefore: (i) to deliver to the Acquired Fund the number of full and fractional Class IA and Class IB Acquiring Fund Shares determined by dividing the value of the Acquired Fund's net assets with respect to the corresponding class of Acquired Fund Shares, computed in the manner and as of the time and date set forth in paragraph 2.1 herein, by the net asset value of one Acquiring Fund Share of the corresponding class, computed in the manner and as of the time and date set forth in paragraph 2.2 herein; and (ii) to assume all liabilities of the Acquired Fund, as set forth in paragraph 1.3 her"
"2757","ein.  Such transactions shall take place on the date of the closing provided for in paragraph 3.1 herein (Closing Date)."
"2758","1.2.

The Acquired Fund will sell, assign, convey, transfer and deliver to the Acquiring Fund any rights, stock dividends, or other securities received by the Acquired Fund after the Closing Date as stock dividends or other distributions on or with respect to the property and assets transferred, which rights, stock dividends, and other securities shall be deemed included in the property and assets transferred to the Acquiring Fund at the Closing Date and shall not be separately valued, in which case any such distribution that remai"

"2760","1.3.	The Acquired Fund will make reasonable efforts to discharge all of its known liabilities and obligations prior to the Valuation Date.  The Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the liabilities of the Acquired Fund, whether accrued or contingent, known or unknown, existing at the Valuation Date (collectively, Liabilities).  On or as soon as practicable prior to the Closing Date, the Acquired Fund will declare and pay to its shareholders of record one or more dividends and/or other distributions so that it will have distributed substantially all (and in no event less than 98%) of its investment company taxable income (computed without regard to any deduction for dividends paid) and realized net capital gain, if any, for the current taxable year through the Closing Date."
"2761","1.4.	Immediately following the actions contemplated by paragraph 1.1 herein, the Company shall take such actions necessary to complete the liquidation of the Acquired Fund.

Such distribution and liquidation will be accomplished, with respect to each class of Acquired Fund shares, by the transfer of the Acquiring Fund Shares then credited to the account of the Acquired Fund on the books of the Acquiring Fund to open accounts on the share records of the Acquiring Fund in the names of the Acquired Fund Shareholders.  The aggregate net asset value of Class IA and Cla"
"2762","ss IB Acquiring Fund Shares to be so credited to the Class IA and Class IB Acquired Fund Shareholders, respectively, shall, with respect to the class, be equal to the aggregate net asset value of the Acquired Fund Shares of the corresponding class owned by Acquired Fund Shareholders on the Closing Date.  All issued and outstanding Acquired Fund Shares will simultaneously be canceled on the books of the Acquired Fund, although shares certificates representing interests in Class IA and Class IB Acquired Fund Shares will thereafter represent interests in the corresponding class of Acquiring Fund Shares after the Closing Date, as determined in accordance with paragraph 2.3.  The Acquiring Fund shall not issue certificates representing the Class IA and Class IB Acquiring Fund Shares in connection with the Reorganization."
"2763","1.5.	Ownership of Acquiring Fund Shares will be shown on the books of the Acquiring Fund's Transfer Agent, as defined in paragraph 3.3 herein."
"2764","1.6.	Any reporting responsibility of the Acquired Fund, including, but not limited to, the responsibility for filing regulatory reports, tax returns, or other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission), any state securities commission, and any Federal, state or local tax authorities or any other relevant regulatory authority, is and shall remain the responsibility of the Acquired Fund."

"2768","2.3.	The number of the Acquiring Fund Shares to be issued (including fractional shares, if any) in exchange for the Acquired Fund's Assets shall be determined by dividing the value of the net assets with respect to the Acquired Fund Shares determined using the same valuation procedures referred to in paragraph 2.1 herein, by the net asset value of the corresponding class of Acquiring Fund Shares, determined in accordance with paragraph 2.2 herein."
"2769","2.4.	All computations of value shall be made by Hartford Life Insurance Company, in its capacity as Fund Accountant for the Company, and shall be subject to confirmation by the Company's Treasurer."

"2896","This Agreement is made by and between HL Investment Advisors, LLC, a Connecticut limited liability company (the Adviser), and Hartford HLS Series Fund II, Inc. a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Maryland (the Company), on its own behalf and on behalf of each of its series listed on Schedule A hereto, as it may be amended from time to time (each, a Portfolio and, collectively, the Portfolios)."
"2897","WHEREAS, the Adviser has agreed to furnish investment advisory services to the Company, an open-end management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act) and each Portfolio; and"
"2898","WHEREAS, the Company and the Adviser wish to enter into this Agreement setting forth the investment advisory services to be performed by the Adviser for the Company and each Portfolio, and the terms and conditions under which such services will be performed; and"
"2899","	WHEREAS, this Agreement has been approved in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, and HIFSCO is willing to furnish such services upon the terms and conditions herein set forth."
"2900","NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the mutual agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:"
"2901","	1.	General Provision"
"2902","The Company hereby employs the Adviser and the Adviser hereby undertakes to act as the investment manager of the Company and to each Portfolio and to perform for the Company such other duties and functions as are hereinafter set forth and such other duties as may be necessary or appropriate in connection with its services as investment manager.  The Adviser shall, in all matters, give to the Company and its Board of Directors the benefit of its best judgment, effort, advice and recommendations and shall at all times conform to, and use its best efforts to enable the Company to conform to (i) the provisions of the 1940 Act and any rules or regulations thereunder, (ii) any other applicable provisions of state or federal law; (iii) the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company as amended from time to time; (iv) the policies and determinations of the Board of Directors of the Company; (v) the fundamental policies and investment restrictions of the Company and Portfolios as reflected "
"2903","in the Company's registration statement under the 1940 Act or as such policies may, from time to time, be amended by the Company's shareholders, and (vi) the Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information of the Company in effect from time to time. The appropriate officers and employees of the Adviser shall be available upon reasonable notice for consultation with any of the Directors and officers of the Company with respect to any matters dealing with the business and affairs of the Company including the valuation of any of each Portfolios' securities that are either not registered for public sale or not being traded on any securities market."
"2904","	2. 	Investment Management Services"
"2905","(a)	Subject to the direction and control by the Company's Board of Directors, the Adviser shall, or shall cause an affiliate to: (i) regularly provide investment advice and recommendations to each Portfolio with respect to its investments, investment policies and the purchase and sale of securities; (ii) supervise continuously the investment program of each Portfolio and the composition and performance of its portfolio securities and determine what securities shall be purchased or sold by each Portfolio; and (iii) arrange, subject to the provisions of Section 4 hereof, for the purchase of securities and other investments for each Portfolio and the sale of securities and other investments held in each Portfolio."

"2909","(a) 	assist in the supervision of all aspects of the Company's operation, including the coordination of all matters relating to the functions of the custodian, transfer agent or other shareholder servicing agents (if any), accountants, attorneys and other parties performing services or operational functions for the Company;"

"2914","	The Adviser, upon approval of the Board of Directors, may engage one or more investment advisers that are registered as such under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, to act as sub-adviser with respect to existing and future Portfolios of the Company.  Such sub-adviser or sub-advisers shall assume such responsibilities and obligations of the Adviser pursuant to this Investment Management Agreement as shall be delegated to the sub?adviser or sub-advisers, and the Adviser will supervise and oversee the activities of any such sub-adviser or sub-advisers.  In addition, the Adviser may subcontract for any of the administrative services set forth in Section 3 above."
"2915","	5.	Brokerage Transactions"
"2916","	When placing orders for the purchase or sale of a Portfolio's securities, the Adviser or any sub-adviser appointed by the Adviser shall use its best efforts to obtain the best net security price available for a Portfolio. Subject to and in accordance with any directions that the Board of Directors may issue from time to time the Adviser or the sub-adviser, if applicable, may also be authorized to effect individual securities transactions at commission rates in excess of the minimum commission rates available, if the Adviser or the sub-adviser, if applicable, determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage or research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the Adviser's or the sub-adviser's overall responsibilities with respect to a Portfolio and other advisory clients.  The execution of such transactions shall not be deemed to represent an unlawful act or breach of any duty created b"
"2917","y this Agreement or otherwise.  The Adviser or the sub-adviser will promptly communicate to the Board of Directors such information relating to portfolio transactions as the Board may reasonably request."
"2918","	6.	Expenses"
"2919","	Expenses to be paid by the Company, include, but are not limited to (i) interest and taxes; (ii) brokerage commissions; (iii) premiums for fidelity and other insurance coverage requisite to the Company's operations; (iv) the fees and expenses of its non-interested directors; (v) legal, audit and fund accounting expenses; (vi) custodian and transfer agent fees and expenses; (vii) expenses incident to the redemption of its shares; (viii) fees and expenses related to the registration under federal and state securities laws of shares of the Company for public sale; (ix) expenses of printing and mailing prospectuses, reports, notices and proxy material to shareholders of the Company; (x) all other expenses incidental to holding meetings of the Company's shareholders; and (xi) such extraordinary non-recurring expenses as may arise, including litigation affecting the Company and any obligation which the Company may have to indemnify its officers and Directors with respect thereto.  Any officer or employee of the A"
"2920","dviser or of any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Adviser, who may also serve as officers, directors or employees of the Company shall not receive any compensation from the Company for their services."
"2921","	7.	Compensation of the Adviser"
"2922","	As compensation for the services rendered by the Adviser, each Portfolio shall pay to the Adviser as promptly as possible after the last day of each month during the term of this Agreement, a fee accrued daily and paid monthly, as set forth in Schedule B to this Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time:"
"2923","	The Adviser, or an affiliate of the Adviser, may agree to subsidize any of the Portfolios to any level that the Adviser, or any such affiliate, may specify. Any such undertaking may be modified or discontinued at any time except to the extent the Adviser explicitly agrees to maintain such undertaking for a specified period."
"2924","	If it is necessary to calculate the fee for a period of time that is less than a month, then the fee shall be (i) calculated at the annual rates provided in Schedule B but prorated for the number of days elapsed in the month in question as a percentage of the total number of days in such month, (ii) based upon the average of the Portfolio's daily net asset value for the period in question, and (iii) paid within a reasonable time after the close of such period."
"2925","	8. 	Liability of the Adviser"
"2926","(a)	The Adviser shall not be liable for any loss or losses sustained by reason of any investment including the purchase, holding or sale of any security, or with respect to the administration of the Company, as long as the Adviser shall have acted in good faith and with due care; provided, however, that no provision in this Agreement shall be deemed to protect the Adviser against any liability to the Company or its shareholders by reason of its willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (or, alternatively, in respect of any Portfolio for which the sub-adviser at the time of such loss is Hartford Investment Management Company, its negligence) in the performance of its duties or by reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"2927","(b)	The rights of exculpation and indemnification are not to be construed so as to provide for exculpation or indemnification provided under 8(a) of any person for any liability (including liability under U.S. federal securities laws that, under certain circumstances, impose liability even on persons that act in good faith) to the extent (but only to the extent) that exculpation or indemnification would be in violation of applicable law, but will be construed so as to effectuate the applicable provisions of this section to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law."
"2928","	9.	Duration of Agreement"
"2929","(a)	This Agreement shall be effective on November 1, 2009.  This Agreement, unless sooner terminated in accordance with 9(b) below, shall continue in effect from year to year thereafter provided that its continuance is specifically approved at least annually (1) by a vote of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of each Portfolio, and (2) in either event, by the vote of a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors who are not parties to this Agreement or interested persons of any such party, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on this Agreement."
"2930","(b) 	This Agreement (1) may be terminated at any time without the payment of any penalty either by a vote of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company or by a vote of a majority of the Portfolio's outstanding voting securities, on sixty days' prior written notice to the Adviser; (2) shall immediately terminate in the event of its assignment and (3) may be terminated by the Adviser on sixty days' prior written notice to the Portfolio, but such termination will not be effective until the Portfolio shall have contracted with one or more persons to serve as a successor investment adviser for the Portfolio and such person(s) shall have assumed such position."
"2931","(c) 	As used in this Agreement, the terms assignment, interested person and vote of majority of the Company's outstanding voting securities shall have the meanings set forth for such terms in the 1940 Act, as amended."
"2932","(d) 	Any notice under this Agreement shall be given in writing, addressed and delivered, or mailed postpaid, to the other party to this Agreement to whom such notice is to be given at such party's current address."
"2933","	10.	Other Activities"

"2935","	11.	Additional Series"
"2936","	The amendment of Schedule A to this Agreement for the sole purpose of adding one or more Portfolios shall not be deemed an amendment of this Agreement or an amendment affecting an already existing Portfolio and requiring the approval of shareholders of that Portfolio."

"2942","            No provision of this Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged, or terminated orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge, or termination is sought, and no amendment of this Agreement will be effective until approved in a manner consistent with the 1940 Act and rules and regulations under the 1940 Act and any applicable Securities and Exchange Commission exemptive order from such rules and regulations.

"3020","	This Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement is made by and between HL Investment Advisors, LLC a Connecticut limited liability company (the Adviser) and Hartford Investment Management Company, a Delaware corporation (the Sub-Adviser)."
"3021","	WHEREAS, the Adviser has entered into an agreement for the provision of investment management services to the Hartford HLS Series Fund II, Inc. (the Company), including each of its series listed on Schedule A hereto, as it may be amended from time to time, (each a Portfolio and together the Portfolios); and"
"3022","	WHEREAS, the Adviser wishes to engage the services of the Sub-Adviser as sub-adviser to the Portfolios listed in Schedule A, as it may be amended from time to time; and"
"3023","	WHEREAS, the Sub-Adviser is willing to provide investment advisory services to the Portfolios upon the terms and conditions and for the compensation hereinafter set forth."
"3024","	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:"
"3025","1.	The Adviser hereby employs the Sub-Adviser to serve as sub-adviser with respect to the assets of the Portfolios and to perform the services hereinafter set forth subject to the terms and conditions of the investment objectives, policies and restrictions of each Portfolio, and the Sub-Adviser hereby accepts such employment and agrees during such period to assume the obligations herein set forth for the compensation herein provided."
"3026","2.	The Sub-Adviser shall evaluate and implement an investment program appropriate for each Portfolio, which program shall be amended and updated from time to time as financial and other economic conditions change as determined by the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser."
"3027","3.	The Sub-Adviser, in consultation with the Adviser when appropriate, will make all determinations with respect to the investment of the assets of the Portfolios and the purchase or sale of portfolio securities, and shall take such steps as may be necessary to implement the same.  Such determinations and services shall include advising the Company's Board of Directors of the manner in which voting rights, rights to consent to corporate action, and any other non-investment decisions pertaining to a Portfolio's securities should be exercised."
"3028","4.	The Sub-Adviser will regularly furnish reports with respect to the Portfolios at periodic meetings of the Company's Board of Directors and at such other times as may be reasonably requested by the Company's Board of Directors, which reports shall include the Sub-Adviser's economic outlook and investment strategy and a discussion of the portfolio activity and the performance of the Portfolios since the last report.  Copies of all such reports shall be furnished to the Adviser for examination and review within a reasonable time prior to the presentation of such reports to the Company's Board of Directors."
"3029","5.	The Sub-Adviser shall manage each Portfolio in conformity with the Company's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, each as amended from time to time, and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, other applicable laws, and to the investment objectives, policies and restrictions of each Portfolio as set forth in the Portfolios' prospectus and statement of additional information, or any investment guidelines or other instructions received in writing from the Adviser, and subject further to such policies and instructions as the Board of Directors or the Adviser may from time to time establish and deliver to the Sub-Adviser."
"3030","	In addition, the Sub-Adviser will cause the Portfolios to comply with the requirements of (a) Section 851(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) regarding derivation of income from specified investment activities; (b) Section 851(b)(3) of the Code regarding diversification of the Portfolios' assets and (c) Section 817(h) of the Code, and the regulations promulgated thereunder."
"3031","6.	The Sub-Adviser will select the brokers or dealers that will execute the purchases and sales of portfolio securities for the Portfolios and place, in the name of each Portfolio or its nominees, all such orders.  When placing such orders, the Sub-Adviser shall use its best efforts to obtain the best net security price available for each Portfolio.  Subject to and in accordance with any directions that the Board of Directors or the Adviser may issue from time to time, the Sub-Adviser may also be authorized to effect individual securities transactions at commission rates in excess of the minimum commission rates available, if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage or research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the Sub-Adviser's overall responsibilities with respect to the Portfolios and the Sub-Adviser's other advisory clients.  The execution of such trans"
"3032","actions shall not be deemed to represent an unlawful act or breach of any duty created by this Agreement or otherwise.  The Sub-Adviser will promptly communicate to the Board of Directors or the Adviser such information relating to portfolio transactions as they may reasonably request."
"3033","7.	(a)	As compensation for the performance of the services by the Sub-Adviser hereunder, the Adviser, as promptly as possible after the last day of each calendar year quarter, will pay the Sub-Adviser the equivalent of all direct and indirect expenses incurred in connection with the performance of its duties under this Agreement, as set forth in Schedule B attached hereto."
"3034","	(b)	The Sub-Adviser will not be entitled to receive any payment for the performance of its services hereunder from the Portfolios."
"3035","	(c)	The Sub-Adviser agrees to notify the Adviser of any change in the Sub-Adviser's personnel that are directly involved in the management of the Portfolios within a reasonable time following the occurrence of such change."
"3036","8.	The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any loss or losses sustained by reason of any investment including the purchase, holding or sale of any security as long as the Sub-Adviser shall have acted in good faith and with due care; provided, however, that no provision in this Agreement shall be deemed to protect the Sub-Adviser, and the Sub-Adviser shall indemnify the Adviser, for any and all loss, damage, judgment, fine or award paid in settlement and attorney's fees related to the Sub-Adviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"3037","9.	(a)	This Sub-Advisory Agreement shall become effective on October 1, 2009.  This Agreement, unless sooner terminated in accordance with 9(b) below, shall continue in effect from year to year thereafter provided that its continuance is specifically approved at least annually (1) by a vote of the majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of each Portfolio, and (2) in either event, by the vote of a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors who are not parties to this Agreement or interested persons of any such party, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on this Agreement."
"3038","	(b)	This Agreement (1) may be terminated with respect to each Portfolio at any time without the payment of any penalty either by vote of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company or by a vote of a majority of any Portfolio's outstanding voting securities, or by the Adviser on written notice to the Sub-Adviser, (2) shall immediately terminate in the event of its assignment, (3) may be terminated by the Sub-Adviser on ninety days' prior written notice to the Adviser, but such termination will not be effective until the Adviser shall have contracted with one or more persons to serve as a successor sub-adviser for the Portfolio (or the Adviser or an affiliate of the Adviser agrees to manage the Portfolio) and such person(s) shall have assumed such position, and (4) will terminate automatically upon termination of the advisory agreement between the Adviser and the Company of even date herewith."
"3039","	(c)	As used in this Agreement, the terms assignment, interested parties and vote of a majority of the Company's outstanding voting securities shall have the meanings set forth for such terms in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended."
"3040","	(d)	Any notice under this Agreement shall be given in writing, addressed and delivered, or mailed postpaid, to the other party or parties at the current office address provided by each party."
"3041","10.	The Adviser represents and warrants to the Sub-Adviser, on an on-going basis, that:"
"3042","	(a)	Each Portfolio is a Qualified Purchaser within the meaning of Investment Company Act of 1940; and"
"3043","	(b)	Each Portfolio is a Qualified Eligible Person as defined in the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Rule 4.7, and is either a member of, or exempt from any requirement to become a member of, the National Futures Association, and will maintain and renew such membership or exemption during the term of this Agreement."
"3044","	(c)	The Adviser acknowledges that the Sub-Adviser has been authorized to invest in futures and other exchange traded derivatives for each Portfolio (other than The Hartford Money Market Fund and Hartford Money Market HLS Fund).&#255; In order to invest in such futures and exchange traded derivatives, the Sub-Adviser (which is registered with the CFTC as a Commodities Trading Adviser) intends to operate each Portfolio as an exempt account under CFTC Rule 4.7."
"3045","PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION IN CONNECTION WITH ACCOUNTS OF QUALIFIED ELIGIBLE PERSONS, THIS AGREEMENT IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE, AND HAS NOT BEEN, FILED WITH THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION.&#255; THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION DOES NOT PASS UPON THE MERITS OF PARTICIPATING IN A TRADING PROGRAM OR UPON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR DISCLOSURE.&#255; CONSEQUENTLY, THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION HAS NOT REVIEWED OR APPROVED THIS AGREEMENT."
"3046","11.	Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any partner, officer, or employee of the Sub-Adviser to engage in any business or to devote his or her time and attention in part to the management or other aspects of any other business, whether of a similar nature or a dissimilar nature, nor to limit or restrict the right of the Sub-Adviser to engage in any other business or to render services of any kind to any other corporation, firm, individual or association."
"3047","12.	The Adviser agrees that neither it nor any affiliate of the Adviser will use the Sub-Adviser's name or refer to the Sub-Adviser or the Sub-Adviser's clients in marketing and promotional materials without prior notification to and authorization by the Sub-Adviser, such authorization not to be unreasonably withheld."
"3048","13.	If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or otherwise, the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby."
"3049","14. 	This Agreement, including the schedules hereto, constitutes the entire understanding between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior agreement between the parties on this subject matter."
"3050","15.	The amendment of this Agreement for the sole purpose of adding one or more Portfolios shall not be deemed an amendment affecting an already existing Portfolio and requiring the approval of shareholders of that Portfolio.  The amendment of Schedule A and/or Schedule B to this Agreement for the sole purpose of (i) adding or deleting one or more Portfolios or (ii) making other non-material changes to the information included in the Schedule shall not be deemed an amendment of this Agreement."
