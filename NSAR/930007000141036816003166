"7823","the Company) as of and for the year ended July 31,"
"7824","2016, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"7825","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"7826","we considered the Company's internal control over"
"7827","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"7828","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"7829","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"7830","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"7831","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"7832","on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control"
"7833","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such"
"7834","opinion."
"7835","The management of the Company is responsible for"
"7836","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"7837","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"7838","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"7839","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"7840","A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"7841","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"7842","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"7843","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"7844","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"7845","principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"7846","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"7847","pertain to the  maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"7848","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"7849","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"7850","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"7851","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"7852","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"7853","and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"7854","being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"7855","management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide"
"7856","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"7857","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"7858","of a company's assets that could have a material effect on"
"7859","the financial statements."
"7860","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"7861","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"7862","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"7863","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"7864","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"7865","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"7866","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"7867","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"7868","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"7869","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"7870","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"7871","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"7872","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"7873","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"7874","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"7875","Company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"7876","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"7877","Our consideration of the Company's internal control over"
"7878","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"7879","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"7880","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"7881","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"7882","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"7883","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Company's"
"7884","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"7885","including controls over safeguarding securities that we"
"7886","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"7887","July 31, 2016."

"7938","(a)	Subject to the supervision and direction of the"
"7939","Trust's Board of Trustees (the Board) and review by UBS"

"7953","continue to qualify as a regulated investment company"
"7954","under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as"
"7955","amended (Code).  The Sub-Adviser will provide services"

"7968","UBS AM hereby designates and appoints the Sub-Adviser as"
"7969","its and the Portfolio's limited purpose agent and attorney-in-"
"7970","fact, without further prior approval of UBS AM (except as"

"7977","in connection with any purchase for the  Portfolio or"
"7978","Segment of securities or instruments that are not registered"
"7979","under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the"
"7980","Securities Act), the Sub-Adviser shall have the full power"

"7982","purchase such securities for the Portfolio on the terms and"
"7983","conditions under which such securities are offered; (ii)"

purchases will have to be sold due to FOL limits or levels
applicable on a stand-alone basis to the Segment or the
Portfolio.


(b)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not consult with
any other sub-adviser (Other Sub-Adviser) for the Trust or
Portfolio concerning any transaction by the Portfolio or
Segment in securities or other assets, including (i) the
purchase by the Portfolio or Segment of a security issued by
the Other Sub-Adviser, or an affiliate of the Other Sub-
Adviser, to the Trust or Portfolio except as permitted by the
1940 Act or (ii) transactions by the Portfolio or Segment in
any security for which the Other Sub-Adviser, or its affiliate,
is the principal underwriter. The parties acknowledge and
agree that the Sub-Adviser may, at its expense and in its
discretion, utilize personnel employed by affiliates of the
Sub-Adviser to perform services pursuant to this Agreement
by way of a participating affiliate agreement in accordance
with, and to the extent permitted by, the Act and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers"
"8012","Act), including the published interpretations thereof by the
SEC or its staff. Such participating affiliate agreement shall
subject the personnel providing such services to the Sub-
Adviser's compliance and other programs with respect to
their activities on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment. For the
avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged and agreed that the
Sub-Adviser assumes full responsibility for all actions, and
any failure to act, by each person utilized by the Sub-Adviser
to perform services under this Agreement. The parties
further acknowledge and agree that the Sub-Adviser and/or
its participating affiliate may, in its discretion, utilize a third
party to perform administrative support services, provided
that the Sub-Adviser's use of such service provider does not
relieve the Sub-Adviser of any obligation under this
Agreement.


(c)	Unless otherwise instructed by UBS AM or the
Trust, the Sub-Adviser agrees that it will be responsible for
voting proxies of issuers of securities held by the Portfolio or
Segment to the extent the Sub-Adviser receives the proxy
materials on a timely basis.  The Sub-Adviser further agrees
that it will adopt written proxy voting procedures that shall
comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (Advisers"
"8013","Act) (Proxy Voting Policy), and that shall be acceptable to
the Board.  The Sub-Adviser shall also provide its Proxy
Voting Policy, and if requested by UBS AM, a summary of
such Proxy Voting Policy for inclusion in the Trust's
registration statement, and will provide UBS AM with any
material amendment to the Proxy Voting Policy within a
reasonable time after such amendment has taken effect.
The Sub-Adviser further agrees that it will provide the Board
on or before August 1st of each year, or more frequently as
the Board may reasonably request, with a written report of
the proxies voted during the most recent 12-month period
ending June 30, or such other period as the Board may
designate, in a format that shall comply with the 1940 Act
and that shall be acceptable to the Board.

(d) 	The Sub-Adviser agrees that upon the request of
UBS AM or the Board, Sub-Adviser shall exercise the rights
incident to the securities held by the Portfolio or Segment in
the context of a bankruptcy or other reorganization.  The
Sub-Adviser further agrees that it will keep UBS AM fully
informed about any such actions that it intends to take. Sub-
Adviser shall not be responsible for managing, monitoring or
conducting litigation (including class action or bankruptcy
proceedings) or other proceedings related to any investment
held or once held in the Portfolio or Segment and UBS AM
acknowledges and agrees that it, and any legal adviser of
UBS AM, shall remain solely responsible for the management
of such proceedings.

(e)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will place orders
with brokers in accordance with best execution policies,
taking into account best price as an important factor in this
decision, provided that, on behalf of the Portfolio or
Segment, the Sub-Adviser may, in its discretion, use brokers
that provide the Sub-Adviser with research, analysis, advice
and similar services to execute portfolio transactions on
behalf of the Portfolio or Segment, and the Sub-Adviser may
pay to those brokers in return for brokerage and research
services a higher commission than may be charged by other
brokers, subject to the Sub-Adviser's determination in good
faith that such commission is reasonable in terms either of
the particular transaction or of the overall responsibility of
the Sub-Adviser to the Portfolio or Segment and its other
clients and that the total commissions paid by the Portfolio
or Segment will be reasonable in relation to the benefits to
the Portfolio or Segment over the long term.  In no instance
will portfolio securities be purchased from or sold to UBS AM
or the Sub-Adviser, the Trust's principal underwriter, or any
affiliated person thereof, except in accordance with the
federal securities laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder.  UBS AM will provide the Sub-Adviser with a list
of such affiliates and will update such list as necessary, and
the Sub-Adviser will only be responsible for complying with
such requirement to the extent it has been provided such
list. The Sub-Adviser may aggregate sales and purchase
orders with respect to the assets of the Portfolio or Segment
with similar orders being made simultaneously for other
accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates.
Whenever the Sub-Adviser simultaneously places orders to
purchase or sell the same security on behalf of the Portfolio
or Segment and one or more other accounts advised by the
Sub-Adviser, the orders will be allocated as to price and
amount among all such accounts in a manner believed to be
equitable over time to each account.  UBS AM recognizes
that in some cases this procedure may adversely affect the
results obtained for the Portfolio or Segment. UBS AM
acknowledges that the Sub-Adviser trades on a global basis
and manages accounts formed under and which are subject
to the rules of jurisdictions outside of the United States. As a
result, in order to comply with different regulatory
requirements, Sub-Adviser may be required to execute
trades for similar securities for other clients on different
markets or trading venues and it may not be possible to
aggregate trades or to obtain the same prices or terms for
the same trade.

Subject to the Sub-Adviser's obligations to seek best
execution, UBS AM agrees that the Sub-Adviser, in its sole
discretion, may place transactions on behalf of the Portfolio
or Segment and the Trust with any broker-dealer deemed to
be an affiliate (including affiliated FCMs) of the Sub-Adviser
(the Affiliated Broker-Dealers) so long as such transactions
are effected in conformity with the requirements (including
any applicable exemptions and administrative
interpretations set forth in Part 2A of the Sub-Adviser's Form
ADV Registration Statement on file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (Form ADV)) of Section 11(a)(1)(H)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act), and
in compliance with Rules 17e-1 or 10f-3 under the 1940 Act
or other applicable rules and the Trust's policies and
procedures thereunder.  In all such dealings, the Affiliated
Broker-Dealers shall be authorized and entitled to retain any
commissions, remuneration or profits which may be made in
such transactions and shall not be liable to account for the
same to UBS AM, the Portfolio or the Trust.  In the event
Sub-Adviser becomes affiliated (as deemed under the
federal securities laws) with a broker-dealer during the term
of this Agreement, Sub-Adviser shall obtain the approval of
the Trust's Board of Trustees prior to commencement of
transactions with such broker-dealer on behalf of the
Portfolio or the Trust.

UBS AM further authorizes the Sub-Adviser and its Affiliated
Broker-Dealers to execute agency cross transactions (the
Cross Transactions) on behalf of the Portfolio and the
Trust. Cross Transactions are transactions which may be
effected by the Affiliated Broker-Dealers acting for both the
Portfolio or the Trust and the counterparty to the
transaction.  Cross Transactions enable the Sub-Adviser to
purchase or sell a block of securities for the Portfolio or the
Trust at a set price and possibly avoid an unfavorable price
movement that may be created through entrance into the
market with such purchase or sale order.  As such, the Sub-
Adviser believes that Cross Transactions can provide
meaningful benefits for the Portfolio and the Trust and its
clients generally.  UBS AM, the Portfolio and the Trust should
be aware, however, that in a Cross Transaction an Affiliated
Broker-Dealer will be receiving commissions from both sides
of the trade and, therefore, there is a potentially conflicting
division of loyalties and responsibilities.  Sub-Adviser shall
effect such Cross Transactions in compliance with Rule
206(3)-2 under the Advisers Act, Rule 17a-7 under the 1940
Act, and any other applicable provisions of the federal
securities laws and shall provide UBS AM with periodic
reports describing such agency cross transactions.  UBS AM
understands that the authority of the Sub-Adviser to execute
agency Cross Transactions for the Portfolio is terminable at
will without penalty, effective upon receipt by the Sub-
Adviser of written notice from UBS AM, and that the failure
to terminate such authorization will result in its
continuation.


(f)	The Sub-Adviser shall maintain separate detailed
records of all matters pertaining to the Portfolio or Segment,
including, without limitation, brokerage and other records of
all securities transactions to the extent required by the
Advisers Acts or the 1940 Act.  Any records required to be
maintained and preserved pursuant to the provisions of Rule
31a-1 and Rule 31a-2 promulgated under the 1940 Act that
are prepared or maintained by the Sub-Adviser on behalf of
the Trust are the property of the Trust and will be
surrendered promptly to the Trust upon request; provided
that the Sub-Adviser shall be entitled to maintain copies of
such records to the extent required by law or regulation of
the Sub-Adviser's policies and procedures. The Sub-Adviser
further agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed in
Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the records required to be
maintained under Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and will
furnish the Board and UBS AM with such periodic and special
reports as the Board or UBS AM may reasonably request.

(g)	At such times as shall be reasonably requested by
the Board or UBS AM, the Sub-Adviser will provide the Board
and UBS AM with economic and investment analyses and
reports as well as quarterly reports setting forth the
performance of the Portfolio or Segment and make available
to the Board and UBS AM any economic, statistical and
investment services that the Sub-Adviser normally makes
available to its institutional or other customers.

(h)	In accordance with procedures adopted by the
Board, as amended from time to time, the Sub-Adviser shall
provide reasonable assistance to the Board and UBS AM in
the fair valuation of the portfolio securities in the Portfolio
or Segment for which the custodian is unable to obtain
prices in the ordinary course of business from an automated
pricing service. In such instances, the Sub-Adviser shall use
its reasonable efforts to arrange for the provision of a price
or prices from one or more parties independent of the Sub-
Adviser. In the event Sub-Adviser is unable to reasonably
obtain a price, Sub-Adviser shall provide a fair value proxy
recommendation. Notwithstanding any services or
assistance Sub-Adviser may provide in accordance with this
Section 2(h) with respect to arranging for the provision of
prices or providing valuation recommendations for Portfolio
or Segment securities, UBS AM acknowledges that they are
responsible for all pricing and valuation determinations.


The Sub-Adviser also will provide such information or
perform such additional acts as are customarily performed
by a Sub-Adviser and may be required for the Trust or UBS
AM to comply with their respective obligations under
applicable federal securities laws, including, without
limitation, the
1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the 1934 Act, the Securities Act,
and any rule or regulation thereunder.

3.	Further Duties.  In all matters relating to the
performance of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will seek to
act in conformity with the Trust's Trust Instrument, By-Laws
and Registration Statement, the Trust's policies and
procedures for compliance by the Trust with the Federal
Securities Laws (as that term is defined in Rule 38a-1 under
the 1940 Act) provided to the Sub-Adviser (together, the
Trust Compliance Procedures) and with the written
instructions and written directions of the Board and UBS AM,
and will comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act, and
the Advisers Act, and the rules under each, the Code, and all
other federal and state laws and regulations applicable to
the Trust and the Portfolio. UBS AM agrees to provide to the
Sub-Adviser copies of the Trust's Trust Instrument, By-Laws,
Registration Statement, Trust's Compliance Procedures,
written instructions and directions of the Board and UBS AM,
and any amendments or supplements to any of these
materials as soon as practicable after such materials become
available.  UBS AM further agrees to identify to the Sub-
Adviser in writing any broker-dealers that are affiliated with
UBS AM (other than UBS Financial Services Inc. and UBS
Asset Management (US) Inc.).

In order to assist the Trust and the Trust's Chief Compliance
Officer (the Trust CCO) to satisfy the requirements
contained in Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Adviser
shall provide to the Trust CCO:  (i) direct access to the Sub-
Adviser's chief compliance officer and/or other senior
compliance
personnel, as reasonably requested by the Trust CCO; (ii)
quarterly reports confirming that the Sub-Adviser has
complied with the Trust Compliance Procedures in managing
the Portfolio or Segment; and (iii) quarterly certifications
that there were no Material Compliance Matters (as that
term is defined by Rule 38a-1(e)(2)) that arose under the
Trust Compliance Procedures that related to the Sub-
Adviser's management of the Portfolio or Segment.

The Sub-Adviser shall promptly provide the Trust CCO with
copies of: (i) the Sub-Adviser's policies and procedures for
compliance by the Sub-Adviser with the Federal Securities
Laws (together, the Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures),
and (ii) any material changes to the Sub-Adviser Compliance
Procedures.  The Sub-Adviser shall cooperate fully with the
Trust CCO so as to facilitate the Trust CCO's performance of
the Trust CCO's responsibilities under Rule 38a-1 to review,
evaluate and report to the Trust's Board on the operation of
the Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures, and shall promptly
report to the Trust CCO any Material Compliance Matter
arising under the Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures
involving the Portfolio or Segment.  The Sub-Adviser shall
provide to the Trust CCO:  (i) quarterly reports confirming
the Sub-Adviser's compliance with the Sub-Adviser
Compliance Procedures in managing the Portfolio or
Segment, and (ii) certifications that there were no Material
Compliance Matters involving the Sub-Adviser that arose
under the Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures that affected
the Portfolio or Segment.  At least annually, the Sub-Adviser
shall provide a certification to the Trust CCO to the effect
that the Sub-Adviser has in place and has implemented
policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to
ensure compliance by the Sub-Adviser with any applicable
Federal Securities Laws, subject to such interpretations as
may be contained in the Trust Compliance Procedures.

The Sub-Adviser will promptly provide UBS AM with
information (including information that is required to be
disclosed in the Trust's registration statement) with respect
to the portfolio managers responsible for the Portfolio or
Segment and any changes in the portfolio managers
responsible for the Portfolio or Segment.

To the extent permitted by law or regulation, the Sub-
Adviser will promptly notify UBS AM of any pending
investigation, material litigation, administrative proceeding
or any other significant regulatory inquiry against the Sub-
Adviser.

The Sub-Adviser will cooperate promptly and fully with UBS
AM and/or the Trust in responding to any regulatory or
compliance examinations or inspections (including
information requests) relating to the Trust, the Portfolio or
UBS AM brought by any governmental or regulatory
authorities having appropriate jurisdiction (including, but not
limited to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)).

4.	Expenses.  During the term of this Agreement, the
Sub-Adviser will bear all expenses incurred by it in
connection with its services under this Agreement.  The Sub-
Adviser shall not be responsible for any expenses incurred by
the Trust, the Portfolio or UBS AM (including any brokerage
commissions, transaction costs or pricing service) except as
otherwise specifically provided herein.

Upon request by UBS AM, Sub-Adviser agrees to reimburse
UBS AM or the Trust for costs associated with generating
and distributing any Registration Statement (as defined
herein)  for when the Sub-Adviser is given a copy of a draft of
such Registration Statement reasonably in advance of the
deadline, is notified of the deadline, and fails to promptly
disclose to UBS AM facts then known to the Sub-Adviser or
its personnel that would require disclosure (or amendments
to disclosure) in the Fund's Registration Statement in time
for such disclosure or amendments to disclosure to be
included in such Registration Statement.  The Sub-Adviser
shall bear all reasonable expenses of the Trust, if any, arising
out of an assignment or change in control of the Sub-
Adviser.

5.	Compensation.

(a)	For the services provided and the expenses
assumed by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement,
UBS AM, not the Portfolio, will pay to the Sub-Adviser a fee,
computed daily and payable monthly, at an annual rate of
___% of the average daily net assets of the Portfolio or
Segment allocated to its management (computed in the
manner specified in the Management Agreement), and will
provide the Sub-Adviser with a schedule showing the
manner in which the fee was computed.  If the Sub-Adviser is
managing a Segment, its fees will be based on the value of
the assets of the Portfolio within the Sub-Adviser's Segment.

(b)	The fee shall be accrued daily and payable monthly
to the Sub-Adviser on or before the last business day of the
next succeeding calendar month.

(c)	For those periods in which UBS AM has agreed to
waive all or a portion of its management fee, UBS AM may
ask the Sub-Adviser to waive the same proportion of its fees,
but the Sub-Adviser is under no obligation to do so.

(d)	If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates
before the end of any month, the fee for the period from the
effective date to the end of the month or from the beginning
of such month to the date of termination, as the case may
be, shall be pro-rated according to the proportion which
such period bears to the full month in that such
effectiveness or termination occurs.

6. Limitation of Liability.

(a) 	The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any error of
judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the
Portfolio, the Trust or its shareholders or by UBS AM in
connection with the matters to which this Agreement
relates, except a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad
faith or negligence on its part in the performance of its
duties or from reckless disregard by it of its obligations and
duties under this Agreement.

(b)	In no event will the Sub-Adviser have any
responsibility for any other portfolio of the Trust, for any
portion of the Portfolio not managed by the Sub-Adviser or
for the acts or omissions of any Other Sub-Adviser to the
Trust or Portfolio, the Trust's custodian. In particular, in the
event the Sub-Adviser shall manage only a Segment of the
Portfolio, the Sub-Adviser shall have no responsibility for the
Portfolio's being in violation of any applicable law or
regulation or investment policy or restriction applicable to
the Portfolio as a whole or for the Portfolio's failing to
qualify as a regulated investment company under the Code,
if the securities and other holdings of the Segment of the
Portfolio managed by the
Sub-Adviser are such that such Segment would not be in
such violation or fail to so qualify if such Segment were
deemed a separate series of the Trust or a separate
regulated investment company under the Code, unless such
violation was due to the Sub-Advisers failure to comply with
written guidelines adopted by the Board or UBS AM and
provided to the Sub-Adviser.

Nothing in this section shall be deemed a limitation or
waiver of any obligation or duty that may not by law be
limited or waived.

<DESCRIPTION>SUB-ADVISOR AGREEMENT 2
<TEXT>
For period ending 	July 31, 2016		Exhibit 77Q1
File number	811-8764


SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT

	Agreement dated as of February 10, 2016 between UBS
Asset Management (Americas) Inc. (UBS AM), a Delaware
corporation, and Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated (Sub-"
"8015","Adviser), a Wisconsin corporation (the Agreement).

RECITALS

(1)	UBS AM has entered into a Management Agreement
dated as of August 1, 2008  (Management Agreement),
with PACE(r) Select Advisors Trust (Trust), an open-end
management investment company registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (1940 Act),
with respect to PACE(r) International Equity Investments
(Portfolio); and

(2) 	UBS AM is authorized to retain one or more sub-
advisers to furnish certain investment advisory services to
UBS AM and the Portfolio;

(3)	UBS AM desires to retain the Sub-Adviser to furnish
certain investment advisory services to UBS AM and the
Portfolio or a designated portion of the assets (Segment)
of the Portfolio; and

(4)	The Sub-Adviser is willing to furnish such services;

Now therefore, in consideration of the premises and mutual
covenants herein contained, UBS AM and the Sub-Adviser
agree as follows:

1.	Appointment.  UBS AM hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser
as an investment sub-adviser with respect to the Portfolio or
Segment for the period and on the terms set forth in this
Agreement. The Sub-Adviser accepts that appointment and
agrees to render the services herein set forth, for the
compensation herein provided.

2.	Duties as Sub-Adviser.

(a)	Subject to the supervision and direction of the Trust's
Board of Trustees (the Board) and review by UBS AM, and
any written guidelines adopted by the Board or UBS AM the
Sub-Adviser will provide a continuous investment program
for the Portfolio or Segment, including investment research
and discretionary management with respect to all securities
and investments and cash equivalents in the Portfolio or
Segment. The Sub-Adviser will determine from time to time
what investments will be purchased, retained or sold by the
Portfolio or Segment.  The Sub-Adviser will be responsible
for placing purchase and sell orders for investments and for
other related transactions for the Portfolio or Segment. The
Sub-Adviser understands that the Portfolio's assets need to
be managed so as to permit the Portfolio to qualify or to
continue to qualify as a regulated investment company
under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as
amended (Code).  The Sub-Adviser will provide services
under this Agreement in accordance with the Portfolio's
investment objective, policies and restrictions as stated in
the Trust's currently effective registration statement under
the 1940 Act, and any amendments or supplements thereto
(Registration Statement).  The Sub-Adviser, on each
business day, shall provide UBS AM and the Trust's custodian
such information as UBS AM and the Trust's custodian may
reasonably request relating to all transactions concerning
the Portfolio or Segment.

UBS AM hereby designates and appoints the Sub-Adviser as
its and the Portfolio's limited purpose agent and attorney-in-
fact, without further prior approval of UBS AM (except as
expressly provided for herein or as may be required by law)
to make and execute, in the name and on behalf of the
Portfolio, all agreements, instruments and other documents
and to take all such other action which the Sub-Adviser
considers necessary or advisable to carry out its duties
hereunder. By way of example and not by way of limitation,
in connection with any purchase for the  Portfolio or
Segment of securities or instruments that are not registered
under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
Securities Act), the Sub-Adviser shall have the full power
and authority, among other things, to: (i) commit to
purchase such securities for the Portfolio on the terms and
conditions under which such securities are offered; (ii)
execute such account opening and other agreements,
instruments and documents (including, without limitation,
purchase agreements, subscription documents, ISDA and
other swap and derivative documents), and make such
commitments, as may be required in connection with the
purchase and sale of such securities or instruments; (iii)
represent that the Portfolio is an accredited investor as
defined in Rule 501 (a) of Regulation D under the Securities
Act and a Qualified Institutional Buyer as defined in Rule
144A (a) (1) (i) under the Securities Act; and (iv) commit that
such securities will not be offered or sold by the Portfolio
except in compliance with the registration requirements of
the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom. This power-of-
attorney is a continuing power-of-attorney and shall remain
in full force and effect until revoked by UBS AM or the Trust
in writing, but any such revocation shall not affect any
transaction initiated prior to receipt by the Sub-Adviser of
such notice.

When investing in non-US securities, the Sub-Advisor is
responsible for identifying and complying with all applicable
laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which the security
is traded. The Sub-Advisor shall use the degree of care,
diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent investment
manager would exercise under the circumstances not to
establish or add to existing positions in securities that are
subject to any applicable foreign ownership limits or levels
(FOL'') at a time when it is reasonably foreseeable that such"
"8016","purchases will have to be sold due to FOL limits or levels."
"8017","(b)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not consult with any"
"8018","other sub-adviser (Other Sub-Adviser) for the Trust or"
"8019","Portfolio concerning any transaction by the Portfolio or"
"8020","Segment in securities or other assets, including (i) the"
"8021","purchase by the Portfolio or Segment of a security issued by"
"8022","the Other Sub-Adviser, or an affiliate of the Other Sub-"
"8023","Adviser, to the Trust or Portfolio except as permitted by the"
"8024","1940 Act or (ii) transactions by the Portfolio or Segment in"
"8025","any security for which the Other Sub-Adviser, or its affiliate,"
"8026","is the principal underwriter."
"8027","(c)	Unless otherwise instructed by UBS AM or the Trust, the"
"8028","Sub-Adviser agrees that it will be responsible for voting"
"8029","proxies of issuers of securities held by the Portfolio or"
"8030","Segment.  The Sub-Adviser further agrees that it will adopt"
"8031","written proxy voting procedures that shall comply with the"
"8032","requirements of the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers"
"8033","Act of 1940, as amended (Advisers Act) (Proxy Voting
Policy), and that shall be acceptable to the Board.  The Sub-"
"8034","Adviser shall also provide its Proxy Voting Policy, and if"
"8035","requested by UBS AM, a summary of such Proxy Voting"
"8036","Policy for inclusion in the Trust's registration statement, and"
"8037","will provide UBS AM with any material amendment to the"
"8038","Proxy Voting Policy within a reasonable time after such"
"8039","amendment has taken effect.  The Sub-Adviser further"
"8040","agrees that it will provide the Board on or before August 1st"
"8041","of each year, or more frequently as the Board may"
"8042","reasonably request, with a written report of the proxies"
"8043","voted during the most recent 12-month period ending June"
"8044","30, or such other period as the Board may designate, in a"
"8045","format that shall comply with the 1940 Act and that shall be"
"8046","acceptable to the Board."
"8047","(d) 	The Sub-Adviser agrees that upon the request of"
"8048","UBS AM or the Board, Sub-Adviser shall exercise the rights"
"8049","incident to the securities held by the Portfolio or Segment in"
"8050","the context of a bankruptcy or other reorganization.  The"
"8051","Sub-Adviser further agrees that it will keep UBS AM fully"
"8052","informed about any such actions that it intends to take."
"8053","(e)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will place orders with"
"8054","brokers in accordance with best execution policies, taking"
"8055","into account best price as an important factor in this"
"8056","decision, provided that, on behalf of the Portfolio or"
"8057","Segment, the Sub-Adviser may, in its discretion, use brokers"
"8058","that provide the Sub-Adviser with research, analysis, advice"
"8059","and similar services to execute portfolio transactions on"
"8060","behalf of the Portfolio or Segment, and the Sub-Adviser may"
"8061","pay to those brokers in return for brokerage and research"
"8062","services a higher commission than may be charged by other"
"8063","brokers, subject to the Sub-Adviser's determination in good"
"8064","faith that such commission is reasonable in terms either of"
"8065","the particular transaction or of the overall responsibility of"
"8066","the Sub-Adviser to the Portfolio or Segment and its other"
"8067","clients and that the total commissions paid by the Portfolio"
"8068","or Segment will be reasonable in relation to the benefits to"
"8069","the Portfolio or Segment over the long term.  In no instance"
"8070","will portfolio securities be purchased from or sold to UBS AM"
"8071","or the Sub-Adviser, the Trust's principal underwriter, or any"
"8072","affiliated person thereof, except in accordance with the"
"8073","federal securities laws and the rules and regulations"
"8074","thereunder.  The Sub-Adviser may aggregate sales and"
"8075","purchase orders with respect to the assets of the Portfolio or"
"8076","Segment with similar orders being made simultaneously for"
"8077","other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates."
"8078","Whenever the Sub-Adviser simultaneously places orders to"
"8079","purchase or sell the same security on behalf of the Portfolio"
"8080","or Segment and one or more other accounts advised by the"
"8081","Sub-Adviser, the orders will be allocated as to price and"
"8082","amount among all such accounts in a manner believed to be"
"8083","equitable over time to each account.  UBS AM recognizes"
"8084","that in some cases this procedure may adversely affect the"
"8085","results obtained for the Portfolio or Segment."
"8086","Subject to the Sub-Adviser's obligations to seek best"
"8087","execution, UBS AM agrees that the Sub-Adviser, in its sole"
"8088","discretion, may place transactions on behalf of the Portfolio"
"8089","or Segment and the Trust with any broker-dealer deemed to"
"8090","be an affiliate (including affiliated FCMs) of the Sub-Adviser"
"8091","(the Affiliated Broker-Dealers) so long as such transactions"
"8092","are effected in conformity with the requirements (including"
"8093","any applicable exemptions and administrative"
"8094","interpretations set forth in Part II of the Sub-Adviser's Form"
"8095","ADV Registration Statement on file with the Securities and"
"8096","Exchange Commission (Form ADV)) of Section 11(a)(1)(H)"
"8097","of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act), and"
"8098","in compliance with Rules 17e-1 or 10f-3 under the 1940 Act"
"8099","or other applicable rules and the Trust's policies and"
"8100","procedures thereunder.  In all such dealings, the Affiliated"
"8101","Broker-Dealers shall be authorized and entitled to retain any"
"8102","commissions, remuneration or profits which may be made in"
"8103","such transactions and shall not be liable to account for the"
"8104","same to UBS AM, the Portfolio or the Trust.  In the event"
"8105","Sub-Adviser becomes affiliated (as deemed under the"
"8106","federal securities laws) with a broker-dealer during the term"
"8107","of this Agreement, Sub-Adviser shall obtain the approval of"
"8108","the Trust's Board of Trustees prior to commencement of"
"8109","transactions with such broker-dealer on behalf of the"
"8110","Portfolio or the Trust."
"8111","UBS AM further authorizes the Sub-Adviser and its Affiliated"
"8112","Broker-Dealers to execute agency cross transactions (the"
"8113","Cross Transactions) on behalf of the Portfolio and the"
"8114","Trust. Cross Transactions are transactions which may be"
"8115","effected by the Affiliated Broker-Dealers acting for both the"
"8116","Portfolio or the Trust and the counterparty to the"
"8117","transaction.  Cross Transactions enable the Sub-Adviser to"
"8118","purchase or sell a block of securities for the Portfolio or the"
"8119","Trust at a set price and possibly avoid an unfavorable price"
"8120","movement that may be created through entrance into the"
"8121","market with such purchase or sale order.  As such, the Sub-"
"8122","Adviser believes that Cross Transactions can provide"
"8123","meaningful benefits for the Portfolio and the Trust and its"
"8124","clients generally.  UBS AM, the Portfolio and the Trust should"
"8125","be aware, however, that in a Cross Transaction an Affiliated"
"8126","Broker-Dealer will be receiving commissions from both sides"
"8127","of the trade and, therefore, there is a potentially conflicting"
"8128","division of loyalties and responsibilities.  Sub-Adviser shall"
"8129","effect such Cross Transactions in compliance with Rule"
"8130","206(3)-2 under the Advisers Act, Rule 17a-7 under the 1940"
"8131","Act, and any other applicable provisions of the federal"
"8132","securities laws and shall provide UBS AM with periodic"
"8133","reports describing such agency cross transactions.  UBS AM"
"8134","understands that the authority of the Sub-Adviser to execute"
"8135","agency Cross Transactions for the Portfolio is terminable at"
"8136","will without penalty, effective upon receipt by the Sub-"
"8137","Adviser of written notice from UBS AM, and that the failure"
"8138","to terminate such authorization will result in its"
"8139","continuation."
"8140","(f)	The Sub-Adviser shall maintain separate detailed records"
"8141","of all matters pertaining to the Portfolio or Segment,"
"8142","including, without limitation, brokerage and other records of"
"8143","all securities transactions.  Any records required to be"
"8144","maintained and preserved pursuant to the provisions of Rule"
"8145","31a-1 and Rule 31a-2 promulgated under the 1940 Act that"
"8146","are prepared or maintained by the Sub-Adviser on behalf of"
"8147","the Trust are the property of the Trust and will be"
"8148","surrendered promptly to the Trust upon request. The Sub-"
"8149","Adviser further agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed"
"8150","in"
"8151","Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the records required to be"
"8152","maintained under Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and will"
"8153","furnish the Board and UBS AM with such periodic and special"
"8154","reports as the Board or UBS AM may request."
"8155","(g)	At such times as shall be reasonably requested by the"
"8156","Board or UBS AM, the Sub-Adviser will provide the Board"
"8157","and UBS AM with economic and investment analyses and"
"8158","reports as well as quarterly reports setting forth the"
"8159","performance of the Portfolio or Segment and make available"
"8160","to the Board and UBS AM any economic, statistical and"
"8161","investment services that the Sub-Adviser normally makes"
"8162","available to its institutional or other customers."
"8163","(h)	In accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, as"
"8164","amended from time to time, the Sub-Adviser is responsible"
"8165","for assisting the Board and UBS AM in the fair valuation of all"
"8166","portfolio securities in the Portfolio or Segment and will use"
"8167","its reasonable efforts to arrange for the provision of a price"
"8168","or prices from one or more parties independent of the Sub-"
"8169","Adviser for each portfolio security for which the custodian"
"8170","does not obtain prices in the ordinary course of business"
"8171","from an automated pricing service."
"8172","The Sub-Adviser also will provide such information or"
"8173","perform such additional acts as are customarily performed"
"8174","by a Sub-Adviser and may be required for the Trust or UBS"
"8175","AM to comply with their respective obligations under"
"8176","applicable federal securities laws, including, without"
"8177","limitation, the"
"8178","1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the 1934 Act, the Securities Act,"
"8179","and any rule or regulation thereunder."
"8180","3.	Further Duties.  In all matters relating to the performance"
"8181","of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will seek to act in"
"8182","conformity with the Trust's Trust Instrument, By-Laws and"
"8183","Registration Statement, the Trust's policies and procedures"
"8184","for compliance by the Trust with the Federal Securities Laws"
"8185","(as that term is defined in Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act)"
"8186","provided to the Sub-Adviser (together, the Trust
Compliance Procedures) and with the written instructions"
"8187","and written directions of the Board and UBS AM, and will"
"8188","comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act, and the"
"8189","Advisers Act, and the rules under each, the Code, and all"
"8190","other federal and state laws and regulations applicable to"
"8191","the Trust and the Portfolio. UBS AM agrees to provide to the"
"8192","Sub-Adviser copies of the Trust's Trust Instrument, By-Laws,"
"8193","Registration Statement, Trust's Compliance Procedures,"
"8194","written instructions and directions of the Board and UBS AM,"
"8195","and any amendments or supplements to any of these"
"8196","materials as soon as practicable after such materials become"
"8197","available.  UBS AM further agrees to identify to the Sub-"
"8198","Adviser in writing any broker-dealers that are affiliated with"
"8199","UBS AM (other than UBS Financial Services Inc. and UBS"
"8200","Asset Management (US) Inc.)."
"8201","In order to assist the Trust and the Trust's Chief Compliance"
"8202","Officer (the Trust CCO) to satisfy the requirements"
"8203","contained in Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Adviser"
"8204","shall provide to the Trust CCO:  (i) direct access to the Sub-"
"8205","Adviser's chief compliance officer and/or other senior"
"8206","compliance"
"8207","personnel, as reasonably requested by the Trust CCO; (ii)"
"8208","quarterly reports confirming that the Sub-Adviser has"
"8209","complied with the Trust Compliance Procedures in managing"
"8210","the Portfolio or Segment; and (iii) quarterly certifications"
"8211","that there were no Material Compliance Matters (as that"
"8212","term is defined by Rule 38a-1(e)(2)) that arose under the"
"8213","Trust Compliance Procedures that related to the Sub-"
"8214","Adviser's management of the Portfolio or Segment."
"8215","The Sub-Adviser shall promptly provide the Trust CCO with"
"8216","copies of: (i) the Sub-Adviser's policies and procedures for"
"8217","compliance by the Sub-Adviser with the Federal Securities"
"8218","Laws (together, the Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures),"
"8219","and (ii) any material changes to the Sub-Adviser Compliance"
"8220","Procedures.  The Sub-Adviser shall cooperate fully with the"
"8221","Trust CCO so as to facilitate the Trust CCO's performance of"
"8222","the Trust CCO's responsibilities under Rule 38a-1 to review,"
"8223","evaluate and report to the Trust's Board on the operation of"
"8224","the Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures, and shall promptly"

"8238","ensure compliance by the Sub-Adviser with any applicable"
"8239","Federal Securities Laws, subject to such interpretations as"
"8240","may be contained in the Trust Compliance Procedures."
"8241","The Sub-Adviser will promptly provide UBS AM with"
"8242","information (including information that is required to be"
"8243","disclosed in the Trust's registration statement) with respect"
"8244","to the portfolio managers responsible for the Portfolio or"

"8247","The Sub-Adviser will promptly notify UBS AM of any pending"
"8248","investigation, material litigation, administrative proceeding"
"8249","or any other significant regulatory inquiry."

"8266","herein)  for when the Sub-Adviser is given a copy of a draft of"
"8267","such Registration Statement and fails to promptly disclose to"
"8268","UBS AM facts then known to the Sub-Adviser or its personnel"
"8269","that would require disclosure (or amendments to disclosure)"
"8270","in the Fund's Registration Statement in time for such"
"8271","disclosure or amendments to disclosure to be included in"

"8280","__% of the average daily net assets of the Portfolio or"
"8281","Segment allocated to its management (computed in the"
"8282","manner specified in the Management Agreement), and will"
"8283","provide the Sub-Adviser with a schedule showing the"
"8284","manner in which the fee was computed.  If the Sub-Adviser is"
"8285","managing a Segment, its fees will be based on the value of"
"8286","the assets of the Portfolio within the Sub-Adviser's Segment."
"8287","(b)	The fee shall be accrued daily and payable monthly to the"
"8288","Sub-Adviser on or before the last business day of the next"

"8291","all or a portion of its management fee, UBS AM may ask the"
"8292","Sub-Adviser to waive the same proportion of its fees, but the"
"8293","Sub-Adviser is under no obligation to do so."
"8294","(d)	If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates before"
"8295","the end of any month, the fee for the period from the"
"8296","effective date to the end of the month or from the beginning"
"8297","of such month to the date of termination, as the case may"
"8298","be, shall be pro-rated according to the proportion which"
"8299","such period bears to the full month in that such"
"8300","effectiveness or termination occurs."
"8301","6. Limitation of Liability."
"8302","(a) 	The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any error"
"8303","of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the"
"8304","Portfolio, the Trust or its shareholders or by UBS AM in"
"8305","connection with the matters to which this Agreement"
"8306","relates, except a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad"
"8307","faith or negligence on its part in the performance of its"
"8308","duties or from reckless disregard by it of its obligations and"
"8309","duties under this Agreement."
"8310","(b)	In no event will the Sub-Adviser have any responsibility"
"8311","for any other portfolio of the Trust, for any portion of the"
"8312","Portfolio not managed by the Sub-Adviser or for the acts or"
"8313","omissions of any Other Sub-Adviser to the Trust or Portfolio."

"8316","responsibility for the Portfolio's being in violation of any"
"8317","applicable law or regulation or investment policy or"
"8318","restriction applicable to the Portfolio as a whole or for the"
"8319","Portfolio's failing to qualify as a regulated investment"
"8320","company under the Code, if the securities and other holdings"
"8321","of the Segment of the Portfolio managed by the"
"8322","Sub-Adviser are such that such Segment would not be in"
"8323","such violation or fail to so qualify if such Segment were"
"8324","deemed a separate series of the Trust or a separate"
"8325","regulated investment company under the Code, unless such"
"8326","violation was due to the Sub-Adviser's failure to comply with"
"8327","written guidelines adopted by the Board or UBS AM and"
"8328","provided to the Sub-Adviser."
"8329","Nothing in this section shall be deemed a limitation or"
"8330","waiver of any obligation or duty that may not by law be"
"8331","limited or waived."

"8585","as of August 1, 2008  (Management Agreement), with PACE(r)"
"8586","Select Advisors Trust (Trust), an open-end management"
"8587","investment company registered under the Investment Company"
"8588","Act of 1940, as amended (1940 Act), with respect to PACE(r)"
"8589","Alternative Strategies Investments (Portfolio); and"
"8590","(2) 	UBS AM is authorized to retain one or more sub-advisers to"
"8591","furnish certain investment advisory services to UBS AM and the"

"8596","(4)	The Sub-Adviser is willing to furnish such services;"
"8597","Now therefore, in consideration of the premises and mutual"
"8598","covenants herein contained, UBS AM and the Sub-Adviser agree"
"8599","as follows:"
"8600","1.	Appointment.  UBS AM hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser as"

"8618","transactions for the Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-Adviser"
"8619","understands that the Portfolio's assets need to be managed so as"
"8620","to permit the Portfolio to qualify or to continue to qualify as a"
"8621","regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the"
"8622","Internal Revenue Code, as amended (Code).  The Sub-Adviser"
"8623","will provide services under this Agreement in accordance with the"
"8624","Portfolio's investment objective, policies and restrictions as"
"8625","stated in the Trust's currently effective registration statement"
"8626","under the 1940 Act, and any amendments or supplements"
"8627","thereto (Registration Statement).  The Sub-Adviser, on each"
"8628","business day, shall provide UBS AM and the Trust's custodian"
"8629","such information as UBS AM and the Trust's custodian may"
"8630","reasonably request relating to all transactions concerning the"
"8631","Portfolio or Segment."
"8632","UBS AM hereby designates and appoints the Sub-Adviser as its"
"8633","and the Portfolio's limited purpose agent and attorney-in-fact,"
"8634","without further prior approval of UBS AM (except as expressly"
"8635","provided for herein or as may be required by law) to make and"
"8636","execute, in the name and on behalf of the Portfolio, all"
"8637","agreements, instruments and other documents and to take all"
"8638","such other action which the Sub-Adviser considers necessary or"
"8639","advisable to carry out its duties hereunder. By way of example"
"8640","and not by way of limitation, in connection with any purchase for"
"8641","the  Portfolio or Segment of securities or instruments that are not"
"8642","registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the"
"8643","Securities Act), the Sub-Adviser shall have the full power and"
"8644","authority, among other things, to: (i) commit to purchase such"
"8645","securities for the Portfolio on the terms and conditions under"
"8646","which such securities are offered; (ii) execute such account"
"8647","opening and other agreements, instruments and documents"
"8648","(including, without limitation, purchase agreements, subscription"
"8649","documents, ISDA and other swap and derivative documents), and"
"8650","make such commitments, as may be required in connection with"
"8651","the purchase and sale of such securities or instruments; (iii)"
"8652","represent that the Portfolio is an accredited investor as defined"
"8653","in Rule 501 (a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act and a"
"8654","Qualified Institutional Buyer as defined in Rule 144A (a) (1) (i)"
"8655","under the Securities Act; and (iv) commit that such securities will"
"8656","not be offered or sold by the Portfolio except in compliance with"
"8657","the registration requirements of the Securities Act or an"
"8658","exemption therefrom. This power-of-attorney is a continuing"
"8659","power-of-attorney and shall remain in full force and effect until"
"8660","revoked by UBS AM or the Trust in writing, but any such"
"8661","revocation shall not affect any transaction initiated prior to"
"8662","receipt by the Sub-Adviser of such notice."
"8663","When investing in non-US securities, the Sub-Adviser is"
"8664","responsible for identifying and complying with all applicable laws"
"8665","and regulations of the jurisdiction in which the security is traded."
"8666","The Sub-Adviser shall use the degree of care, diligence and skill"
"8667","that a reasonably prudent investment manager would exercise"
"8668","under the circumstances not to establish or add to existing"
"8669","positions in securities that are subject to any applicable foreign"
"8670","ownership limits or levels (FOL'') at a time when it is reasonably
foreseeable that such purchases will have to be sold due to FOL
limits or levels.


(b)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not consult with any
other sub-adviser (Other Sub-Adviser) for the Trust or Portfolio
concerning any transaction by the Portfolio or Segment in
securities or other assets, including (i) the purchase by the
Portfolio or Segment of a security issued by the Other Sub-
Adviser, or an affiliate of the Other Sub-Adviser, to the Trust or
Portfolio except as permitted by the 1940 Act or (ii) transactions
by the Portfolio or Segment in any security for which the Other
Sub-Adviser, or its affiliate, is the principal underwriter.

(c)	Unless otherwise instructed by UBS AM or the Trust, the
Sub-Adviser agrees that it will be responsible for voting proxies of
issuers of securities held by the Portfolio or Segment.  The Sub-
Adviser further agrees that it will adopt written proxy voting
procedures that shall comply with the requirements of the 1940
Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended
(Advisers Act) (Proxy Voting Policy), and that shall be
acceptable to the Board.  The Sub-Adviser shall also provide its
Proxy Voting Policy, and if requested by UBS AM, a summary of
such Proxy Voting Policy for inclusion in the Trust's registration
statement, and will provide UBS AM with any material
amendment to the Proxy Voting Policy within a reasonable time
after such amendment has taken effect.  The Sub-Adviser further
agrees that it will provide the Board on or before August 1st of
each year, or more frequently as the Board may reasonably
request, with a written report of the proxies voted during the
most recent 12-month period ending June 30, or such other
period as the Board may designate, in a format that shall comply
with the 1940 Act and that shall be acceptable to the Board.

(d) 	The Sub-Adviser agrees that upon the request of UBS AM
or the Board, Sub-Adviser shall exercise the rights incident to the
securities held by the Portfolio or Segment in the context of a
bankruptcy or other reorganization.  The Sub-Adviser further
agrees that it will keep UBS AM fully informed about any such
actions that it intends to take.

(e)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will place orders with
brokers in accordance with its best execution policies, taking into
account the best available price as an important factor in this
decision, provided that, on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment, the
Sub-Adviser may, in its discretion, use brokers that provide the
Sub-Adviser with research, analysis, advice and similar services to
execute portfolio transactions on behalf of the Portfolio or
Segment, and the Sub-Adviser may pay to those brokers in return
for brokerage and research services a higher commission than
may be charged by other brokers, subject to the Sub-Adviser's
determination in good faith that such commission is reasonable in
terms either of the particular transaction or of the overall
responsibility of the Sub-Adviser to the Portfolio or Segment and
its other clients and that the total commissions paid by the
Portfolio or Segment will be reasonable in relation to the benefits
to the Portfolio or Segment over the long term.  In no instance
will portfolio securities knowingly be purchased from or sold to
UBS AM or the Sub-Adviser, the Trust's principal underwriter, or
any affiliated person thereof, except in accordance with the
federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.
The Sub-Adviser may aggregate sales and purchase orders with
respect to the assets of the Portfolio or Segment with similar
orders being made simultaneously for other accounts advised by
the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates.  Whenever the Sub-Adviser
simultaneously places orders to purchase or sell the same
security on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment and one or more
other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser, the orders will be
allocated as to price and amount among all such accounts in a
manner believed to be equitable over time to each account.  UBS
AM recognizes that in some cases this procedure may adversely
affect the results obtained for the Portfolio or Segment.

Subject to the Sub-Adviser's obligations to seek best execution,
UBS AM agrees that the Sub-Adviser, in its sole discretion, may
place transactions on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment and the
Trust with any broker-dealer deemed to be an affiliate (including
affiliated FCMs) of the Sub-Adviser (the Affiliated Broker-"
"8671","Dealers) so long as such transactions are effected in conformity
with the requirements (including any applicable exemptions and
administrative interpretations set forth in Part 2A of the Sub-
Adviser's Form ADV Registration Statement on file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (Form ADV)) of Section
11(a)(1)(H) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934"
"8672","Act), and in compliance with Rules 17e-1 or 10f-3 under the
1940 Act or other applicable rules and the Trust's policies and
procedures thereunder.  In all such dealings, the Affiliated Broker-
Dealers shall be authorized and entitled to retain any
commissions, remuneration or profits which may be made in such
transactions and shall not be liable to account for the same to
UBS AM, the Portfolio or the Trust.  In the event Sub-Adviser
becomes affiliated (as deemed under the federal securities laws)
with a broker-dealer during the term of this Agreement, Sub-
Adviser shall obtain the approval of the Trust's Board of Trustees
prior to commencement of transactions with such broker-dealer
on behalf of the Portfolio or the Trust.

UBS AM further authorizes the Sub-Adviser and its Affiliated
Broker-Dealers to execute agency cross transactions (the Cross"
"8673","Transactions) on behalf of the Portfolio and the Trust. Cross
Transactions are transactions which may be effected by the
Affiliated Broker-Dealers acting for both the Portfolio or the Trust
and the counterparty to the transaction.  Cross Transactions
enable the Sub-Adviser to purchase or sell a block of securities for
the Portfolio or the Trust at a set price and possibly avoid an
unfavorable price movement that may be created through
entrance into the market with such purchase or sale order.  As
such, the Sub-Adviser believes that Cross Transactions can
provide meaningful benefits for the Portfolio and the Trust and its
clients generally.  UBS AM, the Portfolio and the Trust should be
aware, however, that in a Cross Transaction an Affiliated Broker-
Dealer will be receiving commissions from both sides of the trade
and, therefore, there is a potentially conflicting division of
loyalties and responsibilities.  Sub-Adviser shall effect such Cross
Transactions in compliance with Rule 206(3)-2 under the Advisers
Act, Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act, and any other applicable
provisions of the federal securities laws and shall provide UBS AM
with periodic reports describing such agency cross transactions.
UBS AM understands that the authority of the Sub-Adviser to
execute agency Cross Transactions for the Portfolio is terminable
at will without penalty, effective upon receipt by the Sub-Adviser
of written notice from UBS AM, and that the failure to terminate
such authorization will result in its continuation.

(f)	The Sub-Adviser shall maintain separate detailed records of
all matters pertaining to the Portfolio or Segment, including,
without limitation, brokerage and other records of all securities
transactions.  Any records required to be maintained and
preserved pursuant to the provisions of Rule 31a-1 and Rule 31a-
2 promulgated under the 1940 Act that are prepared or
maintained by the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the Trust are the
property of the Trust and will be surrendered promptly to the
Trust upon request, provided however, the Trust shall make
available the originals of such records if required for any legal,
regulatory or other proceeding. The Sub-Adviser further agrees to
preserve for the periods prescribed in Rule 31a-2 under the 1940
Act the records required to be maintained under Rule 31a-1
under the 1940 Act, and will furnish the Board and UBS AM with
such periodic and special reports as the Board or UBS AM may
request.

(g)	At such times as shall be reasonably requested by the
Board or UBS AM, the Sub-Adviser will provide the Board and UBS
AM with economic and investment analyses and reports as well
as quarterly reports setting forth the performance of the Portfolio
or Segment and make available to the Board and UBS AM any
economic, statistical and investment services that the Sub-
Adviser normally makes available to its institutional or other
customers.

(h)	In accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, as
amended from time to time, and provided to the Sub-Adviser, the
Sub-Adviser is responsible for assisting the Board and UBS AM in
the fair valuation of all portfolio securities in the Portfolio or
Segment and will use its reasonable efforts to arrange for the
provision of a price or prices from one or more parties
independent of the Sub-Adviser for each portfolio security for
which the custodian does not obtain prices in the ordinary course
of business from an automated pricing service.

The Sub-Adviser also will provide such information or perform
such additional acts as are customarily performed by a Sub-
Adviser and may be required for the Trust or UBS AM to comply
with their respective obligations under applicable federal
securities laws, including, without limitation, the
1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the 1934 Act, the Securities Act, and
any rule or regulation thereunder.

3.	Further Duties.  In all matters relating to the performance
of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will seek to act in conformity
with the Trust's Trust Instrument, By-Laws and Registration
Statement, the Trust's policies and procedures for compliance by
the Trust with the Federal Securities Laws (as that term is defined
in Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act) provided to the Sub-Adviser
(together, the Trust Compliance Procedures) and with the
written instructions and written directions of the Board and UBS
AM, and will comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act, and
the Advisers Act, and the rules under each, the Code, and all
other federal and state laws and regulations applicable to the
Trust and the Portfolio. UBS AM agrees to provide to the Sub-
Adviser copies of the Trust's Trust Instrument, By-Laws,
Registration Statement, Trust's Compliance Procedures, written
instructions and directions of the Board and UBS AM, and any
amendments or supplements to any of these materials as soon as
practicable after such materials become available.  The Sub-
Adviser shall not be liable in any way for failure to adhere to any
amendments or supplements to such materials unless the Sub-
adviser has been notified of such amendments or supplements by
the Trust in accordance with this section. UBS AM further agrees
to identify to the Sub-Adviser in writing any broker-dealers that
are affiliated with UBS AM (other than UBS Financial Services Inc.
and UBS Asset Management (US) Inc.).

In order to assist the Trust and the Trust's Chief Compliance
Officer (the Trust CCO) to satisfy the requirements contained in
Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Adviser shall provide to
the Trust CCO:  (i) direct access to the Sub-Adviser's chief
compliance officer and/or other senior compliance
personnel, as reasonably requested by the Trust CCO; (ii)
quarterly reports confirming that the Sub-Adviser has complied
with the Trust Compliance Procedures in managing the Portfolio
or Segment; and (iii) quarterly certifications that there were no
Material Compliance Matters (as that term is defined by Rule
38a-1(e)(2)) that arose under the Trust Compliance Procedures
that related to the Sub-Adviser's management of the Portfolio or
Segment.

The Sub-Adviser shall promptly provide the Trust CCO with copies
of: (i) the Sub-Adviser's policies and procedures for compliance by
the Sub-Adviser with the Federal Securities Laws (together, the
Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures), and (ii) any material
changes to the Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures.  The Sub-
Adviser shall cooperate fully with the Trust CCO so as to facilitate
the Trust CCO's performance of the Trust CCO's responsibilities
under Rule 38a-1 to review, evaluate and report to the Trust's
Board on the operation of the Sub-Adviser Compliance
Procedures, and shall promptly report to the Trust CCO any
Material Compliance Matter arising under the Sub-Adviser
Compliance Procedures involving the Portfolio or Segment.  The
Sub-Adviser shall provide to the Trust CCO:  (i) quarterly reports
confirming the Sub-Adviser's compliance with the Sub-Adviser
Compliance Procedures in managing the Portfolio or Segment,
and (ii) certifications that there were no Material Compliance
Matters involving the Sub-Adviser that arose under the Sub-
Adviser Compliance Procedures that affected the Portfolio or
Segment.  At least annually, the Sub-Adviser shall provide a
certification to the Trust CCO to the effect that the Sub-Adviser
has in place and has implemented policies and procedures that
are reasonably designed to ensure compliance by the Sub-Adviser
with any applicable Federal Securities Laws, subject to such
interpretations as may be contained in the Trust Compliance
Procedures.

The Sub-Adviser will promptly provide UBS AM with information
(including information that is required to be disclosed in the
Trust's registration statement) with respect to the portfolio
managers responsible for the Portfolio or Segment and any
changes in the portfolio managers responsible for the Portfolio or
Segment.

The Sub-Adviser will promptly notify UBS AM of any pending
investigation, material litigation, administrative proceeding or any
other significant non-routine regulatory inquiry.

The Sub-Adviser will cooperate promptly and fully with UBS AM
and/or the Trust in responding to any regulatory or compliance
examinations or inspections (including information requests)
relating to the Trust, the Portfolio or UBS AM brought by any
governmental or regulatory authorities having appropriate
jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC)).

4.	Expenses.  During the term of this Agreement, the Sub-
Adviser will bear all expenses incurred by it in connection with its
services under this Agreement.  Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, the Sub-Adviser shall not be responsible for any
expenses incurred by the Trust, the Portfolio or UBS AM,
including, without limitation, fees of the Trust's independent
public accountants, legal counsel, transfer agent, custodian and
other service providers who are not employees of the Sub-
Adviser, brokerage commissions and other transaction-related
expenses, tax reporting or taxes levied against the Trust
(including capital gains or income tax as well as any potential
withholding taxes on any holdings), any of its property, interest
charges on any Portfolio borrowings, expenditures in connection
with the meetings of the Trust's shareholders and the Board (but
not including any expenditures incurred as a result of an
assignment or change in control as noted below) and fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the issuance, registration
and transfer of the Portfolio's shares.

Upon request by UBS AM, Sub-Adviser agrees to reimburse UBS
AM or the Trust for costs associated with generating and
distributing any Registration Statement (as defined herein)  for
when the Sub-Adviser is given a copy of a draft of such
Registration Statement and fails to promptly disclose to UBS AM
facts then known to the Sub-Adviser or its personnel that would
require disclosure (or amendments to disclosure) in the Fund's
Registration Statement in time for such disclosure or
amendments to disclosure to be included in such Registration
Statement.  The Sub-Adviser shall bear all reasonable expenses of
the Trust, if any, arising out of an assignment or change in control
of the Sub-Adviser.

5.	Compensation.

(a)	For the services provided and the expenses assumed by the
Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, UBS AM, not the
Portfolio, will pay to the Sub-Adviser a fee, computed daily and
payable monthly, at an annual rate of ____% of the average daily
net assets of the Portfolio or Segment allocated to its
management (computed in the manner specified in the
Management Agreement), and will provide the Sub-Adviser with
a schedule showing the manner in which the fee was computed.
If the Sub-Adviser is managing a Segment, its fees will be based
on the value of the assets of the Portfolio within the Sub-
Adviser's Segment.

(b)	The fee shall be accrued daily and payable monthly to the
Sub-Adviser on or before the last business day of the next
succeeding calendar month.

(c)	For those periods in which UBS AM has agreed to waive all
or a portion of its management fee, UBS AM may ask the Sub-
Adviser to waive the same proportion of its fees, but the Sub-
Adviser is under no obligation to do so.

(d)	If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates before
the end of any month, the fee for the period from the effective
date to the end of the month or from the beginning of such
month to the date of termination, as the case may be, shall be
pro-rated according to the proportion which such period bears to
the full month in that such effectiveness or termination occurs.

6. Limitation of Liability.

(a) 	The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any error of
judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the
Portfolio, the Trust or its shareholders or by UBS AM in
connection with the matters to which this Agreement relates,
except a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or
negligence on its part in the performance of its duties or from
reckless disregard by it of its obligations and duties under this
Agreement.

(b)	In no event will the Sub-Adviser have any responsibility for
any other portfolio of the Trust, for any portion of the Portfolio
not managed by the Sub-Adviser or for the acts or omissions of
any Other Sub-Adviser or service provider to the Trust or
Portfolio, including, but not limited to, the custodian. In
particular, in the event the Sub-Adviser shall manage only a
Segment of the Portfolio, the Sub-Adviser shall have no
responsibility for the Portfolio's being in violation of any
applicable law or regulation or investment policy or restriction
applicable to the Portfolio as a whole or for the Portfolio's failing
to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Code, if
the securities and other holdings of the Segment of the Portfolio
managed by the Sub-Adviser are such that such Segment would
not be in such violation or fail to so qualify if such Segment were
deemed a separate series of the Trust or a separate regulated
investment company under the Code, unless such violation was
due to the Sub-Advisers failure to comply with written guidelines
adopted by the Board or UBS AM and provided to the Sub-
Adviser.

Nothing in this section shall be deemed a limitation or waiver of
any obligation or duty that may not by law be limited or waived.

<TEXT>
SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT

Agreement made as of May 31, 2016 between UBS Asset
Management Americas) Inc. (UBS AM), a Delaware corporation,
and Rogge Global Partners LTD (Sub-Adviser), an English company
(the Agreement).

RECITALS

(1)	UBS AM has entered into a Management Agreement dated
as of August 1, 2008 (Management Agreement) with PACE Select
Advisors Trust (Trust), an open-end management investment
company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (1940 Act), with respect to PACE International Fixed
Income Investments (Portfolio);

(2)	UBS AM desires to retain the Sub-Adviser to furnish certain
investment advisory services to UBS AM and the Portfolio, and in
doing so UBS AM agrees to be treated as an Intermediate
Customer in accordance with the FSA Rules; and

(3)	The Sub-Adviser is willing to furnish such services; Now,
therefore, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants
herein contained, UBS AM and the Sub-Adviser agree as follows:

1. Appointment.  UBS AM hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser as an
investment sub-adviser with respect to the Portfolio for the period
and on the terms set forth in this Agreement.  The Sub-Adviser
accepts that appointment and agrees to render the services herein
set forth, for the compensation herein provided.

2. Duties as Sub-Adviser.

(a) Subject to the supervision and direction of the Trusts Board of
Trustees (the Board) and review by UBS AM, and any written
guidelines adopted by the Board or UBS AM, the Sub-Adviser will
provide a continuous investment program for all or a designated
portion of the assets (Segment) of the Portfolio, including
investment research and discretionary management with respect
to all securities and investments and cash equivalents in the
Portfolio or Segment.  The Sub-Adviser will determine from time to
time what investments will be purchased, retained or sold by the
Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-Adviser will be responsible for
placing purchase and sell orders for investments and for other
related transactions for the Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-Adviser
will be responsible for voting proxies of issuers of securities held by
the Portfolio or Segment.  The Sub-Adviser understands that the
Portfolios assets need to be managed so as to permit the Portfolio
to qualify or to continue to qualify as a regulated investment
company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as
amended (Code). The Sub-Adviser will provide services under this
Agreement in accordance with the Portfolios investment objective,
policies and restrictions as stated in the Trusts currently effective
registration statement under the 1940 Act, and any amendments
or supplements thereto (Registration Statement).

(b) The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not consult with any other
sub-adviser (Other Sub-Adviser) for the Trust or Portfolio
concerning any transaction by the Portfolio or Segment in
securities or other assets, including (i) the purchase by the Portfolio
or Segment of a security issued by the Other
Sub-Adviser, or an affiliate of the Other Sub-Adviser, to the Trust or
Portfolio except as permitted by the 1940 Act or (ii) transactions by
the Portfolio or Segment in any security for which the Other Sub-
Adviser, or its affiliate, is the principal underwriter.

(c) The Sub-Adviser agrees that, in placing orders with brokers, it
will obtain the best net result in terms of price and execution;
provided that, on behalf of the Portfolio, the Sub-Adviser may, in
its discretion, use brokers that provide the Sub-Adviser with
research, analysis, advice and similar services to execute portfolio
transactions on behalf of the Portfolio, and the Sub-Adviser may
pay to those brokers in return for brokerage and research services
a higher commission than may be charged by other brokers,
subject to the Sub-Advisers determination in good faith that such
commission is reasonable in terms either of the particular
transaction or of the overall responsibility of the Sub-Adviser to the
Portfolio and its other clients and that the total commissions paid
by the Portfolio or Segment will be reasonable in relation to the
benefits to the Portfolio over the long term.  In no instance will
portfolio securities be purchased from or sold to UBS AM or the
Sub-Adviser, or any affiliated person thereof, except in accordance
with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder. The Sub-Adviser may aggregate sales and purchase
orders with respect to the assets of the Portfolio or Segment with
similar orders being made simultaneously for other accounts
advised by the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates.  Whenever the Sub-
Adviser simultaneously places orders to purchase or sell the same
security on behalf of the Portfolio and one or more other
accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser, the orders will be allocated as
to price and amount among all such accounts in a manner believed
to be equitable over time to each account.  UBS AM recognizes that
in some cases this procedure may adversely affect the results
obtained for the Portfolio or Segment.

(d) The Sub-Adviser will maintain all books and records required to
be maintained pursuant to the 1940 Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to transactions
by the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment, and will
furnish the Board and UBS AM with such periodic and special
reports as the Board or UBS AM reasonably may request.  In
compliance with the requirements of Rule 31 a-3 under the 1940
Act, the Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that all records which it
maintains for the Portfolio are the property of the Trust, agrees to
preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31 a-2 under the 1940
Act any records that it maintains for the Portfolio and that are
required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and
further agrees to surrender promptly to the Trust any records
which it maintains for the Portfolio upon request by the Trust.

(e) At such times as shall be reasonably requested by the Board or
UBS AM, the Sub-Adviser will provide the Board and UBS AM with
economic and investment analyses and reports as well as quarterly
reports setting forth the performance of the Portfolio or Segment
and make available to the Board and UBS AM any economic,
statistical and investment services that the
Sub-Adviser normally makes available to its institutional or other
customers.

(f) In accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, as
amended from time to time, the Sub-Adviser is responsible for
assisting in the fair valuation of all portfolio securities in the
Portfolio or Segment and will use its reasonable efforts to arrange
for the provision of a price or prices from one
or more parties independent of the Sub-Adviser for each portfolio
security for which the custodian does not obtain prices in the
ordinary course of business from an automated pricing service.

3. Further Duties.  In all matters relating to the performance of this
Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will seek to act in conformity with the
Trusts Trust Instrument, By-Laws and Registration Statement and
with the written instructions and written directions of the Board
and UBS AM; and will comply with the requirements of the 1940
Act, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended
(Advisers Act), and the rules under each, the Code, and all other
federal and state laws and regulations applicable to the Trust and
the Portfolio.  UBS AM agrees to provide to the Sub-Adviser copies
of the Trusts Trust Instrument, By-Laws, Registration Statement,
written instructions and directions of the Board and UBS AM, and
any amendments or supplements to any of these materials as soon
as practicable after such materials become available; and further
agrees to identify to the Sub-Adviser in writing any broker-dealers
that are affiliated with UBS AM (other than UBS Financial Services
Inc. and UBS Asset Management (US) Inc.).

4. Expenses.  During the terms of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser
will bear all expenses incurred by it in connection with its services
under this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser shall not be responsible for
any expenses incurred by the Trust, the Portfolio or UBS AM.

5. Compensation.

(a) For the services provided and the expenses assumed by the
Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, UBS AM, not the
Portfolio, will pay to the Sub-Adviser a fee, computed daily and
payable monthly, at an annual rate of ___% of the average daily
net assets of the Portfolio or Segment allocated to its management
(computed in the manner specified in the Management
Agreement), and will provide the Sub-Adviser with a schedule
showing the manner in which the fee was computed.  If the Sub-
Adviser is managing a Segment, its fees will be based on the value
of the assets of the Portfolio within the Sub-Advisers Segment.

(b) The fee shall be accrued daily and payable monthly to the Sub-
Adviser on or before the last business day of the next succeeding
calendar month.

(c) If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates before the
end of any month, the fee for the period from the effective date to
the end of the month or from the beginning of such month to the
date of termination, as the case maybe, shall be pro-rated
according to the proportion which such period bears to the full
month in that such effectiveness or termination occurs.

6. Limitation Of Liability.

(a) The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any error of judgment or
mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Portfolio, the Trust or
its shareholders or by UBS AM in connection with the matters to
which this Agreement relates, except a loss resulting from willful
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the
performance of its duties or from reckless disregard by it of its
obligations and duties under this Agreement.

(b) In no event will the Sub-Adviser have any responsibility for any
other series of the Trust, for any portion of the Portfolio not
managed by the Sub-Adviser or for the acts or omissions of any
other sub-adviser to the Trust or Portfolio.

In particular, in the event the Sub-Adviser shall manage only a
portion of the Portfolios investments, the Sub-Adviser shall have no
responsibility for the Portfolios being in violation of any applicable
law or regulation or investment policy or restriction applicable to
the Portfolio as a whole or for the Portfolios failing to qualify as a
regulated investment company under the Code, if the securities
and other holdings of the Segment of the Portfolio managed by the
Sub-Adviser are such that such Segment would not be in such
violation or fail to so qualify if such Segment were deemed a
separate series of the Trust or a separate regulated investment
company under the Code.  Nothing in this section shall be deemed
a limitation or waiver of any obligation or duty that may not by law
be limited or waived.
