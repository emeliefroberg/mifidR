"562","Funds Corporate Bond Fund</FONT></P>"
"563","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 2.15pt 12pt 0>In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"564","statements of American Funds Corporate Bond Fund (hereafter referred to as the &#8220;Fund&#8221;) as of and for the period ended"
"565","May 31, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"566","the Fund&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"567","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"568","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund&#8217;s internal control over"
"569","financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund&#8217;s internal control over financial"
"570","reporting.</P>"
"571","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 2.15pt 12pt 0>The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"572","and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments"
"573","by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund&#8217;s internal control over"
"574","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"575","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A fund&#8217;s"
"576","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"577","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"578","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"579","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"580","authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"581","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
"582","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 2.15pt 12pt 0>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"583","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"584","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"585","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"
"586","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 2.15pt 12pt 0>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"587","exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"588","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"589","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"590","of the Fund&#8217;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</P>"
"591","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 2.15pt 12pt 0>Our consideration of the Fund&#8217;s internal control"
"592","over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"593","in internal control over financial reporting that might be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses under standards</P>"
"594","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 2.15pt 12pt 0>established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"595","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting and its"
"596","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of April"
"597","30, 2013.</P>"
