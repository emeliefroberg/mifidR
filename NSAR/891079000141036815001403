"2530","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"2531","Firm"
"2532","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"2533","Highland Funds II"
"2534","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"2535","statements of Highland Global Allocation Fund,"
"2536","Highland Dividend Equity Fund, Highland Premier"
"2537","Growth Equity Fund, Highland Small-Cap Equity Fund,"
"2538","Highland Total Return Fund, Highland Tax-Exempt"
"2539","Fund, Highland Fixed Income Fund, and Highland"
"2540","Energy MLP Fund (collectively, the Funds), each a"
"2541","series of Highland Funds II, as of and for the year ended"
"2542","September 30, 2015, in accordance with the standards of"
"2543","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"2544","(United States), we considered the Funds internal control"
"2545","over financial reporting, including controls over"
"2546","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"2547","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"2548","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"
"2549","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"2550","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"2551","the Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"2552","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2553","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"2554","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"2555","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"2556","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"2557","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A funds"
"2558","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"2559","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"2560","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"2561","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"2562","with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"2563","A funds internal control over financial reporting includes"
"2564","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2565","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"2566","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2567","dispositions of the assets of the funds; (2) provide"
"2568","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2569","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2570","accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"2571","expenditures of the funds are being made only in"
"2572","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"2573","trustees of the funds; and (3) provide reasonable"
"2574","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"2575","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a funds"
"2576","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2577","statements."
"2578","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2579","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2580","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2581","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"2582","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2583","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"2584","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2585","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"2586","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"2587","allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"2588","of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"2589","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"2590","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"2591","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"2592","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"2593","misstatement of the Funds annual or interim financial"
"2594","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"2595","basis."
"2596","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"2597","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"2598","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"2599","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"2600","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"2601","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"2602","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal"
"2603","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"2604","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"2605","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as"
"2606","of September 30, 2015."
"2607","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"2608","of management and the Board of Trustees of Highland"
"2609","Funds II and the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"2610","and is not intended to be and should not be used by"

"2681","      NOW,  THEREFORE,  WITNESSETH:  That  it"
"2682","is  hereby  agreed  between  the  parties hereto as follows:"
"2683","SECTION 1. Appointment of Sub-Adviser."
"2684","      The Adviser hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser to"
"2685","act as investment sub-adviser to the Fund for the period"
"2686","and on the terms herein set forth, and the Fund hereby"

"2688","such appointment and agrees to render the services herein"
"2689","set forth, for the compensation herein provided."
"2690","SECTION 2. Duties of Sub-Adviser."
"2691","      The Sub-Adviser, at its own expense, shall furnish"
"2692","the following services and facilities to the Fund:"
"2693","(a)	Investment  Program.  The  Sub-Adviser  shall  (i)"
"2694","furnish  continuously  an  investment program for"
"2695","the Fund, (ii) determine (subject to the overall"
"2696","supervision and review of the Adviser and the"
"2697","Trusts Board of Trustees) the investments to be"
"2698","purchased, held, sold or exchanged by the Fund"
"2699","and the portion, if any, of the assets of the Fund to"

"2706","provisions of the organizational documents of"
"2707","the Trust, the Registration"
"2708","Statement of the Trust with respect to the Fund and"
"2709","its shares of beneficial interest (Shares), including"
"2710","the Funds prospectus(es) and statement of"
"2711","additional information, and the Investment"
"2712","Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act),"
"2713","in each case as from time to time amended and in"
"2714","effect."
"2715","(b)	Portfolio Transactions. The Sub-Adviser shall"
"2716","place all orders for the purchase and sale of"
"2717","portfolio securities for the account of the Fund"
"2718","with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-"
"2719","Adviser, although the Fund will pay the actual"
"2720","brokerage commissions on portfolio transactions in"
"2721","accordance with Section 3(d) of the Advisory"
"2722","Agreement."
"2723","      In placing portfolio transactions for the Fund, it is"
"2724","recognized that the Sub-Adviser will give primary"
"2725","consideration to securing the most favorable price and"
"2726","efficient execution. Consistent with this policy, the Sub-"
"2727","Adviser may consider the financial responsibility, research"
"2728","and investment information and other services provided"
"2729","by brokers or dealers who may effect or be a party to any"
"2730","such transaction or other transactions to which other"
"2731","clients of the Sub-Adviser may be a party. It is understood"
"2732","that neither the Fund nor the Sub-Adviser has adopted a"
"2733","formula for allocation of the Funds investment transaction"
"2734","business. It is also understood that it is desirable for the"
"2735","Fund that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental"
"2736","investment and market research and security and"
"2737","economic analysis provided by brokers who may execute"
"2738","brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than"
"2739","would otherwise result when allocating brokerage"
"2740","transactions to other brokers on the basis of seeking the"
"2741","most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore,"
"2742","subject to Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of"
"2743","1934, the Sub- Adviser is authorized to place orders for"
"2744","the purchase and sale of securities for the Fund with"
"2745","such brokers, subject to review by the Trusts Board of"
"2746","Trustees from time to time with respect to the extent and"
"2747","continuation of this practice. It is understood that the"
"2748","services provided by such brokers may be useful or"
"2749","beneficial to the Sub-Adviser in connection with its"
"2750","services to other clients."
"2751","      On occasions when the Sub-Adviser deems the"
"2752","purchase or sale of a security to be in the best interest of"
"2753","the Fund as well as other clients, the Sub-Adviser, to the"
"2754","extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, may,"
"2755","but shall be under no obligation to, aggregate the"
"2756","securities to be so sold or purchased in order to obtain the"
"2757","most favorable price or lower brokerage commissions and"
"2758","efficient execution. In such event, allocation of the"
"2759","securities so purchased or sold, as well as the expenses"
"2760","incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Sub-"
"2761","Adviser in the manner it considers to be the most equitable"
"2762","and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund"
"2763","and to such other clients."
"2764","SECTION 3. Allocation of Expenses."
"2765","      The Sub-Adviser does not assume nor shall it pay"
"2766","any expenses for Fund operations and activities. For the"
"2767","avoidance of doubt, unless the prospectus(es) or statement"
"2768","of additional information of the Fund provides otherwise,"
"2769","the expenses to be borne by the Fund shall include,"
"2770","without limitation, those items listed in Section 3 of the"
"2771","Advisory Agreement."
"2772","SECTION 4. Sub-Advisory Fee."
"2773","(a)	In return for its advisory services, the Adviser"
"2774","will pay the Sub-Adviser a monthly fee,"
"2775","computed  and  accrued  daily,  based  on  an"
