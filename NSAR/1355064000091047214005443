"473","REPORT OF"
"474","INDEPENDENT"
"475","REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"476","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"477","To the Board of Trustees"
"478","of Mutual Fund Series"
"479","Trust"
"480","and the Shareholders of"
"481","SignalPoint Global Alpha"
"482","Fund"
"483","In planning and"
"484","performing our audit of"
"485","the financial statements"
"486","of SignalPoint Global"
"487","Alpha Fund (the Fund),"
"488","a series of shares of"
"489","beneficial interest of the"
"490","Mutual Fund Series Trust,"
"491","as of September 30, 2014"
"492","and for the year then"
"493","ended, in accordance with"
"494","the standards of the"
"495","Public Company"
"496","Accounting Oversight"
"497","Board (United States)"
"498","(PCAOB), we considered"
"499","internal control over"
"500","financial reporting,"
"501","including control activities"
"502","over safeguarding"
"503","securities, as a basis for"
"504","designing our auditing"
"505","procedures for the"
"506","purpose of expressing our"
"507","opinion on the financial"
"508","statements and to comply"
"509","with the requirements of"
"510","Form N-SAR, but not for"
"511","the purpose of expressing"
"512","an opinion on the"
"513","effectiveness of the"
"514","Fund's internal control"
"515","over financial reporting."
"516","Accordingly, we express"
"517","no such opinion."
"518","The management of the"
"519","Fund is responsible for"
"520","establishing and"
"521","maintaining effective"
"522","internal control over"
"523","financial reporting.  In"
"524","fulfilling this"
"525","responsibility, estimates"
"526","and judgments by"
"527","management are required"
"528","to assess the expected"
"529","benefits and related costs"
"530","of controls.  A company's"
"531","internal control over"
"532","financial reporting is a"
"533","process designed to"
"534","provide reasonable"
"535","assurance regarding the"
"536","reliability of financial"
"537","reporting and the"
"538","preparation of financial"
"539","statements for external"
"540","purposes in accordance"
"541","with accounting principles"
"542","generally accepted in the"
"543","United States of America"
"544","(GAAP).  A company's"
"545","internal control over"
"546","financial reporting"
"547","includes those policies"
"548","and procedures that (1)"
"549","pertain to the"
"550","maintenance of records"
"551","that, in reasonable detail,"
"552","accurately and fairly"
"553","reflect the transactions"
"554","and dispositions of the"
"555","assets of the company; (2)"
"556","provide reasonable"
"557","assurance that"
"558","transactions are recorded"
"559","as necessary to permit"
"560","preparation of the"
"561","financial statements in"
"562","accordance with GAAP,"
"563","and that receipts and"
"564","expenditures of the"
"565","company are being made"
"566","only in accordance with"
"567","authorizations of"
"568","management and trustees"
"569","of the company; and (3)"
"570","provide reasonable"
"571","assurance regarding"
"572","prevention or timely"
"573","detection of unauthorized"
"574","acquisition, use or"
"575","disposition of a company's"
"576","assets that could have a"
"577","material effect on the"
"578","financial statements."
"579","Because of inherent"
"580","limitations, internal"
"581","control over financial"
"582","reporting may not prevent"
"583","or detect misstatements."
"584","Also, projections of any"
"585","evaluation of"
"586","effectiveness to future"
"587","periods are subject to the"
"588","risk that controls may"
"589","become inadequate"
"590","because of changes in"
"591","conditions or that the"
"592","degree of compliance"
"593","with the policies or"
"594","procedures may"
"595","deteriorate."
"596","A deficiency in internal"
"597","control over financial"
"598","reporting exists when the"
"599","design or operation of a"
"600","control does not allow"
"601","management or"
"602","employees, in the normal"
"603","course of performing their"
"604","assigned functions, to"
"605","prevent or detect"
"606","misstatements on a timely"
"607","basis.  A material"
"608","weakness is a deficiency,"
"609","or combination of"
"610","deficiencies, in internal"
"611","control over financial"
"612","reporting, such that there"
"613","is a reasonable possibility"
"614","that a material"
"615","misstatement of the"
"616","Fund's annual or interim"
"617","financial statements will"
"618","not be prevented or"
"619","detected on a timely"
"620","basis."
"621","Our consideration of the"
"622","Fund's internal control"
"623","over financial reporting"
"624","was for the limited"
"625","purpose described in the"
"626","first paragraph and would"
"627","not necessarily disclose all"
"628","deficiencies in internal"
"629","control that might be"
"630","material weaknesses"
"631","under standards"
"632","established by the PCAOB."
"633","However, we noted no"
"634","deficiencies in the Fund's"
"635","internal control over"
"636","financial reporting and its"
"637","operation, including"
"638","controls over"
"639","safeguarding securities"
"640","that we consider to be a"
"641","material weakness, as"
"642","defined above, as of"
"643","September 30, 2014."
"644","This report is intended"
"645","solely for the information"
"646","and use of management,"
"647","the shareholders of"
"648","SignalPoint Global Alpha"
"649","Fund, the Board of"
"650","Trustees of Mutual Fund"
"651","Series Trust and the"
"652","Securities and Exchange"
"653","Commission and is not"
"654","intended to be and should"
"655","not be used by anyone"
