"395","            Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"396","To  the Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"397","of the WP Large Cap Income Plus Fund,"
"398","a Series of Winning Points Funds"
"399","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of WP Large Cap"
"400","Income  Plus  Fund  (the Fund) as of and for the year ended August 31, 2015 in"
"401","accordance  with  the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"402","(United  States),  we  considered its internal control over financial reporting,"
"403","including  control  activities  for  safeguarding  securities,  as  a  basis for"
"404","designing  our  auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"405","the  financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"406","not  for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"407","internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Accordingly,  we express no such"
"408","opinion."
"409","The  management  of  the  Fund  is  responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"410","effective   internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  In  fulfilling  this"
"411","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"412","expected  benefits  and  related costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"413","over  financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"414","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"415","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"416","accounting  principles  (GAAP).  A  company's  internal  control  over financial"
"417","reporting  includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that  (1)  pertain to the"
"418","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"419","the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"420","reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as necessary to permit"
"421","preparation  of  financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"422","and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance with"
"423","authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the company; and (3) provide"
"424","reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"425","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material"
"426","effect on the financial statements."
"427","Because  of  its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"428","may  not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"429","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"430","inadequate  because  of  changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"431","with the policies or procedures many deteriorate."
"432","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"433","or  operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"434","course   of   performing   their   assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"435","misstatements  on  a  timely  basis.  A  material  weakness  is a deficiency, or"
"436","combination  of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"437","that  there  is  a  reasonable  possibility  that a material misstatement of the"
"438","Fund's  annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"439","on a timely basis."
"440","<PAGE>"
"441","Our  consideration  of  the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"442","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in  the  first  paragraph  and  would not"
"443","necessarily  disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might that might"
"444","be  material  weaknesses  under  standards  established  by  the  Public Company"
"445","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"446","the  Fund's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  its  operation,"
"447","including  controls  over  safeguarding  securities  that  we  consider  to be a"
"448","material weakness as defined above as of August 31, 2015."
"449","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"450","Board  of  Trustees of Congressional Effect Fund and the Securities and Exchange"
"451","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"452","these specified parties."
