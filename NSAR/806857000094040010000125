"522","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"523","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of The GAMCO Growth Fund:"
"524","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"525","statements of The GAMCO Growth Fund (the Fund) as of and for"
"526","the year ended December 31, 2009, in accordance with the"
"527","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"528","(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"529","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"530","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"531","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"532","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"533","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"534","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"535","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"536","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"537","reporting."
"538","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"539","maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"540","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"541","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"542","benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal"
"543","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"544","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"545","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"546","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"547","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"548","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"549","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"550","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"551","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"552","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"553","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"554","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"555","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"556","authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3)"
"557","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"558","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"559","fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"560","financial statements."
"561","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"562","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"563","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"564","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"565","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"566","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"567","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"568","exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"569","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"570","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"571","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"572","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"573","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"574","material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial"
"575","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"576","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"577","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"578","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"579","in internal control over financial reporting that might be"
"580","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"581","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"582","we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over"
"583","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"584","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material"
"585","weaknesses as defined above as of December 31, 2009."
"586","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"587","management and the Board of Trustees of The GAMCO Growth Fund"
"588","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"589","to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"590","specified parties."

"776","of Trustees; Removal.  The Board of Trustees, by the"
"777","vote of a majority of the entire Board, may increase"
"778","the number of Trustees to a number not exceeding"
"779","fifteen, and may elect Trustees to fill the vacancies"
"780","occurring for any reason, including vacancies created"

"785","decrease the number of Trustees to a number not less"
"786","than two but the tenure of office of any Trustee shall"

"791","proxy material dies or becomes incapacitated, the"
"792","authorized number of Trustees shall be automatically"
"793","reduced by the number of such nominees, unless the"
"794","Board of Trustees prior to the meeting shall otherwise"
"795","determine. A Trustee at any time may be removed either"
"796","with or without cause by resolution duly adopted by the"
"797","affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the"
"798","outstanding Shares of the Trust, present in person or"
"799","by proxy at any meeting of Shareholders at which such"
"800","vote may be taken, provided that a quorum is present."
"801","Any Trustee at any time may be removed for cause by"
"802","resolution duly adopted at any meeting of the Board of"
"803","Trustees provided that notice thereof is contained in"
"804","the notice of such meeting and that such resolution is"
"805","adopted by the vote of at least two thirds of the"
"806","Trustees whose removal is not proposed.  As used"
"807","herein, for cause shall mean any cause which under"
"808","Massachusetts law would permit the removal of a Trustee"
"809","of a business trust."
"810","	Section 3.	Place of Meeting.  The"

"829","by oral, electronic mail, telegraphic or written notice"
"830","duly served on or sent or mailed to each Trustee not"
"831","less than one day before such meeting.  No notice need"
"832","be given to any Trustee who attends in person or to any"
"833","Trustee who in writing executed and filed with the"
"834","records of the meeting either before or after the"
"835","holding thereof, waives such notice.  Such notice or"
"836","waiver of notice need not state the purpose or purposes"
"837","of such meeting."
"838","	Section 6.	Quorum.  One-third of the"
"839","Trustees then in office shall constitute a quorum for"
"840","the transaction of business, provided that a quorum"
"841","shall in no case be less than two Trustees.  If at any"
"842","meeting of the Board there shall be less than a quorum"
"843","present (in person or by open telephone line, to the"
"844","extent permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940"
"845","(the 1940 Act)), a majority of those present may"
"846","adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum"
"847","shall have been obtained.  The act of the majority of"

"856","discretion, which shall in each case consist of such"
"857","number of members (not less than two) and shall have"
"858","and may exercise such powers as the Board may determine"
"859","in the resolution appointing them.  A majority of all"
"860","members of any such committee may determine its action,"
"861","and fix the time and place of its meetings, unless the"
"862","Board of Trustees shall otherwise provide. The Board of"
"863","Trustees shall have power at any time to change the"
"864","members and powers of any such committee, to fill"
"865","vacancies, and to discharge any such committee."
"866","	Section 8.	 Informal Action by and"
"867","Telephone Meetings of Trustees and Committees.  Any"
"868","action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting"
"869","of the Board of Trustees or any committee thereof may"
"870","be taken without a meeting, if a written consent to"
"871","such action is signed by all members of the Board, or"
"872","of such committee, as the case may be.  Trustees or"
"873","members of a committee of the Board of Trustees may"
"874","participate in a meeting by means of a conference"
"875","telephone or similar communications equipment; such"
"876","participation shall, except as otherwise required by"
"877","the 1940 Act, have the same effect as present in person."
"878","	Section 9.	Compensation of Trustees."

"888","of computation thereof, the method of determining the"
"889","Shareholders of the Series to which they are payable"
