"3578","controls  over  safeguarding  securities,  as a basis for designing our auditing"
"3579","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"

"3588","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"3589","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"3590","accounting  principles.  A  company's  internal control over financial reporting"

"3592","records   that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect   the"
"3593","transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2) provide"
"3594","reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as necessary to permit"

"3599","detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"3600","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3601","Because of its  inherent  limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"3602","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"

"3604","inadequate because of changes in conditions,  or  that  the degree of compliance"
"3605","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3606","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"3607","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,  in the normal"
"3608","course   of   performing   their   assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"3609","misstatements on a timely basis. A material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or  a"

"3834","        SECTION 1. MEETINGS. Meetings of the  Shareholders  may be called at any"
"3835","time by a majority of the Trustees. Meetings of the Shareholders for the purpose"
"3836","of considering the removal of a person serving as Trustee shall be called by the"
"3837","Trustees  if they are requested in writing to do so by Shareholders  holding  in"
"3838","the aggregate  Shares representing not less than ten percent (10%) of the voting"
"3839","power of the outstanding  Shares  of  the  Trust  having voting rights. Any such"
"3840","meeting  shall be held within or without The Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts  on"
"3841","such day and at such time as the Trustees shall designate."
"3842","        SECTION  2.  NOTICE OF MEETINGS. Notice of all meetings of Shareholders,"
"3843","stating the time, place  and  purposes  of  the  meeting,  shall be given by the"
"3844","Trustees in accordance with the Declaration, mailed or sent  at  least  (ten) 10"
"3845","days  and  not  more than ninety (90) days before the meeting. Only the business"
"3846","stated in the notice  of  the  meeting  shall be considered at such meeting. Any"
"3847","adjourned meeting may be held as adjourned  without  further notice, even if the"
"3848","date  of such adjourned meeting is more than 90 days after  the  notice  of  the"
"3849","meeting  was  mailed  or  sent.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if either the"
"3850","President  or  Clerk  of the Trust, or in the absence or unavailability  of  the"
"3851","President and the Clerk,  any  officer of the Trust, determines that as a result"
"3852","of force majeure or an act of God or war, the date, time or place designated for"
"3853","a meeting or adjourned meeting of  Shareholders is not reasonably practicable or"
"3854","available, such officer may, without  further  notice to Shareholders, designate"
"3855","such other date, time or place for such meeting  or  adjourned  meeting  as such"
"3856","officer shall, in his or her sole discretion, determine. No notice need be given"
"3857","to  any  Shareholder  who  shall  have failed to inform the Trust of his current"
"3858","address or if a written waiver of notice,  executed  before or after the meeting"
"3859","by  the  Shareholder or his attorney thereunto authorized,  is  filed  with  the"
"3860","records of the meeting."
"3861","      SECTION  3.  RECORD  DATE FOR MEETINGS. For the purpose of determining the"
"3862","Shareholders who are entitled  to  notice  of  and to vote at any meeting, or to"
"3863","participate in any distribution, or for the purpose  of  any  other  action, the"
"3864","Trustees  may  from  time to time close the transfer books for such period,  not"
"3865","exceeding thirty (30)  days,  as  the Trustees may determine; or without closing"
"3866","the transfer books the Trustees may  fix  a  date not more than ninety (90) days"
"3867","prior to the date of any meeting of Shareholders or distribution or other action"
"3868","as  a  record  date  for  the determination of the  persons  to  be  treated  as"
"3869","Shareholders of record for  such  purpose. The Trustees also may select the time"
"3870","of  day  as  of which the calculations  for  determining  how  many  votes  each"
"3871","Shareholder is entitled to pursuant to the Declaration shall be performed."
"3872","      SECTION  4.  PROXIES. At any meeting of Shareholders, any holder of Shares"
"3873","entitled to vote thereat  may  vote  by  proxy,  provided that no proxy shall be"
"3874","voted at any meeting unless it shall have been placed on file with the Clerk, or"
"3875","with  such  other officer or agent of the Trust as the  Clerk  may  direct,  for"
"3876","verification  prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken. Pursuant to a"
"3877","vote of a majority  of the Trustees, proxies may be solicited in the name of one"
"3878","or more Trustees or one  or more of the officers of the Trust. When any Share is"
"3879","held jointly by several persons,  any  one  of  them  may vote at any meeting in"
"3880","person  or  by proxy in respect of such Share (and a proxy  shall  be  valid  if"
"3881","executed by any  one  of them), but if more than one of them shall be present at"
"3882","such meeting in person  or  by  proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so"
"3883","present disagree as to any vote to  be  cast, such vote shall not be received in"
"3884","respect of such Share. A proxy purporting  to  be  executed by or on behalf of a"
"3885","Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise,"
"3886","and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the  challenger.  The placing"
"3887","of  a  Shareholder's  name  on  a proxy pursuant to telephonic or electronically"
"3888","transmitted instructions obtained  pursuant to procedures reasonably designed to"
"3889","verify that such instructions have been  authorized  by  such  Shareholder shall"
"3890","constitute execution of such proxy by or on behalf of such Shareholder.  If  the"
"3891","holder  of any such Share is a minor or a person of unsound mind, and subject to"
"3892","guardianship  or  to the legal control of any other person as regards the charge"
"3893","or management of such  Share,  he  may vote by his guardian or such other person"
"3894","appointed or having such control, and  such  vote  may  be given in person or by"
"3895","proxy. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of a"
"3896","proxy may be substituted for or used in lieu of the original  proxy  for any and"
"3897","all  purposes  for  which  the original proxy could be used, provided that  such"
"3898","copy, facsimile telecommunication  or  other  reproduction  shall  be a complete"
"3899","reproduction of the entire original proxy or the portion thereof to  be returned"
"3900","by the Shareholder."
"3901","      SECTION  5.  QUORUM  AND  ADJOURNMENT.   Except  when  a larger quorum  is"
"3902","required by any provision of law, Shares representing a majority  of  the voting"
"3903","power  of  the outstanding Shares entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum  at"
"3904","any meeting  of  Shareholders,  except  that  where  any  provision  of law, the"
"3905","Declaration or these By-laws requires that holders of any series or class  shall"
"3906","vote  as a series or class, then Shares representing a majority (unless a larger"
"3907","quorum  is  required  as  specified  above) of the voting power of the aggregate"
"3908","number of Shares of that series or class  entitled to vote shall be necessary to"
"3909","constitute a quorum for the transaction of  business by that series or class. In"
"3910","the absence of a quorum, Shareholders entitled  to  cast  votes  representing  a"
"3911","majority  of the voting power of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote present"
"3912","in person or  by proxy, or, where any provision of law, the Declaration or these"
"3913","By-laws requires  that  holders of any series or class shall vote as a series or"
"3914","class, Shareholders entitled to cast votes representing a majority of the voting"
"3915","power of the outstanding Shares of that series or class entitled to vote present"
"3916","in person or by proxy, may  adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum"
"3917","shall be present. Only Shareholders  of  record shall be entitled to vote on any"
"3918","matter."
"3919","      SECTION 6. INSPECTION OF RECORDS. The  records  of the Trust shall be open"
"3920","to inspection by Shareholders to the same extent as is permitted shareholders of"
"3921","a Massachusetts business corporation."
"3922","      SECTION  7.  ACTION  WITHOUT MEETING. Any action which  may  be  taken  by"
"3923","Shareholders may be taken without  a  meeting  if  Shareholders  holding  Shares"
"3924","representing  a  majority of the voting power of the Shares entitled to vote  on"
"3925","the matter (or such  larger  proportion thereof as shall be required by law, the"
"3926","Declaration or these By-Laws for  approval of such matter) consent to the action"
"3927","in writing and the written consents  are  filed with the records of the meetings"
"3928","of Shareholders. Such consent shall be treated  for all purposes as a vote taken"
"3929","at a meeting of Shareholders."

"3937","place of each meeting other than  regular  or  stated meetings shall be given by"
"3938","the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the  Clerk  or an Assistant Clerk or"
"3939","by the officer, Chair of the Trustees or other Trustee calling  the  meeting and"
"3940","shall be mailed to each Trustee at least two days before the meeting,  or  shall"
"3941","be  telegraphed,  cabled, or wirelessed or sent by facsimile or other electronic"
"3942","means to each Trustee  at his usual or last known business or residence address,"
"3943","or personally delivered  to him at least one day before the meeting. Such notice"
"3944","may, however, be waived by any Trustee. Notice of a meeting need not be given to"
"3945","any Trustee if a written waiver  of  notice, executed by him before or after the"
"3946","meeting, is filed with the records of the meeting, or to any Trustee who attends"
"3947","the meeting without protesting prior thereto  or at its commencement the lack of"
"3948","notice to him. A notice or waiver of notice need  not specify the purpose of any"
"3949","meeting. Except as provided by law the Trustees may meet by means of a telephone"
"3950","conference circuit or similar communications equipment  by  means  of  which all"
"3951","persons  participating  in  the  meeting  can  hear  each other, which telephone"
"3952","conference meeting shall be deemed to have been held at  a  place  designated by"
"3953","the  Trustees  at  the meeting. Participation in a telephone conference  meeting"
"3954","shall constitute presence in person at such meeting."
"3955","      SECTION 2. QUORUM  AND  MANNER OF ACTING. A majority of the Trustees shall"
"3956","be  present at any regular or special  meeting  of  the  Trustees  in  order  to"
"3957","constitute  a quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting and (except"

"3959","majority of the Trustees present at  any  such  meeting,  at  which  a quorum is"
"3960","present,  shall  be  the  act  of  the  Trustees. In the absence of a quorum,  a"
"3961","majority of the Trustees present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until"
"3962","a quorum shall be present. Notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given."
"3963","                                    ARTICLE V"

"3980","Chair."
"3981","      SECTION 2. MEETING, QUORUM AND MANNER OF ACTING. The Trustees may:"
"3982","            (i)   provide for stated meetings of any Committee;"

"4244","The decision of the Trustees as to what, in  accordance  with generally accepted"
"4245","accounting  principles,  is  income and what is principal shall  be  final,  and"

"4247","expenses and charges of the Trust shall be  charged  against  principal and what"
"4248","against income shall be final, all subject to any applicable provisions  of  the"
"4249","1940  Act.  For the purposes of the limitation imposed by this Section 1, Shares"

"4251","of cash which the Shareholders  would  have  received  if  they  had  elected to"

"4253","      Inasmuch as the computation of net income and gains for federal income tax"
"4254","purposes  may  vary from the computation thereof on the books of the Trust,  the"
"4255","above provisions shall be interpreted to give to the Trustees the power in their"
"4256","discretion to distribute  for  any  fiscal  year  as  ordinary  dividends and as"
"4257","capital  gains  distributions,  respectively,  additional amounts sufficient  to"
"4258","enable the Trust to avoid or reduce liability for  taxes.  Any  payment  made to"
"4259","Shareholders pursuant to clause (ii) and/or clause (iii) of this Section 1 shall"

"4278","express his election before a given time shall be deemed to have elected to take"
"4279","Shares rather than cash, or to take cash rather then Shares,  or  to take Shares"
"4280","with cash adjustment of fractions."
"4281","      The  Trustees,  in  their sole discretion, may cause the Trust to  require"

"4284","additional  shares  of  the Trust rather than paid in cash, unless a shareholder"
"4285","who, after notification that  his distributions will be reinvested in additional"
"4286","shares  in  accordance  with  the  preceding  phrase,  elects  to  receive  such"
"4287","distributions in cash. Where a shareholder  has elected to receive distributions"

"4289","the shareholder's address of record, the Trustees, in their sole discretion, may"
"4290","cause  the  Trust  to  require that such Shareholder's  distribution  option  be"

"4376","                                   WITNESSETH:"
"4377","      WHEREAS,  the  Trust  is  engaged  in business as  an  investment  company"
"4378","registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940; and"
"4379","      WHEREAS, the Adviser is willing to provide  services  to  the  Fund on the"
"4380","terms and conditions hereinafter set forth;"
"4381","      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements of"
"4382","the  parties  hereto  as  herein  set  forth, the parties covenant and agree  as"
"4383","follows:"
"4384","      ARTICLE 1.  DUTIES OF THE ADVISER.  (a) The Adviser shall provide the Fund"
"4385","with such investment advice and supervision  as the latter may from time to time"
"4386","consider necessary for the proper supervision  of its assets.  The Adviser shall"
"4387","act as investment adviser to the Fund and as such  shall furnish continuously an"
"4388","investment  program and shall determine from time to  time  what  securities  or"
"4389","other instruments  shall be purchased, sold or exchanged and what portion of the"
"4390","assets of the Fund shall  be held uninvested, subject always to the restrictions"
"4391","of the Trust's Amended and  Restated  Declaration  of  Trust, dated December 16,"
"4392","2004,  and  By-Laws,  each  as  amended  from  time  to time (respectively,  the"
"4393","Declaration and the By-Laws), to the provisions of  the  Investment  Company"
"4394","Act  of  1940 and the Rules, Regulations and orders thereunder and to the Fund's"
"4395","then-current  Prospectus  and  Statement of Additional Information.  The Adviser"
"4396","also shall exercise voting rights,  rights  to  consent to corporate actions and"
"4397","any  other rights pertaining to the Fund's portfolio  securities  in  accordance"
"4398","with the  Adviser's  policies and procedures as presented to the Trustees of the"
"4399","Trust from time to time.   Should  the  Trustees  at any time, however, make any"
"4400","definite  determination  as  to the investment policy  and  notify  the  Adviser"
"4401","thereof in writing, the Adviser  shall  be  bound  by such determination for the"
"4402","period, if any, specified in such notice or until similarly  notified  that such"
"4403","determination shall be revoked."
"4404","      (b)  The  Adviser shall take, on behalf of the Fund, all actions which  it"
"4405","deems necessary to  implement  the  investment  policies  determined as provided"
"4406","above,  and  in  particular  to  place all orders for the purchase  or  sale  of"
"4407","portfolio securities or other instruments for the Fund's account with brokers or"
"4408","dealers selected by it, and to that  end, the Adviser is authorized as the agent"
"4409","of  the  Fund to give instructions to the  Custodian  of  the  Fund  as  to  the"
"4410","deliveries  of  securities  or  other  instruments  and payments of cash for the"
"4411","account  of  the  Fund.  In connection with the selection  of  such  brokers  or"
"4412","dealers and the placing  of such orders, the Adviser is directed to seek for the"
"4413","Fund the best overall price  and  execution available from responsible brokerage"
"4414","firms, taking account of all factors  it  deems  relevant,  including  by way of"
"4415","illustration:  price; the size of the transaction; the nature of the market  for"
"4416","the security; the  amount  of  the  commission;  the  timing  and  impact of the"
"4417","transaction  taking  into  account  market  prices  and  trends; the reputation,"
"4418","experience  and financial stability of the broker or dealer  involved;  and  the"
"4419","quality of services  rendered by the broker or dealer in other transactions.  In"
"4420","fulfilling this requirement,  the  Adviser  shall  not  be  deemed to have acted"
"4421","unlawfully or to have breached any duty, created by this Agreement or otherwise,"
"4422","solely  by  reason of its having caused the Fund to pay a broker  or  dealer  an"
"4423","amount of commission  for  effecting  a  securities transaction in excess of the"
"4424","amount of commission another broker or dealer  would  have charged for effecting"
"4425","that transaction, if the Adviser determined in good faith  that  such  amount of"
"4426","commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research"
"4427","services  provided  by  such  broker  or  dealer, viewed in terms of either that"
"4428","particular transaction or the Adviser's overall responsibilities with respect to"
"4429","the Fund and to other clients of the Adviser  as  to which the Adviser exercises"
"4430","investment  discretion.   Subject to seeking the best  price  and  execution  as"
"4431","described above, and in accordance  with  applicable  rules and regulations, the"
"4432","Adviser also is authorized to consider sales of shares  of  the Fund or of other"
"4433","funds  or accounts of the Adviser as a factor in the selection  of  brokers  and"
"4434","dealers."
"4435","      (c)  The  Adviser may from time to time enter into sub-investment advisory"
"4436","agreements with respect  to  the  Fund with one or more investment advisers with"
"4437","such terms and conditions as the Adviser  may determine, provided that such sub-"
"4438","investment advisory agreements have been approved  in accordance with applicable"
"4439","provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and  any  rules, regulations or"
"4440","orders  of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.   Subject  to  the"
"4441","provisions  of  Article 6,  the  Adviser  shall  not  be liable for any error of"
"4442","judgment or mistake of law by any sub-adviser or for any loss arising out of any"
"4443","investment made by any sub-adviser or for any act or omission  in  the execution"
"4444","and management of the Fund by any sub-adviser."
"4445","      ARTICLE  2.   ALLOCATION  OF CHARGES AND EXPENSES.  (a) The Adviser  shall"
"4446","furnish  at its own expense investment  advisory  and  administrative  services,"
"4447","office space,  equipment  and  clerical  personnel  necessary  for servicing the"

"4449","advisory  facilities  and  executive and supervisory personnel for managing  the"
"4450","investments and effecting the  portfolio  transactions of the Fund.  The Adviser"
"4451","shall arrange, if desired by the Trust, for directors, officers and employees of"
"4452","the Adviser to serve as Trustees, officers  or  agents  of  the  Trust  if  duly"
"4453","elected  or  appointed to such positions and subject to their individual consent"
"4454","and to any limitations imposed by law."
"4455","      (b) It is understood that the Trust and the Fund will pay all of their own"
"4456","expenses incurred  in  their  operations  and the offering of the Fund's shares,"
"4457","unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement or except to the extent"
"4458","that  the  Adviser  agrees  in  a written instrument  executed  by  the  Adviser"
"4459","(specifically referring to this Article 2(b))  to  assume  or  otherwise pay for"
"4460","specified  expenses  of  the  Trust or the Fund, including, without  limitation:"
"4461","compensation of Trustees not affiliated  with  the Adviser; governmental fees;"

"4473","Fund; organizational  and  start  up  costs; such non-recurring or extraordinary"
"4474","expenses as may arise, including those relating to actions, suits or proceedings"
"4475","to which the Fund is a party or otherwise  may  have  an exposure, and the legal"
"4476","obligation  which  the  Fund  may  have  to indemnify the Trust's  Trustees  and"
"4477","officers  with  respect  thereto;  and  expenses   relating   to  the  issuance,"

"4479","printing  and mailing of prospectuses for such purposes (except  to  the  extent"
"4480","that any Distribution  Agreement  to  which  the  Trust is a party provides that"

"4482","      (c) The payment or assumption by the Adviser  of any expenses of the Trust"
"4483","or the Fund that the Adviser is not obligated by this  Agreement or otherwise to"
"4484","pay or assume shall not obligate the Adviser to pay or assume  the  same  or any"
"4485","similar expenses of the Trust or the Fund on any subsequent occasion."

"4487","and the facilities  provided,  the  Fund  shall pay to the Adviser an investment"
"4488","advisory  fee  computed and paid monthly as set  forth  in  Appendix B  attached"
"4489","hereto.  If the  Adviser  shall  serve  for  less  than  the whole of any period"
"4490","specified  in  this  Article 3,  the compensation paid to the  Adviser  will  be"
"4491","prorated."
"4492","      ARTICLE  4.  ADDITIONAL SERVICES.   Should  the  Trust  have  occasion  to"
"4493","request the Adviser  or  its  affiliates  to  perform  administrative  or  other"
"4494","additional  services  not  herein  contemplated or to request the Adviser or its"
"4495","affiliates to arrange for the services  of others, the Adviser or its affiliates"
"4496","will act for the Trust on behalf of the Fund  upon  request  to  the best of its"

"4500","compensation that the Adviser is due, under this Agreement."
"4501","      ARTICLE 5.  COVENANTS OF THE ADVISER.  The Adviser agrees that it will not"
"4502","deal with itself, or with the Trustees of the Trust or the  Trust's distributor,"
"4503","if  any,  as  principals  in  making purchases or sales of securities  or  other"
"4504","property for the account of the  Fund,  except  as  permitted  by the Investment"
"4505","Company Act of 1940 and any rules, regulations or orders of the  Securities  and"
"4506","Exchange  Commission  thereunder,  will not take a long or short position in the"
"4507","shares of the Fund except as permitted  by  the  applicable law, and will comply"
"4508","with  all  other provisions of the Declaration and the  By-Laws  and  the  then-"
"4509","current Prospectus  and Statement of Additional Information of the Fund relative"
"4510","to the Adviser and its directors and officers."
"4511","      ARTICLE 6.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF THE ADVISER.  The Adviser shall not"
"4512","be liable for any error  of  judgment  or mistake of law or for any loss arising"
"4513","out of any investment or for any act or omission in the execution and management"
"4514","of the Fund, except for willful misfeasance,  bad  faith,  gross  negligence  or"
"4515","reckless  disregard  of  its  duties and obligations hereunder.  As used in this"
"4516","Article 6, the term Adviser shall include directors, officers and employees of"
"4517","the Adviser as well as that corporation itself."
"4518","      ARTICLE 7.  ACTIVITIES OF  THE  ADVISER.   (a) The Trust acknowledges that"
"4519","the  services of the Adviser to the Fund are not exclusive,  the  Adviser  being"
"4520","free to  render  investment advisory and/or other services to others.  The Trust"
"4521","further acknowledges  that  it  is  possible  that,  based  on  their investment"
"4522","objectives and policies, certain funds or accounts managed by the Adviser or its"
"4523","affiliates  may  at  times  take  investment  positions  or engage in investment"
"4524","techniques  which are contrary to positions taken or techniques  engaged  in  on"
"4525","behalf of the  Fund.   Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the Adviser will at all"
"4526","times endeavor to treat all of its clients in a fair and equitable manner."
"4527","      (b) The Trust acknowledges that whenever the Fund and  one  or  more other"
"4528","funds  or  accounts advised by the Adviser have available monies for investment,"
"4529","investments  suitable  and  appropriate  for each shall be allocated in a manner"
"4530","believed by the Adviser to be fair and equitable  to  each  entity.   Similarly,"
"4531","opportunities  to sell securities or other investments shall be allocated  in  a"
"4532","manner believed  by  the  Adviser  to be fair and equitable to each entity.  The"
"4533","Trust acknowledges that in some instances  this may adversely affect the size of"
"4534","the position that may be acquired or disposed of for the Fund."
"4535","      (c) It is understood that the Trustees,  officers  and shareholders of the"
"4536","Trust are or may be or become interested in the Adviser, as directors, officers,"
"4537","employees,  or  otherwise  and  that  directors, officers and employees  of  the"
"4538","Adviser  are or may become similarly interested  in  the  Trust,  and  that  the"
"4539","Adviser may be or become interested in the Fund as a shareholder or otherwise."
"4540","      ARTICLE   8.    MFS   NAME.    The   Trust  acknowledges  that  the  names"
"4541","Massachusetts Financial Services, MFS or  any  derivatives  thereof or logos"
"4542","associated  with  those  names (collectively, the MFS Marks) are the  valuable"

"4545","MFS Marks only so long as the Adviser serves as investment  adviser to the Trust"
"4546","and  the  Fund.  The Trust agrees that if the Adviser for any reason  no  longer"

"4548","promptly shall  cease  to  use  the  MFS  Marks  and  promptly  shall  amend its"
"4549","registration statement to delete any references to the MFS Marks.  Likewise, the"

"4552","promptly  shall  cease  to  use  the  MFS  Marks  and  promptly shall amend  its"
"4553","Declaration  of  Trust  to delete any references to the MFS  Marks.   The  Trust"
"4554","acknowledges that the Adviser  may  permit other clients to use the MFS Marks in"
"4555","their names or other material.  For purposes of this Article, the Trust shall be"
"4556","deemed to have taken the required action  promptly  if  such  action  is taken"
"4557","within 90 days of the Adviser no longer serving as the investment adviser to the"
"4558","Fund  of  the Trust, or from the date of the Adviser's request, as the case  may"

"4562","first  written  above,  and shall become effective with respect to the Fund,  if"
"4563","approved by the shareholders of the Fund, on the Effective Date for the Fund, as"

"4574","in each case on not  more  than  sixty  days' nor less than thirty days' written"
"4575","notice to the other party.  This Agreement  shall automatically terminate in the"
"4576","event of its assignment."
"4577","      (c) This Agreement may be amended with  respect  to  the Fund only if such"

"4581","Company Act of 1940)."
"4582","      (d) Any approval, renewal or amendment  of  this Agreement with respect to"

"4585","Trust who are not interested persons  of  the  Trust  or the Adviser, shall be"
"4586","effective  to approve, renew or amend the Agreement with respect  to  that  Fund"
"4587","notwithstanding  (i) that  the  approval,  renewal  or amendment has not been so"
"4588","approved as to any other Fund, or (ii) that the approval,  renewal  or amendment"
"4589","has  not  been  approved  by  the  vote  of a majority of the outstanding voting"
