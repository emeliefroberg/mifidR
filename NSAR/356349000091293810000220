"1344","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1345","To the Board of Trustees and the Shareholders of MFS Government Securities"
"1346","Fund:"
"1347","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of MFS"
"1348","Government Securities Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year ended February"
"1349","28, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1350","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"1351","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"1352","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1353","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"1354","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1355","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"1356","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1357","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1358","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1359","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1360","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"1361","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1362","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1363","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1364","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"1365","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1366","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1367","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"1368","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1369","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1370","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"1371","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1372","trustees of the trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1373","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition"
"1374","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1375","statements."
"1376","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1377","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1378","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1379","become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of"
"1380","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1381","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1382","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"1383","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1384","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1385","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1386","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1387","fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"1388","on a timely basis."
"1389","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"1390","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1391","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"1392","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1393","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1394","in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and their operation,"
"1395","including controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"1396","material weakness, as defined above, as of February 28, 2010."
"1397","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"1398","the Board of Trustees of MFS Government Securities Fund and the Securities and"
"1399","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
"1400","other than these specified parties."

"1629","such meeting in person or by proxy, and such joint owners or their  proxies so"
"1630","present disagree as to any vote to be cast,  such vote shall not be received in"

"1632","Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise,"
"1633","and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger.  The placing"

"1635","transmitted instructions obtained pursuant to procedures reasonably designed to"
"1636","verify that such instructions  have been authorized by such  Shareholder  shall"

"1640","or  management of such Share, he may vote by his guardian or such other person"

"1642","proxy. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of a"
"1643","proxy may be substituted for or used in lieu of the original proxy for any and"
"1644","all  purposes for which the original  proxy could be used,  provided  that such"
"1645","copy,  facsimile  telecommunication or other  reproduction  shall be a complete"
"1646","reproduction of the entire original proxy or the portion thereof to be returned"
"1647","by the Shareholder."

"1659","in person or by proxy, or, where any provision of law, the Declaration or these"
"1660","By-laws  requires that holders of any series or class shall vote as a series or"
"1661","class, Shareholders entitled to cast votes representing a majority of the voting"
"1662","power of the outstanding Shares of that series or class entitled to vote present"
"1663","in person or by proxy, may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum"
"1664","shall be present.  Only Shareholders of record shall be entitled to vote on any"
"1665","matter."

"1667","open to inspection by Shareholders to the same extent as is permitted"
"1668","shareholders of a Massachusetts business corporation."
"1669","         Section 7. Action  without  Meeting. Any action  which may be taken by"
"1670","Shareholders  may be taken  without a meeting if  Shareholders  holding  Shares"
"1671","representing  a majority of the voting power of the Shares  entitled to vote on"
"1672","the matter (or such larger  proportion thereof as shall be required by law, the"
"1673","Declaration or these By-Laws for approval of such matter) consent to the action"
"1674","in writing and the written consents are filed with the records of the meetings"
"1675","of Shareholders. Such consent shall be treated for all purposes as a vote taken"
