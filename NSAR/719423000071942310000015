"12585","The SUB-ADVISER, subject to the control, direction, and supervision of"
"12586","VALIC and the Board and in material conformity with (i) the 1940 Act,"
"12587","and all applicable laws and regulations thereunder, (ii) all other applicable"

registration statements, prospectus and stated investment objectives,
policies and restrictions, and (iv) any applicable procedures adopted by the
Board and provided to the SUB-ADVISER shall:

(a)	manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets of
the Covered Fund(s) including, for example, the
evaluation of pertinent economic, statistical, financial,
and other data, the determination of the industries and
companies to be represented in each Covered Funds"
"12591","portfolio, and the formulation and implementation of"
"12592","investment programs; and"

ADVISER, or arrange for any other entity to provide a
trading desk and to place orders with brokers and
dealers (including futures commission merchants)
selected by the SUB-ADVISER, subject to the SUB-
ADVISERs control, direction, and supervision, which"
"12597","brokers or dealers may include brokers or dealers"
"12598","(including futures commission merchants) affiliated"
"12599","with the SUB-ADVISER, subject to applicable law."
"12600","The SUB-ADVISER shall not be responsible for the administrative affairs"
"12601","of the Covered Fund, including pricing the Covered Fund. The SUB-"
"12602","ADVISER will provide reasonable assistance to VALIC to assist in"
"12603","pricing securities where market or broker quotations are not readily"
"12604","available."
"12605","In performing the services described in paragraph (b) above, the SUB-"
"12606","ADVISER shall use its best efforts to obtain for the Covered Fund(s) the"
"12607","best execution of portfolio transactions.  If the Board approves appropriate"
"12608","policies and procedures, the SUB-ADVISER may cause the Covered"
"12609","Fund(s) to pay to a broker a commission for effecting a portfolio"
"12610","transaction, in excess of the commission another broker would have"
"12611","charged for effecting the same transaction, if the first broker provided"
"12612","brokerage and/or research services to the SUB-ADVISER. The SUB-"
"12613","ADVISER shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to have"

"12620","ADVISERs reasonable judgment such aggregation shall result in an
overall economic benefit to the Covered Fund considering the
advantageous selling or purchase price, brokerage commission and other
expenses. In accounting for such aggregated order price, commission and
other expenses shall be averaged on a per bond or share basis daily.
VALIC acknowledges that the determination of such economic benefit to
the Covered Fund by the SUB-ADVISER is subjective and represents the
SUB-ADVISERs evaluation that the Covered Fund is benefited by"
"12621","relatively better purchase or sales prices, lower commission expenses and"
"12622","beneficial timing of transactions or a combination of these and other"
"12623","factors."
"12624","VALIC may direct the SUB-ADVISER to use a particular broker or dealer"

"12626","interest of the Covered Fund to do so. Any such direction shall be in"
"12627","writing and in a form satisfactory to SUB-ADVISER."
"12628","VALIC authorizes and empowers the SUB-ADVISER to direct the"
"12629","custodian of the Covered Funds (the Custodian) to open and maintain"
"12630","brokerage accounts for securities and other property, including financial"

3.	Scope of the SUB-ADVISERs Activities"
"12725","VALIC understands that the SUB-ADVISER and its affiliates now act,"
"12726","will continue to act and may act in the future as investment adviser to"
"12727","fiduciary and other managed accounts and as investment adviser to other"
"12728","investment companies, and VALIC has no objection to the SUB-"
"12729","ADVISER so acting, provided that whenever a Covered Fund and one or"
"12730","more other accounts or investment companies advised by the SUB-"
"12731","ADVISER have available funds for investment, investments suitable and"
"12732","appropriate for each will be allocated in accordance with a methodology"
"12733","believed to be equitable to each entity. The SUB-ADVISER similarly"
"12734","agrees to allocate opportunities to sell securities. VALIC recognizes that,"
"12735","in some cases, this procedure may limit the size of the position that may be"
"12736","acquired or sold for a Covered Fund. In addition, VALIC understands that"
"12737","the persons employed by the SUB-ADVISER to assist in the performance"
"12738","of the SUB-ADVISERs duties hereunder will not devote their full time to
such service and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit or
restrict the right of the SUB-ADVISER or any affiliate of the SUB-
ADVISER to engage in and devote time and attention to other business or
to render services of whatever kind or nature.

Except as otherwise required by the 1940 Act, any of the shareholders,
directors, officers and employees of VALIC may be a shareholder,
director, officer or employee of, or be otherwise interested in, the SUB-
ADVISER, and in any person controlling, controlled by or under common
control with the SUB-ADVISER; and the SUB-ADVISER, and any person
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the SUB-
ADVISER, may have an interest in VALIC.

The SUB-ADVISER shall not be liable to VALIC, VC I, or to any
shareholder in the Covered Fund, and VALIC shall indemnify the SUB-
ADVISER, for any act or omission in rendering services under this
Agreement, or for any losses sustained in connection with the matters to
which this agreement relates, so long as there has been no willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of
obligations or duties on the part of the SUB-ADVISER in performing its
duties under this Agreement.

VALIC shall perform quarterly and annual tax compliance tests and
promptly furnish reports of such tests to the SUB-ADVISER after each
quarter end to ensure that the Covered Fund is in compliance with
Subchapter M of the Code and Section 817(h) of the Code. VALIC shall
apprise the SUB-ADVISER promptly after each quarter end of any
potential non-compliance with the diversification requirements in such
Code provisions. If so advised, the SUB-ADVISER shall take prompt
action so that the Covered Fund complies with such Code diversification
provisions, as directed by VALIC. VALIC acknowledges that the SUB-
ADVISER will base its compliance with such provisions of the Code on
accurate and timely portfolio information, including tax lot allocation,
from VALIC.

the documents previously furnished to it.

The SUB-ADVISER is authorized to honor and act on any notice,
instruction or confirmation given by VALIC on behalf of the Covered
Fund in writing signed or sent by any of the persons whose names,
addresses and specimen signatures will be provided by VALIC from time
to time. The SUB-ADVISER shall not be liable for so acting in good faith
upon such instructions, confirmation or authority, notwithstanding that it
shall subsequently be shown that the same was not given or signed or sent

SUB-ADVISER, and not to use such material if the SUB-ADVISER
reasonably objects in writing within ten (10) business days (or such other
time as may be mutually agreed) after receipt thereof. In the event of

expenses and claims which arise directly or indirectly (i) as a result of a
failure by VALIC to provide the services or furnish materials required
under the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) as the result of any untrue
statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact
required to be stated or necessary to make the statements, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading in any
registration statements, proxy materials, reports, advertisements, sales
literature, or other materials pertaining to the Covered Fund, except
insofar as any such statement or omission was specifically made in
reliance on written information provided to VALIC by the SUB-
ADVISER for use in such material and which was specifically reviewed
and approved by SUB-ADVISER.

The SUB-ADVISER agrees to indemnify VALIC for losses, costs, fees,
expenses and claims which arise directly or indirectly (i) as a result of the
willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of
obligations or duties by the SUB-ADVISER; or (ii) as the result of any
untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact
required to be stated or necessary to make the statements, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading in any
registration statements, proxy materials, reports, advertisements, sales
literature, or other materials pertaining to the Covered Fund to the extent
any such statement or omission was made in reliance on information
provided to VALIC by the SUB-ADVISER for use in such material and
which was specifically reviewed and approved by SUB-ADVISER.

applicable provisions of the federal securities laws, the latter shall control.

(e)	The SUB-ADVISER is engaged principally in the

(e)	VALIC desires to enter into an Investment Sub-
Advisory Agreement with the SUB-ADVISER for all
or a portion of the assets of the Covered Fund(s)
which VALIC determines from time to time to assign
to the SUB-ADVISER.

VALIC and the SUB-ADVISER AGREE AS FOLLOWS:

1.	Services Rendered and Expenses Paid by the SUB-ADVISER

The SUB-ADVISER, subject to the control, direction, and supervision
of VALIC and the VC Boards and in material conformity with the 1940
Act, all applicable laws and regulations thereunder, all other applicable
federal and state securities and tax laws and regulations, including
section 817(h) and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the ?Code?), the VC Organizational Documents,
Bylaws, registration statements, prospectus and stated investment
objectives, policies and restrictions and any applicable procedures
adopted by the VC Boards and provided to the SUB-ADVISER shall:

(a)	manage the investment and reinvestment of
all of, or to the extent applicable, a portion of, the
assets of each Covered Fund(s) including, for
example, the evaluation of pertinent economic,
statistical, financial, and other data, the determination
of the industries and companies to be represented in
each Covered Fund?s portfolio, and the formulation
and implementation of investment programs.

(b)	maintain a trading desk and place orders for
the purchase and sale of portfolio investments
(including futures contracts and options thereon) for
each Covered Fund?s account with brokers or dealers
(including futures commission merchants) selected
by the SUB-ADVISER, or arrange for any other
entity to provide a trading desk and to place orders
with brokers and dealers (including futures
commission merchants) selected by the SUB-
ADVISER, subject to the SUB-ADVISER?s control,
direction, and supervision, which brokers or dealers
may include brokers or dealers (including futures
commission merchants) affiliated with the SUB-
ADVISER, subject to applicable law.

Without limiting the foregoing, the SUB-ADVISER represents and
warrants to VALIC that all of, or to the extent applicable the portion of,
the assets which it manages of the Covered Fund(s) set forth in
Schedule A will at all times be operated and managed in compliance
with (a) all applicable federal and state laws, including securities,
commodities and banking laws, governing its operations and
investments; (b) applicable provisions of Subchapter M, chapter 1 of
the Code (?Subchapter M?) for each Covered Fund to be treated as a
?regulated investment company? under Subchapter M; (c) the
diversification requirements specified in the Internal Revenue Service?s
regulations under Section 817(h) of the Code so as not to jeopardize the
treatment of the variable annuity contracts that offer the Covered Funds
as annuity contracts for purposes of the Code; (d) the distribution
requirements necessary to avoid payment of any excise tax pursuant to
Section 4982 of the Code; (e) the provisions of the 1940 Act and rules
adopted thereunder; (f) the objectives, policies, restrictions and
limitations for the Covered Funds as set forth in the Covered Funds?
current prospectus and statement of additional information as most
recently provided by VALIC to the SUB-ADVISER; and (g) the
policies and procedures as adopted by the VC Boards, as most recently
provided by VALIC to the SUB-ADVISER. The SUB-ADVISER shall
furnish information to VALIC, as requested, for purposes of
compliance with the distribution requirements necessary to avoid
payment of any excise tax pursuant to Section 4982 of the Code. The
SUB-ADVISER further represents and warrants that to the extent that
any statements or omissions made in any Registration Statement for
shares of the Covered Funds, as applicable, of VC I VC II, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, are made in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished by the SUB-ADVISER
expressly for use therein, such Registration Statement and any
amendments or supplements thereto will, when they become effective,
conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities
Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations of the Commission
thereunder (the 1933 Act) and the 1940 Act and will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading.

 The SUB-ADVISER agrees: (a) to maintain a level of errors and
omissions or professional liability insurance coverage that, at all times
during the course of this Agreement, is satisfactory to VALIC, and (b)
from time to time and upon reasonable request, to supply evidence of
such coverage to VALIC.

VALIC agrees that SUB-ADVISER shall manage the portion of the
assets of a Covered Fund allocated to it as if it was a separate operating
fund, unless instructed otherwise in writing from VALIC, and shall
comply with the representations and warranties stated in this Section
(including, but not limited to, the investment objectives, policies and
restrictions applicable to a Covered Fund and qualifications of a
Covered Fund as a regulated investment company under the Code) with
respect to the portion of assets of a Covered Fund allocated to SUB-
ADVISER.

The SUB-ADVISER will assist the Covered Fund(s) and its agents in
determining whether prices obtained for valuation purposes accurately
reflect the prices on the SUB-ADVISER?s portfolio records relating to
the assets of the Covered Fund(s) for which the SUB-ADVISER has
responsibility at such times as VALIC shall reasonably request;
provided, however, that the parties acknowledge that the SUB-
ADVISER is not the fund accounting agent for the Covered Fund(s)
and is not responsible for pricing determinations or calculations and
any information provided pursuant to this position by the SUB-
ADVISER will be provided for information purposes only.

In performing the services described in paragraph (b) above, the SUB-
ADVISER shall use its best efforts to obtain for the Covered Fund(s)
the best execution of portfolio transactions.  Subject to approval by the
VC I Board or VC II Board, as applicable, of appropriate policies and
procedures, the SUB-ADVISER may cause the Covered Fund(s) to pay
to a broker a commission, for effecting a portfolio transaction, in excess
of the commission another broker would have charged for effecting the
same transaction, if the first broker provided brokerage and/or research
services to the SUB-ADVISER.  The SUB-ADVISER shall not be
deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to have breached any duty created
by this Agreement, or otherwise, solely by reason of acting in
accordance with such authorization.

The SUB-ADVISER may aggregate sales and purchase orders of
securities held by the Covered Fund(s) with similar orders being made
simultaneously for other accounts managed by the SUB-ADVISER or
with accounts of the affiliates of the SUB-ADVISER, if in the SUB-
ADVISER?s reasonable judgment such aggregation shall result in an
overall economic benefit to the Covered Fund(s) considering the
advantageous selling or purchase price, brokerage commission and
other expenses. In accounting for such aggregated order price,
commission and other expenses shall be averaged on a per bond or
share basis daily.  VALIC acknowledges that the determination of such
economic benefit to the Covered Fund(s) by the SUB-ADVISER is
subjective and represents the SUB-ADVISER?s evaluation that the
Covered Fund(s) is benefited by relatively better purchase or sales
prices, lower commission expenses and beneficial timing of
transactions or a combination of these and other factors.

The SUB-ADVISER shall maintain records adequately demonstrating
compliance with its obligations under this Agreement and report
periodically to VALIC and the VC Boards regarding the performance
of its services under this Agreement.  The SUB-ADVISER will make
available to VALIC, VC I and VC II promptly upon their reasonable
written request all of the Covered Fund(s)?s investment records and
ledgers to assist VALIC, VC I and VC II in compliance with respect to
the Covered Fund(s)?s securities transactions as required by the 1940
Act and the Advisers Act, as well as other applicable laws.  The SUB-
ADVISER will furnish the VC Boards such periodic and special reports
as VALIC and the VC Boards may reasonably request.  The SUB-
ADVISER will furnish to regulatory authorities any information or
reports in connection with such services which may be requested in
order to ascertain whether the operations of the Covered Fund(s) are
being conducted in a manner consistent with applicable laws and
regulations.

The SUB-ADVISER will not disclose or use any records or
information obtained pursuant to this Agreement in any manner
whatsoever except as expressly authorized in this Agreement, and will
keep confidential any non-public information obtained directly as a
result of this service relationship, and the SUB-ADVISER shall
disclose such non-public information only if VALIC or the VC I Board
or the VC II Board, as applicable, have authorized such disclosure, or if
such information is or hereafter otherwise is known by the SUB-
ADVISER or has been disclosed, directly or indirectly, by VALIC, VC
I or VC II to others becomes ascertainable from public or published
information or trade sources, or if such disclosure is expressly required
or requested by applicable federal or state regulatory authorities or
Court of Law of competent jurisdiction, or to the extent such disclosure
is reasonably required by auditors or attorneys of the SUB-ADVISER
in connection with the performance of their professional services.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the SUB-ADVISER may disclose the
total return earned by the Covered Fund(s) and may include such total
return in the calculation of composite performance information without
prior approval by VALIC or the VC Boards.

Should VALIC at any time make any definite determination as to any
investment policy and notify the SUB-ADVISER in writing of such
determination, the SUB-ADVISER shall be bound by such
determination for the period, if any, specified in such notice or until
similarly notified that such determination has been revoked, provided
such determination will permit SUB-ADVISER to comply with the
first paragraph of this Section.

The SUB-ADVISER will not hold money or investments on behalf of
the Covered Fund(s).  The money and investments will be held by the
Custodian of the Covered Fund(s).  The SUB-ADVISER will arrange
for the transmission to the Custodian for the Covered Fund(s), on a
daily basis, such confirmation, trade tickets and other documents as
may be necessary to enable it to perform its administrative
responsibilities with respect to the Covered Fund(s).  The SUB-
ADVISER further shall have the authority to instruct the custodian of
the Covered Fund(s) (i) to pay cash for securities and other property
delivered to the Custodian for the Covered Fund(s) (ii) to deliver
securities and other property against payment for the Covered Fund(s),
and (iii) to transfer assets and funds to such brokerage accounts as the
SUB-ADVISER may designate, all consistent with the powers,
authorities and limitations set forth herein. The SUB-ADVISER shall
not have the authority to cause the Custodian to deliver securities and
other property except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

The SUB-ADVISER shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an
independent contractor and shall, unless otherwise provided or
authorized, have no authority to act or represent VALIC, VC I or VC II
other than in furtherance of the SUB-ADVISER?s duties and
responsibilities as set forth in this Agreement.

Except as otherwise agreed, or as otherwise provided herein, the SUB-
ADVISER shall bear the expense of discharging its responsibilities
hereunder and VALIC shall pay, or arrange for others to pay, all
VALIC?s expenses, except that VALIC shall in all events pay the
compensation described in Section 2 of the Agreement.  VALIC and
the SUB-ADVISER acknowledge that VC I or VC II, as applicable,
will be ultimately responsible for all brokerage commissions, taxes,
custodian fees and other transaction-related fees incurred on behalf of
the Covered Fund(s).

The SUB-ADVISER also represents and warrants that in furnishing
services hereunder, the SUB-ADVISER will not consult with any other
sub-adviser of the Covered Fund(s) or other series of VC I or VC II, to
the extent any other sub-advisers are engaged by VALIC, or any other
sub-advisers to other investment companies that are under common
control with VC I or VC II, concerning transactions of the Covered
Fund(s) in securities or other assets, other than for purposes of
complying with the conditions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of rule 12d3-1
under the 1940 Act.

2.	Compensation of the SUB-ADVISER

VALIC shall pay to the SUB-ADVISER, as compensation for the
services rendered and expenses paid by the SUB-ADVISER, a monthly
fee or fees based on the Covered Fund(s)?s average daily net asset
value computed for each of the Covered Fund(s) as provided for herein
and in the fee schedule attached hereto as Schedule A.  Schedule A
may be amended from time to time, provided that amendments are
made in conformity with applicable laws and regulations and the VC
Organizational Documents and Bylaws.  Any change in Schedule A
pertaining to any new or existing Covered Fund(s) shall not be deemed
to affect the interest of any other Covered Fund(s) and shall not require
the approval of shareholders of any other Covered Fund(s).

The average daily net asset value shall be determined by taking the
mean average of all of the determinations of net asset value, made in
the manner provided in the VC I Articles or the VC II Declaration, as
applicable, for each business day during a given calendar month.
VALIC shall pay this fee for each calendar month as soon as
practicable after the end of that month, but in any event no later than
ten (10) business days following the end of the month.

	If the SUB-ADVISER serves for less than a whole month, the
foregoing compensation shall be prorated.

The payment of advisory fees related to the services of the SUB-
ADVISER under this Agreement shall be the sole responsibility of
VALIC and shall not be the responsibility of VC I, VC II or the
Covered Fund(s).

3.	Scope of the SUB-ADVISER?s Activities

VALIC understands that the SUB-ADVISER and its affiliates now act,
will continue to act and may act in the future as investment adviser to
fiduciary and other managed accounts and as investment adviser to
other investment companies, and VALIC has no objection to the SUB-
ADVISER so acting, provided that whenever the Covered Fund(s) and
one or more other accounts or investment companies advised by the
SUB-ADVISER have available funds for investment, investments
suitable and appropriate for each will be allocated in accordance with a
methodology believed to be equitable to each entity. The SUB-
ADVISER similarly agrees to allocate opportunities to sell securities.
VALIC recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure may limit the
size of the position that may be acquired or sold for the Covered
Fund(s). In addition, VALIC understands that the persons employed by
the SUB-ADVISER to assist in the performance of the SUB-
ADVISER?s duties hereunder will not devote their full time to such
service and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit or restrict

This Agreement shall become effective as to the Covered Fund(s) on
the date hereof and as to any other VC I Portfolio or VC II Portfolio on
the date of the Amendment to Schedule A adding such portfolio in
accordance with this Agreement.  Unless sooner terminated as provided
herein, this Agreement shall continue in effect for two years from its
effective date.  Thereafter this Agreement shall continue in effect, but
with respect to any Covered Fund(s), subject to the termination
provisions and all other terms and conditions hereof, only so long as
such continuance is approved at least annually by the vote of a majority
of the VC I directors or VC II trustees, as applicable who are not parties
to this Agreement or interested persons of any such parties, cast in
person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval,
and by a vote of a majority of the directors of the VC I Board or

This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event of its

days? nor less than 30 days? prior written notice to the SUB-ADVISER,

parties.  This Agreement may also be terminated by VALIC:  (i) on not
more than 60 days? nor less than 30 days? prior written notice to the
SUB-ADVISER, or upon such shorter notice as may be mutually
agreed upon by the parties, without the payment of any penalty; or (ii)
if the SUB-ADVISER becomes unable to discharge its duties and
obligations under this Agreement.  The SUB-ADVISER may terminate
this Agreement at any time, or preclude its renewal without the
payment of any penalty, on not more than 60 days? nor less than 30
days? prior written notice to VALIC, or upon such shorter notice as
may be mutually agreed upon by the parties.

6.	Other Matters

The SUB-ADVISER may from time to time employ or associate with
itself any person or persons believed to be particularly fit to assist in its
performance of services under this Agreement, provided no such
person serves or acts as an investment adviser separate from the SUB-
ADVISER so as to require a new written contract pursuant to the 1940
Act. The compensation of any such persons will be paid by the SUB-
ADVISER, and no obligation will be incurred by, or on behalf of,
VALIC, VC I, VC II or the Covered Fund(s) with respect to them.

The SUB-ADVISER agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by
Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the records required to be maintained by
Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act.  The SUB-ADVISER agrees that all
books and records which it maintains for the Covered Fund(s) are the
Covered Fund(s)?s property and will be surrendered promptly to the
Covered Fund(s) or VALIC upon request.  The SUB-ADVISER agrees
that all accounts, books and other records maintained and preserved by
it as required hereby shall be subject at any time, and from time to time,
to such reasonable periodic, special and other examinations by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Covered Fund(s)?s auditors,
the Covered Fund(s) or any representative of the Covered Fund(s),
VALIC, or any governmental agency or other instrumentality having
regulatory authority over the Covered Fund(s)

VALIC has herewith furnished the SUB-ADVISER copies of the
Covered Fund(s)?s Prospectus, Statement of Additional Information,
VC Organizational Documents and Bylaws as are currently in effect
and agrees during the continuance of this Agreement to furnish the
SUB-ADVISER copies of any amendments or supplements thereto
before or at the time the amendments or supplements become effective.
Until VALIC delivers any amendments or supplements to the SUB-
ADVISER, the SUB-ADVISER shall be fully protected in relying on
the documents previously furnished to it.

The SUB-ADVISER is authorized to honor and act on any notice,
instruction or confirmation given by VALIC on behalf of the Covered
Fund(s) in writing signed or sent by any of the persons who the SUB-
ADVISER has reason to believe are acting in good authority.  The
SUB-ADVISER shall not be liable for so acting in good faith upon
such instructions, confirmation or authority.

VALIC agrees to furnish the SUB-ADVISER at its principal office
prior to use thereof, copies of all prospectuses, statements of additional
information, proxy statements, reports to shareholders, sales literature,
or other material prepared for distribution to shareholders of the
Covered Fund(s) or the public that refer in any way to the SUB-
ADVISER, and not to use such material if the SUB-ADVISER
reasonably objects in writing within ten (10) business days (or such
other time as may be mutually agreed) after receipt thereof.  In the
event of termination of this agreement, VALIC will continue to furnish
to the SUB-ADVISER copies of any of the above-mentioned materials
that refer in any way to the SUB-ADVISER and shall cease to use the
SUB-ADVISER name and logo as soon as is reasonable.  VALIC shall
furnish or otherwise make available to the SUB-ADVISER such other
information relating to the business affairs of VALIC and the Covered
Fund(s) as the SUB-ADVISER at any time, or from time to time, may
reasonably request in order to discharge obligations hereunder. Subject
to provisions of this paragraph, the SUB-ADVISER grants VALIC and
the Covered Fund(s) a non-exclusive right to use the ?[NewCo]? name
in connection with the SUB-ADVISER?s management of the Covered
Fund(s) (i) for so long as this Agreement, any other investment
management agreement between VALIC and SUB-ADVISER with
respect to VC I or VC II, or to any extension, renewal or amendment
thereof, remain in effect, and (ii) for subsequent periods as long as
required by law, rule or regulation or to the extent necessary to refer to
or illustrate the historical performance of the Covered Fund(s).

7.	Liability of the SUB-ADVISER

(a) In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or
reckless disregard of obligations or duties (disabling conduct)
hereunder on the part of the SUB-ADVISER (and its officers, directors,
agents, employees, controlling persons, shareholders and any other
person or entity affiliated with the SUB-ADVISER) the SUB-
ADVISER shall not be subject to liability to VC I, VC II, the Covered

Indemnified Parties) from any liability arising from the SUB-
ADVISER's conduct under this Agreement.
\
(b) The SUB-ADVISER agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
VALIC and its affiliates and each of its directors and officers and each
person, if any, who controls VALIC within the meaning of Section 15

litigation (including legal and other expenses), to which VALIC or its
affiliates or such directors, officers or controlling person may become
subject under the 1933 Act, under other statutes, at common law or

this Agreement by the SUB-ADVISER, or (ii) any failure by the SUB-
ADVISER to comply with the representations and warranties set forth
in Section 1 of this Agreement; provided, however, that in no case is
the SUB-ADVISER's indemnity in favor of any person deemed to
protect such other persons against any liability to which such person

faith, or gross negligence in the performance of his, her or its duties or
by reason of his, her or its reckless disregard of obligation and duties
under this Agreement.

(c) The SUB-ADVISER shall not be liable to VALIC for (i) any acts of
VALIC or any other subadviser to the Covered Fund(s) with respect to
the portion of the assets of the Covered Fund(s) not managed by SUB-
ADVISER and (ii) acts of the SUB-ADVISER which result from acts
of VALIC, including, but not limited to, a failure of VALIC to provide
accurate and current information with respect to any records maintained
by VALIC or any other subadviser to a Covered Fund, which records
are not also maintained by or otherwise available to the SUB-
ADVISER upon reasonable request. VALIC shall indemnify the
Indemnified Parties from any liability arising from the conduct of
VALIC and any other subadviser with respect to the portion of a
Covered Fund's assets not allocated to SUB-ADVISER.

"12779","apply only to Funds set forth on the attached Schedule"
"12780","A, and any other Funds as may be added or deleted by"
"12781","amendment to the attached Schedule A (Covered
Funds)."
"12782","(d)	The SUB-ADVISER is engaged principally in the"
"12783","business of rendering investment advisory services and"
"12784","is registered as an investment adviser under the"
"12785","Advisers Act."
"12786","(e)	VALIC desires to enter into an Investment Sub-"
"12787","Advisory Agreement with the SUB-ADVISER for the"
"12788","assets of the Covered Funds."
"12789","VALIC and the SUB-ADVISER agree as follows:"
"12790","1.	Services Rendered and Expenses Paid by the SUB-ADVISER"
"12791","The SUB-ADVISER, subject to the control, direction, and supervision of"
"12792","VALIC and VC Is Board of Directors and in material conformity with the
1940 Act, all applicable laws and regulations thereunder, all other
applicable federal and state securities and tax laws and regulations,
including section 817(h) and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the Code), VC Is Articles, Bylaws, registration"
"12793","statements, prospectus and stated investment objectives, policies and"
"12794","restrictions and any applicable procedures adopted by VC Is Board of
Directors and provided to the SUB-ADVISER in writing shall:

(a)	manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets of the
Covered Funds, including, for example, the evaluation of
pertinent economic, statistical, financial, and other data, the
determination of the industries and companies to be represented
in each Covered Funds portfolio, and the formulation and"
"12795","implementation of investment programs;"
"12796","(b)	maintain a trading desk and place orders for the purchase and"
"12797","sale of portfolio investments (including futures contracts and"
"12798","options thereon) for each Covered Funds account with brokers
or dealers (including futures commission merchants) selected by
the SUB-ADVISER, or arrange for any other entity to provide a
trading desk and to place orders with brokers and dealers
(including futures commission merchants) selected by the SUB-
ADVISER, subject to the SUB-ADVISERs control, direction,"
"12799","and supervision, which brokers or dealers may include brokers or"
"12800","dealers (including futures commission merchants) affiliated with"
"12801","the SUB-ADVISER, subject to applicable law."
"12802","The SUB-ADVISER will assist the Covered Funds and their agents in"
"12803","determining whether prices obtained for valuation purposes accurately"
"12804","reflect the prices on the SUB-ADVISERs portfolio records relating to the
assets of the Covered Funds for which the SUB-ADVISER has
responsibility on a quarterly basis (unless otherwise agreed upon by the
parties hereto) and at such other times as VALIC shall reasonably request.

In performing the services described in paragraph (b) above, the SUB-
ADVISER shall use its best efforts to obtain for the Covered Funds the
best execution of portfolio transactions. The SUB-ADVISER is
responsible for decisions to buy and sell securities for the Covered Funds,
broker-dealer selection, and negotiation of brokerage commission rates.
Subject to approval by VC Is Board of Directors of appropriate policies"
"12805","and procedures, the SUB-ADVISER may cause the Covered Funds to pay"
"12806","to a broker a commission, for effecting a portfolio transaction, in excess of"
"12807","the commission another broker would have charged for effecting the same"
"12808","transaction, if the first broker provided brokerage and/or research services"
"12809","to the SUB-ADVISER. The SUB-ADVISER shall not be deemed to have"
"12810","acted unlawfully, or to have breached any duty created by this Agreement,"
"12811","or otherwise, solely by reason of acting in accordance with such"
"12812","authorization. Notwithstanding the above, nothing shall require the SUB-"
"12813","ADVISER to use a broker that provides research services or to use a"
"12814","particular broker recommended by VALIC."
"12815","The SUB-ADVISER may aggregate, or, if appropriate, cross sales and"
"12816","purchase orders of securities held by the Covered Funds with similar"
"12817","orders being made simultaneously for other accounts managed by the"
"12818","SUB-ADVISER or with accounts of the affiliates of the SUB-ADVISER,"
"12819","if in the SUB-ADVISERs reasonable judgment such aggregation shall
result in an overall economic benefit to the Covered Funds considering the
advantageous selling or purchase price, brokerage commission and other
expenses. In accounting for such aggregated order price, commission and
other expenses shall be averaged on a per bond or share basis daily. If any
trades are crossed, SUB-ADVISER may charge the Covered Funds for
reasonable expenses incurred in such cross-trades, excluding brokerage
commissions, fees (other than customary transfer fees), or other
remuneration paid in connection with the transaction. A transaction fee
charged by a brokerage or a custodial bank will be considered a customary
transfer fee for purposes of this Agreement. VALIC acknowledges that the
determination of such economic benefit to the Covered Funds by the SUB-
ADVISER is subjective and represents the SUB-ADVISERs evaluation"
"12820","that the Covered Funds are benefited by relatively better purchase or sales"
"12821","prices, lower commission expenses and beneficial timing of transactions or"
"12822","a combination of these and other factors."
"12823","VALIC authorizes and empowers the SUB-ADVISER to direct the"
"12824","Covered Funds Custodian to open and maintain brokerage accounts for
securities and other property, including financial and commodity futures
and commodities and options thereon (all such accounts hereinafter called
brokerage accounts) for and in the name of the Covered Funds and to
execute for each Covered Fund as its agent and attorney-in-fact standard
customer agreements with such broker or brokers as the SUB-ADVISER
shall select as provided above. With respect to brokerage accounts for

In accordance with VC Is Articles of Incorporation"
"13014","(the Articles), new Funds may be added to VC I upon"
"13015","approval of VC Is Board of Directors without the
approval of Fund shareholders. This Agreement will
apply only to Funds set forth on the attached Schedule
A, and any other Funds as may be added or deleted by
amendment to the attached Schedule A (Covered"
"13016","Fund(s)).

(d)	The SUB-ADVISER is engaged principally in the
business of rendering investment advisory services and
is registered as an investment adviser under the
Advisers Act.

(e)	VALIC desires to enter into an Investment Sub-
Advisory Agreement with the SUB-ADVISER for the
assets of the Covered Funds.


          VALIC and the SUB-ADVISER agree as follows:

1.	Services Rendered and Expenses Paid by the SUB-ADVISER

The SUB-ADVISER, subject to the control, direction, and supervision of
VALIC and VC Is Board of Directors and in material conformity with the"
"13017","1940 Act, all applicable laws and regulations thereunder, all other"
"13018","applicable federal and state securities and tax laws and regulations,"
"13019","including section 817(h) and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code"
"13020","of 1986, as amended (the Code), VC Is Articles, Bylaws, registration
statements, prospectus and stated investment objectives, policies and
restrictions and any applicable procedures adopted by VC Is Board of"
"13021","Directors and provided to the SUB-ADVISER in writing shall:"
"13022","(a)	manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets of the"
"13023","Covered Funds, including, for example, the evaluation of"
"13024","pertinent economic, statistical, financial, and other data, the"
"13025","determination of the industries and companies to be represented"
"13026","in each Covered Funds portfolio, and the formulation and
implementation of investment programs;

(b)	maintain a trading desk and place orders for the purchase and
sale of portfolio investments (including futures contracts and
options thereon) for each Covered Funds account with brokers"
"13027","or dealers (including futures commission merchants) selected by"
"13028","the SUB-ADVISER, or arrange for any other entity to provide a"
"13029","trading desk and to place orders with brokers and dealers"
"13030","(including futures commission merchants) selected by the SUB-"
"13031","ADVISER, subject to the SUB-ADVISERs control, direction,
and supervision, which brokers or dealers may include brokers or
dealers (including futures commission merchants) affiliated with
the SUB-ADVISER, subject to applicable law.

The SUB-ADVISER will assist the Covered Funds and their agents in
determining whether prices obtained for valuation purposes accurately
reflect the prices on the SUB-ADVISERs portfolio records relating to the"
"13032","assets of the Covered Funds for which the SUB-ADVISER has"
"13033","responsibility on a quarterly basis (unless otherwise agreed upon by the"
"13034","parties hereto) and at such other times as VALIC shall reasonably request."
"13035","In performing the services described in paragraph (b) above, the SUB-"
"13036","ADVISER shall use its best efforts to obtain for the Covered Funds the"
"13037","best execution of portfolio transactions. The SUB-ADVISER is"
"13038","responsible for decisions to buy and sell securities for the Covered Funds,"
"13039","broker-dealer selection, and negotiation of brokerage commission rates."
"13040","Subject to approval by VC Is Board of Directors of appropriate policies
and procedures, the SUB-ADVISER may cause the Covered Funds to pay
to a broker a commission, for effecting a portfolio transaction, in excess of
the commission another broker would have charged for effecting the same
transaction, if the first broker provided brokerage and/or research services
to the SUB-ADVISER. The SUB-ADVISER shall not be deemed to have
acted unlawfully, or to have breached any duty created by this Agreement,
or otherwise, solely by reason of acting in accordance with such
authorization. Notwithstanding the above, nothing shall require the SUB-
ADVISER to use a broker that provides research services or to use a
particular broker recommended by VALIC.

The SUB-ADVISER may aggregate, or, if appropriate, cross sales and
purchase orders of securities held by the Covered Funds with similar
orders being made simultaneously for other accounts managed by the
SUB-ADVISER or with accounts of the affiliates of the SUB-ADVISER,
if in the SUB-ADVISERs reasonable judgment such aggregation shall"
"13041","result in an overall economic benefit to the Covered Funds considering the"
"13042","advantageous selling or purchase price, brokerage commission and other"
"13043","expenses. In accounting for such aggregated order price, commission and"
"13044","other expenses shall be averaged on a per bond or share basis daily. If any"
"13045","trades are crossed, SUB-ADVISER may charge the Covered Funds for"
"13046","reasonable expenses incurred in such cross-trades, excluding brokerage"
"13047","commissions, fees (other than customary transfer fees), or other"
"13048","remuneration paid in connection with the transaction. A transaction fee"
"13049","charged by a brokerage or a custodial bank will be considered a customary"
"13050","transfer fee for purposes of this Agreement. VALIC acknowledges that the"
"13051","determination of such economic benefit to the Covered Funds by the SUB-"
"13052","ADVISER is subjective and represents the SUB-ADVISERs evaluation
that the Covered Funds are benefited by relatively better purchase or sales
prices, lower commission expenses and beneficial timing of transactions or
a combination of these and other factors.

VALIC authorizes and empowers the SUB-ADVISER to direct the
Covered Funds Custodian to open and maintain brokerage accounts for"
"13053","securities and other property, including financial and commodity futures"
"13054","and commodities and options thereon (all such accounts hereinafter called"
"13055","brokerage accounts) for and in the name of the Covered Funds and to"
"13056","execute for each Covered Fund as its agent and attorney-in-fact standard"
"13057","customer agreements with such broker or brokers as the SUB-ADVISER"
"13058","shall select as provided above. With respect to brokerage accounts for"
"13059","financial and commodity futures and commodities and options thereon, the"
"13060","SUB-ADVISER shall select such brokers, as approved by VALIC, prior to"
"13061","the establishment of such brokerage account. The SUB-ADVISER may,"
"13062","using such of the securities and other property in the Covered Funds as the"
"13063","SUB-ADVISER deems necessary or desirable, direct the Covered Funds
Custodian to deposit for the Covered Funds original and maintenance
brokerage and margin deposits and otherwise direct payments of cash,
cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage
accounts and to such brokers as the SUB-ADVISER deems desirable or
appropriate.

The SUB-ADVISER shall maintain records adequately demonstrating
compliance with its obligations under this Agreement and report quarterly
to VALIC and VC Is Board of Directors regarding the performance of its"
"13064","services under this Agreement. The SUB-ADVISER will make available"
"13065","to VALIC and VC I promptly upon their reasonable written request all of"
"13066","the Covered Funds investment records and ledgers to assist VALIC and
VC I in compliance with respect to each Covered Funds securities"
"13067","transactions as required by the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act, as well as"
"13068","other applicable laws. The SUB-ADVISER will furnish VC Is Board of
Directors such quarterly and special reports as VALIC and VC Is Board"
"13069","of Directors may reasonably request, in a format to be agreed upon by"
"13070","VALIC and the SUB-ADVISER. The SUB-ADVISER will furnish to"
"13071","regulatory authorities any information or reports in connection with such"
"13072","services which may be requested by such regulatory authorities in order to"
"13073","ascertain whether the operations of the Covered Funds are being"
"13074","conducted in a manner consistent with applicable laws and regulations."
"13075","The SUB-ADVISER will not disclose or use any records or information"
"13076","obtained pursuant to this Agreement in any manner whatsoever except as"
"13077","expressly authorized in this Agreement, and will keep confidential any"
"13078","non-public information obtained directly as a result of this service"
"13079","relationship, and the SUB-ADVISER shall disclose such non-public"
"13080","information only if VALIC or the Board of Directors of VC I has"
"13081","authorized such disclosure, or if such information is or hereafter otherwise"
"13082","is known by the SUB-ADVISER or has been disclosed, directly or"
"13083","indirectly, by VALIC or the Fund to others becomes ascertainable from"
"13084","public or published information or trade sources, or if such disclosure is"
"13085","expressly required or requested by applicable federal or state regulatory"
"13086","authorities, or to the extent such disclosure is reasonably required by"
"13087","auditors or attorneys of the SUB-ADVISER in connection with the"
"13088","performance of their professional services. Notwithstanding the foregoing,"
"13089","the SUB-ADVISER may disclose the total return earned by the Covered"
"13090","Funds and may include such total return in the calculation of composite"
"13091","performance information without prior approval by VALIC or the Board"
"13092","of Directors of VC I."
"13093","Should VALIC at any time make any definite determination as to a change"
"13094","in any investment policy and notify the SUB-ADVISER in writing of such"
"13095","determination, the SUB-ADVISER shall be bound by such determination"
"13096","for the period, if any, specified in such notice or until similarly notified"
"13097","that such determination has been revoked, provided such determination"
"13098","will permit SUB-ADVISER to comply with the first paragraph of this"
"13099","Section."
"13100","The SUB-ADVISER will not hold money or investments on behalf of VC"
"13101","I. The money and investments will be held by the Custodian of VC I. The"
"13102","SUB-ADVISER will arrange for the transmission to the Custodian for VC"
"13103","I, on a daily basis, such confirmation, trade tickets and other documents as"
"13104","may be necessary to enable it to perform its administrative responsibilities"
"13105","with respect to the Covered Funds. The SUB-ADVISER further shall have"
"13106","the authority to instruct the Custodian of VC I (i) to pay cash for securities"
"13107","and other property delivered, or to be delivered, to the Custodian for VC I"
"13108","(ii) to deliver securities and other property against payment for VC I, and"
"13109","(iii) to transfer assets and funds to such brokerage accounts as the SUB-"
"13110","ADVISER may designate, all consistent with the powers, authorities and"
"13111","limitations set forth herein. The SUB-ADVISER shall not have the"
"13112","authority to cause the Custodian to deliver securities and other property"
"13113","except as expressly provided for in this Agreement."
"13114","The SUB-ADVISER shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an"
"13115","independent contractor and shall, unless otherwise provided or authorized,"
"13116","have no authority to act or represent VALIC or the Fund other than in"
"13117","furtherance of the SUB-ADVISERs duties and responsibilities as set forth
in this Agreement.

Except as otherwise agreed, or as otherwise provided herein, the SUB-
ADVISER shall bear the expense of discharging its responsibilities
hereunder and VALIC shall pay, or arrange for others to pay, all VALICs"
"13118","expenses, except that VALIC shall in all events pay the compensation"
"13119","described in Section 2 of the Agreement."
"13120","The SUB-ADVISER also represents and warrants that in furnishing"
"13121","services hereunder, the SUB-ADVISER will not consult with any other"
"13122","sub-adviser of the Covered Funds or other series of VC I, to the extent any"
"13123","other sub-advisers are engaged by VALIC, or any other sub-advisers to"
"13124","other investments companies that are under common control with VC I,"
"13125","concerning transactions of the Covered Funds in securities or other assets,"
"13126","other than for purposes of complying with the conditions of paragraphs (a)"
"13127","and (b) of Rule 12d3-1 under the Act."
"13128","The SUB-ADVISER shall not be responsible for taking any action on"
"13129","behalf of the Covered Funds in connection with class action lawsuits"
"13130","involving portfolio securities owned by the Covered Funds."
"13131","2.	Compensation of the SUB-ADVISER"
"13132","VALIC shall pay to the SUB-ADVISER, as compensation for the services"
"13133","rendered and expenses paid by the SUB-ADVISER, a monthly fee or fees"
"13134","based on each Covered Funds average daily net asset value computed for
each Covered Fund as provided for herein and in the fee schedule attached
hereto as Schedule A. Schedule A may be amended from time to time,
provided that amendments are made in conformity with applicable laws
and regulations and the Articles and Bylaws of VC I. Any change in
Schedule A pertaining to any new or existing Fund shall not be deemed to
affect the interest of any other Fund and shall not require the approval of
shareholders of any other Fund.

The average daily net asset value shall be determined by taking the mean
average of all of the determinations of net asset value, made in the manner
provided in VC Is Declaration, for each business day during a given"
"13135","calendar month. VALIC shall pay this fee to the SUB-ADVISER for each"
"13136","calendar month as soon as practicable after the end of that month, but in"
"13137","any event no later than ten (10) business days following the end of the"
"13138","month, and shall include or be supplemented by such supporting"
"13139","documentation as SUB-ADVISER shall reasonably request. Wire"
"13140","instructions are attached as Schedule B to this Agreement."
"13141","         If the SUB-ADVISER serves for less than a whole month, the foregoing"
"13142","compensation shall be prorated."
"13143","The payment of advisory fees related to the services of the SUB-"
"13144","ADVISER under this Agreement shall be the sole responsibility of VALIC"
"13145","and shall not be the responsibility of VC I."
"13146","3.	Scope of the SUB-ADVISERs Activities

VALIC understands that the SUB-ADVISER and its affiliates now act,
will continue to act and may act in the future as investment adviser to
fiduciary and other managed accounts and as investment adviser to other
investment companies, and VALIC has no objection to the SUB-
ADVISER so acting, provided that whenever a Covered Fund and one or
more other accounts or investment companies advised by the SUB-
ADVISER have available funds for investment, investments suitable and
appropriate for each will be allocated in accordance with the SUB-
ADVISERs allocation policy. The SUB-ADVISER similarly agrees to"
"13147","allocate opportunities to sell securities. VALIC recognizes that, in some"
"13148","cases, this procedure may limit the size of the position that may be"
"13149","acquired or sold for a Covered Fund. In addition, VALIC understands that"
"13150","the persons employed by the SUB-ADVISER to assist in the performance"
"13151","of the SUB-ADVISERs duties hereunder will not devote their full time to
such service and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit or
restrict the right of the SUB-ADVISER or any affiliate of the SUB-
ADVISER to engage in and devote time and attention to other business or
to render services of whatever kind or nature.

Except as otherwise required by the 1940 Act, any of the shareholders,
directors, officers and employees of VALIC may be a shareholder,
director, officer or employee of, or be otherwise interested in, the SUB-
ADVISER, and in any person controlling, controlled by or under common
control with the SUB-ADVISER; and the SUB-ADVISER, and any person
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the SUB-
ADVISER, may have an interest in VALIC.

The SUB-ADVISER shall not be liable to VALIC, VC I, or to any
shareholder in a Covered Fund, and VALIC shall indemnify the SUB-
ADVISER, for any act or omission in rendering services under this
Agreement, or for any losses sustained in connection with the matters to
which this agreement relates, so long as there has been no willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of
obligations or duties on the part of the SUB-ADVISER in performing its
duties under this Agreement.

VALIC shall perform quarterly and annual tax compliance tests and
promptly furnish reports of such tests to the SUB-ADVISER after each
quarter end to ensure that a Covered Fund is in compliance with
Subchapter M of the Code and Section 817(h) of the Code. VALIC shall
apprise the SUB-ADVISER promptly after each quarter end of any
potential non-compliance with the diversification requirements in such
Code provisions. If so advised, the SUB-ADVISER shall take prompt
action so that the Covered Funds complies with such Code diversification
provisions, as directed by VALIC.

5.	Term of Agreement

This Agreement shall become effective as to the Covered Funds set forth
on Schedule A on the date hereof and as to any other Fund on the date of
the Amendment to Schedule A adding such Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. Unless sooner terminated as provided herein, this Agreement
shall continue in effect for two years from its effective date. Thereafter,
this Agreement shall continue in effect, but with respect to any Covered
Fund, subject to the termination provisions and all other terms and
conditions hereof, only so long as such continuance is approved at least
annually by the vote of a majority of VC Is directors who are not parties"
"13152","to this Agreement or interested persons of any such parties, cast in person"
"13153","at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval, and by a"
"13154","vote of a majority of VC Is Board of Directors or a majority of a Covered
Funds outstanding voting securities."
"13155","This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event of its"
"13156","assignment as that term is defined in the 1940 Act, or in the event of the"
"13157","termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement between VALIC and"
"13158","VC I as it relates to any Covered Funds. The Agreement may be"
"13159","terminated as to any Covered Funds at any time, without the payment of"
"13160","any penalty, by vote of VC Is Board of Directors or by vote of a majority
of that Covered Funds outstanding voting securities on not more than 60"
"13161","days nor less than 30 days written notice to the SUB-ADVISER, or upon"

"13164","days nor less than 30 days written notice to the SUB-ADVISER, or upon"
"13165","such shorter notice as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties, without"
"13166","the payment of any penalty; or (ii) if the SUB-ADVISER becomes unable"
"13167","to discharge its duties and obligations under this Agreement. The SUB-"
"13168","ADVISER may terminate this Agreement at any time, or preclude its"
"13169","renewal without the payment of any penalty, on not more than 60 days nor
less than 30 days written notice to VALIC, or upon such shorter notice as"
"13170","may be mutually agreed upon by the parties."
"13171","6.	Other Matters"
"13172","The SUB-ADVISER may from time to time employ or associate with itself"
"13173","any person or persons believed to be particularly fit to assist in its"
"13174","performance of services under this Agreement, provided no such person"
"13175","serves or acts as an investment adviser separate from the SUB-ADVISER"
"13176","so as to require a new written contract pursuant to the 1940 Act. The"
"13177","compensation of any such persons will be paid by the SUB-ADVISER,"
"13178","and no obligation will be incurred by, or on behalf of, VALIC or VC I"
"13179","with respect to them."
"13180","The SUB-ADVISER agrees that all books and records which it maintains"
"13181","for the Covered Funds are the Covered Funds property. The SUB-
ADVISER also agrees upon request of VALIC or VC I, to promptly
surrender the books and records in accordance with the 1940 Act and rules
thereunder, provided that VALIC reimburses the SUB-ADVISER for its
reasonable expenses in making duplicate copies of such books and records
for SUB-ADVISERs files. The SUB-ADVISER further agrees to"
"13182","preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the"
"13183","records required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act."
"13184","VALIC has herewith furnished the SUB-ADVISER copies of VC Is
Prospectus, Statement of Additional Information, Articles and Bylaws,
investment objectives, policies and restrictions, and any applicable
procedures adopted by VC Is Board of Directors, as currently in effect"
"13185","and agrees during the continuance of this Agreement to furnish the SUB-"
"13186","ADVISER copies of any amendments or supplements thereto before or at"
"13187","the time the amendments or supplements become effective. Until VALIC"
"13188","delivers any amendments or supplements to the SUB-ADVISER, the SUB-"
"13189","ADVISER shall be fully protected in relying on the documents previously"
"13190","furnished to it. VALIC will inform SUB-ADVISER of any anticipated"
"13191","changes to the investment objectives and/or restrictions of the Covered"
"13192","Funds as soon as reasonably practicable."
"13193","The SUB-ADVISER is authorized to honor and act on any notice,"
"13194","instruction or confirmation given by VALIC on behalf of the Covered"
"13195","Funds in writing signed or sent by any of the persons whose names,"
"13196","addresses and specimen signatures will be provided by VALIC from time"
"13197","to time. The SUB-ADVISER shall not be liable for so acting in good faith"
"13198","upon such instructions, confirmation or authority, notwithstanding that it"
"13199","shall subsequently be shown that the same was not given or signed or sent"
"13200","by an authorized person."
"13201","VALIC agrees to furnish the SUB-ADVISER at its principal office prior"
"13202","to use thereof, copies of all prospectuses, proxy statements, reports to"
"13203","shareholders, sales literature, or other material prepared for distribution to"
"13204","shareholders of the Covered Funds or the public that refer in any way to"
"13205","the SUB-ADVISER, and not to use such material if the SUB-ADVISER"
"13206","reasonably objects in writing within ten (10) business days (or such other"
"13207","time as may be mutually agreed) after receipt thereof. In the event of"
"13208","termination of this agreement, VALIC will continue to furnish to the SUB-"
"13209","ADVISER copies of any of the above-mentioned materials that refer in"
"13210","any way to the SUB-ADVISER. VALIC shall furnish or otherwise make"
"13211","available to the SUB-ADVISER such other information relating to the"
"13212","business affairs of VALIC and the Covered Funds as the SUB-ADVISER"
"13213","at any time, or from time to time, may reasonably request in order to"
"13214","discharge obligations hereunder."
"13215","VALIC agrees to indemnify the SUB-ADVISER for losses, costs, fees,"
"13216","expenses and claims which arise directly or indirectly (i) as a result of a"
"13217","failure by VALIC to provide the services or furnish materials required"
"13218","under the terms of this Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement, or (ii) as the"
"13219","result of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a"
"13220","material fact required to be stated or necessary to make the statements, in"
"13221","light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading in"
"13222","any registration statements, proxy materials, reports, advertisements, sales"
"13223","literature, or other materials pertaining to the Covered Funds, except"
"13224","insofar as any such statement or omission was specifically made in"
"13225","reliance on written information provided by the SUB-ADVISER to"
"13226","VALIC specifically for inclusion in such documents."
"13227","The SUB-ADVISER agrees to indemnify VALIC for losses and claims"
"13228","which arise (i) as a result of a failure by SUB-ADVISER to provide the"
"13229","services or furnish the materials required under the terms of this"
"13230","Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement, to the extent of and as a result of the"
"13231","willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of"
"13232","obligations or duties by the SUB-ADVISER, any of SUB-ADVISERs
employees or representatives; or (ii) as the result of any untrue statement
of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact required to be
stated or necessary to make the statements, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading in any registration

"13322","Funds set forth on the attached Schedule A, and"
"13323","any other Funds as may be added or deleted by"

"13325","(d)	The SUB-ADVISER is engaged principally in the"
"13326","business of rendering investment advisory"
"13327","services and is registered as an investment adviser"
"13328","under the Advisers Act."
"13329","(e)	VALIC desires to enter into a definitive"

"13343","        VALIC and the SUB-ADVISER agree as follows:"
"13344","1.	Services Rendered and Expenses Paid by the SUB-ADVISER"
"13345","The SUB-ADVISER, subject to the control, direction, and"
"13346","supervision of VALIC and VC I's Board of Directors and in material"
"13347","conformity with the 1940 Act, all applicable laws and regulations"
"13348","thereunder, all other applicable federal and state securities and tax"
"13349","laws and regulations, including section 817(h) and Subchapter M of"
"13350","the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), VC"
"13351","I's Articles, Bylaws, registration statements, prospectus and stated"
"13352","investment objectives, policies and restrictions and any applicable"
"13353","procedures adopted by VC I's Board of Directors and provided to"
"13354","the SUB-ADVISER in writing shall:"
"13355","(a)	manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets of the"
"13356","Covered Funds, including, for example, the evaluation of"
"13357","pertinent economic, statistical, financial, and other data, the"
"13358","determination of the industries and companies to be"
"13359","represented in each Covered Fund's portfolio, and the"
"13360","formulation and implementation of investment programs.;"
"13361","(b)	maintain a trading desk and place orders for the purchase"
"13362","and sale of portfolio investments (including futures"
"13363","contracts and options thereon) for each Covered Fund's"
"13364","account with brokers or dealers (including futures"
"13365","commission merchants) selected by the SUB-ADVISER, or"
"13366","arrange for any other entity to provide a trading desk and to"
"13367","place orders with brokers and dealers (including futures"
"13368","commission merchants) selected by the SUB-ADVISER,"
"13369","subject to the SUB-ADVISER's control, direction, and"
"13370","supervision, which brokers or dealers may include brokers"
"13371","or dealers (including futures commission merchants)"
"13372","affiliated with the SUB-ADVISER, subject to applicable"
"13373","law."
"13374","The SUB-ADVISER will assist the Covered Funds and their agents"
"13375","in determining whether prices obtained for valuation purposes"
"13376","accurately reflect the prices on the SUB-ADVISER's portfolio"
"13377","records relating to the assets of the Covered Funds for which the"
"13378","SUB-ADVISER has responsibility on a quarterly basis (unless"
"13379","otherwise agreed upon by the parties hereto) and at such other times"
"13380","as VALIC shall reasonably request."
"13381","In performing the services described in paragraph (b) above, the"
"13382","SUB-ADVISER shall use its best efforts to obtain for the Covered"
"13383","Funds the best execution of portfolio transactions. The SUB-"
"13384","ADVISER is responsible for decisions to buy and sell securities for"
"13385","the Covered Funds, broker-dealer selection, and negotiation of"
"13386","brokerage commission rates. Subject to approval by VC I's Board of"
"13387","Directors of appropriate policies and procedures, the SUB-"
"13388","ADVISER may cause the Covered Funds to pay to a broker a"
"13389","commission, for effecting a portfolio transaction, in excess of the"
"13390","commission another broker would have charged for effecting the"
"13391","same transaction, if the first broker provided brokerage and/or"
"13392","research services to the SUB-ADVISER. The SUB-ADVISER shall"
"13393","not be deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to have breached any"
"13394","duty created by this Agreement, or otherwise, solely by reason of"
"13395","acting in accordance with such authorization. Notwithstanding the"
"13396","above, nothing shall require the SUB-ADVISER to use a broker that"
"13397","provides research services or to use a particular broker"
"13398","recommended by VALIC."
"13399","The SUB-ADVISER may aggregate, or, if appropriate, cross sales"
"13400","and purchase orders of securities held by the Covered Funds with"
"13401","similar orders being made simultaneously for other accounts"
"13402","managed by the SUB-ADVISER or with accounts of the affiliates of"
"13403","the SUB-ADVISER, if in the SUB-ADVISER's reasonable judgment"
"13404","such aggregation shall result in an overall economic benefit to the"
"13405","Covered Funds considering the advantageous selling or purchase"
"13406","price, brokerage commission and other expenses. In accounting for"
"13407","such aggregated order price, commission and other expenses shall be"
"13408","averaged on a per bond or share basis daily. If any trades are"
"13409","crossed, SUB-ADVISER may charge the Covered Funds for"
"13410","reasonable expenses incurred in such cross-trades, excluding"
"13411","brokerage commissions, fees (other than customary transfer fees), or"
"13412","other remuneration paid in connection with the transaction. A"
"13413","transaction fee charged by a brokerage or a custodial bank will be"
"13414","considered a customary transfer fee for purposes of this Agreement."
"13415","VALIC acknowledges that the determination of such economic"
"13416","benefit to the Covered Funds by the SUB-ADVISER is subjective"
"13417","and represents the SUB-ADVISER's evaluation that the Covered"
"13418","Funds are benefited by relatively better purchase or sales prices,"
"13419","lower commission expenses and beneficial timing of transactions or a"
"13420","combination of these and other factors."
"13421","VALIC authorizes and empowers the SUB-ADVISER to direct the"
"13422","Covered Funds' Custodian to open and maintain brokerage accounts"
"13423","for securities and other property, including financial and commodity"
"13424","futures and commodities and options thereon (all such accounts"
"13425","hereinafter called brokerage accounts) for and in the name of the"
"13426","Covered Funds and to execute for each Covered Fund as its agent"
"13427","and attorney-in-fact standard customer agreements with such broker"
"13428","or brokers as the SUB-ADVISER shall select as provided above."
"13429","With respect to brokerage accounts for financial and commodity"
"13430","futures and commodities and options thereon, the SUB-ADVISER"
"13431","shall select such brokers, as approved by VALIC, prior to the"
"13432","establishment of such brokerage account. The SUB-ADVISER may,"
"13433","using such of the securities and other property in the Covered Funds"
"13434","as the SUB-ADVISER deems necessary or desirable, direct the"
"13435","Covered Funds' Custodian to deposit for the Covered Funds original"
"13436","and maintenance brokerage and margin deposits and otherwise direct"
"13437","payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property"
"13438","into such brokerage accounts and to such brokers as the SUB-"
"13439","ADVISER deems desirable or appropriate."
"13440","The SUB-ADVISER shall maintain records adequately"
"13441","demonstrating compliance with its obligations under this Agreement"
"13442","and report quarterly to VALIC and VC I's Board of Directors"
"13443","regarding the performance of its services under this Agreement. The"
"13444","SUB-ADVISER will make available to VALIC and VC I promptly"
"13445","upon their reasonable written request all of the Covered Funds'"
"13446","investment records and ledgers to assist VALIC and VC I in"
"13447","compliance with respect to each Covered Fund's securities"
"13448","transactions as required by the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act, as"
"13449","well as other applicable laws. The SUB-ADVISER will furnish VC"
"13450","I's Board of Directors such quarterly and special reports as VALIC"
"13451","and VC I's Board of Directors may reasonably request, in a format to"
"13452","be agreed upon by VALIC and the SUB-ADVISER. The SUB-"
"13453","ADVISER will furnish to regulatory authorities any information or"
"13454","reports in connection with such services which may be requested by"
"13455","such regulatory authorities in order to ascertain whether the"
"13456","operations of the Covered Funds are being conducted in a manner"
"13457","consistent with applicable laws and regulations."
"13458","The SUB-ADVISER will not disclose or use any records or"
"13459","information obtained pursuant to this Agreement in any manner"
"13460","whatsoever except as expressly authorized in this Agreement, and"
"13461","will keep confidential any non-public information obtained directly"
"13462","as a result of this service relationship, and the SUB-ADVISER shall"
"13463","disclose such non-public information only if VALIC or the Board of"
"13464","Directors of VC I has authorized such disclosure, or if such"
"13465","information is or hereafter otherwise is known by the SUB-"
"13466","ADVISER or has been disclosed, directly or indirectly, by VALIC or"
"13467","the Fund to others becomes ascertainable from public or published"
"13468","information or trade sources, or if such disclosure is expressly"
"13469","required or requested by applicable federal or state regulatory"
"13470","authorities, or to the extent such disclosure is reasonably required by"
"13471","auditors or attorneys of the SUB-ADVISER in connection with the"
"13472","performance of their professional services. Notwithstanding the"
"13473","foregoing, the SUB-ADVISER may disclose the total return earned"
"13474","by the Covered Funds and may include such total return in the"
"13475","calculation of composite performance information without prior"
"13476","approval by VALIC or the Board of Directors of VC I."
"13477","Should VALIC at any time make any definite determination as to a"
"13478","change in any investment policy and notify the SUB-ADVISER in"
"13479","writing of such determination, the SUB-ADVISER shall be bound by"
"13480","such determination for the period, if any, specified in such notice or"
"13481","until similarly notified that such determination has been revoked,"
"13482","provided such determination will permit SUB-ADVISER to comply"
"13483","with the first paragraph of this Section."
"13484","The SUB-ADVISER will not hold money or investments on behalf"
"13485","of VC I. The money and investments will be held by the Custodian"
"13486","of VC I. The SUB-ADVISER will arrange for the transmission to the"
"13487","Custodian for VC I, on a daily basis, such confirmation, trade tickets"
"13488","and other documents as may be necessary to enable it to perform its"
"13489","administrative responsibilities with respect to the Covered Funds."
"13490","The SUB-ADVISER further shall have the authority to instruct the"
"13491","Custodian of VC I (i) to pay cash for securities and other property"
"13492","delivered, or to be delivered, to the Custodian for VC I (ii) to deliver"
"13493","securities and other property against payment for VC I, and (iii) to"
"13494","transfer assets and funds to such brokerage accounts as the SUB-"
"13495","ADVISER may designate, all consistent with the powers, authorities"
"13496","and limitations set forth herein. The SUB-ADVISER shall not have"
"13497","the authority to cause the Custodian to deliver securities and other"
"13498","property except as expressly provided for in this Agreement."
"13499","The SUB-ADVISER shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an"
"13500","independent contractor and shall, unless otherwise provided or"
"13501","authorized, have no authority to act or represent VALIC or the Fund"
"13502","other than in furtherance of the SUB-ADVISER's duties and"
"13503","responsibilities as set forth in this Agreement."
"13504","Except as otherwise agreed, or as otherwise provided herein, the"
"13505","SUB-ADVISER shall bear the expense of discharging its"
"13506","responsibilities hereunder and VALIC shall pay, or arrange for"
"13507","others to pay, all VALIC's expenses, except that VALIC shall in all"
"13508","events pay the compensation described in Section 2 of the"
"13509","Agreement."
"13510","The SUB-ADVISER also represents and warrants that in furnishing"
"13511","services hereunder, the SUB-ADVISER will not consult with any"
"13512","other sub-adviser of the Covered Funds or other series of VC I, to"
"13513","the extent any other sub-advisers are engaged by VALIC, or any"
"13514","other sub-advisers to other investments companies that are under"
"13515","common control with VC I, concerning transactions of the Covered"
"13516","Funds in securities or other assets, other than for purposes of"
"13517","complying with the conditions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of Rule"
"13518","12d3-1 under the Act."
"13519","The SUB-ADVISER shall not be responsible for taking any action"
"13520","on behalf of the Covered Funds in connection with class action"
"13521","lawsuits involving portfolio securities owned by the Covered Funds."
"13522","2.	Compensation of the SUB-ADVISER"
"13523","VALIC shall pay to the SUB-ADVISER, as compensation for the"
"13524","services rendered and expenses paid by the SUB-ADVISER, a"
"13525","monthly fee or fees based on each Covered Fund's average daily net"
"13526","asset value computed for each Covered Fund as provided for herein"
"13527","and in the fee schedule attached hereto as Schedule A. Schedule A"
"13528","may be amended from time to time, provided that amendments are"
"13529","made in conformity with applicable laws and regulations and the"
"13530","Articles and Bylaws of VC I. Any change in Schedule A pertaining"
"13531","to any new or existing Fund shall not be deemed to affect the interest"
"13532","of any other Fund and shall not require the approval of shareholders"
"13533","of any other Fund."
"13534","The average daily net asset value shall be determined by taking the"
"13535","mean average of all of the determinations of net asset value, made in"
"13536","the manner provided in VC I's Declaration, for each business day"
"13537","during a given calendar month. VALIC shall pay this fee to the SUB-"
"13538","ADVISER for each calendar month as soon as practicable after the"
"13539","end of that month, but in any event no later than ten (10) business"
"13540","days following the end of the month, and shall include or be"
"13541","supplemented by such supporting documentation as SUB-ADVISER"
"13542","shall reasonably request. Wire instructions are attached as Schedule"
"13543","B to this Agreement."
"13544","       If the SUB-ADVISER serves for less than a whole month, the"
"13545","foregoing compensation shall be prorated."
"13546","The payment of advisory fees related to the services of the SUB-"
"13547","ADVISER under this Agreement shall be the sole responsibility of"
"13548","VALIC and shall not be the responsibility of VC I."
"13549","3.	Scope of the SUB-ADVISER's Activities"
"13550","VALIC understands that the SUB-ADVISER and its affiliates now"
"13551","act, will continue to act and may act in the future as investment"
"13552","adviser to fiduciary and other managed accounts and as investment"
"13553","adviser to other investment companies, and VALIC has no objection"
"13554","to the SUB-ADVISER so acting, provided that whenever a Covered"
"13555","Fund and one or more other accounts or investment companies"
"13556","advised by the SUB-ADVISER have available funds for investment,"
"13557","investments suitable and appropriate for each will be allocated in"
"13558","accordance with the SUB-ADVISER's allocation policy. The SUB-"
"13559","ADVISER similarly agrees to allocate opportunities to sell"
"13560","securities. VALIC recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure may"
"13561","limit the size of the position that may be acquired or sold for a"
"13562","Covered Fund. In addition, VALIC understands that the persons"
"13563","employed by the SUB-ADVISER to assist in the performance of the"
"13564","SUB-ADVISER's duties hereunder will not devote their full time to"
"13565","such service and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit or"
"13566","restrict the right of the SUB-ADVISER or any affiliate of the SUB-"
"13567","ADVISER to engage in and devote time and attention to other"

"13943","        VALIC and the SUB-ADVISER agree as follows:"
"13944","1.	Services Rendered and Expenses Paid by the SUB-ADVISER"
"13945","The SUB-ADVISER, subject to the control, direction, and"
"13946","supervision of VALIC and VC I's Board of Directors and in material"
"13947","conformity with the 1940 Act, all applicable laws and regulations"
"13948","thereunder, all other applicable federal and state securities and tax"
"13949","laws and regulations, including section 817(h) and Subchapter M of"
"13950","the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), VC"
"13951","I's Articles, Bylaws, registration statements, prospectus and stated"
"13952","investment objectives, policies and restrictions and any applicable"
"13953","procedures adopted by VC I's Board of Directors and provided to"
"13954","the SUB-ADVISER in writing shall:"
"13955","(a)	manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets of the"
"13956","Covered Funds, including, for example, the evaluation of"
"13957","pertinent economic, statistical, financial, and other data, the"
"13958","determination of the industries and companies to be"
"13959","represented in each Covered Fund's portfolio, and the"
"13960","formulation and implementation of investment programs;"
"13961","(b)	maintain a trading desk and place orders for the purchase"
"13962","and sale of portfolio investments (including futures"
"13963","contracts and options thereon) for each Covered Fund's"
"13964","account with brokers or dealers (including futures"
"13965","commission merchants) selected by the SUB-ADVISER, or"
"13966","arrange for any other entity to provide a trading desk and to"
"13967","place orders with brokers and dealers (including futures"
"13968","commission merchants) selected by the SUB-ADVISER,"
"13969","subject to the SUB-ADVISER's control, direction, and"

"13971","or dealers (including futures commission merchants)"
"13972","affiliated with the SUB-ADVISER, subject to applicable"
"13973","law."
"13974","The SUB-ADVISER will assist the Covered Funds and their agents"
"13975","in determining whether prices obtained for valuation purposes"
"13976","accurately reflect the prices on the SUB-ADVISER's portfolio"
"13977","records relating to the assets of the Covered Funds for which the"
"13978","SUB-ADVISER has responsibility on a quarterly basis (unless"
"13979","otherwise agreed upon by the parties hereto) and at such other times"
"13980","as VALIC shall reasonably request."
"13981","In performing the services described in paragraph (b) above, the"
"13982","SUB-ADVISER shall use its best efforts to obtain for the Covered"
"13983","Funds the best execution of portfolio transactions. The SUB-"
"13984","ADVISER is responsible for decisions to buy and sell securities for"
"13985","the Covered Funds, broker-dealer selection, and negotiation of"
"13986","brokerage commission rates. Subject to approval by VC I's Board of"
"13987","Directors of appropriate policies and procedures, the SUB-"
"13988","ADVISER may cause the Covered Funds to pay to a broker a"
"13989","commission, for effecting a portfolio transaction, in excess of the"
"13990","commission another broker would have charged for effecting the"
"13991","same transaction, if the first broker provided brokerage and/or"
"13992","research services to the SUB-ADVISER. The SUB-ADVISER shall"
"13993","not be deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to have breached any"
"13994","duty created by this Agreement, or otherwise, solely by reason of"
"13995","acting in accordance with such authorization. Notwithstanding the"
"13996","above, nothing shall require the SUB-ADVISER to use a broker that"
"13997","provides research services or to use a particular broker"
"13998","recommended by VALIC."
"13999","The SUB-ADVISER may aggregate, or, if appropriate, cross sales"
"14000","and purchase orders of securities held by the Covered Funds with"
"14001","similar orders being made simultaneously for other accounts"
"14002","managed by the SUB-ADVISER or with accounts of the affiliates of"
"14003","the SUB-ADVISER, if in the SUB-ADVISER's reasonable judgment"
"14004","such aggregation shall result in an overall economic benefit to the"
"14005","Covered Funds considering the advantageous selling or purchase"
"14006","price, brokerage commission and other expenses. In accounting for"
"14007","such aggregated order price, commission and other expenses shall be"
"14008","averaged on a per bond or share basis daily. If any trades are"
"14009","crossed, SUB-ADVISER may charge the Covered Funds for"
"14010","reasonable expenses incurred in such cross-trades, excluding"
"14011","brokerage commissions, fees (other than customary transfer fees), or"
"14012","other remuneration paid in connection with the transaction. A"
"14013","transaction fee charged by a brokerage or a custodial bank will be"
"14014","considered a customary transfer fee for purposes of this Agreement."
"14015","VALIC acknowledges that the determination of such economic"
"14016","benefit to the Covered Funds by the SUB-ADVISER is subjective"
"14017","and represents the SUB-ADVISER's evaluation that the Covered"
"14018","Funds are benefited by relatively better purchase or sales prices,"
"14019","lower commission expenses and beneficial timing of transactions or a"
"14020","combination of these and other factors."
"14021","VALIC authorizes and empowers the SUB-ADVISER to direct the"
"14022","Covered Funds' Custodian to open and maintain brokerage accounts"
"14023","for securities and other property, including financial and commodity"
"14024","futures and commodities and options thereon (all such accounts"
"14025","hereinafter called brokerage accounts) for and in the name of the"
"14026","Covered Funds and to execute for each Covered Fund as its agent"
"14027","and attorney-in-fact standard customer agreements with such broker"
"14028","or brokers as the SUB-ADVISER shall select as provided above."
"14029","With respect to brokerage accounts for financial and commodity"
"14030","futures and commodities and options thereon, the SUB-ADVISER"
"14031","shall select such brokers, as approved by VALIC, prior to the"
"14032","establishment of such brokerage account. The SUB-ADVISER may,"
"14033","using such of the securities and other property in the Covered Funds"
"14034","as the SUB-ADVISER deems necessary or desirable, direct the"
"14035","Covered Funds' Custodian to deposit for the Covered Funds original"
"14036","and maintenance brokerage and margin deposits and otherwise direct"
"14037","payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property"
"14038","into such brokerage accounts and to such brokers as the SUB-"
"14039","ADVISER deems desirable or appropriate."
"14040","The SUB-ADVISER shall maintain records adequately"
"14041","demonstrating compliance with its obligations under this Agreement"
"14042","and report quarterly to VALIC and VC I's Board of Directors"
"14043","regarding the performance of its services under this Agreement. The"
"14044","SUB-ADVISER will make available to VALIC and VC I promptly"
"14045","upon their reasonable written request all of the Covered Funds'"
"14046","investment records and ledgers to assist VALIC and VC I in"
"14047","compliance with respect to each Covered Fund's securities"
"14048","transactions as required by the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act, as"
"14049","well as other applicable laws. The SUB-ADVISER will furnish VC"
"14050","I's Board of Directors such quarterly and special reports as VALIC"
"14051","and VC I's Board of Directors may reasonably request, in a format to"
"14052","be agreed upon by VALIC and the SUB-ADVISER. The SUB-"
"14053","ADVISER will furnish to regulatory authorities any information or"
"14054","reports in connection with such services which may be requested by"
"14055","such regulatory authorities in order to ascertain whether the"
"14056","operations of the Covered Funds are being conducted in a manner"
"14057","consistent with applicable laws and regulations."
"14058","The SUB-ADVISER will not disclose or use any records or"
"14059","information obtained pursuant to this Agreement in any manner"
"14060","whatsoever except as expressly authorized in this Agreement, and"
"14061","will keep confidential any non-public information obtained directly"
"14062","as a result of this service relationship, and the SUB-ADVISER shall"

"14072","performance of their professional services. Notwithstanding the"
"14073","foregoing, the SUB-ADVISER may disclose the total return earned"
"14074","by the Covered Funds and may include such total return in the"
"14075","calculation of composite performance information without prior"
"14076","approval by VALIC or the Board of Directors of VC I."
"14077","Should VALIC at any time make any definite determination as to a"
"14078","change in any investment policy and notify the SUB-ADVISER in"
"14079","writing of such determination, the SUB-ADVISER shall be bound by"
"14080","such determination for the period, if any, specified in such notice or"
"14081","until similarly notified that such determination has been revoked,"
"14082","provided such determination will permit SUB-ADVISER to comply"
"14083","with the first paragraph of this Section."
"14084","The SUB-ADVISER will not hold money or investments on behalf"
"14085","of VC I. The money and investments will be held by the Custodian"
"14086","of VC I. The SUB-ADVISER will arrange for the transmission to the"

"14088","and other documents as may be necessary to enable it to perform its"
"14089","administrative responsibilities with respect to the Covered Funds."
"14090","The SUB-ADVISER further shall have the authority to instruct the"

"14097","the authority to cause the Custodian to deliver securities and other"
"14098","property except as expressly provided for in this Agreement."
"14099","The SUB-ADVISER shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an"
"14100","independent contractor and shall, unless otherwise provided or"
"14101","authorized, have no authority to act or represent VALIC or the Fund"
"14102","other than in furtherance of the SUB-ADVISER's duties and"

"14118","12d3-1 under the Act."
"14119","The SUB-ADVISER shall not be responsible for taking any action"
"14120","on behalf of the Covered Funds in connection with class action"
"14121","lawsuits involving portfolio securities owned by the Covered Funds."
"14122","2.	Compensation of the SUB-ADVISER"
"14123","VALIC shall pay to the SUB-ADVISER, as compensation for the"
"14124","services rendered and expenses paid by the SUB-ADVISER, a"
"14125","monthly fee or fees based on each Covered Fund's average daily net"
"14126","asset value computed for each Covered Fund as provided for herein"
"14127","and in the fee schedule attached hereto as Schedule A. Schedule A"
"14128","may be amended from time to time, provided that amendments are"
"14129","made in conformity with applicable laws and regulations and the"
"14130","Articles and Bylaws of VC I. Any change in Schedule A pertaining"
"14131","to any new or existing Fund shall not be deemed to affect the interest"
"14132","of any other Fund and shall not require the approval of shareholders"
"14133","of any other Fund."
"14134","The average daily net asset value shall be determined by taking the"
"14135","mean average of all of the determinations of net asset value, made in"
"14136","the manner provided in VC I's Declaration, for each business day"
"14137","during a given calendar month. VALIC shall pay this fee to the SUB-"
"14138","ADVISER for each calendar month as soon as practicable after the"
"14139","end of that month, but in any event no later than ten (10) business"
"14140","days following the end of the month, and shall include or be"
"14141","supplemented by such supporting documentation as SUB-ADVISER"
"14142","shall reasonably request. Wire instructions are attached as Schedule"
"14143","B to this Agreement."
"14144","       If the SUB-ADVISER serves for less than a whole month, the"
"14145","foregoing compensation shall be prorated."
"14146","The payment of advisory fees related to the services of the SUB-"
"14147","ADVISER under this Agreement shall be the sole responsibility of"
"14148","VALIC and shall not be the responsibility of VC I."
"14149","3.	Scope of the SUB-ADVISER's Activities"
"14150","VALIC understands that the SUB-ADVISER and its affiliates now"
"14151","act, will continue to act and may act in the future as investment"
"14152","adviser to fiduciary and other managed accounts and as investment"
"14153","adviser to other investment companies, and VALIC has no objection"
"14154","to the SUB-ADVISER so acting, provided that whenever a Covered"
"14155","Fund and one or more other accounts or investment companies"
"14156","advised by the SUB-ADVISER have available funds for investment,"
"14157","investments suitable and appropriate for each will be allocated in"
"14158","accordance with the SUB-ADVISER's allocation policy. The SUB-"
"14159","ADVISER similarly agrees to allocate opportunities to sell"
"14160","securities. VALIC recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure may"
"14161","limit the size of the position that may be acquired or sold for a"
"14162","Covered Fund. In addition, VALIC understands that the persons"
"14163","employed by the SUB-ADVISER to assist in the performance of the"
"14164","SUB-ADVISER's duties hereunder will not devote their full time to"
"14165","such service and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit or"
"14166","restrict the right of the SUB-ADVISER or any affiliate of the SUB-"
"14167","ADVISER to engage in and devote time and attention to other"
"14168","business or to render services of whatever kind or nature."
"14169","Except as otherwise required by the 1940 Act, any of the"
"14170","shareholders, directors, officers and employees of VALIC may be a"
"14171","shareholder, director, officer or employee of, or be otherwise"
"14172","interested in, the SUB-ADVISER, and in any person controlling,"
"14173","controlled by or under common control with the SUB-ADVISER;"
"14174","and the SUB-ADVISER, and any person controlling, controlled by"
"14175","or under common control with the SUB-ADVISER, may have an"
"14176","interest in VALIC."
"14177","The SUB-ADVISER shall not be liable to VALIC, VC I, or to any"
"14178","shareholder in a Covered Fund, and VALIC shall indemnify the"
"14179","SUB-ADVISER, for any act or omission in rendering services under"
"14180","this Agreement, or for any losses sustained in connection with the"
"14181","matters to which this agreement relates, so long as there has been no"
"14182","willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard"
"14183","of obligations or duties on the part of the SUB-ADVISER in"
"14184","performing its duties under this Agreement."
"14185","VALIC shall perform quarterly and annual tax compliance tests and"
"14186","promptly furnish reports of such tests to the SUB-ADVISER after"
"14187","each quarter end to ensure that a Covered Fund is in compliance with"
"14188","Subchapter M of the Code and Section 817(h) of the Code. VALIC"
"14189","shall apprise the SUB-ADVISER promptly after each quarter end of"
"14190","any potential non-compliance with the diversification requirements"
"14191","in such Code provisions. If so advised, the SUB-ADVISER shall"
"14192","take prompt action so that the Covered Funds complies with such"
"14193","Code diversification provisions, as directed by VALIC."
"14194","4.	Representations of the SUB-ADVISER and VALIC"

"14212","Act or otherwise."
"14213","(b)	The SUB-ADVISER has adopted a written code of ethics"

"14250","assignment as that term is defined in the 1940 Act, or in the event of"
"14251","the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement between"

"14271","itself any person, or persons, believed to be particularly fit to assist"
"14272","in its performance of services under this Agreement, provided no"
"14273","such person serves or acts as an investment adviser separate from the"
"14274","SUB-ADVISER so as to require a new written contract pursuant to"

"14276","the SUB-ADVISER, and no obligation will be incurred by, or on"

"14278","The SUB-ADVISER agrees that all books and records which it"

"14282","1940 Act and rules thereunder, provided that VALIC reimburses the"
"14283","SUB-ADVISER for its reasonable expenses in making duplicate"

"14527","                    Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"14528","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of VALIC Company I:"
"14529","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of VALIC"
"14530","Company I, formerly known as AIG Retirement Company I (the Series) as of"
"14531","and for the year ended May 31, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the"
"14532","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"14533","the Series' internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"14534","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"14535","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"14536","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"14537","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Series' internal control over"
"14538","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"14539","effectiveness of the Series' internal control over financial reporting."
"14540","The management of the Series is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"14541","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"14542","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"14543","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control"
"14544","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"14545","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"14546","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"14547","accounting principles.A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"14548","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"14549","records that,in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"14550","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"14551","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"14552","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"14553","principles,and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"14554","in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the fund; and"
"14555","(3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"14556","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could"
"14557","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"14558","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"14559","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"14560","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"14561","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"14562","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"14563","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"14564","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"14565","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"14566","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"14567","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,such"
"14568","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"14569","Series' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"14570","on a timely basis."
"14571","Our consideration of the Series' internal control over financial reporting"
"14572","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"14573","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"14574","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"14575","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"14576","we noted no deficiencies in the Series' internal control over financial"
"14577","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"14578","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of May 31, 2010."
