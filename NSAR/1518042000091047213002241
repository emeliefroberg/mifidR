"454","PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"455","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"456","Two Oaks Diversified Growth and Income Fund"
"457","(Northern Lights Fund Trust II)"
"458","We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and"
"459","liabilities, including the schedule of investments of Two"
"460","Oaks Diversified Growth and Income Fund (the Fund), a"
"461","series of the Northern Lights Fund Trust II, as of March"
"462","31, 2013, and the related statement of operations for the"
"463","year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for"
"464","each of the two years in the period then ended, and the"
"465","financial highlights for each of the five periods in the"
"466","period then ended.  These financial statements and"
"467","financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's"
"468","management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on"
"469","these financial statements and financial highlights based on"
"470","our audits."
"471","We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards"
"472","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"473","(United States).  Those standards require that we plan and"
"474","perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about"
"475","whether the financial statements and financial highlights"
"476","are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes"
"477","examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the"
"478","amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our"
"479","procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of"
"480","March 31, 2013, by correspondence with the custodian."
"481","An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles"
"482","used and significant estimates made by management, as"
"483","well as evaluating the overall financial statement"
"484","presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a"
"485","reasonable basis for our opinion."
"486","In our opinion, the financial statements and financial"
"487","highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material"
"488","respects, the financial position of Two Oaks Diversified"
"489","Growth and Income Fund as of March 31, 2013, the results"
"490","of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its"
"491","net assets for each of the two years in the period then"
"492","ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five"
"493","periods in the period then ended, in conformity with"
"494","accounting principles generally accepted in the United"
"495","States of America."
