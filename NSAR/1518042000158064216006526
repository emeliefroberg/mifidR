"496","<TEXT>"
"497","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED"
"498","PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"499","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"500","Northern Lights Fund Trust II"
"501","Omaha, Nebraska 68130"
"502","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"503","statements of Witherspoon Managed Futures Strategy"
"504","Fund (the Funds), a series of Northern Lights Fund"
"505","Trust II as of and for the year ended November 30, 2015,"
"506","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"507","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"508","considered its internal control over financial reporting,"
"509","including control activities for safeguarding securities,"
"510","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"511","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"512","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"513","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"514","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"515","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"516","opinion."
"517","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"518","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"519","over financial reporting.   In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"520","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"521","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"522","A company's internal control over financial reporting is"
"523","a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"524","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"525","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"526","in accordance with accounting principles generally"
"527","accepted in the United States of America.   Such internal"
"528","control includes policies and procedures that provide"
"529","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"530","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"531","of a company's assets that could have a material effect"
"532","on the financial statements."
"533","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over"
"534","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"535","misstatements.   Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"536","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"537","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"538","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"539","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"540","A control deficiency exists when the design or operation"
"541","of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"542","in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"543","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
"544","basis.   A significant deficiency is a control deficiency,"
"545","or combination of control deficiencies, that adversely"
"546","affects the company's ability to initiate, authorize,"
"547","record, process or report financial data reliably in"
"548","accordance with accounting principles generally"
"549","accepted in the United States of America such that there"
"550","is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of"
"551","the company's annual or interim financial statements"
"552","that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented"
"553","or detected. A material weakness is a significant"
"554","deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies,"
"555","that results in more than a remote likelihood that a"
"556","material misstatement of the annual or interim financial"
"557","statements will not be prevented or detected."
"558","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"559","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"560","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"561","all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"562","significant deficiencies or material weaknesses under"
"563","standards established by the Public Company"
"564","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).   However,"
"565","we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control"
"566","over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"567","controls for safeguarding securities, which we consider"
"568","to be material weaknesses, as defined above, as of"
"569","November 30, 2015."
"570","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"571","of management, Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"572","the Northern Lights Fund Trust II and the Securities and"
"573","Exchange Commission, and is not intended to be and"
"574","should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"575","parties."
