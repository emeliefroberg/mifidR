"629","<DESCRIPTION>AUDITOR'S LETTER"
"630","<TEXT>"
"631","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"632","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders"
"633","of Cohen & Steers Preferred Securities and Income Fund, Inc."
"634","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Cohen &"
"635","Steers Preferred Securities and Income Fund, Inc. (the Fund) as of and for"
"636","the year ended December  31, 2011, in accordance with the standards of the"
"637","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"638","Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"639","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"640","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"641","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"642","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"643","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"644","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"645","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"646","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"647","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"648","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal"
"649","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"650","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"651","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"652","accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"653","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"654","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"655","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"656","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"657","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"658","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"659","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"660","directors of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"661","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"662","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"663","statements."
"664","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"665","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"666","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"667","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"668","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"669","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"670","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"671","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"672","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"673","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"674","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"675","the Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"676","detected on a timely basis."
"677","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"678","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"679","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"680","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"681","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"682","no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and"
"683","its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"684","consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of December 31, 2011."
"685","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"686","the Board of Directors of Cohen & Steers Preferred Securities and Income Fund,"
"687","Inc. and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"688","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"698","<DESCRIPTION>SHAREHOLDERS SERVICE PLAN"
"699","<TEXT>"
"700","SHAREHOLDER SERVICES PLAN"
"701","Cohen & Steers Preferred Securities and Income Fund, Inc."
"702","The above-captioned investment company (the Fund) adopts this Shareholder"
"703","Services Plan (the Plan) pursuant to which the Fund pays Cohen & Steers"
"704","Securities, LLC, the Fund's distributor (the Distributor), fees as set"
"705","forth on Exhibit A hereto and as may be modified from time to time for"
"706","shareholder account service and maintenance (Services).  The Distributor may"
"707","enter into agreements with certain qualified financial institutions, including"
"708","securities dealers and other industry professionals (collectively,"
"709","Service Agents), to perform Services, and the Distributor is responsible for"
"710","payment to the Service Agents.  Services may vary by Class and based on the"
"711","Services offered by Service Agents.  The Plan is not adopted pursuant to Rule"
"712","12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act)."
"713","The material aspects of the Plan are as follows:"
"714","1.	The Distributor shall determine the amounts to be paid to Service Agents"
"715","and the basis on which such payments will be made.  Payments to a Service"
"716","Agent are subject to compliance by the Service Agent with the terms of any"
"717","related Plan agreement between the Service Agent and the Distributor or the"
"718","Fund."
"719","2.	For the purpose of determining the fees payable under the Plan, the value"
"720","of the Fund's net assets attributable to each Class shall be computed in the"
"721","manner specified in the Fund's charter documents and registration statement"
"722","for the computation of net asset value."
"723","3.	The Fund's Board of Directors (the Board) shall be provided, at least"
"724","quarterly, with a written report of all amounts expended pursuant to the Plan."
"725","The report shall state the purpose for which the amounts were expended."
"726","4.	The Plan has been approved by a majority of the Fund Board members,"
"727","including a majority of the Board members who are not interested persons (as"
"728","defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund (Independent Directors) and have no"
"729","direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of the Plan or in any"
"730","agreements related to the Plan (Qualified Directors), pursuant to a vote"
"731","cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on the approval"
"732","of the Plan.  In voting to approve the implementation of the Plan, the Board"
"733","has concluded, in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment and in"
"734","light of applicable fiduciary duties, that there is a reasonable likelihood"
"735","that the Plan will benefit the Fund and shareholders of each Class."
"736","5.	As to each Class, the Plan shall continue for a period of no more than one"
"737","year, unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, and thereafter"
"738","shall continue automatically for successive annual periods, provided such"
"739","continuance is approved at least annually in the manner provided in paragraph"
"740","4 hereof."
