"525","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"526","To the Shareholders and"
"527","Board of Trustees of"
"528","Federated Institutional Trust"
"529","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"530","statements of Federated Intermediate"
"531","Government/Corporate Fund (the Fund), a portfolio of"
"532","Federated Institutional Trust, as of and for the"
"533","year ended August 31, 2011, in accordance with the standards"
"534","of the Public Company Accounting"
"535","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's"
"536","internal control over financial reporting,"
"537","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"538","for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"539","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"540","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"541","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"542","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"543","control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"544","we express no such opinion."
"545","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"546","and maintaining effective internal control over"
"547","financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"548","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"549","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"550","controls. A company's internal control over financial"
"551","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"552","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"553","reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"554","for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"555","accepted accounting principles. A company's internal"
"556","control over financial reporting includes those"
"557","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"558","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"559","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"560","the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"561","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"562","permit preparation of financial statements in"
"563","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"564","and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"565","company are being made in accordance with authorizations"
"566","of management and directors of the company;"
"567","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"568","or timely detection of the unauthorized"
"569","acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets"
"570","that could have a material affect on the financial"
"571","statements."
"572","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"573","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"574","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"575","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"576","that controls may become inadequate because of changes"
"577","in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"578","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"579","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"580","exists when the design or operation of a control"
"581","does not allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"582","of performing their assigned functions, to"
"583","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"584","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"585","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"586","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"587","material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim"
"588","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"589","detected on a timely basis."
"590","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"591","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"592","described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily"
"593","disclose all deficiencies in internal control that"
"594","might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"595","the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"596","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"597","the Fund's internal control over financial"
"598","reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"599","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"600","material weakness as defined above as of August 31, 2011."
"601","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"602","of management and the Board of Trustees of"
"603","Federated Institutional Trust and the Securities and Exchange"
"604","Commission and is not intended to be and"
"605","should not be used by anyone other than those specified parties."

"616","LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"617","Since February 2004, Federated and related entities"

"619","as defendants in several lawsuits, that were consolidated"
"620","into a single action in the United States"
"621","District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania,"
"622","alleging excessive advisory fees"
"623","involving one of the Federated-sponsored mutual funds."
