"568","times with regard to the securities owned by"
"569","the Fund, its funds available, or to become"
"570","available, for investment, and generally as to"
"571","the condition of the Fund's affairs. The"
"572","Manager shall furnish the Subadviser with"
"573","such other documents and information with"
"574","regard to the Fund's affairs as the"
"575","Subadviser may from time to time"
"576","reasonably request."
"577","          3.           (a)           Subject to the"
"578","supervision of the Trust's Board of Trustees"
"579","(the Board) and the Manager, the"
"580","Subadviser shall regularly provide the Fund"
"581","with respect to such portion of the Fund?s"
"582","assets as shall be allocated to the Subadviser"

"590","in the Fund's current Prospectus and"
"591","Statement of Additional Information. The"
"592","Subadviser shall, with respect to the"
"593","Allocated Assets, determine from time to"
"594","time what securities and other investments"
"595","will be purchased (including, as permitted in"
"596","accordance with this paragraph, swap"
"597","agreements, options and futures), retained,"
"598","sold or exchanged by the Fund and what"
"599","portion of the Allocated Assets will be held"
"600","in the various securities and other"
"601","investments in which the Fund invests, and"
"602","shall implement those decisions (including"
"603","the execution of investment documentation),"
"604","all subject to the provisions of the Trust's"
"605","Declaration of Trust and By-Laws"
"606","(collectively, the Governing Documents),"
"607","the 1940 Act, and the applicable rules and"
"608","regulations promulgated thereunder by the"
"609","Securities and Exchange Commission (the"
"610","SEC) and interpretive guidance issued"
"611","thereunder by the SEC staff and any other"
"612","applicable federal and state law, as well as"
"613","the investment objectives, policies and"
"614","restrictions of the Fund referred to above,"
"615","and any other specific policies adopted by"
"616","the Board and disclosed to the Subadviser."
"617","The Subadviser is authorized as the agent of"
"618","the Trust to give instructions with respect to"
"619","the Allocated Assets to the custodian of the"
"620","Fund as to deliveries of securities and other"
"621","investments and payments of cash for the"
"622","account of the Fund. Subject to applicable"
"623","provisions of the 1940 Act, the investment"
"624","program to be provided hereunder may"
"625","entail the investment of all or substantially"
"626","all of the assets of a Fund in one or more"
"627","investment companies. The Subadviser will"
"628","place orders pursuant to its investment"
"629","determinations for the Fund either directly"
"630","with the issuer or with any broker or dealer,"
"631","foreign currency dealer, futures commission"
"632","merchant or others selected by it. In"
"633","connection with the selection of such"
"634","brokers or dealers and the placing of such"
"635","orders, subject to applicable law, brokers or"
"636","dealers may be selected who also provide"
"637","brokerage and research services (as those"
"638","terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the"
"639","Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as"
"640","amended (the Exchange Act)) to the Fund"
"641","and/or the other accounts over which the"
"642","Subadviser or its affiliates exercise"
"643","investment discretion. The Subadviser is"
"644","authorized to pay a broker or dealer who"
"645","provides such brokerage and research"
"646","services a commission for executing a"
"647","portfolio transaction for the Fund which is in"
"648","excess of the amount of commission another"
"649","broker or dealer would have charged for"
"650","effecting that transaction if the Subadviser"
"651","determines in good faith that such amount"
"652","of commission is reasonable in relation to the"
"653","value of the brokerage and research services"
"654","provided by such broker or dealer. This"
"655","determination may be viewed in terms of"
"656","either that particular transaction or the"
"657","overall responsibilities which the Subadviser"
"658","and its affiliates have with respect to"
"659","accounts over which they exercise"
"660","investment discretion. The Board may adopt"
"661","policies and procedures that modify and"
"662","restrict the Subadviser's authority regarding"
"663","the execution of the Fund's portfolio"
"664","transactions provided herein. The Subadviser"
"665","shall exercise voting rights, rights to consent"
"666","to corporate action and any other rights"
"667","pertaining to the Allocated Assets subject to"
"668","such direction as the Board may provide,"
"669","and shall perform such other functions of"
"670","investment management and supervision as"
"671","may be directed by the Board. The"
"672","Subadviser may execute on behalf of the"
"673","Fund certain agreements, instruments and"
"674","documents in connection with the services"
"675","performed by it under this Agreement. These"
"676","may include, without limitation, brokerage"
"677","agreements, clearing agreements, account"
"678","documentation, futures and options"
"679","agreements, swap agreements, other"
"680","investment related agreements, and any"
"681","other agreements, documents or instruments"
"682","the Subadviser believes are appropriate or"
"683","desirable in performing its duties under this"
"684","Agreement."
"685","          (b)           The Fund hereby authorizes"
"686","any entity or person associated with the"
"687","Subadviser which is a member of a national"
"688","securities exchange to effect any transaction"
"689","on the exchange for the account of the Fund"
"690","which is permitted by Section 11(a) of the"
"691","Exchange Act and Rule 11a2-2(T)"
"692","thereunder, and the Fund hereby consents to"
"693","the retention of compensation for such"
"694","transactions in accordance with Rule 11a2-"
"695","2(T)(a)(2)(iv). Notwithstanding the"
"696","foregoing, the Subadviser agrees that it will"
"697","not deal with itself, or with members of the"
"698","Board or any principal underwriter of the"
"699","Fund, as principals or agents in making"
"700","purchases or sales of securities or other"
"701","property for the account of the Fund, nor"
"702","will it purchase any securities from an"
"703","underwriting or selling group in which the"
"704","Subadviser or its affiliates is participating, or"
"705","arrange for purchases and sales of securities"
"706","between the Fund and another account"
"707","advised by the Subadviser or its affiliates,"
"708","except in each case as permitted by the 1940"
"709","Act and in accordance with such policies"
"710","and procedures as may be adopted by the"
"711","Fund from time to time, and will comply"
"712","with all other provisions of the Governing"
"713","Documents and the Fund?s then-current"
"714","Prospectus and Statement of Additional"
"715","Information relative to the Subadviser and"
"716","its directors and officers."
"717","          4.           The Subadviser may delegate"
"718","to any other one or more companies that the"
"719","Subadviser controls, is controlled by, or is"
"720","under common control with, or to specified"
"721","employees of any such companies, certain of"
"722","the Subadviser?s duties under this"
"723","Agreement, provided in each case the"
"724","Subadviser will supervise the activities of"
"725","each such entity or employees thereof, that"
"726","such delegation will not relieve the"
"727","Subadviser of any of its duties or obligations"
"728","under this Agreement and provided further"
"729","that any such arrangements are entered into"
"730","in accordance with all applicable"
"731","requirements of the 1940 Act."
"732","          5.           The Subadviser agrees that it"
"733","will keep records relating to its services"
"734","hereunder in accordance with all applicable"
"735","laws, and in compliance with the"
"736","requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940"
"737","Act, the Subadviser hereby agrees that any"
"738","records that it maintains for the Fund are the"
"739","property of the Fund, and further agrees to"
"740","surrender promptly to the Fund any of such"
"741","records upon the Fund?s request. The"
"742","Subadviser further agrees to arrange for the"
"743","preservation of the records required to be"
"744","maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940"
"745","Act for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2"
"746","under the 1940 Act."
"747","          6.           (a)           The Subadviser, at"
"748","its expense, shall supply the Board, the"
"749","officers of the Trust, and the Manager with"
"750","all information and reports reasonably"
"751","required by them and reasonably available to"
"752","the Subadviser relating to the services"
"753","provided by the Subadviser hereunder."
"754","          (b)           The Subadviser shall bear all"
"755","expenses, and shall furnish all necessary"
"756","services, facilities and personnel, in"

"805","          7.           No member of the Board,"
"806","officer or employee of the Trust or Fund"
"807","shall receive from the Trust or Fund any"
"808","salary or other compensation as such member"
"809","of the Board, officer or employee while he is"
"810","at the same time a director, officer, or"
"811","employee of the Subadviser or any affiliated"
"812","company of the Subadviser, except as the"
"813","Board may decide. This paragraph shall not"

"816","persons who are not regular members of the"

"820","services performed by the Subadviser,"
"821","including the services of any consultants"
"822","retained by the Subadviser, the Manager"
"823","shall pay the Subadviser out of the"
"824","management fee it receives with respect to"
"825","the Fund, and only to the extent thereof, as"
"826","promptly as possible after the last day of"
"827","each month, a fee, computed daily at an"
"828","annual rate set forth on Schedule A annexed"
"829","hereto. The first payment of the fee shall be"
"830","made as promptly as possible at the end of"
"831","the month succeeding the effective date of"
"832","this Agreement, and shall constitute a full"
"833","payment of the fee due the Subadviser for"
"834","all services prior to that date. If this"
"835","Agreement is terminated as of any date not"
"836","the last day of a month, such fee shall be"
"837","paid as promptly as possible after such date"
"838","of termination, shall be based on the average"
"839","daily net assets of the Fund or, if less, the"
"840","portion thereof comprising the Allocated"
"841","Assets in that period from the beginning of"
"842","such month to such date of termination, and"
"843","shall be that proportion of such average daily"
"844","net assets as the number of business days in"
"845","such period bears to the number of business"
"846","days in such month. The average daily net"
"847","assets of the Fund or the portion thereof"
"848","comprising the Allocated Assets shall in all"
"849","cases be based only on business days and be"
"850","computed as of the time of the regular close"
"851","of business of the New York Stock"
"852","Exchange, or such other time as may be"
"853","determined by the Board."
"854","          9.           The Subadviser assumes no"
"855","responsibility under this Agreement other"
"856","than to render the services called for"
"857","hereunder, in good faith, and shall not be"
"858","liable for any error of judgment or mistake"
"859","of law, or for any loss arising out of any"
"860","investment or for any act or omission in the"
"861","execution of securities transactions for the"
"862","Fund, provided that nothing in this"
"863","Agreement shall protect the Subadviser"
"864","against any liability to the Manager or the"
"865","Fund to which the Subadviser would"
"866","otherwise be subject by reason of willful"
"867","misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence"
"868","in the performance of its duties or by reason"
"869","of its reckless disregard of its obligations"
"870","and duties hereunder. As used in this"
"871","Section 9, the term Subadviser shall"
"872","include any affiliates of the Subadviser"
"873","performing services for the Trust or the Fund"
"874","contemplated hereby and the partners,"
"875","shareholders, directors, officers and"
"876","employees of the Subadviser and such"
"877","affiliates."
"878","          10.         Nothing in this Agreement"
"879","shall limit or restrict the right of any director,"
"880","officer, or employee of the Subadviser who"
"881","may also be a Board member, officer, or"
"882","employee of the Trust or the Fund, to"
"883","engage in any other business or to devote his"
"884","time and attention in part to the management"

"889","or to render services of any kind, including"

"891","services, to any other fund, firm, individual"

"893","securities consistent with the investment"
"894","policies of the Fund or one or more other"
"895","accounts of the Subadviser is considered at"
"896","or about the same time, transactions in such"
"897","securities will be allocated among the"
"898","accounts in a manner deemed equitable by"
"899","the Subadviser. Such transactions may be"
"900","combined, in accordance with applicable"
"901","laws and regulations, and consistent with the"
"902","Subadviser's policies and procedures as"

"1080","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1081","The Board of Trustees"
"1082","Legg Mason Partners Equity Trust:"
"1083","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"1084","of Legg Mason Investment Counsel Financial Services Fund (the"
"1085","Fund), a series of Legg Mason Partners Equity Trust, as of and"
"1086","for the year ended March 31, 2013, in accordance with the"
"1087","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1088","(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"1089","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1090","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"1091","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1092","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1093","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1094","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1095","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1096","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1097","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1098","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1099","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1100","related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"1101","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1102","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1103","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1104","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1105","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1106","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1107","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1108","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"1109","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1110","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1111","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1112","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"1113","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1114","and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1115","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1116","acquisition, use, or disposition of the fund's assets that could"
"1117","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1118","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1119","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1120","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1121","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1122","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"1123","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1124","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1125","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1126","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1127","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"1128","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"1129","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1130","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1131","material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial"
"1132","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1133","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1134","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1135","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1136","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1137","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1138","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"1139","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1140","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that"
"1141","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"1142","March 31, 2013."
"1143","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1144","management and the Board of Trustees of Legg Mason Partners"
"1145","Equity Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"1146","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"1147","these specified parties."
