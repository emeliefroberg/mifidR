"3602","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"3603","To the Trustees of Eaton Vance Special Investment Trust and"
"3604","Shareholders of Eaton Vance Balanced Fund:"
"3605","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"3606","Eaton Vance Balanced Fund (the Fund) (one of the funds"
"3607","constituting Eaton Vance Special Investment Trust) as of and for"
"3608","the year ended December 31, 2016, in accordance with the"
"3609","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"3610","(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"3611","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"3612","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"3613","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"3614","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"3615","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"3616","Fund's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"3617","express no such opinion."
"3618","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"3619","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"3620","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"3621","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"3622","related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over financial"
"3623","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"3624","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"3625","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"3626","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control"
"3627","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"3628","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"3629","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"3630","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"3631","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"3632","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"3633","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"3634","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"3635","authorizations of management of the fund and trustees of the"
"3636","trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"3637","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition"
"3638","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"3639","financial statements."
"3640","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"3641","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"3642","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"3643","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"3644","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with"
"3645","the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3646","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"3647","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"3648","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"3649","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"3650","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"3651","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"3652","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"3653","material misstatement of a fund's annual or interim financial"
"3654","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3655","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"3656","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"3657","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"3658","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"3659","standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"3660","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"3661","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"3662","and its operation, including controls for safeguarding securities"
"3663","that we consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as"

"4309","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING"
"4310","FIRM"
"4311","To the Trustees of Eaton Vance Special Investment Trust and"
"4312","Shareholders of Eaton Vance Special Equities Fund:"
"4313","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Eaton"
"4314","Vance Special Equities Fund (the Fund) (one of the funds constituting"
"4315","Eaton Vance Special Investment Trust) as of and for the year ended"
"4316","December 31, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"4317","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"4318","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"4319","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"4320","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"4321","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"4322","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"4323","Fund's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express"
"4324","no such opinion."
"4325","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"4326","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"4327","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"4328","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"4329","fund's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"4330","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"4331","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"4332","purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"4333","A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"4334","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"4335","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"4336","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"4337","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"4338","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"4339","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"4340","made only in accordance with authorizations of management of the fund"
"4341","and trustees of the trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"4342","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"4343","use, or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on"
"4344","the financial statements."
"4345","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"4346","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"4347","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"4348","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"4349","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"4350","deteriorate."
"4351","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"4352","design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"4353","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"4354","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"4355","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"4356","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"4357","possibility that a material misstatement of a fund's annual or interim"
"4358","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"4359","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"4360","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"4361","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"4362","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"4363","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we"
"4364","noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"4365","reporting and its operation, including controls for safeguarding securities"
"4366","that we consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as of"
"4367","December 31, 2016."

"5161","any of the Fund Procedures and of any violation of"

"5214","upon the Trust's or the Adviser's request in"
"5215","compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3"
"5216","under the 1940 Act, although the Sub-Adviser may,"

"5244","access to the Fund's holdings and information"
"5245","relating to portfolio management that is in the"
"5246","possession of the Custodian."

"5251","which it receives or has access to in the course of"
"5252","performing its duties under this Agreement except"
"5253","as may be permitted by relevant Fund Procedures."
"5254","Neither party shall use its knowledge of non-public"
"5255","information regarding the Fund as a basis to place"
"5256","or recommend any securities transactions for its"
"5257","own benefit, or the benefit of one or more of its"
"5258","clients, to the detriment of the Fund.  To the extent"
"5259","that either Party has delegated any duties or"
"5260","services to an affiliate or a third-party, it shall"
"5261","ensure that any such affiliate or third-party abides"

"5276","             a.	Except as may otherwise be"
"5277","required by the 1940 Act or the rules thereunder or"
"5278","other applicable law, the Adviser agrees that the"

"5280","Adviser, and controlling persons thereof (each a"
"5281","Sub- Adviser Controlling Person, and collectively,"
"5282","Sub-Adviser Controlling Persons) shall not be"
"5283","liable for, or subject to any losses, claims,"
"5284","damages, expenses, liabilities or litigation in"
"5285","connection with, any act or omission connected"
"5286","with or arising out of any services rendered under"
"5287","this Agreement, except by reason of willful"
"5288","misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence, in"
"5289","each such case, in the performance of the Sub-"
"5290","Adviser's duties, or any material breach by the Sub-"
"5291","Adviser of its obligations or duties under this"
"5292","Agreement (the Sub-Adviser Standard of Care)."
"5293","In no case shall the Sub-Adviser, its affiliated"

"5299","action or non-action.  The Adviser understands and"
"5300","acknowledges that the Sub-Adviser does not"
"5301","warrant that the portion of the assets of the Fund"
"5302","managed by the Sub-Adviser will achieve any"
"5303","particular rate of return or that its performance will"
"5304","match any benchmark index or other standard or"

"5311","shall be deemed to apply only to the portion of the"
"5312","assets of the Fund managed by the Sub-Adviser."
"5313","             b.	The Sub-Adviser agrees that"
"5314","neither the Trust nor the Fund shall bear any"

"5317","or litigation of the Sub-Adviser connected with or"
"5318","arising out of its services under this Agreement."
"5319","       14.	Indemnification."
"5320","             a.	The Adviser agrees to"
"5321","indemnify and hold harmless the Sub-Adviser, any"
"5322","affiliated person of the Sub-Adviser, and Sub-"
"5323","Adviser Controlling Persons (the Sub-Adviser and"

"5329","Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act), the 1940"
"5330","Act, the Advisers Act, under any other statute, at"
"5331","common law or otherwise, (1) arising out of the"
"5332","Adviser's responsibilities to the Sub-Adviser which"
"5333","may be based upon the Adviser's gross negligence,"
"5334","willful misfeasance, or bad faith in the performance"
"5335","of its duties, or any material breach by the Adviser"
"5336","of its obligations or duties under this Agreement, or"
"5337","(2) which may be based upon any untrue statement"
"5338","or alleged untrue statement of a material fact"
"5339","contained in the Registration Statement or"
"5340","prospectus covering the Fund, or any amendment"
"5341","thereof or any supplement thereto, or the omission"
"5342","or alleged omission to state therein a material fact"
"5343","required to be stated therein or necessary to make"
"5344","the statements therein not misleading unless such"
"5345","statement or omission was made in reliance on"
"5346","disclosure reviewed by the Sub-Adviser in"
"5347","accordance with Section 8 of this Agreement;"
"5348","provided however, that in no case shall the"
"5349","indemnity in favor of the Sub-Adviser Indemnified"
"5350","Person be deemed to protect such person against"
"5351","any liability to which such person would otherwise"
"5352","be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad"
"5353","faith, or gross negligence in the performance of its"
"5354","duties, or any material breach of its obligations or"
"5355","duties under this Agreement."
"5356","             b.	Notwithstanding Section 13"
"5357","of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser agrees to"
"5358","indemnify and hold harmless the Adviser, any"
"5359","affiliated person of the Adviser, and controlling"
"5360","persons thereof (the Adviser and all of such"
"5361","persons being referred to as Adviser Indemnified
Persons) against any and all losses, claims,"
"5362","damages, expenses, liabilities, or litigation"
"5363","(including reasonable legal and other expenses) to"

"5365","subject under the 1933 Act, 1940 Act, the Advisers"
"5366","Act, under any other statute, at common law or"
"5367","otherwise, (1)  arising out of the Sub-Adviser's"
"5368","responsibilities as sub-adviser of the Fund which"
"5369","may be based upon the Sub-Adviser's breach of"
"5370","the Sub-Adviser Standard of Care; or (2) may be"
"5371","based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue"
"5372","statement of a material fact contained in the"
"5373","Registration Statement or prospectus covering the"
"5374","Fund, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or"
"5375","the omission or alleged omission to state therein a"
"5376","material fact known or which should have been"
"5377","known to the Sub-Adviser and"
"5378","             c.	was required to be stated"
"5379","therein or necessary to make the statements"
"5380","therein not misleading, if such a statement was"
"5381","made in reliance upon disclosure reviewed by the"
"5382","Sub-Adviser in accordance with Section 8 of this"
"5383","Agreement or was omitted from a disclosure"
"5384","reviewed by the Sub-Adviser in accordance with"
"5385","such Section 8; provided, however, that in no case"
"5386","shall the indemnity in favor of an Adviser"
"5387","Indemnified Person be deemed to protect such"
"5388","person against any liability to which such person"
"5389","would otherwise be subject by reason of willful"
"5390","misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence in the"
"5391","performance of its duties, or by reason of its"
"5392","material breach of its obligations or duties under"
"5393","this Agreement."
"5394","             d.	The Adviser shall not be"
"5395","liable under Paragraph (a) of this Section 14 with"
"5396","respect to any claim made against a Sub-Adviser"
"5397","Indemnified Person unless such Sub-Adviser"
"5398","Indemnified Person shall have notified the Adviser"
"5399","in writing within a reasonable time after the"
"5400","summons or other first legal process giving"
"5401","information of the nature of the claim shall have"
"5402","been served upon such Sub-Adviser Indemnified"
"5403","Person (or after such Sub-Adviser Indemnified"
"5404","Person shall have received notice of such service"
"5405","on any designated agent), but failure to notify the"
"5406","Adviser of any such claim shall not relieve the"
"5407","Adviser from any liability which it may have to the"
"5408","Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person against whom"
"5409","such action is brought except to the extent the"
"5410","Adviser is prejudiced by the failure or delay in"
"5411","giving such notice.  In case any such action is"
"5412","brought against the Sub-Adviser Indemnified"
"5413","Person, the Adviser will be entitled to participate, at"
"5414","its own expense, in the defense thereof or, after"
"5415","notice to the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person, to"
"5416","assume the defense thereof, with counsel"
"5417","reasonably satisfactory to the Sub-Adviser"
"5418","Indemnified Person.  If the Adviser assumes the"
"5419","defense of any such action and the selection of"
"5420","counsel by the Adviser to represent both the"
"5421","Adviser and the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person"
"5422","would result in a conflict of interests and therefore,"
"5423","would not, in the reasonable judgment of the Sub-"
"5424","Adviser Indemnified Person, adequately represent"
"5425","the interests of the Sub-Adviser Indemnified"
"5426","Person, the Adviser will, at its own expense,"
"5427","assume the defense with counsel to the Adviser"
"5428","and, also at its own expense, with separate counsel"
"5429","to the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person, which"
"5430","counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the"
"5431","Adviser and to the Sub-Adviser Indemnified"
"5432","Person.  The Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person shall"
"5433","bear the fees and expenses of any additional"
"5434","counsel retained by it, and the Adviser shall not be"
"5435","liable to the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person under"
"5436","this Agreement for any legal or other expenses"
"5437","subsequently incurred by the Sub-Adviser"
"5438","Indemnified Person independently in connection"
"5439","with the defense thereof other than reasonable"
"5440","costs of investigation.  The Adviser shall not have"
"5441","the right to compromise on or settle the litigation"
"5442","without the prior written consent of the Sub-Adviser"
"5443","Indemnified Person if the compromise or settlement"
"5444","results, or may result, in a finding of wrongdoing on"
"5445","the part of the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person."
"5446","             e.	The Sub-Adviser shall not be"
"5447","liable under Paragraph (b) of this Section 14 with"
"5448","respect to any claim made against an Adviser"
"5449","Indemnified Person unless such Adviser"
"5450","Indemnified Person shall have notified the Sub-"
"5451","Adviser in writing within a reasonable time after the"
"5452","summons or other first legal process giving"
"5453","information of the nature of the claim shall have"
"5454","been served upon such Adviser Indemnified Person"
"5455","(or after such Adviser Indemnified Person shall"
"5456","have received notice of such service on any"
"5457","designated agent), but failure to notify the Sub-"
"5458","Adviser of any such claim shall not relieve the Sub-"
"5459","Adviser from any liability which it may have to the"
"5460","Adviser Indemnified Person against whom such"
"5461","action is brought except to the extent the Sub-"
"5462","Adviser is prejudiced by the failure or delay in"
"5463","giving such notice.  In case any such action is"
"5464","brought against the Adviser Indemnified Person,"
"5465","the Sub-Adviser will be entitled to participate, at its"
"5466","own expense, in the defense thereof or, after notice"
"5467","to the Adviser Indemnified Person, to assume the"
"5468","defense thereof, with counsel reasonably"
"5469","satisfactory to the Adviser Indemnified Person.  If"
"5470","the Sub-Adviser assumes the defense of any such"
"5471","action and the selection of counsel by the Sub-"
"5472","Adviser to represent both the Sub-Adviser and the"
"5473","Adviser Indemnified Person would result in a"
"5474","conflict of interests and therefore, would not, in the"
"5475","reasonable judgment of the Adviser Indemnified"
"5476","Person, adequately represent the interests of the"
"5477","Adviser Indemnified Person, the Sub-Adviser will,"
"5478","at its own expense, assume the defense with"
"5479","counsel to the Sub-Adviser and, also at its own"
"5480","expense, with separate counsel to the Adviser"
"5481","Indemnified Person, which counsel shall be"
"5482","reasonably satisfactory to the Sub-Adviser and to"
"5483","the Adviser Indemnified Person.  The Adviser"
"5484","Indemnified Person shall bear the fees and"
"5485","expenses of any additional counsel retained by it,"
"5486","and the Sub-Adviser shall not be liable to the"
"5487","Adviser Indemnified Person under this Agreement"
"5488","for any legal or other expenses subsequently"
"5489","incurred by the Adviser Indemnified Person"
"5490","independently in connection with the defense"
"5491","thereof other than reasonable costs of"
"5492","investigation.  The Sub-Adviser shall not have the"
"5493","right to compromise on or settle the litigation"
"5494","without the prior written consent of the Adviser"
"5495","Indemnified Person if the compromise or settlement"
"5496","results, or may result, in a finding of wrongdoing on"
"5497","the part of the Adviser Indemnified Person."
"5498","       15.	Duration and Termination."

"5514","in person at a meeting called for the purpose of"
"5515","voting on such approval.."
"5516","             b.	Notwithstanding the"

"5537","be returned to the Adviser or the Trust, free from"
"5538","any claim or retention of rights in such record by"
"5539","the Sub-Adviser, although the Sub-Adviser may, at"
"5540","its own expense, make and retain a copy of such"
"5541","records.  This Agreement shall automatically"
"5542","terminate in the event of its assignment (as such"
