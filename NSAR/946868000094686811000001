"514","To the Shareholders"
"515","and Board of"
"516","Trustees of"
"517","Federated Total"

"519","Bond Fund:"
"520","In planning and"
"521","performing our audit"
"522","of the financial"
"523","statements of"
"524","Federated Total"
"525","Return Government"
"526","Bond Fund (the Fund)"
"527","as of and for the"
"528","year ended February 28,"
"529","2011, in accordance"
"530","with the standards"
"531","of the Public Company"
"532","Accounting Oversight"
"533","Board (United States),"
"534","we considered the"
"535","Fund's internal"
"536","control over financial"
"537","reporting,"
"538","including controls"
"539","over safeguarding"
"540","securities, as a basis"
"541","for designing our auditing"
"542","procedures for the"
"543","purpose of expressing"
"544","our opinion on the"
"545","financial statements"
"546","and to"
"547","comply with the"
"548","requirements of Form"
"549","N-SAR, but not for the"
"550","purpose of expressing an"
"551","opinion on the"
"552","effectiveness of the"
"553","Fund's internal control"
"554","over financial reporting."
"555","Accordingly, we"
"556","express no such opinion."
"557","The management of the"
"558","Fund is responsible for"
"559","establishing and"
"560","maintaining effective"
"561","internal control over"
"562","financial reporting."
"563","In fulfilling this"
"564","responsibility, estimates"
"565","and"
"566","judgments by management"
"567","are required to assess"
"568","the expected benefits"
"569","and related costs"
"570","of controls. A company's"
"571","internal control over"
"572","financial reporting is a"
"573","process designed to"
"574","provide reasonable"
"575","assurance regarding the"
"576","reliability of financial"
"577","reporting and the"
"578","preparation of financial"
"579","statements for external"
"580","purposes in accordance"
"581","with generally"
"582","accepted accounting"
"583","principles.  A company's"
"584","internal control over"
"585","financial reporting"
"586","includes those policies"
"587","and procedures that (1)"
"588","pertain to the"
"589","maintenance of records that,"
"590","in reasonable detail,"
"591","accurately and fairly"
"592","reflect the transactions"
"593","and dispositions of the"
"594","assets of the company;"
"595","(2) provide reasonable"
"596","assurance that transactions"
"597","are recorded as"
"598","necessary to permit"
"599","preparation of financial"
"600","statements in accordance"
"601","with generally"
"602","accepted accounting"
"603","principles, and that"
"604","receipts and expenditures"
"605","of the company are"
"606","being made only in"
"607","accordance with"
"608","authorizations of"
"609","management and directors"
"610","of the"
"611","company; and (3) provide"
"612","reasonable assurance"
"613","regarding prevention or"
"614","timely detection"
"615","of unauthorized"
"616","acquisition, use or"
"617","disposition of a"
"618","company's assets that"
"619","could have a"
"620","material effect on the"
"621","financial statements."
"622","Because of its inherent"
"623","limitations, internal"
"624","control over financial"
"625","reporting may not"
"626","prevent or detect"
"627","misstatements. Also,"
"628","projections of any"
"629","evaluation of effectiveness"
"630","to"
"631","future periods are"
"632","subject to the risk"
"633","that controls may"
"634","become inadequate"
"635","because of"
"636","changes in conditions,"
"637","or that the degree of"
"638","compliance with the"
"639","policies or procedures"
"640","may deteriorate."
"641","A deficiency in"
"642","internal control over"
"643","financial reporting"
"644","exists when the design or"
"645","operation of a control"
"646","does not allow"
"647","management or employees,"
"648","in the normal course of"
"649","performing their"
"650","assigned functions,"
"651","to prevent or detect"
"652","misstatements on a"
"653","timely basis."
"654","A material weakness"
"655","is a deficiency, or"
"656","a combination of"
"657","deficiencies, in"
"658","internal control"
"659","over financial reporting,"
"660","such that there is a"
"661","reasonable possibility"
"662","that a material"
"663","misstatement of the"
"664","company's annual or"
"665","interim financial"
"666","statements will not be"
"667","prevented or detected"
"668","on a timely basis."
"669","Our consideration"
"670","of the Fund's internal"
"671","control over financial"
"672","reporting was for the"
"673","limited purpose"
"674","described in the first"
"675","paragraph and would"
"676","not necessarily"
"677","disclose all"
"678","deficiencies in"
"679","internal control that"
"680","might be material"
"681","weaknesses under standards"
"682","established by the"
"683","Public Company Accounting"
"684","Oversight Board (United States)."
"685","However, we noted no"
"686","deficiencies in the"
"687","Fund's internal control"
"688","over financial reporting"
"689","and its operation,"
"690","including controls"
"691","over safeguarding"
"692","securities that we"
"693","consider to be a"
"694","material weakness as"
"695","defined above as of"
"696","February 28, 2011."
"697","This report is intended"
"698","solely for the information"
"699","and use of management"
"700","and the Board"

"703","Exchange Commission and"
"704","is not intended"

"720","Since February"
"721","2004, Federated"
"722","and related entities"
"723","(collectively,"
"724","Federated) have"

"729","United States"
"730","District Court for"
"731","the Western"
"732","District of"
"733","Pennsylvania."
"734","These lawsuits"

"738","action alleging"
"739","excessive"
"740","advisory fees"

"744","funds (Funds)."
"745","       Federated"

"747","have been defending"
"748","this litigation."
"749","Additional"
"750","lawsuits based upon"
