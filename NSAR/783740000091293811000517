"544","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"545","To the Board of Trustees of MFS Series Trust X and"
"546","Shareholders of MFS Emerging Markets Debt Fund"
"547","In planning and performing our audit of the financial  statements of MFS Emergin"
"548","g Markets Debt Fund (the Fund)(one of the portfolios comprising  MFS Series Trus"
"549","t X) as of and for the year ended July 31, 2011, in accordance with the standard"
"550","s of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considere"
"551","d the Funds internal control over financial reporting, including controls over s"
"552","afeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"553","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"
"554","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"555","on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial reporting. Acc"
"556","ordingly, we express no such opinion."
"557","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining effec"
"558","tive internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibilit"
"559","y, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected ben"
"560","efits and related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over financial"
"561","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the re"
"562","liability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"563","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"564","companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and p"
"565","rocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable det"
"566","ail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the asse"
"567","ts of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are record"
"568","ed as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"569","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"570","the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"571","and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding pre"
"572","vention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"573","companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"574","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting m"
"575","ay not prevent or detect  misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"576","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"577","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance wi"
"578","th the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"579","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"580","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"581","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatement"
"582","s on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of de"
"583","ficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"584","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or in"
"585","terim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"586","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial reporting was for"
"587","the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily d"
"588","isclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses u"
"589","nder standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (Uni"
"590","ted States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal control ove"
"591","r financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding se"
"592","curities that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of July"
"593","31, 2011."
"594","This  report is intended  solely for the information and use of management and t"
