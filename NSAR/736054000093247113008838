"2056","The board of trustees of Vanguard STAR? Funds (the Trust) has"

"2058","to reorganize Vanguard Developed Markets Index Fund, a series of"
"2059","the Trust, into Vanguard Tax-Managed International Fund, a series"
"2060","of Vanguard Tax-Managed Funds'. The reorganization will consolidate"
"2061","the assets of these two Funds in order to simplify the Vanguard"
"2062","fund lineup, and it will allow Developed Markets Index Fund"
"2063","shareholders to merge into a fund that has identical expense ratios,"
"2064","utilizes the same benchmark, and has the ability to benefit from an"
"2065","exchange-traded share class. It is anticipated that the reorganization"
"2066","will allow the combined Fund to benefit by eliminating duplicative"
"2067","expenses and spreading fixed costs over a larger asset base."
"2068","The reorganization does not require shareholder approval, and the"
"2069","closing of the reorganization is expected to occur on or about"
"2070","April 4, 2014. Prior to the closing, a combined information s"

"2073","statement/prospectus will describe the reorganization, provide a"

"2078","Institutional Plus Shares, as appropriate, of the Tax-Managed"

"2081","cease operations. Investor Shares and Institutional Plus Shares of"
"2082","the Tax-Managed International Fund will be created in anticipation"

"2085","as amended."
"2086","(over, please)"

"2449","because of rising interest rates; credit risk, which is the chance that"
"2450","the issuer of a security will fail to pay interest and principal in a"
"2451","timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to"
"2452","make such payments will cause the price of that security to decline,"
"2453","thus reducing the underlying fund's return; and income risk, which is"
"2454","the chance that an underlying fund's income will decline because of"
"2455","falling interest rates. If an underlying fund holds securities that"
"2456","are callable, the underlying fund's income may decline because"
"2457","of call risk, which is the chance that during periods of falling"
"2458","interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities"
"2459","with higher coupons or interest rates before their maturity dates."
"2460","An underlying fund would then lose any price appreciation above"
"2461","the bond's call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated"
"2462","proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline i"
"2463","n the underlying fund?s income."
"2464","For mortgage-backed securities, this risk is known as prepayment risk."
"2465","The Fund is also subject to the following risks associated with"
"2466","investments in currency-hedged foreign bonds: country/regional risk,"
"2467","which is the chance that world events-such as political upheaval,"
"2468","financial troubles, or natural disasters-will adversely affect"
"2469","the value of securities issuedby foreign governments,"
"2470","government agencies, or companies; and currency hedging risk,"
"2471","which is the risk that the currency hedging transactions entered"
"2472","into by the underlying international bond fund may not perfectly"
"2473","offset the fund's foreign currency exposures."
