"5571","File number 811-8764"
"5572","                            SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT"
"5573","	Agreement dated as of August 5, 2010 between UBS Global Asset"
"5574","Management (Americas) Inc. (UBS Global AM), a Delaware corporation, and"
"5575","Standard Life Investments (Corporate Funds) Limited (Sub- Adviser), a"
"5576","corporation organized under the laws of Scotland, United Kingdom (the"
"5577","Agreement)."
"5578","                                   RECITALS"
"5579","(1)	UBS Global AM has entered into a Management Agreement dated as of"
"5580","August 1, 2008  (Management Agreement), with UBS PACE Select Advisors Trust"
"5581","(Trust), an open-end management investment company registered under the"
"5582","Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (1940 Act), with respect to UBS"
"5583","PACE Alternative Strategies Investments"
"5584","(Portfolio); and"
"5585","(2) 	UBS Global AM is authorized to retain one or more sub-advisers to"
"5586","furnish certain investment advisory services to UBS Global AM and the"
"5587","Portfolio;"
"5588","(3)	UBS Global AM desires to retain the Sub-Adviser to furnish certain"
"5589","investment advisory services to UBS Global AM and the Portfolio or a"
"5590","designated portion of the assets (Segment) of the Portfolio; and"
"5591","(4)	The Sub-Adviser is willing to furnish such services;"
"5592","Now therefore, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants herein"
"5593","contained, UBS"
"5594","Global AM and the Sub-Adviser agree as follows:"
"5595","1.	Appointment.  UBS Global AM hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser as an"
"5596","investment sub-adviser with respect to the Portfolio or Segment for the"
"5597","period and on the terms set forth in this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser accepts"
"5598","that appointment and agrees to render the services herein"
"5599","set forth, for the compensation herein provided."
"5600","2. 	Regulation and Client Categorisation"
"5601","The Sub-Adviser is authorised and regulated by the Financial Services"
"5602","Authority in the United Kingdom (FSA) and the Investment Advisers Act of"
"5603","1940, as amended (Advisers Act) in the conduct of its business and the Sub-"
"5604","Adviser will notify UBS Global AM immediately if it ceases to"
"5605","be so regulated."
"5606","3.	Duties as Sub-Adviser."
"5607","(a)	Subject to the supervision and direction of the Trusts Board of"
"5608","Trustees (the Board) and review by UBS Global AM and any written guidelines"
"5609","adopted by the Board or UBS Global AM the Sub-Adviser will provide a"
"5610","continuous investment program for the Portfolio or Segment, including"
"5611","investment research and discretionary management with respect to all"
"5612","securities and investmentsand cash equivalents in the Portfolio or Segment."
"5613","The Sub-Adviser will determine from time to time what investments will be"
"5614","purchased, retained or sold by the Portfolio or Segment.  The Sub-Adviser"
"5615","will be responsible for placing purchase and sell orders for investments"
"5616","and for other related transactions for the Portfolio or Segment. The"
"5617","Sub-Adviser understands that the Portfolios assets need to be managed so as to"
"5618","permit the Portfolio to qualify or to continue to qualify as a regulated"
"5619","investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended"
"5620","(Code).  The Sub-Adviser will provide services under this Agreement in"
"5621","accordance with the Portfolios investment objective, policies and restrictions"
"5622","as stated in the Trusts currently effective registration statement under the"
"5623","1940 Act, and any amendments or supplements thereto (Registration Statement)."
"5624","The Sub-Adviser, on each business day, shall provide UBS Global"
"5625"," AM and the Trusts custodian such information as UBS Global AM and the Trusts"
"5626","custodian may reasonably request relating to all transactions concerning the"
"5627","Portfolio or Segment."
"5628","UBS Global AM hereby designates and appoints the Sub-Adviser as its and the"
"5629","Portfolios limited purpose agent and attorney-in-fact, without further prior"
"5630","approval of UBS Global AM (except as expressly provided for herein or as may"
"5631","be required by law) to make and execute, in the name and on behalf of the"
"5632","Portfolio, all agreements, instruments and other documents and to take all"
"5633","such other action which the Sub-Adviser considers necessary or advisable to"
"5634","carry out its duties hereunder. By way of example and not by way of"
"5635","limitation, in connection with any purchase for the  Portfolio or Segment of"
"5636","securities or instruments that are not registered under the U.S. Securities"
"5637","Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), the Sub-Adviser shall have the"
"5638","full power and authority, among other things, to: (i) commit to purchase such"
"5639","securities for the Portfolio on the terms and conditions under which such"
"5640","securities are offered; (ii) execute such account opening and other"
"5641","agreements, instruments and documents (including, without limitation,"
"5642","purchase agreements, subscription documents, ISDA and other swap and"
"5643","derivative documents), and make such commitments, as may be required in"
"5644","connection with the purchase and sale of such securities or instruments;"
"5645","(iii) represent that the Portfolio is an accredited investor as defined in"
"5646","Rule 501 (a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act and a Qualified"
"5647","Institutional Buyer as defined in Rule 144A (a) (1) (i) under the Securities"
"5648","Act; and (iv) commit that such securities will not be offered or sold by the"
"5649","Portfolio except in compliance with the registration requirements of the"
"5650","Securities Act or an exemption therefrom. This power-of-attorney is a"
"5651","continuing power-of-attorney and shall remain in full force and effect until"
"5652","revoked by UBS Global AM or the Trust in writing, but any such revocation"
"5653","shall not affect any transaction initiated prior to receipt by the Sub-"
"5654","Adviser of such notice."
"5655","(b)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not consult with any other sub-"
"5656","adviser (Other Sub-Adviser) for the Trust or Portfolio concerning any"
"5657","transaction by the Portfolio or Segment in securities or other assets,"
"5658","including (i) the purchase by the Portfolio or Segment of a security issued"
"5659","by the Other Sub-Adviser, or an affiliate of the Other Sub-Adviser, to the"
"5660","Trust or Portfolio except as permitted by the 1940 Act or (ii) transactions"
"5661","by the Portfolio or Segment in any security for which the Other Sub-Adviser,"
"5662","or its affiliate, is the principal underwriter."
"5663","(c)	Unless otherwise instructed by UBS Global AM or the Trust, the Sub-"
"5664","Adviser agrees that it will be responsible for voting proxies of issuers of"
"5665","securities held by the Portfolio or Segment.  The Sub-Adviser further agrees"
"5666","that it will adopt written proxy voting procedures that shall comply with the"
"5667","requirements of the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act (Proxy Voting Policy), and"
"5668","that shall be acceptable to the Board.  The Sub-Adviser shall also provide"
"5669","its Proxy Voting Policy, and if requested by UBS Global AM, a summary of such"
"5670","Proxy Voting Policy for inclusion in the Trusts registration statement, and"
"5671","will provide UBS Global AM with any material amendment to the Proxy Voting"
"5672","Policy within a reasonable time after such amendment has taken effect.  The"
"5673","Sub-Adviser further agrees that it will provide the Board on or before August"
"5674","1st of each year, or more frequently as the Board may reasonably request,"
"5675","with a written report of the proxies voted during the most recent 12-month"
"5676","period ending June 30, or such other period as the Board may designate, in a"
"5677","format that shall comply with the 1940 Act and that shall be acceptable to"
"5678","the Board. Except as may be provided by applicable law or as otherwise"
"5679","provided herein, the Sub-Adviser shall not incur any liability to UBS Global"
"5680","AM by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any such proxy"
"5681","voting discretion. UBS Global AM understands that the Sub-Adviser establishes"
"5682","from time to time guidelines for the voting of proxies and may employ the"
"5683","services of a proxy voting service to exercise proxies in accordance with the"
"5684","Sub-Advisers guidelines."
"5685","(d) Notwithstanding the above, UBS Global AM or another service provider for"
"5686","the Trust, and not the Sub-Adviser, shall make any and all filings in"
"5687","connection with any securities litigation or class action lawsuits involving"
"5688","securities held or that were held in the Segment; provided, however, that the"
"5689","Sub-Adviser is responsible for promptly forwarding to UBS Global AM documents"
"5690","it receives regarding such matters that are specific to the Portfolio or the"
"5691","Segment and providing reasonable assistance, if necessary, in making such"
"5692","claims."
"5693","(e)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that upon the request of UBS Global AM or the"
"5694","Board, Sub-Adviser shall exercise the rights incident to the securities held"
"5695","by the Portfolio or Segment in the context of a bankruptcy or other"
"5696","reorganization.  The Sub-Adviser further agrees that it will keep UBS Global"
"5697","AM fully informed about any such actions that it intends to take."
"5698","(f)     The Sub-Adviser will seek best execution when trading Portfolio assets,"
"5699","that is, execution whose cost (both execution and research provided)"
"5700","represents the highest value to the client. Consistent with the Sub-Advisers"
"5701","fiduciary duty, commissions paid to a broker in the trading of Portfolio"
"5702","assets may be higher  than what might be charged by other brokers."
"5703","Specifically, commissions may be greater than an execution only price when"
"5704","the Sub-Adviser, in exercising its fiduciary duty, reasonably determines that"
"5705","the amount of the commission was reasonable in relation to the research and"
"5706","brokerage services provided, viewed either in terms of the particular"
"5707","transactions or the Sub-Advisers overall responsibilities with respect to"
"5708","discretionary accounts. The Sub-Adviser may consider the value of the"
"5709","research and services received versus the cost of such research and services"
"5710","in aggregate for all clients. The Sub-Adviser agrees that the total"
"5711","commissions paid by the Portfolio or Segment will be reasonable in relation"
"5712","to the benefits to the Portfolio or Segment over the long term.  In no"
"5713","instance will portfolio securities be purchased from or sold to UBS Global AM"
"5714","or the Sub-Adviser, the Trusts principal underwriter, or any affiliated"
"5715","person thereof, except in accordance with the federal securities laws and the"
"5716","rules and regulations thereunder.  The Sub-Adviser may aggregate sales and"
"5717","purchase orders with respect to the assets of the Portfolio or Segment with"
"5718","similar orders being made simultaneously for other accounts advised by the"
"5719","Sub-Adviser or its affiliates.  Whenever the Sub-Adviser aggregates orders to"
"5720","purchase or sell the same security on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment and"
"5721","one or more other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser, the orders will be"
"5722","allocated as to price and amount among all such accounts in a manner believed"
"5723","to be equitable over time to each account.  UBS Global AM recognizes that in"
"5724","some cases this procedure may adversely affect the results obtained for the"
"5725","Portfolio or Segment."
"5726","Subject to the Sub-Advisers obligations to seek best execution, UBS Global AM"
"5727","agrees that the Sub-Adviser, in its sole discretion, may place transactions"
"5728","on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment and the Trust with any broker-dealer"
"5729","deemed to be an affiliate (including affiliated FCMs) of the Sub-Adviser (the"
"5730","Affiliated Broker-Dealers) so long as such transactions are effected in"
"5731","conformity with the requirements (including any applicable exemptions and"
"5732","administrative interpretations set forth in Part II of the Sub-Advisers Form"
"5733","ADV Registration Statement on file with the Securities and Exchange"
"5734","Commission (Form ADV)) of Section 11(a)(1)(H) of the Securities Exchange Act"
"5735","of 1934 (the 1934 Act), and in compliance with Rules 17e-1 or 10f-3 under the"
"5736","1940 Act or other applicable rules and the Trusts policies and procedures"
"5737","thereunder.  In all such dealings, the Affiliated Broker-Dealers shall be"
"5738","authorized and entitled to retain any commissions, remuneration or profits"
"5739","which may be made in such transactions and shall not be liable to account for"
"5740","the same to UBS Global AM, the Portfolio or the Trust.  In the event the Sub-"
"5741","Adviser becomes affiliated (as deemed under the federal securities laws) with"
"5742","a broker-dealer during the term of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"5743","obtain the approval of the Trusts Board of Trustees prior to commencement of"
"5744","transactions with such broker-dealer on behalf of the Portfolio or the Trust."
"5745","UBS Global AM further authorizes the Sub-Adviser and its Affiliated Broker-"
"5746","Dealers to execute agency cross transactions (the Cross Transactions) on"
"5747","behalf of the Portfolio and the Trust. Cross Transactions are transactions"
"5748","which may be effected by the Affiliated Broker-Dealers acting for both the"
"5749","Portfolio or the Trust and the counterparty to the transaction.  Cross"
"5750","Transactions enable the Sub-Adviser to purchase or sell a block of securities"
"5751","for the Portfolio or the Trust at a set price and possibly avoid an"
"5752","unfavorable price movement that may be created through entrance into the"
"5753","market with such purchase or sale order.  As such, the Sub-Adviser believes"
"5754","that Cross Transactions can provide meaningful benefits for the Portfolio and"
"5755","the Trust and its clients generally.  UBS Global AM, the Portfolio and the"
"5756","Trust should be aware, however, that in a Cross Transaction an Affiliated"
"5757","Broker-Dealer will be receiving commissions from both sides of the trade and,"
"5758","therefore, there is a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and"
"5759","responsibilities.  The Sub-Adviser shall effect such Cross Transactions in"
"5760","compliance with Rule 206(3)-2 under the Advisers Act, Rule 17a-7 under the"
"5761","1940 Act, and any other applicable provisions of the federal securities laws"
"5762","and shall provide UBS Global AM with periodic reports describing such agency"
"5763","cross transactions.  UBS Global AM understands that the authority of the Sub-"

"5766","notice from UBS Global AM, and that the failure to terminate such"
"5767","authorization will result in its continuation."
"5768","(g)     The Sub-Adviser shall maintain separate detailed records of all matters"
"5769","pertaining to the Portfolio or Segment, including, without limitation,"
"5770","brokerage and other records of all securities transactions.  Any records"

"5777","Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and will furnish the Board and UBS Global AM"
"5778","with such periodic and special reports as the Board or UBS Global AM may"
"5779","request."
"5780","(h)	At such times as shall be reasonably requested by the Board or UBS"
"5781","Global AM, the Sub-Adviser will provide the Board and UBS Global AM with"
"5782","economic and investment analyses and reports as well as quarterly reports"

"5880","shall bear all reasonable expenses of the Trust, if any, arising out of an"

"5882","6.	Compensation."
"5883","(a)	For the services provided and the expenses assumed by the Sub-Adviser"
"5884","pursuant to this Agreement, UBS Global AM, not the Portfolio, will pay to the"
"5885","Sub-Adviser a fee, computed daily and payable monthly, at an annual rate of"
"5886","0.70% of the average daily net assets of the Portfolio or Segment allocated"
"5887","to its management (computed in the manner specified in the Management"
"5888","Agreement), and will provide the Sub-Adviser with a schedule showing the"
"5889","manner in which the fee was computed.  If the Sub-Adviser is managing a"
"5890","Segment, its fees will be based on the value of the assets of the Portfolio"
"5891","within the Sub-Advisers Segment."
"5892","(b)	The fee shall be accrued daily and payable monthly to the Sub-Adviser"
"5893","on or before the last business day of the next succeeding calendar month."
"5894","(c)	For those periods in which UBS Global AM has agreed to waive all or a"
"5895","portion of its management fee, UBS Global AM may ask the Sub-Adviser to waive"
"5896","the same proportion of its fees, but the Sub-Adviser is under no obligation"
"5897","to do so."
"5898","(d)     If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates before the end of any"
"5899","month, the fee for the period from the effective date to the end of the month"
"5900","or from the beginning of such month to the date of termination, as the case"
"5901","may be, shall be pro-rated according to the proportion which such period"
"5902","bears to the full month in that such effectiveness or termination occurs."
"5903","7. Limitation of Liability."
"5904","(a) 	The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any error of judgment or"
"5905","mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Portfolio, the Trust or its"
"5906","shareholders or by UBS Global AM in connection with the matters to which this"
"5907","Agreement relates, except a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad"
"5908","faith or gross negligence on its part in the performance of its duties or"
"5909","from reckless disregard by it of its obligations and duties under this"
"5910","Agreement."
"5911","(b)	In no event will the Sub-Adviser have any responsibility for any other"
"5912","portfolio of the Trust, for any portion of the Portfolio not managed by the"
"5913","Sub-Adviser or for the acts or omissions of any Other Sub-Adviser to the"
"5914","Trust or Portfolio. In particular, in the event the Sub-Adviser shall manage"
"5915","only a Segment of the Portfolio, the Sub-Adviser shall have no responsibility"
"5916","for the Portfolios being in violation of any applicable law or regulation or"
"5917","investment policy or restriction applicable to the Portfolio as a whole or"
"5918","for the Portfolios failing to qualify as a regulated investment company under"
"5919","the Code, if the securities and other holdings of the Segment of the"
"5920","Portfolio managed by the"
"5921","Sub-Adviser are such that such Segment would not be in such violation or fail"
"5922","to so qualify if such Segment were deemed a separate series of the Trust or a"
"5923","separate regulated investment company under the Code, unless such violation"
"5924","was due to the Sub-Advisers failure to comply with written guidelines adopted"
"5925","by the Board or UBS Global AM and provided to the Sub-Adviser."
"5926","Nothing in this section shall be deemed a limitation or waiver of any"
"5927","obligation or duty that may not by law be limited or waived."
"5928","8.	Representations of Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser represents, warrants"

"5943","(b)     The Sub-Adviser has adopted a written code of ethics complying with the"

"5967","in any way refer directly or indirectly to its relationship with the Trust,"
"5968","the Portfolio, UBS Global AM or any of their respective affiliates in"
"5969","offering, marketing or other promotional materials without the express"
"5970","written consent of UBS Global AM."
"5971","(f)     The Sub-Adviser hereby represents that it has implemented policies and"
"5972","procedures designed to prevent the disclosure by it, its employees or its"
"5973","agents of the Trusts portfolio holdings to any person or entity other than"

"6111","Sub-Advisory Agreement"
"6112","Agreement dated as of August 9, 2010, between UBS Global Asset Management"
"6113","(Americas) Inc. (UBS Global AM), a Delaware corporation, and First Quadrant"
"6114","LP, a Delaware Partnership (Sub-Adviser) (the Agreement)."
"6115","Recitals"
"6116","(1)     UBS Global AM has entered into a Management Agreement dated as of"
"6117","August 1, 2008 (Management Agreement) with UBS PACE Select Advisors Trust"
"6118","(Trust), an open-end management investment company registered under the"
"6119","Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (1940 Act), with respect to the"
"6120","UBS PACE Alternative Strategies Investments (Portfolio);"
"6121","(2)	UBS Global AM desires to retain the Sub-Adviser to furnish certain"
"6122","investment advisory services to UBS Global AM and the Portfolio or a designated"
"6123","portion of the assets (Segment) of the Portfolio; and"
"6124","(3)	The Sub-Adviser is willing to furnish such services;"
"6125","Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants herein"
"6126","contained, the parties agree as follows:"
"6127","1.	Appointment.  UBS Global AM hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser as an"
"6128","investment Sub-Adviser with respect to the Portfolio or Segment for the period"
"6129","and on the terms set forth in this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser accepts that"
"6130","appointment and agrees to render the services herein set forth, for the"
"6131","compensation herein provided."
"6132","2.	Duties as Sub-Adviser."
"6133","(a)     Subject to the supervision and direction of the Trusts Board of"
"6134","Trustees (the Board) and review by UBS Global AM, and any written guidelines"
"6135","adopted by the Board or UBS Global AM, the Sub-Adviser will provide a"
"6136","continuous investment program for the Portfolio or Segment, including"
"6137","investment research and discretionary management with respect to all securities"
"6138","and investments and cash equivalents in the Portfolio or Segment.  The"
"6139","Sub-Adviser will determine from time to time what investments will be"
"6140","purchased, retained or sold by the Portfolio or Segment.  The Sub-Adviser will"
"6141","be responsible for placing purchase and sell orders for investments and for"
"6142","other related transactions for the Portfolio or Segment.  The Sub-Adviser"
"6143","understands that the Portfolios assets need to be managed so as to permit the"
"6144","Portfolio to qualify or to continue to qualify as a regulated investment"
"6145","company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (Code)."
"6146","The Sub-Adviser will provide services under this Agreement in accordance with"
"6147","the Portfolios investment objective, policies and restrictions as stated in the"
"6148","Trusts currently effective registration statement under the 1940 Act, and any"
"6149","amendments or supplements thereto (Registration Statement).  The Sub-Adviser,"
"6150","on each business day, shall provide UBS Global AM and the Trusts custodian"
"6151","such information as UBS Global Americas and the Trusts custodian may reasonably"
"6152","request relating to all transactions concerning the Portfolio or Segment."
"6153","(b)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not consult with any other Sub-"
"6154","Adviser  (Other Sub-Adviser) for the Trust or Portfolio concerning any"
"6155","transaction by the Portfolio or Segment in securities or other assets,"
"6156","including (i) the purchase by the Portfolio or Segment of a security issued by"
"6157","the Other Sub-Adviser, or an affiliate of the Other Sub-Adviser, to the Trust"
"6158","or Portfolio except as permitted by the 1940 Act or (ii) transactions by the"
"6159","Portfolio or Segment in any security for which the Other Sub-Adviser, or its"
"6160","affiliate, is the principal underwriter."
"6161","(c)	Unless otherwise instructed by UBS Global AM or the Trust, the Sub-"
"6162","Adviser agrees that it will be responsible for voting proxies of issuers of"
"6163","securities held by the Portfolio or Segment.  The Sub-Adviser further agrees"
"6164","that it will adopt written proxy voting procedures that shall comply with the"
"6165","requirements of the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as"
"6166","amended (Advisers Act) (Proxy Voting Policy), and that shall be acceptable to"
"6167","the Board.  The Sub-Adviser shall also provide its Proxy Voting Policy, and if"
"6168","requested by UBS Global AM, a summary of such Proxy Voting Policy for inclusion"
"6169","in the Trusts registration statement, and will provide UBS Global AM with any"
"6170","material amendment to the Proxy Voting Policy within a reasonable time after"
"6171","such amendment has taken effect.  The Sub-Adviser further agrees that it will"
"6172","provide the Board on or before August 1st of each year, or more frequently as"
"6173","the Board may reasonably request, with a written report of the proxies voted"
"6174","during the most recent 12-month period ending June 30, or such other period as"
"6175","the Board may designate, in a format that shall comply with the 1940 Act and"
"6176","that shall be acceptable to the Board."
"6177","(d)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that, in placing orders with brokers, it will"
"6178","obtain the best net result in terms of price and execution; provided that, on"
"6179","behalf of the Portfolio or Segment, the Sub-Adviser may, in its discretion, use"
"6180","brokers who provide the Sub-Adviser with research, analysis, advice and similar"
"6181","services to execute portfolio transactions on behalf of the Portfolio or"
"6182","Segment, and the Sub-Adviser may pay to those brokers in return for brokerage"
"6183","and research services a higher commission than may be charged by other brokers,"
"6184","subject to the Sub-Advisers determining in good faith that such commission is"
"6185","reasonable in terms either of the particular transaction or of the overall"
"6186","responsibility of the Sub-Adviser to the Portfolio or Segment and its other"
"6187","clients and that the total commissions paid by the Portfolio or Segment will be"
"6188","reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio over the long term. In"
"6189","no instance will portfolio securities be purchased from or sold to UBS Global"
"6190","AM or the Sub-Adviser, the Trusts principal underwriter, or any affiliated"
"6191","person thereof, except in accordance with the federal securities laws and the"
"6192","rules and regulations thereunder.  The Sub-Adviser may aggregate sales and"
"6193","purchase orders of the assets of the Portfolio or Segment with similar orders"
"6194","being made simultaneously for other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser or its"
"6195","affiliates.  Whenever the Sub-Adviser simultaneously places orders to purchase"
"6196","or sell the same security on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment and one or more"
"6197","other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser, the orders will be allocated as to"
"6198","price and amount among all such accounts in a manner believed to be equitable"
"6199","over time to each account. UBS Global AM recognizes that in some cases this"
"6200","procedure may adversely affect the results obtained for the Portfolio or"
"6201","Segment."
"6202","Subject to the Sub-Advisers obligations to seek best execution, UBS Global AM"
"6203","agrees that the Sub-Adviser, in its sole discretion, may place transactions"
"6204","on behalf of the Portfolio and the Trust or with any broker-dealer deemed to"
"6205","be an affiliate of the Sub-Adviser (the Affiliated Broker-Dealers) so long as"
"6206","such transactions are effected in conformity with the requirements (including"
"6207","any applicable exemptions and administrative interpretations set forth in"
"6208","Part II of the Sub-Advisers Form ADV Registration Statement on file with the"
"6209","Securities and Exchange Commission (Form ADV)) of Section 11(a)(1)(H) of the"
"6210","Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and in compliance with Rules 17e-1 or 10f-3"
"6211","under the 1940 Act or other applicable rules and the Trusts policies and"
"6212","procedures thereunder.  In all such dealings, the Affiliated Broker-Dealers"
"6213","shall be authorized and entitled to retain any commissions, remuneration or"
"6214","profits which may be made in such transactions and shall not be liable to"
"6215","account for the same to UBS Global AM, the Portfolio or the Trust. In the"
"6216","event Sub-Adviser becomes affiliated (as deemed under the federal securities"
"6217","laws) with a broker-dealer during the term of this Agreement, Sub-Adviser"
"6218","shall obtain the approval of the Trusts Board of Trustees prior to"
"6219","commencement of transactions with such broker-dealer on behalf of the"
"6220","Portfolio or the Trust."
"6221","UBS Global AM further authorizes the Sub-Adviser and its Affiliated Broker-"
"6222","Dealers to execute agency cross transactions (the Cross Transactions) on"
"6223","behalf of the Portfolio and the Trust.  Cross Transactions are transactions"
"6224","which may be effected by the Affiliated Broker-Dealers acting for both the"
"6225","Portfolio or the Trust and the counterparty to the transaction.  Cross"
"6226","Transactions enable the Sub-Adviser to purchase or sell a block of securities"
"6227","for the Portfolio or the Trust at a set price and possibly avoid an"
"6228","unfavorable price movement that may be created through entrance into the"
"6229","market with such purchase or sale order.  As such, the Sub-Adviser believes"
"6230","that Cross Transactions can provide meaningful benefits for the Portfolio and"
"6231","the Trust and its clients generally.  UBS Global AM, the Portfolio and the"
"6232","Trust should be aware, however, that in a Cross Transaction an Affiliated"
"6233","Broker-Dealer will be receiving commissions from both sides of the trade and,"
"6234","therefore, there is a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and"
"6235","responsibilities.  Sub-Adviser shall effect such Cross Transactions in"
"6236","compliance with Rule 206(3)-2 under the Advisers Act, Rule 17a-7 under the"
"6237","1940 Act, and any other applicable provisions of the federal securities laws"
"6238","and shall provide UBS Global Americas with periodic reports describing such"
"6239","agency cross transactions."
"6240","Subject to any other written instructions of UBS Global AM or the Trust, the"
"6241","Sub-Adviser is hereby appointed UBS Global AMs and the Trusts agent and"
"6242","attorney-in-fact for the limited purposes of executing account documentation,"
"6243","agreements, contracts and other documents as the Sub-Adviser shall be"
"6244","requested by brokers, dealers, counterparties and other persons in connection"
"6245","with its management of the Portfolio or Segment, provided that, the Sub-"
"6246","Advisers actions in executing such documents shall comply with federal"
"6247","regulations, all other federal laws applicable to registered investment"
"6248","companies and the Sub-Advisers duties and obligations under this Agreement"
"6249","and the Trusts governing documents."
"6250","(e)     The Sub-Adviser shall maintain separate detailed records of all matters"
"6251","pertaining to the Portfolio or Segment, including, without limitation,"
"6252","brokerage and other records of all securities transactions.  Any records"
"6253","required to be maintained and preserved pursuant to the provisions of Rule"
"6254","31a-1 and Rule 31a-2 promulgated under the 1940 Act that are prepared or"
"6255","maintained by the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the Trust are the property of the"
"6256","Trust and will be surrendered promptly to the Trust upon request.  The Sub-"
"6257","Adviser further agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed in Rule 31a-2"
"6258","under the 1940 Act the records required to be maintained under Rule 31a-1"
"6259","under the 1940 Act."
"6260","(f)     At such times as shall be reasonably requested by the Board or UBS"
"6261","Global AM, the Sub-Adviser will provide the Board and UBS Global AM with"
"6262","economic and investment analyses and reports as well as quarterly reports"
"6263","setting forth the performance of the Portfolio or Segment and make available"
"6264","to the Board and UBS Global AM any economic, statistical and investment"
"6265","services that the Sub-Adviser normally makes available to its institutional"
"6266","or other customers."
"6267","(g)     In accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, as amended from"
"6268","time to time, the Sub-Adviser is responsible for assisting in the fair"
"6269","valuation of all portfolio securities and will use its reasonable efforts to"
"6270","arrange for the provision of a price(s) from one or more parties independent of"
"6271","the Sub-Adviser for each portfolio security for which the custodian does not"
"6272","obtain prices in the ordinary course of business from an automated pricing"
"6273","service."
"6274","The Sub-Adviser also will provide such information or perform such additional"
"6275","acts as are customarily performed by a Sub-Adviser and may be required for"
"6276","the Trust or UBS Global Americas to comply with their respective obligations"
"6277","under applicable federal securities laws, including, without limitation, the"
"6278","1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the 1934 Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as"
"6279","amended (the Securities Act), and any rule or regulation thereunder."
"6280","3.	Further Duties.  In all matters relating to the performance of this"
"6281","Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will act in conformity with the Trusts Trust"
"6282","Instrument, By-Laws and Registration Statement, the Trusts policies and"
"6283","procedures for compliance by the Trust with the Federal Securities Laws (as"
"6284","that term is defined in Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act) provided to the Sub-"
"6285","Adviser (together, the Trust Compliance Procedures) and with the written"
"6286","instructions and written directions of the Board and UBS Global AM; and will"
"6287","comply with the applicable requirements of the 1940 Act, the Investment"
"6288","Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (Advisers Act), and the rules under each, the"
"6289","Code, and all other applicable federal and state laws and regulations"
"6290","applicable to the Trust and the Portfolio. UBS Global AM agrees to provide to"
"6291","the Sub-Adviser copies of the Trusts Trust Instrument, By-Laws, Registration"
"6292","Statement,  Trusts Compliance Procedures, written instructions and directions"
"6293","of the Board and UBS Global AM, and any amendments or supplements to any of"
"6294","these materials as soon as practicable after such materials become available;"
"6295","provided, however, that the Sub-Advisers duty under this Agreement to act in"
"6296","conformity with any document, instruction or guideline produced by the Trust or"
"6297","UBS Global AM shall not arise until it has been delivered to the Sub-Adviser."
"6298","Any changes to the objectives, policies and restrictions will make due"
"6299","allowance for the time within which the Sub-Adviser shall have to come into"
"6300","compliance.  UBS Global AM further agrees to identify to the Sub-Adviser in"
"6301","writing any broker-dealers that are affiliated with UBS Global AM (other than"
"6302","UBS Financial Services Inc. and UBS Global Asset Management (US) Inc.)."
"6303","In order to assist the Trust and the Trusts Chief Compliance Officer (the Trust"
"6304","CCO) to satisfy the requirements contained in Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act,"
"6305","the Sub-Adviser shall provide to the Trust CCO:  (i) direct access to the Sub-"
"6306","Advisers chief compliance officer (the Sub-Adviser CCO), as reasonably"
"6307","requested by the Trust CCO; (ii) quarterly reports confirming that the Sub-"
"6308","Adviser has complied with the Trust Compliance Procedures in managing the"
"6309","Portfolio or Segment; and (iii) quarterly certifications that there were no"
"6310","Material Compliance Matters (as that term is defined by Rule 38a-1(e)(2)) that"
"6311","arose under the Trust Compliance Procedures that related to the Sub-Advisers"
"6312","management of the Portfolio or Segment."
"6313","The Sub-Adviser shall promptly provide the Trust CCO with copies of:  (i) the"
"6314","Sub-Advisers policies and procedures for compliance by the Sub-Adviser with the"
"6315","Federal Securities Laws (together, the Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures), and"
"6316","(ii) any material changes to the Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures.  The Sub-"
"6317","Adviser shall cooperate fully with the Trust CCO so as to facilitate the Trust"
"6318","CCOs performance of the Trust CCOs responsibilities under Rule 38a-1 to review,"
"6319","evaluate and report to the Trusts Board on the operation of the Sub-Adviser"
"6320","Compliance Procedures, and shall promptly report to the Trust CCO any Material"
"6321","Compliance Matter arising under the Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures involving"
"6322","the Portfolio or Segment.  The Sub-Adviser shall provide to the Trust CCO:  (i)"
"6323","quarterly reports confirming the Sub-Advisers compliance with the Sub-Adviser"
"6324","Compliance Procedures in managing the Portfolio or Segment, and (ii)"
"6325","certifications that there were no Material Compliance Matters involving the"
"6326","Sub-Adviser that arose under the Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures that"
"6327","affected the Portfolio or Segment.  At least annually, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"6328","provide a certification to the Trust CCO to the effect that the Sub-Adviser has"
"6329","in place and has implemented policies and procedures that are reasonably"
"6330","designed to ensure compliance by the Sub-Adviser with the Federal Securities"
"6331","Laws."
"6332","The Sub-Adviser will provide UBS Global AM with information (including"
"6333","information that is required to be disclosed in the Trusts registration"
"6334","statement) with respect to the portfolio managers responsible for the Portfolio"
"6335","or Segment and any changes in the portfolio managers responsible for the"
"6336","Portfolio or Segment."
"6337","The Sub-Adviser will promptly notify UBS Global AM of any pending"
"6338","investigation, material litigation, administrative proceeding or any other"
"6339","significant regulatory inquiry."
"6340","The Sub-Adviser will cooperate promptly and fully with UBS Global AM and/or the"
"6341","Trust in responding to any regulatory or compliance examinations or inspections"
"6342","(including information requests) relating to the Trust, the Portfolio or UBS"
"6343","Global AM brought by any governmental or regulatory authorities having"
"6344","appropriate jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, the SEC)."
"6345","4.     Expenses.  During the term of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will bear"
"6346","all expenses incurred by it in connection with its services under this"
"6347","Agreement.  The Sub-Adviser shall not be responsible for any expenses incurred"
"6348","by the Trust, the Portfolio or UBS Global AM."
"6349","Upon request by UBS Global AM, Sub-Adviser agrees to reimburse UBS Global"
"6350","Americas or the Trust for costs associated with generating and distributing any"
"6351","supplement or amendment to the Prospectuses or SAIs for any Fund (Supplement)"
"6352","when the Sub-Adviser is given a copy of a draft of such Supplement at least"
"6353","five business days ahead of the due date and fails to promptly disclose to the"
"6354","Adviser facts then known to the Sub-Adviser or its personnel that would require"
"6355","disclosure (or amendments to disclosure) in the Funds Prospectuses or SAIs in"
"6356","time for such disclosure or amendments to disclosure to be included in such"
"6357","Supplement.  The Sub-Adviser shall bear all reasonable expenses of the Trust,"
"6358","if any, arising out of an assignment or change in control of the Sub-Adviser."
"6359","5.	Compensation."
"6360","(a)	For the services provided and the expenses assumed by the Sub-Adviser"
"6361","pursuant to this Agreement, UBS Global AM, not the Portfolio, will pay to the"
"6362","Sub-Adviser a fee, computed daily and payable monthly, at an annual rate of"
"6363","0.90% of the average daily net assets of the Portfolio or Segment that the"
"6364","Sub-Adviser manages (computed in the manner specified in the Management"
"6365","Agreement), and will provide the Sub-Adviser with a schedule showing the"
"6366","manner in which the fee was computed.  If the Sub-Adviser is managing a"
"6367","Segment, its fees will be based on the value of the assets of the Portfolio"
"6368","within the Sub-Advisers Segment."
"6369","(b)     The fee shall be computed daily and payable monthly to the Sub-Adviser"
"6370","on or before the last business day of the next succeeding calendar month."
"6371","(c)	For those periods in which UBS Global AM has agreed to waive all or a"
"6372","portion of its management fee, UBS Global AM may ask the Sub-Adviser to waive"
"6373","the same proportion of its fees, but the Sub-Adviser is under no obligation"
"6374","to do so."
"6375","(d)     If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates before the end of any"
"6376","month, the fee for the period from the effective date to the end of the month"
"6377","or from the beginning of such month to the date of termination, as the case may"
"6378","be, shall be prorated according to the proportion which such period bears to"
"6379","the full month in which such effectiveness or termination occurs."
"6380","6.	Limitation of Liability."
"6381","(a)     The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any error of judgment or"
"6382","mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Portfolio, the Trust or its"
"6383","shareholders or by UBS Global AM in connection with the matters to which this"
"6384","Agreement relates, except a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith"
"6385","or gross negligence on its part in the performance of its duties or from"
"6386","reckless disregard by it of its obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"6387","(b)     In no event will the Sub-Adviser have any responsibility for any other"
"6388","portfolio of the Trust, for any portion of the Portfolio not managed by the"
"6389","Sub-Adviser or for the acts or omissions of any Other Sub-Adviser to the Trust"
"6390","or Portfolio."
"6391","In particular, in the event the Sub-Adviser shall manage only a portion of the"
"6392","Portfolios Segment of the Portfolio, the Sub-Adviser shall have no"
"6393","responsibility for the Portfolios being in violation of any applicable law or"
"6394","regulation or investment policy or restriction applicable to the Portfolio as a"
"6395","whole or for the Portfolios failing to qualify as a regulated investment"
"6396","company under the Code, if the securities and other holdings of the Segment of"
"6397","the Portfolio managed by the Sub-Adviser are such that such Segment would not"
"6398","be in such violation or fail to so qualify if such Segment were deemed a"
"6399","separate series of the Trust or separate regulated investment company under the"
"6400","Code, unless such violation was due to the Sub-Advisers failure to comply with"
"6401","written guidelines adopted by the Board or UBS Global AM and provided to the"
"6402","Sub-Adviser."
"6403","7.     Representations of Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser represents, warrants"
"6404","and agrees as follows:"
"6405","(a)	The Sub-Adviser (i) is registered as an investment adviser under the"
"6406","Advisers Act and will continue to be so registered for so long as this"
"6407","Agreement remains in effect; (ii) is not prohibited by the 1940 Act or the"
"6408","Advisers Act from performing the services contemplated by this Agreement; (iii)"
"6409","has met, and will seek to continue to meet for so long as this Agreement"
"6410","remains in effect, any other applicable federal or state requirements, or the"
"6411","applicable requirements of any regulatory or industry self-regulatory agency"
"6412","necessary to be met in order to perform the services contemplated by this"
"6413","Agreement; (iv) has the authority to enter into and perform the services"
"6414","contemplated by this Agreement; and (v) will promptly notify UBS Global AM of"
"6415","the occurrence of any event that would disqualify the Sub-Adviser from serving"
"6416","as an investment adviser of an investment company pursuant to Section 9(a) of"
"6417","the 1940 Act or otherwise."
"6418","(b)     The Sub-Adviser has adopted a written code of ethics complying with the"
"6419","requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the"
"6420","Advisers Act and will provide UBS Global AM and the Board with a copy of such"
"6421","code of ethics, together with evidence of its adoption.  Within fifteen days of"
"6422","the end of the last calendar quarter of each year that this Agreement is in"
"6423","effect, a duly authorized officer of the Sub-Adviser shall certify to UBS"
"6424","Global AM that the Sub-Adviser has complied with the requirements of Rule 17j-1"
"6425","during the previous year and that there has been no material violation of the"
"6426","Sub-Advisers code of ethics or, if such a violation has occurred, that"
"6427","appropriate action was taken in response to such violation. Upon the written"
"6428","request of UBS Global AM, the Sub-Adviser shall permit UBS Global AM, its"
"6429","employees or its agents to examine the reports required to be made to the Sub-"
"6430","Adviser by Rule 17j-1(c)(1) and all other records relevant to the Sub-Advisers"
"6431","code of ethics."
"6432","(c)     The Sub-Adviser has provided UBS Global AM with a copy of its Form ADV"
"6433","as most recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and"
"6434","promptly will furnish a copy of all amendments to UBS Global AM at least"
"6435","annually."
"6436","(d)     The Sub-Adviser will notify UBS Global AM of any change of control of"
"6437","the Sub-Adviser, including any change of its general partners or 25%"
"6438","shareholders or 25% limited partners, as applicable, and any changes in the key"
"6439","personnel who are either the portfolio manager(s) of the Portfolio or senior"
"6440","management of the Sub-Adviser, in each case prior to or promptly after such"
"6441","change."
"6442","(e)     The Sub-Adviser agrees that neither it nor any of its affiliates will"
"6443","in any way refer directly or indirectly to its relationship with the Trust, the"

"6507","the 1940 Act and the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to"
"6508","the conflicts of laws principles thereof. To the extent that the applicable"
"6509","laws of the State of New York conflict with the applicable provisions of the"
"6510","1940 Act, the latter shall control."
"6511","12.	Confidentiality.  The Sub-Adviser will treat as proprietary and"
"6512","confidential any information obtained in connection with its duties hereunder,"
"6513","including all records and information pertaining to the Series and its prior,"

"6515","information for any purpose other than the performance of its responsibilities"

"6521","13.	Use of Name."
"6522","(a)  It is understood that the names UBS and PACE or any derivative thereof or"

"6524","its affiliates, and that Sub-Adviser has the right to use such name (or"
"6525","derivative or logo) only with the approval of the UBS Global AM and only so"
"6526","long as the UBS Global AM is Manager to the Trust and/or the Fund."

"6547","restrictive by a rule, regulation or order of the SEC, whether of special or"
"6548","general application, such provision shall be deemed to incorporate the effect"

"6551","15.     Notices.  Any notice herein required is to be in writing and is deemed"

"6579","SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT"
"6580","        Agreement dated as of May 25, 2010 between UBS Global Asset Management"
"6581","(Americas) Inc. (UBS Global AM), a Delaware corporation, and Roxbury Capital"
"6582","Management, LLC (Sub- Adviser), a Delaware Limited Liability Company (the"
"6583","Agreement)."
"6584","RECITALS"
"6585","(1)     UBS Global AM has entered into a Management Agreement dated as of"
"6586","August 1, 2008  (Management Agreement), with UBS PACE Select Advisors Trust"
"6587","(Trust), an open-end management investment company registered under the"
"6588","Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (1940 Act), with respect to UBS"
"6589","PACE Large Co Growth Equity Investments  (Portfolio); and"
"6590","(2) 	UBS Global AM is authorized to retain one or more sub-advisers to"
"6591","furnish certain investment advisory services to UBS Global AM and the"
"6592","Portfolio;"
"6593","(3)	UBS Global AM desires to retain the Sub-Adviser to furnish certain"
"6594","investment advisory services to UBS Global AM and the Portfolio or a"
"6595","designated portion of the assets (Segment) of the Portfolio; and"
"6596","(4)	The Sub-Adviser is willing to furnish such services;"
"6597","Now therefore, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants herein"
"6598","contained, UBS Global AM and the Sub-Adviser agree as follows:"
"6599","1.	Appointment.  UBS Global AM hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser as an"
"6600","investment sub-adviser with respect to the Portfolio or Segment for the"
"6601","period and on the terms set forth in this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser accepts"
"6602","that appointment and agrees to render the services herein set forth, for the"
"6603","compensation herein provided."
"6604","2.	Duties as Sub-Adviser."
"6605","(a)	Subject to the supervision and direction of the Trusts Board of"
"6606","Trustees (the Board) and review by UBS Global AM, and any written guidelines"
"6607","adopted by the Board or UBS Global AM the Sub-Adviser will provide a"
"6608","continuous investment program for the Portfolio or Segment, including"
"6609","investment research and discretionary management with respect to all"
"6610","securities and investments and cash equivalents in the Portfolio or Segment."
"6611","The Sub-Adviser will determine from time to time what investments will be"
"6612","purchased, retained or sold by the Portfolio or Segment.  The Sub-Adviser"
"6613","will be responsible for placing purchase and sell orders for investments and"
"6614","for other related transactions for the Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-Adviser"
"6615","understands that the Portfolios assets need to be managed so as to permit the"
"6616","Portfolio to qualify or to continue to qualify as a regulated investment"
"6617","company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (Code)."
"6618","The Sub-Adviser will provide services under this Agreement in accordance with"
"6619","the Portfolios investment objective, policies and restrictions as stated in"
"6620","the Trusts currently effective registration statement under the 1940 Act, and"
"6621","any amendments or supplements thereto (Registration Statement).  The Sub-"
"6622","Adviser, on each business day, shall provide UBS Global AM and the Trusts"
"6623","custodian such information as UBS Global AM and the Trusts custodian may"
"6624","reasonably request relating to all transactions concerning the Portfolio or"
"6625","Segment."
"6626","UBS Global AM hereby designates and appoints the Sub-Adviser as its and the"
"6627","Portfolios limited purpose agent and attorney-in-fact, without further prior"
"6628","approval of UBS Global AM (except as expressly provided for herein or as may"
"6629","be required by law) to make and execute, in the name and on behalf of the"
"6630","Portfolio, all agreements, instruments and other documents and to take all"
"6631","such other action which the Sub-Adviser considers necessary or advisable to"
"6632","carry out its duties hereunder. By way of example and not by way of"
"6633","limitation, in connection with any purchase for the  Portfolio or Segment of"
"6634","securities or instruments that are not registered under the U.S. Securities"
"6635","Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), the Sub-Adviser shall have the"
"6636","full power and authority, among other things, to: (i) commit to purchase such"
"6637","securities for the Portfolio on the terms and conditions under which such"
"6638","securities are offered; (ii) execute such account opening and other"
"6639","agreements, instruments and documents (including, without limitation,"
"6640","purchase agreements, subscription documents, ISDA and other swap and"
"6641","derivative documents), and make such commitments, as may be required in"
"6642","connection with the purchase and sale of such securities or instruments;"
"6643","(iii) represent that the Portfolio is an accredited investor as defined in"
"6644","Rule 501 (a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act and a Qualified"
"6645","Institutional Buyer as defined in Rule 144A (a) (1) (i) under the Securities"
"6646","Act; and (iv) commit that such securities will not be offered or sold by the"
"6647","Portfolio except in compliance with the registration requirements of the"
"6648","Securities Act or an exemption therefrom. This power-of-attorney is a"
"6649","continuing power-of-attorney and shall remain in full force and effect until"
"6650","revoked by UBS Global AM or the Trust in writing, but any such revocation"
"6651","shall not affect any transaction initiated prior to receipt by the Sub-"
"6652","Adviser of such notice."
"6653","(b)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not consult with any other sub-"
"6654","adviser (Other Sub-Adviser) for the Trust or Portfolio concerning any"
"6655","transaction by the Portfolio or Segment in securities or other assets,"
"6656","including (i) the purchase by the Portfolio or Segment of a security issued"
"6657","by the Other Sub-Adviser, or an affiliate of the Other Sub-Adviser, to the"
"6658","Trust or Portfolio except as permitted by the 1940 Act or (ii) transactions"
"6659","by the Portfolio or Segment in any security for which the Other Sub-Adviser,"
"6660","or its affiliate, is the principal underwriter."
"6661","(c)	Unless otherwise instructed by UBS Global AM or the Trust, the Sub-"
"6662","Adviser agrees that it will be responsible for voting proxies of issuers of"
"6663","securities held by the Portfolio or Segment.  The Sub-Adviser further agrees"
"6664","that it will adopt written proxy voting procedures that shall comply with the"
"6665","requirements of the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as"
"6666","amended (Advisers Act) (Proxy Voting Policy), and that shall be acceptable to"
"6667","the Board.  The Sub-Adviser shall also provide its Proxy Voting Policy, and"
"6668","if requested by UBS Global AM, a summary of such Proxy Voting Policy for"
"6669","inclusion in the Trusts registration statement, and will provide UBS Global"
"6670","AM with any material amendment to the Proxy Voting Policy within a reasonable"
"6671","time after such amendment has taken effect.  The Sub-Adviser further agrees"
"6672","that it will provide the Board on or before August 1st of each year, or more"
"6673","frequently as the Board may reasonably request, with a written report of the"
"6674","proxies voted during the most recent 12-month period ending June 30, or such"
"6675","other period as the Board may designate, in a format that shall comply with"
"6676","the 1940 Act and that shall be acceptable to the Board."
"6677","(d) The Sub-Adviser agrees that upon the request of UBS Global AM or the"
"6678","Board, Sub-Adviser shall exercise the rights incident to the securities held"
"6679","by the Portfolio or Segment in the context of a bankruptcy or other"
"6680","reorganization.  The Sub-Adviser further agrees that it will keep UBS Global"
"6681","AM fully informed about any such actions that it intends to take."
"6682","(e)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will place orders with brokers in"
"6683","accordance with best execution policies, taking into account best price as an"
"6684","important factor in this decision, provided that, on behalf of the Portfolio"
"6685","or Segment, the Sub-Adviser may, in its discretion, use brokers that provide"
"6686","the Sub-Adviser with research, analysis, advice and similar services to"
"6687","execute portfolio transactions on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment, and the"
"6688","Sub-Adviser may pay to those brokers in return for brokerage and research"
"6689","services a higher commission than may be charged by other brokers, subject to"
"6690","the Sub-Advisers determination in good faith that such commission is"
"6691","reasonable in terms either of the particular transaction or of the overall"
"6692","responsibility of the Sub-Adviser to the Portfolio or Segment and its other"
"6693","clients and that the total commissions paid by the Portfolio or Segment will"
"6694","be reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio or Segment over"
"6695","the long term.  In no instance will portfolio securities be purchased from or"
"6696","sold to UBS Global AM or the Sub-Adviser, the Trusts principal underwriter,"
"6697","or any affiliated person thereof, except in accordance with the federal"
"6698","securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.  The Sub-Adviser"
"6699","may aggregate sales and purchase orders with respect to the assets of the"
"6700","Portfolio or Segment with similar orders being made simultaneously for other"
"6701","accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates.  Whenever the Sub-"
"6702","Adviser simultaneously places orders to purchase or sell the same security on"
"6703","behalf of the Portfolio or Segment and one or more other accounts advised by"
"6704","the Sub-Adviser, the orders will be allocated as to price and amount among"
"6705","all such accounts in a manner believed to be equitable over time to each"
"6706","account.  UBS Global AM recognizes that in some cases this procedure may"
"6707","adversely affect the results obtained for the Portfolio or Segment."
"6708","Subject to the Sub-Advisers obligations to seek best execution, UBS Global AM"
"6709","agrees that the Sub-Adviser, in its sole discretion, may place transactions"
"6710","on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment and the Trust with any broker-dealer"
"6711","deemed to be an affiliate (including affiliated FCMs) of the Sub-Adviser (the"
"6712","Affiliated Broker-Dealers) so long as such transactions are effected in"
"6713","conformity with the requirements (including any applicable exemptions and"
"6714","administrative interpretations set forth in Part II of the Sub-Advisers Form"
"6715","ADV Registration Statement on file with the Securities and Exchange"
"6716","Commission (Form ADV)) of Section 11(a)(1)(H) of the Securities Exchange Act"
"6717","of 1934 (the 1934 Act), and in compliance with Rules 17e-1 or 10f-3 under the"
"6718","1940 Act or other applicable rules and the Trusts policies and procedures"
"6719","thereunder.  In all such dealings, the Affiliated Broker-Dealers shall be"
"6720","authorized and entitled to retain any commissions, remuneration or profits"
"6721","which may be made in such transactions and shall not be liable to account for"
"6722","the same to UBS Global AM, the Portfolio or the Trust.  In the event Sub-"
"6723","Adviser becomes affiliated (as deemed under the federal securities laws) with"
"6724","a broker-dealer during the term of this Agreement, Sub-Adviser shall obtain"
"6725","the approval of the Trusts Board of Trustees prior to commencement of"
"6726","transactions with such broker-dealer on behalf of the Portfolio or the Trust."
"6727","UBS Global AM further authorizes the Sub-Adviser and its Affiliated Broker-"
"6728","Dealers to execute agency cross transactions (the Cross Transactions) on"
"6729","behalf of the Portfolio and the Trust. Cross Transactions are transactions"
"6730","which may be effected by the Affiliated Broker-Dealers acting for both the"
"6731","Portfolio or the Trust and the counterparty to the transaction.  Cross"
"6732","Transactions enable the Sub-Adviser to purchase or sell a block of securities"
"6733","for the Portfolio or the Trust at a set price and possibly avoid an"
"6734","unfavorable price movement that may be created through entrance into the"
"6735","market with such purchase or sale order.  As such, the Sub-Adviser believes"
"6736","that Cross Transactions can provide meaningful benefits for the Portfolio and"
"6737","the Trust and its clients generally.  UBS Global AM, the Portfolio and the"
"6738","Trust should be aware, however, that in a Cross Transaction an Affiliated"
"6739","Broker-Dealer will be receiving commissions from both sides of the trade and,"
"6740","therefore, there is a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and"
"6741","responsibilities.  Sub-Adviser shall effect such Cross Transactions in"
"6742","compliance with Rule 206(3)-2 under the Advisers Act, Rule 17a-7 under the"
"6743","1940 Act, and any other applicable provisions of the federal securities laws"
"6744","and shall provide UBS Global AM with periodic reports describing such agency"
"6745","cross transactions.  UBS Global AM understands that the authority of the Sub-"
"6746","Adviser to execute agency Cross Transactions for the Portfolio is terminable"
"6747","at will without penalty, effective upon receipt by the Sub-Adviser of written"
"6748","notice from UBS Global AM, and that the failure to terminate such"
"6749","authorization will result in its continuation."
"6750","(f)     The Sub-Adviser shall maintain separate detailed records of all matters"
"6751","pertaining to the Portfolio or Segment, including, without limitation,"
"6752","brokerage and other records of all securities transactions.  Any records"
"6753","required to be maintained and preserved pursuant to the provisions of Rule"
"6754","31a-1 and Rule 31a-2 promulgated under the 1940 Act that are prepared or"
"6755","maintained by the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the Trust are the property of the"
"6756","Trust and will be surrendered promptly to the Trust upon request. The Sub-"
"6757","Adviser further agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed in"
"6758","Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the records required to be maintained under"
"6759","Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and will furnish the Board and UBS Global AM"
"6760","with such periodic and special reports as the Board or UBS Global AM may"
"6761","request."
"6762","(g)	At such times as shall be reasonably requested by the Board or UBS"
"6763","Global AM, the Sub-Adviser will provide the Board and UBS Global AM with"
"6764","economic and investment analyses and reports as well as quarterly reports"
"6765","setting forth the performance of the Portfolio or Segment and make available"
"6766","to the Board and UBS Global AM any economic, statistical and investment"
"6767","services that the Sub-Adviser normally makes available to its institutional"
"6768","or other customers."
"6769","(h)	In accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, as amended from"
"6770","time to time, the Sub-Adviser is responsible for assisting the Board and UBS"
"6771","Global AM in the fair valuation of all portfolio securities in the Portfolio"
"6772","or Segment and will use its reasonable efforts to arrange for the provision"
"6773","of a price or prices from one or more parties independent of the Sub-Adviser"
"6774","for each portfolio security for which the custodian does not obtain prices in"
"6775","the ordinary course of business from an automated pricing service."
"6776","The Sub-Adviser also will provide such information or perform such additional"
"6777","acts as are customarily performed by a Sub-Adviser and may be required for"
"6778","the Trust or UBS Global AM to comply with their respective obligations under"
"6779","applicable federal securities laws, including, without limitation, the"
"6780","1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the 1934 Act, the Securities Act, and any rule or"
"6781","regulation thereunder."
"6782","3.	Further Duties.  In all matters relating to the performance of this"
"6783","Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will seek to act in conformity with the Trusts"
"6784","Trust Instrument, By-Laws and Registration Statement, the Trusts policies and"
"6785","procedures for compliance by the Trust with the Federal Securities Laws (as"
"6786","that term is defined in Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act) provided to the Sub-"
"6787","Adviser (together, the Trust Compliance Procedures) and with the written"
"6788","instructions and written directions of the Board and UBS Global AM, and will"
"6789","comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act, and the Advisers Act, and the"
"6790","rules under each, the Code, and all other federal and state laws and"
"6791","regulations applicable to the Trust and the Portfolio. UBS Global AM agrees"
"6792","to provide to the Sub-Adviser copies of the Trusts Trust Instrument, By-Laws,"
"6793","Registration Statement, Trusts Compliance Procedures, written instructions"
"6794","and directions of the Board and UBS Global AM, and any amendments or"
"6795","supplements to any of these materials as soon as practicable after such"
"6796","materials become available.  UBS Global AM further agrees to identify to the"
"6797","Sub-Adviser in writing any broker-dealers that are affiliated with UBS Global"
"6798","AM (other than UBS Financial Services Inc. and UBS Global Asset Management"
"6799","(US) Inc.)."
"6800","In order to assist the Trust and the Trusts Chief Compliance Officer (the"
"6801","Trust CCO) to satisfy the requirements contained in Rule 38a-1 under the 1940"
"6802","Act, the Sub-Adviser shall provide to the Trust CCO:  (i) direct access to"
"6803","the Sub-Advisers chief compliance officer and/or other senior compliance"
"6804","personnel, as reasonably requested by the Trust CCO; (ii) quarterly reports"
"6805","confirming that the Sub-Adviser has complied with the Trust Compliance"
"6806","Procedures in managing the Portfolio or Segment; and (iii) quarterly"
"6807","certifications that"
"6808","there were no Material Compliance Matters (as that term is defined by Rule"
"6809","38a-1(e)(2)) that arose under the Trust Compliance Procedures that related to"
"6810","the Sub-Advisers management of the Portfolio or Segment."
"6811","The Sub-Adviser shall promptly provide the Trust CCO with copies of: (i) the"
"6812","Sub-Advisers policies and procedures for compliance by the Sub-Adviser with"
"6813","the Federal Securities Laws (together, the Sub-Adviser Compliance"
"6814","Procedures), and (ii) any material changes to the Sub-Adviser Compliance"
"6815","Procedures.  The Sub-Adviser shall cooperate fully with the Trust CCO so as"
"6816","to facilitate the Trust CCOs performance of the Trust CCOs responsibilities"
"6817","under Rule 38a-1 to review, evaluate and report to the Trusts Board on the"
"6818","operation of the Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures, and shall promptly report"
"6819","to the Trust CCO any Material Compliance Matter arising under the Sub-Adviser"
"6820","Compliance Procedures involving the Portfolio or Segment.  The Sub-Adviser"
"6821","shall provide to the Trust CCO:  (i) quarterly reports confirming the Sub-"
"6822","Advisers compliance with the Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures in managing"
"6823","the Portfolio or Segment, and (ii) certifications that there were no Material"
"6824","Compliance Matters involving the Sub-Adviser that arose under the Sub-Adviser"
"6825","Compliance Procedures that affected the Portfolio or Segment.  At least"
"6826","annually, the Sub-Adviser shall provide a certification to the Trust CCO to"
"6827","the effect that the Sub-Adviser has in place and has implemented policies and"
"6828","procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure compliance by the Sub-"
"6829","Adviser with any applicable Federal Securities Laws, subject to such"
"6830","interpretations as may be contained in the Trust Compliance Procedures."
"6831","The Sub-Adviser will promptly provide UBS Global AM with information"
"6832","(including information that is required to be disclosed in the Trusts"
"6833","registration statement) with respect to the portfolio managers responsible"
"6834","for the Portfolio or Segment and any changes in the portfolio managers"
"6835","responsible for the Portfolio or Segment."
"6836","The Sub-Adviser will promptly notify UBS Global AM of any pending"
"6837","investigation, material litigation, administrative proceeding or any other"
"6838","significant regulatory inquiry."
"6839","The Sub-Adviser will cooperate promptly and fully with UBS Global AM and/or"
"6840","the Trust in responding to any regulatory or compliance examinations or"
"6841","inspections (including information requests) relating to the Trust, the"
"6842","Portfolio or UBS Global AM brought by any governmental or regulatory"
"6843","authorities having appropriate jurisdiction (including, but not limited to,"
"6844","the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC))."
"6845","4.     Expenses.  During the term of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will bear"
"6846","all expenses incurred by it in connection with its services under this"
"6847","Agreement.  The Sub-Adviser shall not be responsible for any expenses"
"6848","incurred by the Trust, the Portfolio or UBS Global AM, except as otherwise"
"6849","specifically provided herein."
"6850","Upon request by UBS Global AM, Sub-Adviser agrees to reimburse UBS Global"
"6851","Americas or the Trust for costs associated with generating and distributing"
"6852","any Registration Statement (as defined herein)  for when the Sub-Adviser is"
"6853","given a copy of a draft of such Registration Statement and fails to promptly"
"6854","disclose to UBS Global AM facts then known to the Sub-Adviser or its"
"6855","personnel that would require disclosure (or amendments to disclosure) in the"
"6856","Funds Registration Statement in time for such disclosure or amendments to"
"6857","disclosure to be included in such Registration Statement.  The Sub-Adviser"
"6858","shall bear all reasonable expenses of the Trust, if any, arising out of an"
"6859","assignment or change in control of the Sub-Adviser."
"6860","5.	Compensation."
"6861","(a)     For the services provided and the expenses assumed by the Sub-Adviser"
"6862","pursuant to this Agreement, UBS Global AM, not the Portfolio, will pay to the"
"6863","Sub-Adviser a fee, computed daily and payable monthly, at an annual rate of"
"6864","0.25% on the first $250 million and 0.20% on assets in excess of $250 million"
"6865","of the average daily net assets of the Portfolio or Segment allocated to its"
"6866","management (computed in the manner specified in the  Management Agreement),"
"6867","and will provide the Sub-Adviser with a schedule showing the manner in which"
"6868","the fee was computed.  If the Sub-Adviser is managing a Segment, its fees"
"6869","will be based on the value of the assets of the Portfolio within the Sub-"
"6870","Advisers Segment."
"6871","(b)	The fee shall be accrued daily and payable monthly to the Sub-Adviser"
"6872","on or before the last business day of the next succeeding calendar month."
"6873","(c)	For those periods in which UBS Global AM has agreed to waive all or a"
"6874","portion of its management fee, UBS Global AM may ask the Sub-Adviser to waive"
"6875","the same proportion of its fees, but the Sub-Adviser is under no obligation"
"6876","to do so."
"6877","(d)     If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates before the end of"
"6878","any month, the fee for the period from the effective date to the end of the"
"6879","month or from the beginning of such month to the date of termination, as the"
"6880","case may be, shall be pro-rated according to the proportion which such period"
"6881","bears to the full month in that such effectiveness or termination occurs."
"6882","6. Limitation of Liability."
"6883","(a) 	The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any error of judgment or"
"6884","mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Portfolio, the Trust or its"
"6885","shareholders or by UBS Global AM in connection with the matters to which this"
"6886","Agreement relates, except a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad"
"6887","faith or gross negligence on its part in the performance of its duties or"
"6888","from reckless disregard by it of its obligations and duties under this"
"6889","Agreement."
"6890","(b)     In no event will the Sub-Adviser have any responsibility for any other"
"6891","portfolio of the Trust, for any portion of the Portfolio not managed by the"
"6892","Sub-Adviser or for the acts or omissions of any Other Sub-Adviser to the"
"6893","Trust or Portfolio. In particular, in the event the Sub-Adviser shall manage"
"6894","only a Segment of the Portfolio, the Sub-Adviser shall have no responsibility"
"6895","for the Portfolios being in violation of any applicable law or regulation or"
"6896","investment policy or restriction applicable to the Portfolio as a whole or"
"6897","for the Portfolios failing to qualify as a regulated investment company under"
"6898","the Code, if the securities and other holdings of the Segment of the"
"6899","Portfolio managed by the Sub-Adviser are such that such Segment would not be"
"6900","in such violation or fail to so qualify if such Segment were deemed a separate"
"6901","series of the Trust or a separate regulated investment company under the Code,"
"6902","unless such violation was due to the Sub-Advisers failure to comply with"
"6903","written guidelines adopted by the Board or UBS Global AM and provided to the"
"6904","Sub-Adviser."
"6905","Nothing in this section shall be deemed a limitation or waiver of any"
"6906","obligation or duty that may not by law be limited or waived."
"6907","7.	Representations of Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser represents, warrants"
"6908","and agrees as follows:"

"6921","pursuant to Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act or otherwise."
"6922","(b)     The Sub-Adviser has adopted a written code of ethics complying with the"

"6935","the Sub-Advisers code of ethics."
"6936","(c)	The Sub-Adviser has provided UBS Global AM with a copy of its Form ADV,"

"6945","(e)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that neither it nor any of its affiliates, will"
"6946","in any way refer directly or indirectly to its relationship with the Trust,"
"6947","the Portfolio, UBS Global AM or any of their respective affiliates in"
"6948","offering, marketing or other promotional materials without the express"
"6949","written consent of UBS Global AM."
"6950","(f)	The Sub-Adviser hereby represents that it has implemented policies and"
"6951","procedures that will prevent the disclosure by it, its employees or its"
"6952","agents of the Trusts portfolio holdings to any person or entity other than"
"6953","UBS Global AM, the Trusts custodian, or other persons expressly designated by"
"6954","UBS Global AM.  The Sub-Adviser further represents that it implemented"
"6955","policies and procedures to prevent it, its employees and agents from trading"

"6957","AM, the Trust, their affiliates or agents."
"6958","8.	Services Not Exclusive. The services furnished by the Sub-Adviser"
"6959","hereunder are not to be deemed exclusive, and except as the Sub-Adviser may"
"6960","otherwise agree in writing, the Sub-Adviser shall be free to furnish similar"

"6964","be a trustee, officer or employee of the Trust, to engage in any other"
"6965","business or to devote his or her time and attention in part to the management"

"7016","1940 Act, the latter shall control."
"7017","12.	Confidentiality.  The Sub-Adviser will treat as proprietary and"

"7807","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"7808","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"7809","UBS PACE Select Advisors Trust"
"7810","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of UBS PACE"

"7820","Securities Investments and UBS PACE Alternative Strategies Investments) (the"
"7821","Company), as of and for the year ended July 31, 2010, in accordance with the"
"7822","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"7823","considered the Companys internal control over financial reporting, including"
"7824","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"7825","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"7826","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"7827","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal"
"7828","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"7829","The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"7830","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"7831","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"7832","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A companys internal"
"7833","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"7834","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"7835","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"7836","accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial"
"7837","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"7838","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"7839","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"7840","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"7841","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"7842","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"7843","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"7844","trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"7845","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"7846","of a companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"7847","statements."
"7848","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"7849","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"7850","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"7851","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"7852","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"7853","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"7854","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"7855","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"7856","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"7857","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"7858","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"7859","Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"7860","detected on a timely basis."
"7861","Our consideration of the Companys internal control over financial reporting was"
"7862","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"7863","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"7864","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"7865","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"7866","in the Companys internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"7867","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"7868","material weakness as defined above as of July 31, 2010."
"7869","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"7870","the Board of Trustees of UBS PACE Select Advisors Trust, and the Securities and"
"7871","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
