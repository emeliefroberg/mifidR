"926","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"927","To The Board of Directors:"
"928","     Sit U.S. Government Securities Fund, Inc."
"929","     Sit Mutual Funds II, Inc."
"930","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"931","Sit U.S. Government Securities Fund, Inc. and Sit Quality Income Fund,"
"932","Sit Tax-Free Income Fund, and Sit Minnesota Tax-Free Income Fund (each"
"933","a series of Sit Mutual Funds II, Inc.) (collectively, the Funds) as of"
"934","and for the year ended March 31, 2017, in accordance with the standards"
"935","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"936","considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"937","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"938","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"939","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"940","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"941","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"942","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"943","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"944","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"945","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required"
"946","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"947","company's internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"948","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"949","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"950","external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting"
"951","principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"952","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"953","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"954","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"955","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"956","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"957","accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"958","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"959","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"960","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"961","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of"
"962","the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"963","statements."
"964","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"965","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"966","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"967","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"968","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"969","procedures may deteriorate."
"970","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"971","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"972","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"973","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"974","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"975","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"976","possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim"
"977","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"978","basis."
"979","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"980","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"981","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"982","that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"983","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we"
"984","noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial"
"985","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"986","securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above"
"987","as of March 31, 2017."
"988","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"989","management and the Board of Directors of the Funds and the Securities"
"990","and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be"
"991","used by anyone other than these specified parties."
