"2185","THE VOTING PROCESS WILL ONLY TAKE A FEW MINUTES"
"2186","Instructions for returning your proxy are enclosed. PLEASE BE SURE TO RESPOND BY"
"2187","JUNE 8, 2010, regardless of the number of shares you own."
"2188","HIGHLIGHTS OF PROXY PROPOSALS"
"2189","For your convenience, the following information highlights the principal aspects"
"2190","of the proposals in the proxy. Full details are provided in the prospectus/proxy"
"2191","statement. We encourage you to read it carefully."
"2192","WHY HAVE WE PROPOSED THESE MERGERS?"

"2194","the pending proposal to combine the fund lineups of the Wells Fargo Advantage"
"2195","Funds and the Evergreen Funds under the Wells Fargo Advantage Funds name."
"2196","Coinciding with this proposal, Wells Fargo Funds Management, LLC, has"
"2197","recommended the merger of certain Wells Fargo Advantage Funds."
"2198","WHAT AM I BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON?"
"2199","As a shareholder of the merging (Target) fund, you are being asked to approve"
"2200","the merger of your fund into a surviving (Acquiring) fund. Your Fund's Board of"
"2201","Trustees believes that the merger is in the best interests of your Fund and that"
"2202","the interests of existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result of the"
"2203","merger. As such, they also recommend that you vote to approve it."
"2204","Upon approval by shareholders, as well as the satisfaction of other closing"
"2205","conditions, the target fund will transfer all of its assets to the acquiring"
"2206","fund, and the acquiring fund will assume all of the liabilities of the target"
"2207","fund in exchange for shares of a comparable class of the acquiring fund. The"
"2208","acquiring fund shares that you receive in a merger will have a total dollar"
"2209","value equal to that of the target fund shares that you hold at the time of the"
"2210","merger."

"2483","THE VOTING PROCESS WILL ONLY TAKE A FEW MINUTES"
"2484","Instructions for returning your proxy are enclosed. PLEASE BE SURE TO RESPOND BY"

"2487","For your convenience, the following information highlights the principal aspects"
"2488","of the proposals in the proxy. Full details are provided in the prospectus/proxy"
"2489","statement. We encourage you to read it carefully."
"2490","WHY HAVE WE PROPOSED THESE MERGERS?"
"2491","The enclosed prospectus/proxy statement for the merger of your funds is part of"
"2492","the overall proposal to combine the fund lineups of the Wells Fargo Advantage"
"2493","Funds and the Evergreen Funds. As a result of the merger between Wells Fargo &"
"2494","Company and Wachovia Corporation, Wells Fargo Funds Management, LLC, the"
"2495","investment advisor to the Wells Fargo Advantage Funds, and Evergreen Investment"
"2496","Management Company, LLC, the investment advisor to the Evergreen Funds,"
"2497","recommended that the Boards of Trustees of the two fund families approve"
"2498","combining the fund families under the Wells Fargo Advantage Funds name."
"2499","WHAT AM I BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON?"
"2500","As a shareholder of the merging (Target) fund, you are being asked to approve"
"2501","the merger of your fund into a surviving (Acquiring) fund. Your fund's Board of"
"2502","Trustees believes that the merger is in the best interests of your fund and that"
"2503","the interests of existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result of the"
"2504","merger. As such, they recommend that you vote to approve it."
"2505","Upon approval by shareholders, as well as the satisfaction of other closing"
"2506","conditions, the target fund will transfer all of its assets to the acquiring"
"2507","fund, and the acquiring fund will assume all of the liabilities of the target"
"2508","fund in exchange for shares of a comparable class of the acquiring fund. The"
"2509","acquiring fund shares that you receive in a merger will have a total dollar"
"2510","value equal to that of the target fund shares that you hold at the time of the"
"2511","merger."
