"6015","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"6016","To the Board of Trustees of BlackRock Funds and Shareholders of"
"6017","BlackRock Strategic Risk Allocation Fund:"
"6018","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"6019","statements of BlackRock Strategic Risk Allocation Fund (the"
"6020","Fund), a series of BlackRock Funds, as of and for the year"
"6021","ended July 31, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the"
"6022","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"6023","considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"6024","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"6025","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"6026","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"6027","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"6028","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"6029","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"6030","express no such opinion."
"6031","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"6032","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"6033","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"6034","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"6035","related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"6036","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"6037","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"6038","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"6039","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"6040","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"6041","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"6042","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"6043","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"6044","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"6045","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"6046","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"6047","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"6048","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"6049","and directors of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"6050","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"6051","acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets that could"
"6052","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"6053","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"6054","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"6055","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"6056","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"6057","inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree"
"6058","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"6059","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"6060","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"6061","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"6062","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"6063","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"6064","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"6065","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"6066","material misstatement of the fund's annual or interim financial"
"6067","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"6068","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"6069","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"6070","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"6071","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"6072","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"6073","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"6074","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"6075","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities that"
"6076","we consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as of"
"6077","July 31, 2016."
"6078","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"6079","management and the Board of Trustees of BlackRock Funds and the"
"6080","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"6081","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"11903","Agreement in accordance with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and"
"11904","restrictions as stated in the Fund's Prospectus and Statement of Additional"
"11905","Information (as currently in effect and as they may be amended or supplemented"
"11906","from time to time) and the resolutions of the Trust's Board of Trustees."
"11907","The Sub-Advisor represents, warrants and covenants that it is authorized and"
"11908","regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA and the applicable rules"
"11909","promulgated by the FCA, the FCA Rules)."
"11910","References in this Agreement to the Supplemental Disclosures means any"

"11914","   3. Covenants."
"11915","       (a) In the performance of its duties under this Agreement, the"
"11916","Sub-Advisor shall at all times conform to, and act in accordance with, any"
"11917","requirements imposed by: (i) the provisions of the 1940 Act and the Investment"
"11918","Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act) and all applicable Rules"
"11919","and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC); (ii) any"
"11920","other applicable provision of law; (iii) the provisions of the Declaration of"
"11921","Trust and Amended and Restated Code of Regulations of the Trust, as such"
"11922","documents are amended from time to time; (iv) the investment objectives and"
"11923","policies of the Fund as set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement on Form"
"11924","N-1A and/or the resolutions of the Board of Trustees; and (v) any policies and"
"11925","determinations of the Board of Trustees of the Trust."

"11927","<PAGE>"
"11928","   (b) In addition, the Sub-Advisor will:"
"11929","       (i) place orders either directly with the issuer or with any broker or"
"11930","dealer. Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph, in placing orders"
"11931","with brokers and dealers, the Sub-Advisor will attempt to obtain the best price"
"11932","and the most favorable execution of its orders. The Advisor has been provided"
"11933","with the Supplemental Disclosures which contain a copy of the Sub-Advisor's"
"11934","order execution policy and hereby confirms that it has read and understood the"
"11935","information in the order execution policy and agrees to it. In particular, the"
"11936","Advisor agrees that the Sub-Advisor may trade outside of the regulated market"
"11937","or multilateral trading facility. In placing orders, the Sub-Advisor will"
"11938","consider the experience and skill of the firm's securities traders as well as"
"11939","the firm's financial responsibility and administrative efficiency. Consistent"
"11940","with this obligation, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers on the basis of the"
"11941","research, statistical and pricing services they provide to the Fund and other"
"11942","clients of the Advisor or the Sub-Advisor. Information and research received"
"11943","from such brokers will be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the services"
"11944","required to be performed by the Sub-Advisor hereunder. A commission paid to"
"11945","such brokers may be higher than that which another qualified broker would have"
"11946","charged for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Advisor"
"11947","determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in terms either of"
"11948","the transaction or the overall responsibility of the Advisor and the"
"11949","Sub-Advisor to the Fund and their other clients and that the total commissions"
"11950","paid by the Fund will be reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Fund"
"11951","over the long-term. Subject to the foregoing and the provisions of the"
"11952","1940 Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and other applicable"
"11953","provisions of law, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers and dealers with which it"
"11954","or the Fund is affiliated;"
"11955","       (ii) maintain books and records with respect to the Fund's securities"
"11956","transactions and will render to the Advisor and the Trust's Board of Trustees"
"11957","such periodic and special reports as they may request;"
"11958","       (iii) maintain a policy and practice of conducting its investment"
"11959","advisory services hereunder independently of the commercial banking operations"
"11960","of its affiliates. When the Sub-Advisor makes investment recommendations for"
"11961","the Fund, its investment advisory personnel will not inquire or take into"
"11962","consideration whether the issuer of securities proposed for purchase or sale"
"11963","for the Fund's account are customers of the commercial department of its"
"11964","affiliates; and"
"11965","       (iv) treat confidentially and as proprietary information of the Fund all"
"11966","records and other information relative to the Fund, and the Fund's prior,"
"11967","current or potential shareholders, and will not use such records and"
"11968","information for any purpose other than performance of its responsibilities and"
"11969","duties hereunder, except after prior notification to and approval in writing by"
"11970","the Fund, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld and may not be"
"11971","withheld where the Sub-Advisor may be exposed to civil or criminal contempt"
"11972","proceedings for failure to comply, when requested to divulge such information"
"11973","by duly constituted authorities, or when so requested by the Fund."

"11976","       (c) In addition, the Advisor:"
"11977","          (i) agrees that the Sub-Advisor may, to the extent permitted by the"
"11978","   FCA Rules, aggregate transactions for the Fund with transactions for other"
"11979","   clients and/ or its own account, but shall be under no obligation to"
"11980","   aggregate transactions for the Fund. In relation to a particular order,"
"11981","   aggregation may operate on some occasions to the advantage of the Advisor"
"11982","   and on other occasions to the Advisor's disadvantage. However, it must be"
"11983","   unlikely that the aggregation of orders and transactions will work overall"
"11984","   to the disadvantage of the Advisor before transactions will be aggregated;"
"11985","   and"
"11986","          (ii) instructs the Sub-Advisor not to make or book client limit"
"11987","   orders (being a specific instruction from the Advisor to buy or sell a"
"11988","   financial instrument at a specified price limit or better and for a"
"11989","   specified size) in respect of securities admitted to trading on a regulated"
"11990","   market which are not immediately executed under prevailing market conditions."
"11991","       (d) The Advisor acknowledges that the Sub-Advisor does not hold"
"11992","client money and/or safe custody assets for the Advisor under the Client"
"11993","Asset Rules (the CASS Rules) of the FCA."
"11994","   4. Services Not Exclusive. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the"
"11995","Sub-Advisor or any officer, employee or other affiliate thereof from acting as"
"11996","investment advisor for any other person, firm or corporation, or from engaging"
"11997","in any other lawful activity, and shall not in any way limit or restrict the"
"11998","Sub-Advisor or any of its officers, employees or agents from buying, selling or"
"11999","trading any securities for its or their own accounts or for the accounts of"
"12000","others for whom it or they may be acting; provided, however, that the"
"12001","Sub-Advisor will undertake no activities which, in its judgment, will adversely"
"12002","affect the performance of its obligations under this Agreement."
"12003","   5. Books and Records. In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3"
"12004","under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all records which it"
"12005","maintains for the Fund are the property of the Trust and further agrees to"
"12006","surrender promptly to the Trust any such records upon the Trust's request. The"
"12007","Sub-Advisor further agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2"
"12008","under the 1940 Act the records required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under"
"12009","the 1940 Act (to the extent such books and records are not maintained by the"
"12010","Advisor)."
"12011","   6. Expenses. During the term of this Agreement, the Sub-Advisor will bear"
"12012","all costs and expenses of its employees and any overhead incurred by the"
"12013","Sub-Advisor in connection with its duties hereunder; provided that the Board of"
"12014","Trustees of the Trust may approve reimbursement to the Sub-Advisor of the"
"12015","pro-rata portion of the salaries, bonuses, health insurance, retirement"
"12016","benefits and all similar employment costs for the time spent on Fund operations"
"12017","(including, without limitation, compliance matters) (other than the provision"
"12018","of investment advice and administrative services required to be provided"
"12019","hereunder) of all personnel employed by the Sub-Advisor who devote substantial"
"12020","time to Fund operations or the operations of other investment companies advised"
"12021","or sub-advised by the Sub-Advisor."

"12023","<PAGE>"
"12024","   7. Compensation."
"12025","       (a) The Advisor agrees to pay to the Sub-Advisor and the Sub-Advisor"
"12026","agrees to accept as full compensation for all services rendered by the"
"12027","Sub-Advisor as such, a monthly fee in arrears at an annual rate equal to the"
"12028","amount set forth in Schedule A hereto. For any period less than a month during"
"12029","which this Agreement is in effect, the fee shall be prorated according to the"
"12030","proportion which such period bears to a full month of 28, 29, 30 or 31 days, as"
"12031","the case may be."
"12032","       (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the net assets of the Fund shall be"
"12033","calculated pursuant to the procedures adopted by resolutions of the Trustees of"
"12034","the Trust for calculating the value of the Fund's assets or delegating such"
"12035","calculations to third parties."
"12036","       (c) If Advisor waives any or all of its advisory fee payable under the"
"12037","Advisory Agreement, or reimburses the Trust pursuant to Section 8(b) of that"
"12038","Agreement or an expense limitation agreement or other advisory fee waiver"
"12039","agreement, with respect to the Fund, Sub-Advisor will bear its share of the"
"12040","amount of such waiver or reimbursement by waiving fees otherwise payable to it"
"12041","hereunder on a proportionate basis to be determined by comparing the aggregate"
"12042","fees that would otherwise be paid to it hereunder with respect to the Fund to"
"12043","the aggregate fees that would otherwise be paid by the Trust to Advisor under"
"12044","the Advisory Agreement with respect to the Fund. Advisor shall inform"
"12045","Sub-Advisor prior to waiving any advisory fees."
"12046","   8. Indemnity."
"12047","       (a) The Fund may, in the discretion of the Board of Trustees of the"
"12048","Trust, indemnify the Sub-Advisor, and each of the Sub-Advisor's directors,"
"12049","officers, employees, agents, associates and controlling persons and the"
"12050","directors, partners, members, officers, employees and agents thereof (including"
"12051","any individual who serves at the Sub-Advisor's request as director, officer,"
"12052","partner, member, trustee or the like of another entity) (each such person being"
"12053","an Indemnitee) against any liabilities and expenses, including amounts paid"
"12054","in satisfaction of judgments, in compromise or as fines and penalties, and"
"12055","counsel fees (all as provided in accordance with applicable state law)"
"12056","reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with the defense or"
"12057","disposition of any action, suit or other proceeding, whether civil or criminal,"
"12058","before any court or administrative or investigative body in which such"
"12059","Indemnitee may be or may have been involved as a party or otherwise or with"
"12060","which such Indemnitee may be or may have been threatened, while acting in any"
"12061","capacity set forth herein or thereafter by reason of such Indemnitee having"
"12062","acted in any such capacity, except with respect to any matter as to which such"
"12063","Indemnitee shall have been adjudicated not to have acted in good faith in the"
"12064","reasonable belief that such Indemnitee's action was in the best interest of the"
"12065","Fund and furthermore, in the case of any criminal proceeding, so long as such"
"12066","Indemnitee had no reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful;"
"12067","provided, however, that (1) no Indemnitee shall be indemnified hereunder"
"12068","against any liability to the Fund or its shareholders or any expense of such"
"12069","Indemnitee arising by reason of (i) willful misfeasance, (ii) bad faith,"
"12070","(iii) gross negligence or (iv) reckless disregard of the duties involved in the"
"12071","conduct of such Indemnitee's position (the conduct referred to in such clauses"
"12072","(i) through (iv) being sometimes referred to herein as disabling conduct),"
"12073","(2) as to any matter disposed of by settlement or a compromise payment by such"
"12074","Indemnitee, pursuant to a"

"12077","consent decree or otherwise, no indemnification either for said payment or for"
"12078","any other expenses shall be provided unless there has been a determination that"
"12079","such settlement or compromise is in the best interests of the Fund and that"
"12080","such Indemnitee appears to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief"
"12081","that such Indemnitee's action was in the best interest of the Fund and did not"
"12082","involve disabling-conduct by such Indemnitee and (3) with respect to any"
"12083","action, suit or other proceeding voluntarily prosecuted by any Indemnitee as"
"12084","plaintiff, indemnification shall be mandatory only if the prosecution of such"
"12085","action, suit or other proceeding by such Indemnitee was authorized by a"
"12086","majority of the full Board of Trustees of the Trust."
"12087","       (b) The Fund shall make advance payments in connection with the expenses"
"12088","of defending any action with respect to which indemnification might be sought"
"12089","hereunder if the Fund receives a written affirmation of the Indemnitee's good"
"12090","faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification has"
"12091","been met and a written undertaking to reimburse the Fund unless it is"
"12092","subsequently determined that such Indemnitee is entitled to such"
"12093","indemnification and if the Trustees of the Trust determine that the facts then"
"12094","known to them would not preclude indemnification. In addition, at least one of"
"12095","the following conditions must be met: (A) the Indemnitee shall provide a"
"12096","security for such Indemnitee's undertaking, (B) the Fund shall be insured"
"12097","against losses arising by reason of any unlawful advance, or (C) a majority of"
"12098","a quorum consisting of Trustees of the Trust who are neither interested
persons of the Trust (as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) nor"
"12099","parties to the proceeding (Disinterested Non-Party Trustees) or an"
"12100","independent legal counsel in a written opinion, shall determine, based on a"
"12101","review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial-type inquiry),"
"12102","that there is reason to believe that the Indemnitee ultimately will be found"
"12103","entitled to indemnification."
"12104","       (c) All determinations with respect to the standards for indemnification"
"12105","hereunder shall be made (1) by a final decision on the merits by a court or"
"12106","other body before whom the proceeding was brought that such Indemnitee is not"
"12107","liable by reason of disabling conduct, or (2) in the absence of such a"
"12108","decision, by (i) a majority vote of a quorum of the Disinterested Non-Party"
"12109","Trustees of the Trust, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable or even, if"
"12110","obtainable, if a majority vote of such quorum so directs, independent legal"
"12111","counsel in a written opinion. All determinations that advance payments in"
"12112","connection with the expense of defending any proceeding shall be authorized"
"12113","shall be made in accordance with the immediately preceding clause (2) above."
"12114","The rights accruing to any Indemnitee under these provisions shall not exclude"
"12115","any other right to which such Indemnitee may be lawfully entitled."
"12116","   9. Limitation on Liability."
"12117","       (a) The Sub-Advisor will not be liable for any error of judgment or"
"12118","mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Advisor or by the Trust or the"
"12119","Fund in connection with the performance of this Agreement, except a loss"
"12120","resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of"
"12121","compensation for services or a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad"
"12122","faith or gross negligence on its part in the performance of its duties or from"
"12123","reckless disregard by it of its duties under this Agreement. As used in this"
"12124","Section 9(a), the term Sub-Advisor shall include any affiliates of the"
"12125","Sub-Advisor performing services for the Fund contemplated hereby and partners,"
"12126","directors, officers and employees of the Sub-Advisor and such affiliates."

"12139","Thereafter, if not terminated, this Agreement shall continue in effect with"

"12149","penalty, upon giving the Sub-Advisor 60 days' notice (which notice may be"
"12150","waived by the Sub-Advisor), provided that such termination by the Trust or the"
