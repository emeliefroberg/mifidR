"2032","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2033","To the Board of Trustees of Legg Mason Global Asset Management Trust and"
"2034","Shareholders of Legg Mason BW Alternative Credit Fund:"
"2035","In planning and performing our audits of the  financial statements of Legg"
"2036","Mason BW Alternative Credit Fund (one of the funds comprising Legg Mason"
"2037","Global Asset Management Trust, the Company) as of and for the year ended"
"2038","October 31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"2039","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Company's"
"2040","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"2041","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"2042","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"2043","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2044","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control"
"2045","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"2046","effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting."
"2047","The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and"
"2048","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"2049","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"2050","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"2051","company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"2052","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"2053","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"2054","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"2055","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"2056","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"2057","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2058","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"2059","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"2060","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2061","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"2062","only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"2063","company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"2064","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"2065","company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2066","statements."
"2067","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2068","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any"
"2069","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"2070","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"2071","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2072","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"2073","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"2074","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"

"2104","Shareholders of ClearBridge Value Trust, ClearBridge Special Investment"
"2105","Trust, ClearBridge Global Growth Trust, Legg Mason BW Global High Yield Fund"
"2106","and Legg Mason BW Absolute Return Opportunities Fund:"
"2107","In planning and performing our audits of the  financial statements of"
"2108","ClearBridge Value Trust, ClearBridge Special Investment Trust, ClearBridge"
"2109","Global Growth Trust, Legg Mason BW Global High Yield Fund and Legg Mason BW"
"2110","Absolute Return Opportunities Fund (five of the funds comprising Legg Mason"
"2111","Global Asset Management Trust, the Company) as of and for the year ended"
"2112","October 31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"2113","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Company's"
"2114","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"2115","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"2116","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"2117","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2118","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control"
"2119","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"2120","effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting."
"2121","The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and"
"2122","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"2123","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"2124","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"2125","company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"2126","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"2127","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"2128","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"2129","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"2130","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"2131","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2132","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"2133","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"2134","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2135","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"2136","only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"2137","company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"2138","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"2139","company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2140","statements."
"2141","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2142","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any"
"2143","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"2144","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"2145","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2146","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"2147","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"2148","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"2149","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"2150","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"2151","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"2152","material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial"
"2153","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."

"2182","The following revises the fund's disclosure to incorporate new aspects of"

"2189","contract is an agreement pursuant to which two parties agree to take or"
"2190","make delivery of an amount of cash equal to the difference between the"
"2191","value of the index at the close of the last trading day of the contract"
"2192","and the price at which the index contract was originally entered into."
"2193","Equity index futures contracts are based on indexes that reflect the"
"2194","market value of the equity securities of the companies included in the"
"2195","indexes. The stock market is volatile and the values of equity securities"
"2196","fluctuate, sometimes significantly. While the value of a broad index will"
"2197","likely be affected only to a relatively small degree by changes in the"
"2198","price of an individual stock that is included in the index, most or all of"
"2199","the securities that compose an index may be similarly affected by economic"
"2200","developments, including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates,"
"2201","general economic, consumer or investor confidence, monetary and tax"
"2202","policies, unemployment rates, oil prices, political developments and"
