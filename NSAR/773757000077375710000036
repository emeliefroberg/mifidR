"5598","Columbia U.S. Treasury Index Fund, Columbia World Equity Fund,"
"5599","Columbia Income Fund, and Columbia Intermediate Bond Fund (each a"
"5600","series of Columbia Funds Series Trust I and hereafter collectively"
"5601","referred to as the Funds) as of and for the year ended March 31,"
"5602","2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"5603","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"5604","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"5605","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"5606","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"5607","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"5608","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"5609","Funds' internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"5610","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"5611","control over financial reporting."
"5612","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"5613","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"5614","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"5615","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"5616","controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"5617","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"5618","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"5619","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"5620","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"5621","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"5622","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"5623","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"5624","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"5625","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"5626","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"5627","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance"
"5628","with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3)"
"5629","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"5630","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that"
"5631","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"5632","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"5633","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"5634","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"5635","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"5636","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"5637","procedures may deteriorate."
"5638","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"5639","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"5640","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"5641","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"5642","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"5643","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"5644","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds' annual or"
"5645","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"5646","timely basis."
"5647","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"5648","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"5649","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"5650","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"5651","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"5652","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"5653","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"5654","controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material"
"5655","weaknesses as defined above as of March 31, 2010."
"5656","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"5657","and the Board of Trustees of the Funds and the Securities and Exchange"
"5658","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
"5659","other than these specified parties."

"5962","(0001193125-10-021712), which included a supplement to the registration"
"5963","statement of Columbia Funds Series Trust I, was filed with the SEC. It is"
"5964","hereby incorporated by reference as part of the response to this Items 77D"
"5965","and 77Q1(b) of Form N-SAR. The Statement of Additional Information supplement"
"5966","disclosed certain changes that were made to the policies with respect to"
"5967","fundamental and non-fundamental investments of Columbia Blended Equity Fund,"
"5968","Columbia Bond Fund, Columbia Emerging Markets Fund, Columbia Energy and"
"5969","Natural Resources Fund, Columbia International Growth Fund, Columbia"

"5974","Item 77E - Legal Proceedings:"
"5975","Columbia Atlantic Funds"
"5976","As of May, 2010"
"5977","In June 2004, an action captioned John E. Gallus et al. v. American"
"5978","Express Financial Corp. and American Express Financial Advisors Inc."
"5979","was filed in the United States District Court for the District of"
"5980","Arizona. The plaintiffs allege that they are investors in several"
"5981","American Express Company (now known as RiverSource) mutual funds and"
"5982","they purport to bring the action derivatively on behalf of those funds"
"5983","under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The plaintiffs allege that"
"5984","fees allegedly paid to the defendants by the funds for investment"
"5985","advisory and administrative services are excessive. The plaintiffs"
"5986","seek remedies including restitution and rescission of investment"
"5987","advisory and distribution agreements. The plaintiffs voluntarily agreed"
"5988","to transfer this case to the United States District Court for the"
"5989","District of Minnesota (the District Court). In response to defendants'"
"5990","motion to dismiss the complaint, the District Court dismissed one of"
"5991","plaintiffs' four claims and granted plaintiffs limited discovery."
"5992","Defendants moved for summary judgment in April 2007. Summary judgment"
"5993","was granted in the defendants' favor on July 9, 2007. The plaintiffs"
"5994","filed a notice of appeal with the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals"
"5995","(the Eighth Circuit) on August 8, 2007. On April 8, 2009, the Eighth"
"5996","Circuit reversed summary judgment and remanded to the District Court"
"5997","for further proceedings. On August 6, 2009, defendants filed a writ of"
"5998","certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court (the Supreme Court), asking the"
"5999","Supreme Court to stay the District Court proceedings while the Supreme"
"6000","Court considers and rules in a case captioned Jones v. Harris"
"6001","Associates, which involves issues of law similar to those presented in"
"6002","the Gallus case. On March 30, 2010, the Supreme Court issued its ruling"
"6003","in Jones v. Harris Associates, and on April 5, 2010, the Supreme Court"
"6004","vacated the Eighth Circuit's decision in the Gallus case and remanded"
"6005","the case to the Eighth Circuit for further consideration in light of"
"6006","the Supreme Court's decision in Jones v. Harris Associates."
"6007","In December 2005, without admitting or denying the allegations,"
"6008","American Express Financial Corporation (AEFC, which is now known as"
"6009","Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (Ameriprise Financial)), entered into"
"6010","settlement agreements with the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"6011","(SEC) and Minnesota Department of Commerce (MDOC) related to market"
"6012","timing activities. As a result, AEFC was censured and ordered to cease"
"6013","and desist from committing or causing any violations of certain"
"6014","provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment"
"6015","Company Act of 1940, and various Minnesota laws. AEFC agreed to pay"
"6016","disgorgement of $10 million and civil money penalties of $7 million."
"6017","AEFC also agreed to retain an independent distribution consultant to"
"6018","assist in developing a plan for distribution of all disgorgement and"
"6019","civil penalties ordered by the SEC in accordance with various"
"6020","undertakings detailed at http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/ia-2451.pdf."
"6021","Ameriprise Financial and its affiliates have cooperated with the SEC"
"6022","and the MDOC in these legal proceedings, and have made regular reports"
"6023","to the RiverSource Funds' Boards of Directors/Trustees."
"6024","On November 7, 2008, RiverSource Investments, LLC, a subsidiary of"
"6025","Ameriprise Financial, Inc., acquired J. & W. Seligman & Co. Incorporated"
"6026","(Seligman). In late 2003, Seligman conducted an extensive internal review"
"6027","concerning mutual fund trading practices. Seligman's review, which"
"6028","covered the period 2001-2003, noted one arrangement that permitted"
"6029","frequent trading in certain open-end registered investment companies"
"6030","managed by Seligman (the Seligman Funds); this arrangement was in the"
"6031","process of being closed down by Seligman before September 2003. Seligman"
"6032","identified three other arrangements that permitted frequent trading,"
"6033","all of which had been terminated by September 2002. In January 2004,"
"6034","Seligman, on a voluntary basis, publicly disclosed these four"
"6035","arrangements to its clients and to shareholders of the Seligman Funds."
"6036","Seligman also provided information concerning mutual fund trading"
"6037","practices to the SEC and the Office of the Attorney General of the"
"6038","State of New York (NYAG)."
"6039","In September 2006, the NYAG commenced a civil action in New York State"
"6040","Supreme Court against Seligman, Seligman Advisors, Inc. (now known as"
"6041","RiverSource Fund Distributors, Inc.), Seligman Data Corp. and Brian T."
"6042","Zino (collectively, the Seligman Parties), alleging, in substance, that"
"6043","the Seligman Parties permitted various persons to engage in frequent"
"6044","trading and, as a result, the prospectus disclosure used by the"
"6045","registered investment companies then managed by Seligman was and had"
"6046","been misleading. The NYAG included other related claims and also"
"6047","claimed that the fees charged by Seligman to the Seligman Funds were"
"6048","excessive. On March 13, 2009, without admitting or denying any"
"6049","violations of law or wrongdoing, the Seligman Parties entered into a"
"6050","stipulation of settlement with the NYAG and settled the claims made by"
"6051","the NYAG. Under the terms of the settlement, Seligman paid $11.3"
"6052","million to four Seligman Funds. This settlement resolved all"
"6053","outstanding matters between the Seligman Parties and the NYAG. In"
"6054","addition to the foregoing matter, the New York staff of the SEC"
"6055","indicated in September 2005 that it was considering recommending to"
"6056","the Commissioners of the SEC the instituting of a formal action"
"6057","against Seligman and Seligman Advisors, Inc. relating to frequent"
"6058","trading in the Seligman Funds. Seligman responded to the staff in"
"6059","October 2005 that it believed that any action would be both"
"6060","inappropriate and unnecessary, especially in light of the fact that"
"6061","Seligman had previously resolved the underlying issue with the"
"6062","Independent Directors of the Seligman Funds and made recompense to"
"6063","the affected Seligman Funds. There have been no further"
"6064","developments with the SEC on this matter."
"6065","Ameriprise Financial and certain of its affiliates have historically"
"6066","been involved in a number of legal, arbitration and regulatory"
"6067","proceedings, including routine litigation, class actions, and"
"6068","governmental actions, concerning matters arising in connection with"
"6069","the conduct of their business activities. Ameriprise Financial believes"
"6070","that the Funds are not currently the subject of, and that neither"
"6071","Ameriprise Financial nor any of its affiliates are the subject of,"
"6072","any pending legal, arbitration or regulatory proceedings that are"
"6073","likely to have a material adverse effect on the Funds or the ability"
"6074","of Ameriprise Financial or its affiliates to perform under their"
"6075","contracts with the Funds. Ameriprise Financial is required to make"
"6076","10-Q, 10-K and, as necessary, 8-K filings with the Securities and"
"6077","Exchange Commission on legal and regulatory matters that relate to"
"6078","Ameriprise Financial and its affiliates. Copies of these filings"
"6079","may be obtained by accessing the SEC website at www.sec.gov."
"6080","There can be no assurance that these matters, or the adverse publicity"
"6081","associated with them, will not result in increased fund redemptions,"
"6082","reduced sale of fund shares or other adverse consequences to the Funds."
"6083","Further, although we believe proceedings are not likely to have a"
"6084","material adverse effect on the Funds or the ability of Ameriprise"
"6085","Financial or its affiliates to perform under their contracts with the"
"6086","Funds, these proceedings are subject to uncertainties and, as such,"
"6087","we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may"
"6088","result. An adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings could"
"6089","result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other"
"6090","relief that could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated"
"6091","financial condition or results of operations of Ameriprise Financial."

"6134","(1)  The Fund hereby retains the Investment Manager, and the Investment"

"6138","     objectives, strategies and policies as from time to time set forth in its"
"6139","     then-current prospectus or statement of additional information, or as"
"6140","     otherwise established by the Board of Trustees (the Board), which"
"6141","     investments, in the Investment Manager's discretion, shall be purchased,"
"6142","     held or sold, and to execute or cause the execution of purchase or sell"

"6150","     always to oversight by the Board and the authorized officers of the Fund."
"6151","     The Investment Manager agrees: (a) to maintain an adequate organization of"
"6152","     competent persons to provide the services and to perform the functions"
"6153","     herein mentioned (to the extent that such services and functions have not"

"6156","     herein mentioned. The Investment Manager agrees to meet with any persons at"
"6157","     such times as the Board deems appropriate for the purpose of reviewing the"
"6158","     Investment Manager's performance under this Agreement and will prepare and"
"6159","     furnish to the Board such reports, statistical data and other information"
"6160","     relating to the investment management of the Fund in such form and at such"
"6161","     intervals as the Board may reasonably request.  The Fund agrees that the"

"6163","     services described under this Agreement (including with affiliates of the"
"6164","     Investment Manager) with the understanding that the quality and scope of"

"6175","     the Investment Manager will retain overall supervisory responsibility for"
"6176","     the general management and investment of the Fund and, subject to review"
"6177","     and approval by the Board, will set the Fund's overall investment"
"6178","     strategies (consistent with the Fund's then-current prospectus and"

"6184","     the subadvisers comply with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and"
"6185","     restrictions."
"6186","(2)  The Investment Manager shall comply (or cause the Fund to comply, as"
"6187","     applicable) with all applicable law, including but not limited to the"
"6188","     Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations"
"6189","     promulgated thereunder (the 1940 Act), the Investment Advisers Act of"

"6195","     with its fiduciary obligations to clients. The Fund recognizes that the"
"6196","     Investment Manager and its affiliates may from time to time acquire"
"6197","     information about issuers or securities that it may not share with, or act"
"6198","     upon for the benefit of, the Fund."
"6199","(4)  The Investment Manager agrees to vote proxies and to provide or withhold"

"6207","     management of the assets for the Fund, including with respect to the"
"6208","     acquisition or disposition of securities. In compliance with the"
"6209","     requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Investment Manager"
"6210","     hereby agrees that all records that it maintains for each Fund under this"
"6211","     Agreement are the property of the Registrant and further agrees to"
"6212","     surrender promptly to the Registrant any of such records upon request."
"6213","(6)  The Fund agrees that it will furnish to the Investment Manager any"

"6216","     Agreement."
"6217","(7)  In selecting broker-dealers for execution, the Investment Manager will"
"6218","     seek to obtain best execution for securities transactions on behalf of the"
"6219","     Fund, except where otherwise directed by the Board.  In selecting"
"6220","     broker-dealers to execute transactions, the Investment Manager may consider"
"6221","     not only available prices (including commissions or mark-up), but also"
"6222","     other"
"6223","<Page>"
"6224","     relevant factors such as, without limitation, the characteristics of the"
"6225","     security being traded, the size and difficulty of the transaction, the"
"6226","     execution, clearance and settlement capabilities as well as the"
"6227","     reputation, reliability, and financial soundness of the broker-dealer"
"6228","     selected, the broker-dealer's risk in positioning a block of securities,"
"6229","     the broker-dealer's execution service rendered on a continuing basis and"
"6230","     in other transactions, the broker-dealer's expertise in particular"
"6231","     markets, and the broker-dealer's ability to provide research services.  To"
"6232","     the extent permitted by law, and consistent with its obligation to seek"
"6233","     best execution, the Investment Manager may, except where otherwise"
"6234","     directed by the Board, execute transactions or pay a broker-dealer a"
"6235","     commission or markup in excess of that which another broker-dealer might"
"6236","     have charged for executing a transaction provided that the Investment"
"6237","     Manager determines, in good faith, that the execution is appropriate or"
"6238","     the commission or markup is reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"6239","     brokerage and/or research services provided, viewed in terms of either"
"6240","     that particular transaction or the Investment Manager's overall"
"6241","     responsibilities with respect to the Fund and other clients for which it"
"6242","     acts as investment adviser.  The Investment Manager shall not consider the"
"6243","     sale or promotion of shares of the Fund, or other affiliated products, as"
"6244","     a factor in the selection of broker dealers through which transactions are"
"6245","     executed."
"6246","(8)  Except for willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence on the part of"
"6247","     the Investment Manager in the performance of its duties, or reckless"
"6248","     disregard by the Investment Manager of its obligations and duties, under"
"6249","     this Agreement, neither the Investment Manager, nor any of its respective"
"6250","     directors, officers, partners, principals, employees, or agents shall be"
"6251","     liable for any acts or omissions or for any loss suffered by the Fund or"
"6252","     its shareholders or creditors.  To the extent permitted by applicable law,"
"6253","     each of the Investment Manager, and its respective directors, officers,"
"6254","     partners, principals, employees and agents, shall be entitled to rely, and"
"6255","     shall be protected from liability in reasonably relying, upon any"
"6256","     information or instructions furnished to it (or any of them as individuals)"
"6257","     by the Fund or its agents which is believed in good faith to be accurate"
"6258","     and reliable.  The Fund understands and acknowledges that the Investment"
"6259","     Manager does not warrant any rate of return, market value or performance of"
"6260","     any assets in the Fund.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the federal"
"6261","     securities laws impose liabilities under certain circumstances on persons"
"6262","     who act in good faith and, therefore, nothing herein shall constitute a"
"6263","     waiver of any right which the Fund may have under such laws or regulations."
"6264","PART TWO:  COMPENSATION TO THE INVESTMENT MANAGER"
"6265","(1)  The Fund agrees to pay to the Investment Manager, in full payment for"
"6266","     the services furnished, a fee as set forth in Schedule A."
"6267","(2)  The fee shall be accrued daily (unless otherwise directed by the Board"
"6268","     consistent with the prospectus and statement of additional information of"
"6269","     the Fund) and paid on a monthly basis and, in the event of the"
"6270","     effectiveness or termination of this Agreement, in whole or in part with"
"6271","     respect to any Fund, during any month, the fee paid to the Investment"
"6272","     Manager shall be prorated on the basis of the number of days that this"
"6273","     Agreement is in effect during the month with respect to which such payment"
