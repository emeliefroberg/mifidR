"467","<TEXT>"
"468","INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT"
"469","This INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT is"
"470","made as of this 1st day of July 2015, between Wells Fargo Funds"
"471","Trust (the Trust), a statutory trust organized under the laws of"
"472","the State of Delaware with its principal place of business at 525"
"473","Market Street, 12th Floor, San Francisco, California, 94105 and"
"474","Wells Fargo Fund Management, LLC (the Manager), a limited"
"475","liability company organized under the laws of the State of"
"476","Delaware with its principal place of business at 525 Market Street,"
"477","12th Floor, San Francisco, California, 94105."
"478","WHEREAS, the Trust is registered under the Investment"
"479","Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act) as an openend"
"480","management investment company and is authorized to issue"
"481","interests (as defined in the Trust's Declaration of Trust, as"
"482","amended and supplemented from time to time), in separate series;"
"483","WHEREAS, the Trust desires that the Manager provide"
"484","investment management services consisting of advisory services"
"485","and Fund-level (as opposed to class-level) administrative services"
"486","to the series of the Trust identified on Schedule A hereto, as such"
"487","Schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to time by"
"488","mutual agreement (the Fund), and the Manager is willing to"
"489","provide those services on the terms and conditions set forth in this"
"490","Agreement; and"
"491","WHEREAS, the Trust has entered into a separate Class-"
"492","Level Administration Agreement with the Manager for the"
"493","provision of class-level administrative services (Class-Level
Duties)."
"494","NOW THEREFORE, the Trust and the Manager agree as follows:"
"495","Section 1. Appointment of the Manager. The Trust is"
"496","engaged in the business of investing and reinvesting its assets in"
"497","securities of the type and in accordance with the limitations"
"498","specified in its Declaration of Trust, as amended and supplemented"
"499","from time to time, By-Laws (if any) and Registration Statement"
"500","filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the"
"501","Commission) under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act of 1933"
"502","(the Securities Act), including any representations made in the"
"503","prospectus and statement of additional information relating to the"
"504","Fund contained therein and as may be amended or supplemented"
"505","from time to time, all in such manner and to such extent as may"
"506","from time to time be authorized by the Trust's Board of Trustees"
"507","(the Board). The Board is authorized to issue any unissued"
"508","shares in any number of additional classes or series."
"509","The investment authority granted to the Manager shall"
"510","include the authority to exercise whatever powers the Trust may"
"511","possess with respect to any of its assets held by the Fund,"
"512","including, but not limited to, the power to exercise rights, options,"
"513","warrants, conversion privileges, redemption privileges, and to"
"514","tender securities pursuant to a tender offer, and participate in class"
"515","actions and other legal proceedings on behalf of the Fund."
"516","The Trust hereby appoints the Manager, subject to the"
"517","direction and control of the Board, to manage the investment and"
"518","reinvestment of the assets in the Fund and, without limiting the"
"519","generality of the foregoing, to provide the other services specified"
"520","in Section 2 hereof."
"521","The Trust hereby appoints the Manger to provide the Fundlevel"
"522","duties and services as set forth in Section 2(b) hereof, for the"
"523","compensation and on the terms herein provided, and the Manager"
"524","hereby accepts such appointment."
"525","Section 2. Duties of the Manager."
"526","(a) Advisory Services"
"527","(i) The Manager shall make decisions with respect to"
"528","all purchases and sales of securities and other investment assets for"
"529","the Fund. Among other things, the Manager shall make all"
"530","decisions with respect to the allocation of the Fund's investments"
"531","in various securities or other assets, in investment styles and, if"
"532","applicable, in other investment companies or pooled vehicles in"
"533","which the Fund may invest."
"534","To the extent the securities of an underlying registered"
"535","investment company constitute the Fund's only investment"
"536","security, in accordance with Section 12(d)(1)(E) of the 1940 Act,"
"537","the Manager's responsibilities shall include, but not be limited to,"
"538","reviewing the investment strategy and performance of the"
"539","underlying fund, evaluating any proposed changes affecting the"
"540","underlying fund, and conducting risk management reviews and"
"541","assessments with respect to the underlying fund and its adviser."
"542","To carry out such duties, the Manager is hereby authorized,"
"543","as agent and attorney-in-fact for the Trust, for the account of, at the"
"544","risk of and in the name of the Trust, to place orders and issue"
"545","instructions with respect to transactions of the Fund. In all"
"546","purchases, sales and other transactions in securities for the Fund,"
"547","the Manager is authorized to exercise full discretion and act for the"
"548","Trust in the same manner and with the same force and effect as the"
"549","Trust might or could do with respect to such purchases, sales or"
"550","other transactions, as well as with respect to all other things"
"551","necessary or incidental to the furtherance or conduct of such"
"552","purchases, sales or other transactions."
"553","(ii) The Manager will report to the Board at each"
"554","regular meeting thereof regarding the investment performance of"

"556","informed of important developments affecting the Trust, the Fund"
"557","and the Manager, and on its own initiative will furnish the Board"
"558","from time to time with such information as the Manager may"
"559","believe appropriate, whether concerning the individual companies"
"560","whose securities are held by the Fund, the industries in which they"
"561","engage, or the economic, social or political conditions prevailing in"
"562","each country in which the Fund maintains investments. The"
"563","Manager will also furnish the Board with such statistical and"
"564","analytical information with respect to securities in the Fund as the"
"565","Manager may believe appropriate or as the Board reasonably may"
"566","request."

"576","the services to certain persons as the Manager believes to"
"577","be appropriate or necessary to assist in the execution of the"
"578","Manager's duties hereunder; provided, however, that the"
"579","employment or sub-contracting with any such person shall not"
"580","relieve the Manager of its responsibilities or liabilities hereunder"
"581","and provided further that the Manager shall not have the authority"
"582","to sub-contract advisory responsibilities without the consent of the"
"583","Trust. The cost of performance of such duties will be borne and"
"584","paid by the Manager. No obligation may be imposed on the Trust"
"585","in any such respect."
"586","The Manager shall supervise and monitor the activities of"
"587","its representatives, personnel, sub-contractors, and agents in"
"588","connection with the execution of its duties and obligations"

"599","pursuant to this Agreement required to be prepared and maintained"
"600","by the Trust pursuant to the rules and regulations of any national,"
"601","state, or local government entity with jurisdiction over the Trust,"
"602","including the Commission and the Internal Revenue Service. The"
"603","books and records pertaining to the Trust which are in possession"
"604","of the Manager shall be the property of the Trust. The Trust, or the"
"605","Trust's authorized representatives, shall have access to such books"
"606","and records at all times during the Manager's normal business"
"607","hours. Upon the reasonable request of the Trust, copies of any"

"674","nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to"
"675","require Funds Management to provide any services"
"676","that may not be provided by it under applicable"
"677","banking laws and regulations."
"678","In performing all Fund-level administrative services under"
"679","this Section 2(b), the Manager shall: (a) act in conformity with the"
"680","Trust's Declaration of Trust (and By-Laws, if any), the 1940 Act,"
"681","and any other applicable laws as may be amended from time to"
"682","time, and all relevant rules thereunder, and with the Trust's"
"683","registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 and the"
"684","1940 Act, as may be amended from time to time; (b) consult and"
"685","coordinate with legal counsel to the Trust as necessary and"
"686","appropriate; and (c) advise and report to the Trust and its legal"
"687","counsel, as necessary and appropriate, with respect to any"
"688","compliance or other matters that come to its attention."
"689","In connection with its duties under this Section 2(b), the"
"690","Manager may, at its own expense, enter into sub-administration"
"691","agreements with other service providers, provided that each such"
"692","service provider agrees with the Manager to comply with this"
"693","Agreement and all relevant provisions of the 1940 Act and any"
"694","other applicable laws as may be amended from time to time, and"
"695","all relevant rules thereunder. The Manager will provide the Trust"
"696","with a copy of each sub-administration agreement it executes"
"697","relating to the Trust. The Manager will be liable for acts or"
"698","omissions of any such sub-administrators under the standards of"
"699","care described herein under Section 11."
"700","Section 3. Delivery of Documents to the Manager. The"
"701","Trust has furnished the Manager with true, correct and complete"
"702","copies of the following documents:"
"703","(a) The Declaration of Trust, as in effect on the date hereof;"
"704","(b) The Registration Statement filed with the Commission"
"705","under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act; and"
"706","(c) Written guidelines, policies and procedures adopted by the"
"707","Trust."
"708","The Trust will furnish the Manager with all future"
"709","amendments and supplements to the foregoing as soon as"
"710","practicable after such documents become available. The Trust"
"711","shall furnish the Manager with any further documents, materials or"
"712","information that the Manager may reasonably request in"
"713","connection with the performance of its duties hereunder."
"714","Section 4. Delegation of Responsibilities. The Manager"
"715","may carry out any of its obligations under this Agreement (other"
"716","than under Section 2(b) hereof) by employing, subject to"
"717","supervision by the Manager, one or more Sub-Adviser(s) who are"
"718","registered as investment advisers pursuant to the Investment"
"719","Advisers Act of 1940 (Sub-Advisers). Each Sub-Adviser's"
"720","employment will be evidenced by a separate written agreement"
"721","approved by the Board and, if required under the 1940 Act, by the"
"722","shareholders of the Fund (unless the Commission or its staff has"
"723","given authorization or issued an interpretation dispensing with the"
"724","requirement of shareholder approval). The Manager shall not be"
"725","liable hereunder for any act or omission of any Sub-Adviser,"
"726","except for failure to exercise good faith in the employment of the"
"727","Sub-Adviser and for failure to exercise appropriate supervision of"
"728","such Sub-Adviser, and as may otherwise be agreed in writing. The"
"729","Manager shall be solely responsible for compensating any Sub-"
"730","Adviser for services rendered under any Sub-Advisory Agreement."
"731","The Manager may, from time to time and at any time, terminate"
"732","any Sub-Adviser and reassume the responsibilities assigned to such"
"733","Sub-Adviser with respect to any Fund without obtaining the"
"734","approval of the shareholders of the Fund."
"735","Section 5. Control by Board. Any investment"
"736","management activities undertaken by the Manager pursuant to this"
"737","Agreement, as well as any other activities undertaken by the"
"738","Manager on behalf of the Fund, shall at all times be subject to the"
"739","direction and control of the Board."
"740","Section 6. Compliance with Applicable Requirements."
"741","In carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, the Manager"
"742","shall at all times comply with:"
"743","(a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"744","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"745","(b) the Registration Statement of the Trust, as it may be"
"746","amended from time to time, filed with the Commission"
"747","under the Securities Act and the 1940 Act;"
"748","(c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it"
"749","may be amended from time to time;"
"750","(d) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"
"751","amended, applicable to the Trust or the Fund, and any rules"
"752","and regulations adopted thereunder; and"
"753","(e) any other applicable provisions of state or federal law, and"
"754","any rules and regulations adopted thereunder."
"755","Section 7. Proxies. The Manager shall have responsibility"
"756","to vote proxies solicited with respect to issuers of securities in"
"757","which assets of the Fund are invested in accordance with the"
"758","Trust's policies on proxy voting."
"759","Section 8. Broker-Dealer Relationships. In connection"
"760","with the purchase and sale of securities for the Fund, the Manager"
"761","is responsible for broker-dealer selection and negotiation of"
"762","brokerage commission rates. The Manager's primary"
"763","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain"
"764","the best price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to"
"765","execute each particular transaction for the Fund, the Manager will"
"766","consider among other things: the best net price available, the"
"767","reliability, integrity and financial condition of the broker-dealer;"
"768","the size of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value of"
"769","the expected contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a"
"770","continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any"
"771","transaction may be less favorable than that available from another"
"772","broker-dealer if the difference is reasonably justified by other"
"773","aspects of the portfolio execution services offered. Subject to such"
"774","policies as the Board may from time to time determine, the"
"775","Manager shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have"
"776","breached any duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely"
"777","by reason of having caused the Fund to pay a broker or dealer that"
"778","provides brokerage and research services to the Manager an"
"779","amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"780","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker"
"781","or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if the"
"782","Manager determines in good faith that such amount of commission"
"783","was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"

"839","Manager fees, payable monthly, at the annual rates"
"840","indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such Schedule may be"
"841","amended or supplemented from time to time. The fees"
"842","payable pursuant to this Paragraph shall be calculated based"
"843","on the average daily value (as determined on each business"
"844","day at the time set forth in the Prospectus for determining"
"845","net asset value per share) of each Fund's net assets, as"
"846","appropriate, during the preceding month. If the fee payable"
"847","to the Manager pursuant to this Paragraph begins to accrue"

"850","period from the effective date to the end of that month or"
"851","from the beginning of that month to the termination date,"
"852","respectively, shall be prorated according to the proportion"
"853","that the period bears to the full month in which the"
"854","effectiveness or termination occurs. For purposes of"
"855","calculating each such monthly fee, the value of each Fund's"
"856","net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in that"
"857","Fund's registration statement as then on file with the SEC"
"858","for the computation of the value of the Fund's net assets in"
"859","connection with the determination of the net asset value of"
"860","Fund shares. For purposes of this Agreement, a business
day for a Fund is any day that the Fund is open for"

"1170","the Fund's investments in various securities or other assets, in"
"1171","investment styles and, if applicable, in other investment companies"
"1172","or pooled vehicles in which the Fund may invest."
"1173","To the extent the securities of an underlying"
"1174","registered investment company constitute the Fund's only"
"1175","investment security, in accordance with Section 12(d)(1)(E) of the"
"1176","1940 Act, the Manager's responsibilities shall include, but not be"
"1177","limited to, reviewing (at least quarterly) the investment strategy"

"1179","affecting the underlying fund, its objective, investment strategies"
"1180","and risks, and conducting risk management reviews and"
"1181","assessments with respect to the underlying fund and its adviser."
"1182","To carry out such duties, the Manager is hereby"
"1183","authorized, as agent and attorney-in-fact for the Trust, for the"
"1184","account of, at the risk of and in the name of the Trust, to place"

"1187","for the Fund, the Manager is authorized to exercise full discretion"
"1188","and act for the Trust in the same manner and with the same force"
"1189","and effect as the Trust might or could do with respect to such"
"1190","purchases, sales or other transactions, as well as with respect to all"
"1191","other things necessary or incidental to the furtherance or conduct"
"1192","of such purchases, sales or other transactions."
"1193","(b) The Manager will report to the Board at each"
"1194","regular meeting thereof regarding the investment performance of"

"1201","whose securities are held by the Fund, the industries in which they"
"1202","engage, or the economic, social or political conditions prevailing in"

"1269","nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Funds"
"1270","Management to provide any services that may not be provided by it"
"1271","under applicable banking laws and regulations."
"1272","Section 3. Delivery of Documents to the Manager. The"
"1273","Trust has furnished the Manager with true, correct and complete"
"1274","copies of the following documents:"
"1275","(a) The Declaration of Trust, as in effect on the date hereof;"
"1276","(b) The Registration Statement filed with the Commission under"
"1277","the 1940 Act and the Securities Act; and"

"1280","The Trust will furnish the Manager with all future"
"1281","amendments and supplements to the foregoing as soon as"
"1282","practicable after such documents become available. The Trust"
"1283","shall furnish the Manager with any further documents, materials or"
"1284","information that the Manager may reasonably request in"
"1285","connection with the performance of its duties hereunder."
"1286","Section 4. Delegation of Responsibilities."
"1287","(a) The Manager may carry out any of its obligations"
"1288","under this Agreement by employing, subject to supervision by the"
"1289","Manager, one or more Sub-Adviser(s) who are registered as"
"1290","investment advisers pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of"
"1291","1940 (Sub-Advisers). Each Sub-Adviser's employment will be"
"1292","evidenced by a separate written agreement approved by the Board"
"1293","and, if required under the 1940 Act, by the shareholders of the"
"1294","Fund (unless the Commission or its staff has given authorization or"
"1295","issued an interpretation dispensing with the requirement of"
"1296","shareholder approval). The Manager shall not be liable hereunder"
"1297","for any act or omission of any Sub-Adviser, except for failure to"
"1298","exercise good faith in the employment of the Sub-Adviser and for"
"1299","failure to exercise appropriate supervision of such Sub-Adviser,"
"1300","and as may otherwise be agreed in writing. The Manager shall be"
"1301","solely responsible for compensating any Sub-Adviser for services"
"1302","rendered under any Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Manager may,"
"1303","from time to time and at any time, terminate any Sub-Adviser and"
"1304","reassume the responsibilities assigned to such Sub-Adviser with"
"1305","respect to any Fund without obtaining the approval of the"
"1306","shareholders of the Fund."
"1307","(b) The Manager will from time to time employ or subcontract"
"1308","the services to certain persons as the Manager believes to"
"1309","be appropriate or necessary to assist in the execution of the"
"1310","Manager's duties hereunder; provided, however, that the"
"1311","employment or sub-contracting with any such person shall not"
"1312","relieve the Manager of its responsibilities or liabilities hereunder"
"1313","and provided further that the Manager shall not have the authority"
"1314","to sub-contract advisory responsibilities without the consent of the"
"1315","Trust. The cost of performance of such duties will be borne and"
"1316","paid by the Manager. No obligation may be imposed on the Trust"
"1317","in any such respect."
"1318","The Manager shall supervise and monitor the"
"1319","activities of its representatives, personnel, sub-contractors, and"
"1320","agents in connection with the execution of its duties and obligations"
"1321","hereunder. The appropriate personnel of the Manager will be made"
"1322","available to consult with the Board at reasonable times and upon"
"1323","reasonable notice concerning the business of the Trust."
"1324","(c) The Manager shall maintain records relating to"
"1325","portfolio transactions and the placing and allocation of brokerage"
"1326","orders as are required to be maintained by the Trust under the 1940"
"1327","Act. The Manager shall prepare and maintain, or cause to be"
"1328","prepared and maintained, in such form, for such periods and in"
"1329","such locations as may be required by applicable law, all documents"
"1330","and records relating to the services provided by the Manager"
"1331","pursuant to this Agreement required to be prepared and maintained"
"1332","by the Trust pursuant to the rules and regulations of any national,"
"1333","state, or local government entity with jurisdiction over the Trust,"
"1334","including the Commission and the Internal Revenue Service. The"
"1335","books and records pertaining to the Trust which are in possession"
"1336","of the Manager shall be the property of the Trust. The Trust, or the"
"1337","Trust's authorized representatives, shall have access to such books"
"1338","and records at all times during the Manager's normal business"
"1339","hours. Upon the reasonable request of the Trust, copies of any"
"1340","such books and records shall be provided promptly by the Manager"
"1341","to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives."
"1342","Section 5. Control by Board. Any investment activities"
"1343","undertaken by the Manager pursuant to this Agreement, as well as"
"1344","any other activities undertaken by the Manager on behalf of the"
"1345","Fund, shall at all times be subject to the direction and control of the"
"1346","Board."
"1347","Section 6. Compliance with Applicable Requirements."
"1348","In carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, the Manager"
"1349","shall at all times comply with:"
"1350","(a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"1351","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"1352","(b) the Registration Statement of the Trust, as it may be amended"
"1353","from time to time, filed with the Commission under the Securities"
"1354","Act and the 1940 Act;"
"1355","(c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it"
"1356","may be amended from time to time;"
"1357","(d) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,"
"1358","applicable to the Trust or the Fund, and any rules and regulations"
"1359","adopted thereunder; and"
"1360","(e) any other applicable provisions of state or federal law, and"
"1361","any rules and regulations adopted thereunder."
"1362","Section 7. Proxies. The Manager shall have responsibility"
"1363","to vote proxies solicited with respect to issuers of securities in"
"1364","which assets of the Fund are invested in accordance with the"
"1365","Trust's policies on proxy voting."
"1366","Section 8. Broker-Dealer Relationships. In connection"
"1367","with the purchase and sale of securities for the Fund, the Manager"
"1368","is responsible for broker-dealer selection and negotiation of"
"1369","brokerage commission rates. The Manager's primary"
"1370","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain"
"1371","the best price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to"
"1372","execute each particular transaction for the Fund, the Manager will"
"1373","consider among other things: the best net price available, the"
"1374","reliability, integrity and financial condition of the broker-dealer;"
"1375","the size of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value of"
"1376","the expected contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a"
"1377","continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any"
"1378","transaction may be less favorable than that available from another"
"1379","broker-dealer if the difference is reasonably justified by other"
"1380","aspects of the portfolio execution services offered. Subject to such"
"1381","policies as the Board may from time to time determine, the"
"1382","Manager shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have"
"1383","breached any duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely"
"1384","by reason of having caused the Fund to pay a broker or dealer that"
"1385","provides brokerage and research services to the Manager an"
"1386","amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"1387","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker"
"1388","or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if the"
"1389","Manager determines in good faith that such amount of commission"
"1390","was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"1391","research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in"
"1392","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"1393","responsibilities of the Manager with respect to the Fund and to"
"1394","other clients of the Manager. The Manager is further authorized to"
"1395","allocate the orders placed by it on behalf of the Fund to brokers"
"1396","and dealers who also provide brokerage and research services"
"1397","within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange"
"1398","Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith. Such allocation shall be"
"1399","in such amounts and proportions as the Manager shall determine"
"1400","and the Manager will report on said allocations regularly to the"
"1401","Board, indicating the brokers to whom such allocations have been"
"1402","made and the basis therefore."
"1403","Section 9. Expenses. All of the ordinary business"
"1404","expenses incurred in the operations of the Fund and the offering of"
"1405","their shares shall be borne by the Fund unless specifically provided"
"1406","otherwise in this Agreement. The expenses borne by the Trust"
"1407","include, but are not limited to, brokerage commissions, taxes,"
"1408","legal, auditing or governmental fees, the cost of preparing share"

"1413","and distributing reports and notices to shareholders, the fees and"
"1414","other expenses incurred by the Fund in connection with"
"1415","membership in investment company organizations and the cost of"
"1416","printing copies of prospectuses and statements of additional"
"1417","information distributed to the Fund's shareholders."
"1418","The Manager shall pay its own expenses in connection with"
"1419","the services to be provided by it pursuant to this Agreement. In"
"1420","addition, the Manager shall be responsible for reasonable out-ofpocket"
"1421","costs and expenses incurred by the Trust: (a) to amend the"
"1422","Trust's registration statement or supplement the Fund's prospectus,"
"1423","and circulate the same, to reflect a change in the personnel of the"
"1424","Manager responsible for making investment decisions in relation to"
"1425","the Fund; (b) to obtain shareholder approval of a new sub-advisory"
"1426","agreement as a result of a change in control (as such term in"
"1427","defined in Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act) of the Manager, or to"
"1428","otherwise comply with the 1940 Act, the Securities Act, or any"
"1429","other applicable statute, law, rule or regulation, as a result of such"
"1430","change; or (c) to meet other legal or regulatory obligations caused"
"1431","by actions of the Manager."
"1432","Section 10. Compensation."
"1433","(a) As compensation for the advisory services provided"
"1434","under this Agreement, the Trust shall pay the Manager fees,"
"1435","payable monthly, at the annual rates indicated on Schedule A"
"1436","hereto, as such Schedule may be amended or supplemented from"
"1437","time to time;"
"1438","Section 11. Standard of Care. The Trust will expect of"
"1439","the Manager, and the Manager will give the Trust the benefit of,"
"1440","the Manager's best judgment and efforts in rendering its services to"
"1441","the Trust, and the Manager shall not be liable hereunder for any"
"1442","mistake in judgment. In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad"
"1443","faith, negligence or reckless disregard of obligations or duties"
"1444","hereunder on the part of the Manager or any of its officers,"
"1445","directors, employees or agents, the Manager shall not be subject to"
"1446","liability to the Trust or to any shareholders of the Trust for any act"
"1447","or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering services"
"1448","hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase,"
"1449","holding or sale of any security."
"1450","Section 12. Non-Exclusivity. The services of the"
"1451","Manager to the Fund are not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the"
"1452","Manager shall be free to render investment advisory or other"
"1453","services to others (including other investment companies) and to"

"1458","may be permitted by law, and that the officers and directors of the"

"1460","activity or from rendering services to any other person, or from"
"1461","serving as partners, officers, directors or trustees of any other firm"
"1462","or trust, including other investment advisory companies."

"1467","the 1940 Act as well as such records as the Fund's administrator"
"1468","reasonably requests to be maintained, including, but not limited to,"

"1472","rule. All such records will be the property of the Trust and will be"
"1473","made available for inspection and use by the Trust and its"

"1560","discharge or termination is sought. If shareholder approval of an"
"1561","amendment is required under the 1940 Act, no such amendment"
"1562","shall become effective until approved by a vote of the majority of"
"1563","the outstanding shares of the affected Fund. Otherwise, a written"
"1564","amendment of this Agreement is effective upon the approval of the"
"1565","Board and the Manager."
"1566","Section 21. Wells Fargo Name. The Manager and the"
"1567","Trust each agree that the name Wells Fargo, which comprises a"
"1568","component of the Trust's name, is a property right of the parent of"
"1569","the Manager. The Trust agrees and consents that: (i) it will use the"
"1570","words Wells Fargo as a component of its corporate name, the"
"1571","name of any series or class, or all of the above, and for no other"
"1572","purpose; (ii) it will not grant to any third party the right to use the"
"1573","name Wells Fargo for any purpose; (iii) the Manager or any"
"1574","corporate affiliate of the Manager may use or grant to others the"
"1575","right to use the words Wells Fargo, or any combination or"
"1576","abbreviation thereof, as all or a portion of a corporate or business"
"1577","name or for any commercial purpose, other than a grant of such"
"1578","right to another registered investment company not advised by the"
"1579","Manager or one of its affiliates; and (iv) in the event that the"
"1580","Manager or an affiliate thereof is no longer acting as investment"
"1581","adviser to any Fund, the Trust shall, upon request by the Manager,"
"1582","promptly take such action as may be necessary to change its"
"1583","corporate name to one not containing the words Wells Fargo and"
"1584","following such change, shall not use the words Wells Fargo, or"
"1585","any combination thereof, as a part of its corporate name or for any"
"1586","other commercial purpose, and shall use its best efforts to cause its"
"1587","trustees, officers and shareholders to take any and all actions that"
"1588","the Manager may request to effect the foregoing and to reconvey to"
"1589","the Manager any and all rights to such words."
"1590","Section 22. Risk Acknowledgement. The Manager does"
"1591","not guarantee the future performance of the Fund or any specific"
"1592","level of performance, the success of any investment decision or"
"1593","strategy that the Manager may use, or the success of the Manager's"
"1594","overall management of the Fund. The Trust understands that"
"1595","investment decisions made for the Fund by the Manager are"
"1596","subject to various market, currency, economic and business risks,"
"1597","and that those investment decisions will not always be profitable."
"1598","The Manager will manage only the securities, cash and other"
"1599","investments for which management responsibility is delegated to it"
"1600","and which are held in the Fund's account(s) and, in making"
"1601","investment decisions for the Fund, the Manager will not consider"
"1602","any other securities, cash or other investments owned by the Trust."
"1603","IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused"
"1604","this Agreement to be executed in duplicate by their respective"
"1605","officers on the day and year first written above."

"1680","<TEXT>"
"1681","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1682","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"1683","Wells Fargo Funds Trust:"
"1684","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1685","statements of the Wells Fargo Absolute Return Fund"
"1686","(formerly known as the Wells Fargo Advantage Absolute"
"1687","Return Fund) and Wells Fargo Asset Allocation Fund"
"1688","(formerly known as the Wells Fargo Advantage Asset"
"1689","Allocation Fund), two of the funds constituting the"
"1690","Wells Fargo Funds Trust (collectively, the Funds),"
"1691","as of and for the year ended April 30, 2016, in"
"1692","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1693","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1694","considered the Funds internal control over financial"
"1695","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"1696","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1697","purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial"
"1698","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"1699","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"1700","on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"1701","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1702","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"1703","and maintaining effective internal controls over financial"
"1704","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1705","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"1706","benefits and related costs of controls. A funds internal"
"1707","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1708","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1709","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1710","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1711","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal"
"1712","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1713","procedures that (l) pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"1714","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1715","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"1716","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1717","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1718","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1719","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"1720","in accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"1721","of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1722","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,"
"1723","or disposition of the funds assets that could have a material"
"1724","effect on the financial statements."
"1725","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1726","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1727","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1728","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1729","inadequate because of changes in condition, or that the degree"
"1730","of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1731","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1732","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1733","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"1734","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
"1735","basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1736","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1737","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"1738","of the Funds annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1739","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1740","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"1741","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1742","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1743","internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"1744","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1745","(United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds"
"1746","internal control over financial reporting and its operations,"
"1747","including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider"
"1748","to be a material weakness as defined above as of April 30, 2016."
"1749","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1750","management and the Board of Trustees of the Wells Fargo Funds"
"1751","Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"1752","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"1753","specified parties."
