"684","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify>In planning and performing our audit of"

"686","as of and for the year ended March 31, 2015, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"687","(United States), we considered the Funds&rsquo; internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"688","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"689","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"690","Funds&rsquo; internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</P>"

"692","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify>The management of the Funds is responsible"
"693","for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"694","and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund&rsquo;s internal"
"695","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"696","and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"697","A fund&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"698","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"699","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"700","with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"701","directors of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"702","use or disposition of a fund&rsquo;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
