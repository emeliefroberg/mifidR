"685","<DESCRIPTION>AUDIT LETTER"
"686","<TEXT>"
"687","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"688","Accounting Firm"
"689","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders"
"690","of Cohen & Steers Low Duration Preferred and"
"691","Income Fund, Inc."
"692","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"693","statements of Cohen & Steers Low Duration Preferred"
"694","and Income Fund, Inc. (the Fund) as of and for the"
"695","year ended April 30, 2018, in accordance with the"
"696","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"697","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"698","Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"699","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"700","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"701","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"702","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"703","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"704","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"705","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"706","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"707","Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"708","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"709","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"710","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"711","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"712","management are required to assess the expected"
"713","benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's"
"714","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"715","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"716","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"717","preparation of financial statements for external"
"718","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"719","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over"
"720","financial reporting includes those policies and"
"721","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"722","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"723","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"724","of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"725","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"726","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"727","generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"728","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made"
"729","only in accordance with authorizations of"
"730","management and directors of the fund; and (3)"
"731","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"732","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"733","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a"
"734","material effect on the financial statements."
"735","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"736","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"737","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"738","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"739","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"740","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"741","compliance with the policies or procedures may"

"745","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"746","the normal course of performing their assigned"

"749","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"750","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"751","possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's"

"754","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
