"938","Accounting"
"939","Firm"
"940","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"941","of"
"942","IVA Fiduciary Trust:"
"943","In planning and performing our audits of"
"944","the"
"945","financial statements of IVA Worldwide Fund"
"946","and"
"947","IVA International Fund (two of the Funds"
"948","comprising IVA Fiduciary Trust)"
"949","(collectively, the"
"950","Funds) as of and for the year ended"
"951","September 30,"
"952","2011, in accordance with the standards of"
"953","the Public"
"954","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"955","States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"956","control"
"957","over financial reporting, including"
"958","controls over"
"959","safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"960","designing our"
"961","auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"962","expressing"
"963","our opinion on the financial statements"
"964","and to"
"965","comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"966","SAR, but"
"967","not for the purpose of expressing an"
"968","opinion on the"
"969","effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"970","control over"
"971","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"972","express no"
"973","such opinion."
"974","The management of the Funds is responsible"
"975","for"
"976","establishing and maintaining effective"
"977","internal"
"978","control over financial reporting. In"
"979","fulfilling this"
"980","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"981","management are required to assess the"
"982","expected"
"983","benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"984","company's"
"985","internal control over financial reporting"
"986","is a process"
"987","designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"988","regarding"
"989","the reliability of financial reporting and"
"990","the"
"991","preparation of financial statements for"
"992","external"
"993","purposes in accordance with generally"
"994","accepted"
"995","accounting principles. A company's"
"996","internal control"
"997","over financial reporting includes those"
"998","policies and"
"999","procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1000","maintenance of"
"1001","records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1002","accurately and"
"1003","fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1004","dispositions of the"
"1005","assets of the company; (2) provide"
"1006","reasonable"
"1007","assurance that transactions are recorded"
"1008","as necessary"
"1009","to permit preparation of financial"
"1010","statements in"
"1011","accordance with generally accepted"
"1012","accounting"
"1013","principles, and that receipts and"
"1014","expenditures of the"
"1015","company are being made only in accordance"
"1016","with"
"1017","authorizations of management and directors"
"1018","of the"
"1019","company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1020","assurance"
"1021","regarding prevention or timely detection"
"1022","of"
"1023","unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"1024","disposition of a"
"1025","company's assets that could have a"
"1026","material effect"
"1027","on the financial statements."
"1028","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"1029","internal control"
"1030","over financial reporting may not prevent"
"1031","or detect"
"1032","misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"1033","evaluation"
"1034","of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1035","subject to the"
"1036","risk that controls may become inadequate"
"1037","because of"
"1038","changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"1039","of"
"1040","compliance with the policies or procedures"
"1041","may"
"1042","deteriorate."
"1043","A deficiency in internal control over"
"1044","financial"
"1045","reporting exists when the design or"
"1046","operation of a"
"1047","control does not allow management or"
"1048","employees, in"
"1049","the normal course of performing their"
"1050","assigned"
"1051","functions, to prevent or detect"
"1052","misstatements on a"
"1053","timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"1054","deficiency, or"
"1055","a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1056","control"
"1057","over financial reporting, such that there"
"1058","is a"
"1059","reasonable possibility that a material"
"1060","misstatement of"
"1061","the company's annual or interim financial"
"1062","statements"
"1063","will not be prevented or detected on a"
"1064","timely basis."
"1065","Our consideration of the Funds' internal"
"1066","control over"
"1067","financial reporting was for the limited"
"1068","purpose"
"1069","described in the first paragraph and would"
"1070","not"
"1071","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1072","internal"
"1073","control that might be material weaknesses"
"1074","under"
"1075","standards established by the Public"
"1076","Company"
"1077","Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1078","States)."
"1079","However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"1080","Funds'"
"1081","internal control over financial reporting"
"1082","and its"
"1083","operation, including controls over"
"1084","safeguarding"
"1085","securities that we consider to be a"
"1086","material weakness"
"1087","as defined above as of September 30, 2011."
