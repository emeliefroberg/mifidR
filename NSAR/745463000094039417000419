"1333","       FEE REDUCTION AGREEMENT"
"1334","	AGREEMENT made as of this 1st day of November 2016,"
"1335","between Eaton Vance Mutual Funds Trust (the Trust) on behalf"
"1336","of Parametric Commodity Strategy Fund (the Fund) and Eaton"
"1337","Vance Management (the Adviser)."
"1338","	WHEREAS, the Trust on behalf of the Fund has entered"
"1339","into an Investment Advisory and Administrative Agreement (the"
"1340","Advisory Agreement) with the Adviser, which provides that the"
"1341","Adviser shall be entitled to receive compensation at a certain"
"1342","rate; and"
"1343","       WHEREAS, the Adviser has offered to reduce such"
"1344","advisory fee rate, and the Trust has accepted such fee reduction,"
"1345","such fee reduction being effective as of November 1, 2016; and"
"1346","       WHEREAS, the Adviser and the Trust wish to"
"1347","memorialize said fee reduction in writing;"
"1348","	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual"
"1349","covenants and agreements contained herein and for other good"
"1350","and valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby"
"1351","acknowledged, the Trust and the Adviser hereby jointly and"
"1352","severally agree as follows:"
"1353","1.	For so long as the Advisory Agreement shall remain in"
"1354","effect, notwithstanding any provisions of the Advisory"
"1355","Agreement to the contrary, the Adviser will reduce its"
"1356","advisory fee for the Trust in accordance with the fee"
"1357","reduction schedule set forth on Exhibit A hereto."
"1358","2.	This Agreement may only be terminated or amended"
"1359","upon the mutual written consent of the Trust and the"
"1360","Adviser; provided, however, that (i) no termination of"
"1361","this Agreement shall be effective unless approved by the"
"1362","majority vote of those Trustees of the Trust who are not"
"1363","interested persons of the Adviser or the Trust (the"
"1364","Independent Trustees) and by the vote of a majority of"
"1365","the outstanding voting securities of the Fund; (ii) no"
"1366","amendment of this Agreement shall be effective unless"
"1367","approved by the majority vote of the Independent"
"1368","Trustees; and (iii) no amendment of this Agreement that"
"1369","decreases the fee reductions set forth herein shall be"
"1370","effective unless approved by the vote of a majority of"
"1371","the outstanding voting securities of the Fund."
"1372","3.	For purposes of this Agreement the term vote of a
majority of the outstanding voting securities of the
Fund shall mean the vote, at a meeting of"

"1376","centum of the outstanding shares of the Fund are"
"1377","present or represented by proxy at the meeting, or (ii)"
"1378","more than 50 per centum of the outstanding shares of"
"1379","the Fund."
"1380","4.	This instrument is executed under seal and shall be"

"1599","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"

"1601","funds constituting Eaton Vance Mutual Funds Trust) as of and for"
"1602","the year ended December 31, 2016, in accordance with the"
"1603","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1604","(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"1605","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1606","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1607","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"1608","and to comply with the requirements of Form N- SAR, but not for"
"1609","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1610","Fund's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"1611","express no such opinion."
"1612","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1613","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1614","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1615","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1616","related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over financial"
"1617","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1618","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1619","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1620","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal"
"1621","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1622","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1623","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"1624","and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"1625","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1626","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"

"1628","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"

"1630","trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"

"1632","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1633","financial statements."
"1634","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1635","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"

"1637","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"1638","because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1639","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1640","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1641","the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"1642","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1643","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"1644","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1645","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that"
"1646","there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a"
