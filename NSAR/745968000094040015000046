"1704","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1705","To the Shareholders and"
"1706","Board of Trustees of"
"1707","Federated Equity Funds"
"1708","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1709","statements of Federated Emerging Markets Equity Fund,"
"1710","Federated InterContinental Fund and Federated International"
"1711","Strategic Value Dividend Fund  (collectively, the Funds),"
"1712","each a portfolio of Federated Equity Funds, as of and for the"
"1713","year ended November 30, 2014, in accordance with the standards"
"1714","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1715","States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"1716","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1717","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"1718","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1719","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1720","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1721","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1722","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1723","Management of the Funds are responsible for establishing and"
"1724","maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1725","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1726","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"1727","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal"
"1728","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1729","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1730","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1731","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1732","accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"1733","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1734","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"1735","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1736","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"1737","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1738","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1739","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1740","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"1741","are being made in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1742","and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1743","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of the"
"1744","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's"
"1745","assets that could have a material affect on the financial"
"1746","statements."
"1747","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1748","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1749","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1750","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1751","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"1752","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1753","deteriorate."
"1754","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1755","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1756","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1757","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1758","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"1759","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1760","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1761","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1762","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1763","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1764","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"1765","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"1766","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"1767","deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1768","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1769","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted"
"1770","no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1771","reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"1772","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material"
"1773","weakness as defined above as of November 30, 2014."
"1774","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1775","management and the Board of Trustees of Federated Equity Funds"
"1776","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"1777","to be and should not be used by anyone other than those"
"1778","specified parties."

LIMITED POWER OF ATTORNEY


	KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, dated as of March 1, 2007,
that Federated Equity Funds, a business trust duly organized
under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the
Trust), does hereby nominate, constitute and appoint Federated
Global Investment Management Corp., a business corporation duly
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (the
Adviser), to act hereunder as the true and lawful agent and
attorney-in-fact of the Trust, acting on behalf of each of the
series portfolios for which the Adviser acts as investment
adviser shown on Schedule 1 attached hereto and incorporated by
reference herein (each such series portfolio being hereinafter
referred to as a Fund and collectively as the Funds), for
the specific purpose of executing and delivering all such
agreements, instruments, contracts, assignments, bond powers,
stock powers, transfer instructions, receipts, waivers, consents
and other documents, and performing all such acts, as the
Adviser may deem necessary or reasonably desirable, related to
the acquisition, disposition and/or reinvestment of the funds
and assets of a Fund of the Trust in accordance with Adviser's
supervision of the investment, sale and reinvestment of the
funds and assets of each Fund pursuant to the authority granted
to the Adviser as investment adviser of each Fund under that
certain investment advisory contract dated March 1, 2007 by and
between the Adviser and the Trust (such investment advisory
contract, as may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
from time to time is hereinafter referred to as the Investment"
"1801","Advisory Contract).

	The Adviser shall exercise or omit to exercise the powers
and authorities granted herein in each case as the Adviser in
its sole and absolute discretion deems desirable or appropriate
under existing circumstances.  The Trust hereby ratifies and
confirms as good and effectual, at law or in equity, all that
the Adviser, and its officers and employees, may do by virtue
hereof.  However, despite the above provisions, nothing herein
shall be construed as imposing a duty on the Adviser to act or
assume responsibility for any matters referred to above or other
matters even though the Adviser may have power or authority
hereunder to do so.  Nothing in this Limited Power of Attorney
shall be construed (i) to be an amendment or modifications of,
or supplement to, the Investment Advisory Contract, (ii) to
amend, modify, limit or denigrate any duties, obligations or
liabilities of the Adviser under the terms of the Investment
Advisory Contract or (iii) exonerate, relieve or release the
Adviser any losses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments
and suits and other costs, expenses and disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by
or asserted against the Adviser (x) under the terms of the
Investment Advisory Contract or (y) at law, or in equity, for
the performance of its duties as the investment adviser of any
of the Funds.

	The Trust hereby agrees to indemnify and save harmless the
Adviser and its Trustees, officers and employees (each of the
foregoing an Indemnified Party and collectively the
Indemnified Parties) against and from any and all losses,
obligations, penalties, actions, judgments and suits and other
costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against an Indemnified Party, other than as a consequence of
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an
Indemnified Party, arising out of or in connection with this
Limited Power of Attorney or any other agreement, instrument or
document executed in connection with the exercise of the
authority granted to the Adviser herein to act on behalf of the
Trust, including without limitation the reasonable costs,
expenses and disbursements in connection with defending such
Indemnified Party against any claim or liability related to the
exercise or performance of any of the Adviser's powers or duties
under this Limited Power of Attorney or any of the other
agreements, instruments or documents executed in connection with
the exercise of the authority granted to the Adviser herein to
act on behalf of the Trust, or the taking of any action under or
in connection with any of the foregoing.  The obligations of the
Trust under this paragraph shall survive the termination of this
Limited Power of Attorney with respect to actions taken by the
Adviser on behalf of the Trust during the term of this Limited
Power of Attorney.  No Fund shall have any joint or several
obligations with any other Fund to reimburse or indemnify an
Indemnified Party for any action, event, matter or occurrence
performed or omitted by or on behalf of the Adviser in its
capacity as agent or attorney-in-fact of Trust acting on behalf
of any other Fund hereunder.

	Any person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity
dealing with the Adviser in its capacity as attorney-in-fact
hereunder for the Trust is hereby expressly put on notice that
the Adviser is acting solely in the capacity as an agent of the
Trust and that any such person, partnership, corporation or
other legal entity must look solely to the Trust in question for
enforcement of any claim against the Trust, as the Adviser
assumes no personal liability whatsoever for obligations of the
Trust entered into by the Adviser in its capacity as attorney-
in-fact for the Trust.

	Each person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity
which deals with a Fund of the Trust through the Adviser in its
capacity as agent and attorney-in-fact of the Trust, is hereby
expressly put on notice (i) that all persons or entities dealing
with the Trust must look solely to the assets of the Fund of the
Trust on whose behalf the Adviser is acting pursuant to its
powers hereunder for enforcement of any claim against the Trust,
as the Trustees, officers and/or agents of such Trust, the
shareholders of the various classes of shares of the Trust and
the other Funds of the Trust assume no personal liability
whatsoever for obligations entered into on behalf of such Fund
of the Trust, and (ii) that the rights, liabilities and
obligations of any one Fund are separate and distinct from those
of any other Fund of the Trust.

	The execution of this Limited Power of Attorney by the
Trust acting on behalf of the several Funds shall not be deemed
to evidence the existence of any express or implied joint
undertaking or appointment by and among any or all of the Funds.
Liability for or recourse under or upon any undertaking of the
Adviser pursuant to the power or authority granted to the
Adviser under this Limited Power of Attorney under any rule of
law, statute or constitution or by the enforcement of any
assessment or penalty or by legal or equitable proceedings or
otherwise shall be limited only to the assets of the Fund of the
Trust on whose behalf the Adviser was acting pursuant to the
authority granted hereunder.

	The Trust hereby agrees that no person, partnership,
corporation or other legal entity dealing with the Adviser shall
be bound to inquire into the Adviser's power and authority
hereunder and any such person, partnership, corporation or other
legal entity shall be fully protected in relying on such power
or authority unless such person, partnership, corporation or
other legal entity has received prior written notice from the
Trust that this Limited Power of Attorney has been revoked. This
Limited Power of Attorney shall be revoked and terminated
automatically upon the cancellation or termination of the
Investment Advisory Contract between the Trust and the Adviser.
Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the
powers and authorities herein granted may be revoked or
terminated by the Trust at any time provided that no such
revocation or termination shall be effective until the Adviser
has received actual notice of such revocation or termination in
writing from the Trust.

	This Limited Power of Attorney constitutes the entire
agreement between the Trust and the Adviser, may be changed only
by a writing signed by both of them, and shall bind and benefit
their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, the
Adviser shall have no power or authority hereunder to appoint a
successor or substitute attorney in fact for the Trust.

	This Limited Power of Attorney shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania without reference to principles of conflicts of
laws.  If any provision hereof, or any power or authority
conferred upon the Adviser herein, would be invalid or
unexercisable under applicable law, then such provision, power
or authority shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to
render it valid or exercisable while most nearly preserving its
original intent, and no provision hereof, or power or authority
conferred upon the Adviser herein, shall be affected by the
invalidity or the non-exercisability of another provision
hereof, or of another power or authority conferred herein.

	This Limited Power of Attorney may be executed in as many
identical counterparts as may be convenient and by the different
parties hereto on separate counterparts.  This Limited Power of
Attorney shall become binding on the Trust when the Trust shall
have executed at least one counterpart and the Adviser shall
have accepted its appointment by executing this Limited Power of
Attorney.  Immediately after the execution of a counterpart
original of this Limited Power of Attorney and solely for the
convenience of the parties hereto, the Trust and the Adviser
will execute sufficient counterparts so that the Adviser shall
have a counterpart executed by it and the Trust, and the Trust
shall have a counterpart executed by the Trust and the Adviser.
Each counterpart shall be deemed an original and all such taken
together shall constitute but one and the same instrument, and
it shall not be necessary in making proof of this Limited Power
of Attorney to produce or account for more than one such
counterpart.

	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Trust has caused this Limited Power
of Attorney to be executed by its duly authorized officer as of
the date first written above.
