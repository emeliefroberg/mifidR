"600","SUB-ITEM 77E:  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"601","LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"602","Since October 2003, Federated and related entities"
"603"," (collectively, Federated), and various Federated funds"
"604","(Funds), have been named as defendants in several"
"605"," class action lawsuits now pending in the United States"
"606","District Court for the District of Maryland. The la"
"607","wsuits were purportedly filed on behalf of people who"
"608","purchased, owned and/or redeemed shares of Federate"
"609","d-sponsored mutual funds during specified periods"
"610","beginning November 1, 1998. The suits are generally"
"611"," similar in alleging that Federated engaged in illegal"
"612","and improper trading practices including market tim"
"613","ing and late trading in concert with certain institutional"
"614","traders, which allegedly caused financial injury to"
"615","the mutual fund shareholders. These lawsuits began to be"
"616","filed shortly after Federated's first public announc"
"617","ement that it had received requests for information on"
"618","shareholder trading activities in the Funds from th"
"619","e SEC, the Office of the New York State Attorney"
"620","General (NYAG), and other authorities. In that re"
"621","gard, on November 28, 2005, Federated announced that"
"622","it had reached final settlements with the SEC and th"
"623","e NYAG with respect to those matters. Specifically, the"
"624","SEC and NYAG settled proceedings against three Feder"
"625","ated subsidiaries involving undisclosed market"
"626","timing arrangements and late trading. The SEC made f"
"627","indings: that Federated Investment Management"
"628","Company (FIMC), an SEC-registered investment advis"
"629","er to various Funds, and Federated Securities"
"630","Corp., an SEC-registered broker-dealer and distributo"
"631","r for the Funds, violated provisions of the Investment"
"632","Advisers Act and Investment Company Act by approving,"
"633","but not disclosing, three market timing"
"634","arrangements, or the associated conflict of interest"
"635","between FIMC and the funds involved in the"
"636","arrangements, either to other fund shareholders or t"
"637","o the funds' board; and that Federated Shareholder"
"638","Services Company, formerly an SEC-registered transfer"
"639"," agent, failed to prevent a customer and a Federated"
"640","employee from late trading in violation of provisions"
"641"," of the Investment Company Act. The NYAG found"
"642","that such conduct violated provisions of New York Stat"
"643","e law. Federated entered into the settlements"
"644","without admitting or denying the regulators' findings."
"645"," As Federated previously reported in 2004, it has"
"646","already paid approximately $8.0 million to certain fu"
"647","nds as determined by an independent consultant. As"
"648","part of these settlements, Federated agreed to pay dis"
"649","gorgement and a civil money penalty in the aggregate"
"650","amount of an additional $72 million and, among other t"
"651","hings, agreed that it would not serve as investment"
"652","adviser to any registered investment company unless (i)"
"653","at least 75% of the fund's directors are independent"
"654","of Federated, (ii) the chairman of each such fund is in"
"655","dependent of Federated, (iii) no action may be taken"
"656","by the fund's board or any committee thereof unless app"
"657","roved by a majority of the independent trustees of"
"658","the fund or committee, respectively, and (iv) the fund a"
"659","ppoints a senior officer who reports to the"
"660","independent trustees and is responsible for monitoring"
"661","compliance by the fund with applicable laws and"
"662","fiduciary duties and for managing the process by which"
"663","management fees charged to a fund are approved."
"664","The settlements are described in Federated's announcem"
"665","ent which, along with previous press releases and"
"666","related communications on those matters, is available i"
"667","n the About Us section of Federated's website at"
"668","FederatedInvestors.com."
"669","Federated entities have also been named as defendants i"
"670","n several additional lawsuits that are now pending"
"671","in the United States District Court for the Western Dis"
"672","trict of Pennsylvania, alleging, among other things,"
"673","excessive advisory and Rule 12b-1 fees."
"674","The Board of the Funds retained the law firm of Dickste"
"675","in Shapiro LLP to represent the Funds in each of"
"676","the lawsuits described in the preceding two paragraphs."
"677"," Federated and the Funds, and their respective"
"678","counsel, have been defending this litigation, and none"
"679","of the Funds remains a defendant in any of the"
"680","lawsuits (though some could potentially receive any reco"
"681","veries as nominal defendants). Additional lawsuits"
"682","based upon similar allegations may be filed in the futu"
"683","re. The potential impact of these lawsuits, all of"
"684","which seek unquantified damages, attorneys' fees, and e"
"685","xpenses, and future potential similar suits is"
"686","uncertain. Although we do not believe that these lawsuit"
"687","s will have a material adverse effect on the Funds,"
"688","there can be no assurance that these suits, ongoing adve"
"689","rse publicity and/or other developments resulting"
"690","from the regulatory investigations will not result in in"
"691","creased Fund redemptions, reduced sales of Fund"
"692","shares, or other adverse consequences for the Funds."

"700","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"701","Accounting Firm"
"702","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"703","Federated Equity Income Fund, Inc.:"
"704","In planning and performing our audit of"
"705"," the financial statements of Federated Equity Income Fund,"
"706","Inc. (the Fund) as of and for the yea"
"707","r ended November 30, 2009, in accordance with the"
"708","standards of the Public Company Account"
"709","ing Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"710","Fund's internal control over financial r"
"711","eporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"712","a basis for designing our auditing proce"
"713","dures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"714","financial statements and to comply with"
"715","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"716","of expressing an opinion on the effectiv"
"717","eness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"718","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"719","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"720"," for establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"721","control over financial reporting.  In fulf"
"722","illing this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"723","management are required to assess the exp"
"724","ected benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"725","company's internal control over financial r"
"726","eporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"727","assurance regarding the reliability of finan"
"728","cial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"729","for external purposes in accordance with ge"
"730","nerally accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"731","internal control over financial reporting i"
"732","ncludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"733","the maintenance of records that, in reasona"
"734","ble detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"735","and dispositions of the assets of the compa"
"736","ny; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"737","are recorded as necessary to permit preparat"
"738","ion of financial statements in accordance with"
"739","generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"740","that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"741","being made only in accordance with authorizat"
"742","ions of management and directors of the company;"
"743","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"744"," prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"745","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"746"," assets that could have a material effect on the"
"747","financial statements."
"748","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"749"," control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"750","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"751"," evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"752","subject to the risk that controls may become i"
"753","nadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"754","the degree of compliance with the policies or p"
"755","rocedures may deteriorate."
"756","A deficiency in internal control over financial r"
"757","eporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"758","control does not allow management or employees,"
"759","in the normal course of performing their"
"760","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstat"
"761","ements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is"
"762","a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, i"
"763","n internal control over financial reporting, such that"
