"486","<p align=center><font face=Times New Roman size=2><u><b>REPORT OF INDEPENDENT"
"487"," REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM</b></u></font></p>"
"488","<p align=justify><font face=Times New Roman size=2>To the Shareholders of Big 4 OneFund and"
"489","<br>Board of Trustees of World Funds Trust</font></p>"
"490","<p align=justify><font face=Times New Roman size=2>In planning and performing our audit of"
"491"," the financial statements of Big 4 OneFund (the &#147;Fund&#148;), a series of World"
"492"," Funds Trust, as of and for the period ended October 31, 2015, in accordance with"
"493"," the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"494"," we considered the Fund&#146;s internal control over financial reporting, including"
"495"," controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"496"," for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"497"," with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"498"," on the effectiveness of the Fund&#146;s internal control over financial reporting."
"499"," Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</font></p>"
"500","<p align=justify><font face=Times New Roman size=2>The management of the Fund is responsible"
"501"," for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"502"," In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required"
"503"," to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund&#146;s internal"
"504"," control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"505"," regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"506"," statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"507"," principles (GAAP). A fund&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes"
"508"," those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"509"," in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"510"," of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"511"," recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"512"," with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"513"," accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"514"," reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"515"," use or disposition of a fund&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on"
"516"," the financial statements.</font></p>"
"517","<p align=justify><font face=Times New Roman size=2>Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"518"," control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"519"," projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"520"," the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"521"," that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</font></p>"
"522","<p align=justify><font face=Times New Roman size=2>A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"523"," reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"524"," or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"525"," or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"526"," or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"527"," that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund&#146;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"528"," on a timely basis.</font></p>"
"529","<p align=justify><font face=Times New Roman size=2>Our consideration of the Fund&#146;s internal"
"530"," control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"531"," paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"532"," that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"533"," Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"534"," the Fund&#146;s internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"535"," controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness"
"536"," as defined above as of October 31, 2015.</font></p>"
"537","<p align=justify><font face=Times New Roman size=2>This report is intended solely for the information"
"538"," and use of management and the Board of Trustees&#160;of the Fund and the Securities"
"539"," and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
"540"," other than these specified parties.</font></p><br><br>"
