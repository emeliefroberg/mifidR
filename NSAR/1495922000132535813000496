"1029","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1030","To the Board of Trustees of EntrepreneurSharesTM Series Trust"
"1031","and the Shareholders of EntrepreneurSharesTM Global Fund"
"1032","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of EntrepreneurSharesTM Global Fund, (the Fund), a separate series of the EntrepreneurSharesTM Series Trust as of and for the year ended June 30, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1033","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1034","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1035","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1036","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of June 30, 2013."
"1037","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the Board of Trustees of EntrepreneurSharesTM Series Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1061","Sub-Item 77K:  Change in Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1062","On May 9, 2013, the Fund's Board of Directors engaged the firm McGladrey LLP to serve as the new independent registered public accounting firm to the Fund.  During the two most recent fiscal years and through May 9, 2013, the Fund's management did not consult McGladrey LLP regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Fund's financial statements, or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement or a reportable event, as such terms are defined in Item 304 of Regulation S-K.  The decision to appoint McGladrey LLP was approved by the audit committee of the Fund's board of directors and by the Fund's board of directors."
"1063","On May 28, 2013, Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y) resigned as the independent registered public accounting firm for the EntrepreneurShares Global Fund (the Fund).  The reports of E&Y on the Fund's financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2012 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles."
"1064","During the two most recent fiscal years and through May 9, 2013, there were no disagreements with E&Y on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of E&Y, would have caused E&Y to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports on the financial statements for such years.  During the two most recent fiscal years and through May 9, 2013, there were no reportable events of the kind enumerated in paragraphs (1)(v)(A) through (D) of item 304(a) of Regulation S-K."
"1065","The Fund has provided E&Y with a copy of these disclosures and has requested E&Y to furnish the Fund with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the statements made by the Fund herein and, if not, detailing the particular statements with which it does not agree.  A copy of such letter, dated August 15, 2013, is filed as an exhibit to this Form N-SAR."
