"449","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"450","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"451","Steward Funds, Inc. and Capstone Series Fund, Inc."
"452","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Steward"
"453","Funds, Inc. comprising Steward Large Cap Enhanced Index Fund, Steward Select"
"454","Bond Fund, Steward International Enhanced Index Fund, and Steward Global"
"455","Equity Income Fund, and Capstone Series Fund, Inc. comprising Steward"
"456","Small-Mid Cap Enhanced Index Fund (collectively referred to as the Funds),"
"457","as of and for the year ended April 30, 2014, in accordance with the"
"458","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"459","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"460","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"461","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"462","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"463","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"464","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"465","express no such opinion."
"466","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"467","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"468","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"469","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's"
"470","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"471","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"472","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"473","with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A fund's internal"
"474","control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"475","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"476","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"477","assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"478","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"479","accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"480","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"481","directors of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"482","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"483","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"484","financial statements."
"485","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"486","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"487","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"488","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"489","that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"490","deteriorate."
"491","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"492","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"493","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"494","or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"495","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"496","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"497","material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial statements"
"498","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"499","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"500","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"501","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"502","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"503","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"504","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and"
"505","its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"506","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of April 30, 2014."
"507","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"508","and the Board of Directors of the Funds and the Securities and Exchange"
"509","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
"510","other than these specified parties."

"521","LIST OF PENDING, THREATENED OR SETTLED LITIGATION"
"522","The Steward Funds have been named as defendants and as putative members of a"
"523","proposed defendant class in Kirschner v. FitzSimons (In re Tribune Co.), No."
"524","12-2652 (S.D.N.Y.) (the FitzSimons action) and Deutsche Bank Trust Co."
"525","Americas v. Employees Retirement Fund of the City of Dallas, Texas, No."
"526","11-9568 (S.D.N.Y.) (the Deutsche Bank action) as a result of the sale by"
"527","Steward Large Cap Enhanced Index Fund (then known as Steward Domestic All-Cap"
"528","Equity Fund) and Steward Multi-Manager Equity Fund (a fund that is no longer"
"529","in existence) of their shares in the Tribune Company (Tribune) in a 2007"
"530","leveraged buyout transaction (LBO) by which Tribune converted to a"
"531","privately-held company. Both lawsuits have been consolidated with the majority"
"532","of the other Tribune-related lawsuits in the multidistrict litigation"
"533","proceeding In re Tribune Co. Fraudulent Conveyance Litig., No. 11-2296"
"534","(S.D.N.Y.) (the MDL Proceeding). None of these lawsuits alleges any"
"535","wrongdoing on the part of the Steward Funds. On September 23, 2013, the Court"
"536","granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the Deutsche Bank action on the"
"537","basis that the plaintiffs lacked standing. Both sides are appealing the"
"538","decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The appeals"
"539","have been fully briefed, although a date has not been set for argument in the"
"540","Second Circuit. On February 25, 2014, the District Court issued a Phase Two
Motion Protocol in the FitzSimons action that directed the liaison counsel"
"541","for the shareholder defendants to file a global motion to dismiss, i.e., a"
"542","motion that applies to the claim against all shareholder defendants, with"
"543","respect to the plaintiff's claim brought against former Tribune shareholders"
"544","for intentional fraudulent conveyance under U.S. federal law. On May 23, 2014,"
"545","the defendants filed motions to dismiss the Fifth Amended Complaint in the"
"546","FitzSimons action. That motion remains pending. At this state of the"
"547","proceedings, the Steward Funds are not able to make a reliable prediction as"
"548","to these lawsuits or the effect, if any, on the net asset value of the Funds."
"549","Capstone Asset Management Company has been named as a defendant in Weisfelner,"
"550","as Trustee of the LB Creditor Trust v. Fund 1 (In re Lyondell Co.), Adversary"
"551","Proceeding No. 10-4609 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.) (the Creditor Trust action), and"
"552","has responded to a subpoena issued in Weisfelner, as Trustee of the LB"
"553","Litigation Trust v.A. Holmes and H. Holmes TTEE (In re Lyondell Co.),"
"554","Adversary Proceeding No. 10-5525 (S.D.N.Y.) (the Litigation Trust action)."
"555","A third action, entitled Weisfelner, as Trustee of the LB Creditor Trust v."
"556","Reichman, Adversary Proceeding No. 12-1570 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.) (the Reichman
action), arises out of the same facts and circumstances alleged in the other"
"557","two actions. All three cases relate to the 2008 bankruptcy of Lyondell"
"558","Chemical Company (Lyondell), shares of which were sold by Steward Large"
"559","Cap Enhanced Index Fund pursuant to the cash out merger of Lyondell"
"560","shareholders in connection with the combination of Lyondell and Basell AF in"
"561","2007. On January 14, 2014, the Court granted in part and denied in part the"
"562","defendants' motion to dismiss the Creditor Trust action. In particular, the"
"563","Court dismissed all defendants who were conduits for the proceeds from the"
"564","merger transaction, and also ruled that the plaintiff could not bring any"
"565","claims on behalf of certain entities who had ratified the merger transaction."
"566","The Court also dismissed without prejudice the plaintiff's claims for"
"567","intentional fraudulent transfer against the remaining defendants, and gave"
"568","the Credit Trustee leave to replead these claims. Finally, the Court denied"
"569","the motion to dismiss with respect to the plaintiff's claims for constructive"
"570","fraudulent transfer against the remaining defendants. On April 7, 2014,"
"571","the plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint in the Creditor Trust action,"
"572","a Second Amended Complaint in the Litigation Trust action, and an Amended"
"573","Complaint in the Reichman action. Like prior versions of the complaints,"
"574","the amended complaints allege claims for fraudulent transfer against the"
"575","former Lyondell shareholders. In May 2014, the plaintiff in the Litigation"
"576","Trust Action filed a motion to certify a defendant class. The Court held a"
"577","status conference on May 29, 2014, and set forth a schedule for motions to"
"578","dismiss and motion for class certification. None of these lawsuits alleges"
"579","any wrongdoing on the part of Steward Large Cap Enhanced Index Fund. At"
"580","this state of the proceedings, Steward Large Cap Enhanced Index Fund is"
"581","not able to make a reliable prediction as to the outcome of these lawsuits"
"582","or the effect, if any, on the Fund's net asset value."
