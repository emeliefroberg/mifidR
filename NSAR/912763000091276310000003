"808","SUB-ITEM 77-E   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"809","Since October 2003, Federated and related"
"810","entities (collectively, Federated) and various"
"811","Federated-sponsored mutual funds (Funds) ha"
"812","ve been named as defendants in several class"
"813","action lawsuits now pending in the United St"
"814","ates District Court for the District of Maryland. The"
"815","lawsuits were purportedly filed on behalf of"
"816"," people who purchased, owned and/or redeemed"
"817","shares of certain Funds during specified peri"
"818","ods beginning November 1, 1998. The suits are"
"819","generally similar in alleging that Federated e"
"820","ngaged in illegal and improper trading practices"
"821","including market timing and late trading in co"
"822","ncert with certain institutional traders, which"
"823","allegedly caused financial injury to the mutual"
"824","fund shareholders. Federated without admitting the"
"825","validity of any claim has reached a preliminary"
"826"," settlement with the Plaintiffs in these cases. Any"
"827","settlement would have to be approved by the Cou"
"828","rt."
"829","     Federated entities have also been named as"
"830"," defendants in several additional lawsuits that"
"831","are now pending in the United States District C"
"832","ourt for the Western District of Pennsylvania."
"833","These lawsuits have been consolidated into a si"
"834","ngle action alleging excessive advisory fees"
"835","involving one of the Funds."
"836","     The Board of the Funds retained the law fi"
"837","rm of Dickstein Shapiro LLP to represent the"
"838","Funds in each of the lawsuits described in the"
"839","preceding two paragraphs. Federated and the"
"840","Funds, and their respective counsel, have been d"
"841","efending this litigation, and none of the Funds"
"842","remains a defendant in any of the lawsuits. Addi"
"843","tional lawsuits based upon similar allegations"
"844","may be filed in the future. The potential impac"
"845","t of these lawsuits, all of which seek monetary"
"846","damages, attorneys' fees and expenses, and futur"
"847","e potential similar suits is uncertain. Although"
"848","we do not believe that these lawsuits will have"
"849","a material adverse effect on the Funds, there can"
"850","be no assurance that these suits, ongoing advers"
"851","e publicity and/or other developments resulting"
"852","from the allegations in these matters will not r"
"853","esult in increased redemptions, or reduced sales of"
"854","shares of the Funds or other adverse consequenc"
"855","es for the Funds."

"864","Report of Independent Registered Pu"
"865","blic Accounting Firm"
"866","To the Shareholders and"
"867","Board of Trustees of"
"868","Federated Total Return Series, Inc"
"869","In planning and performing our audits of th"
"870","e financial statements of Federated Mortgage Fund"
"871","and Federated Ultrashort Fund, each a portfo"
"872","lio of Federated Total Return Series, Inc"
"873","(collectively, the Funds) as of and for the"
"874"," year ended September 30, 2010, in accordance with the"
"875","standards of the Public Company Accounting Ov"
"876","ersight Board (United States), we considered the"
"877","Funds' internal control over financial repor"
"878","ting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"879","as a basis for designing our auditing procedur"
"880","es for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"881","financial statements and to comply with the re"
"882","quirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"883","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"884","of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"885","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opi"
"886","nion."
"887","Management of the Funds is responsible for esta"
"888","blishing and maintaining effective internal"
"889","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"890"," this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"891","management are required to assess the expected"
"892","benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"893","company's internal control over financial repo"
"894","rting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"895","assurance regarding the reliability of financi"
"896","al reporting and the preparation of financial"
"897","statements for external purposes in accordance"
"898"," with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"899","company's internal control over financial repor"
"900","ting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"901","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"902","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"903","transactions and dispositions of the assets of t"
"904","he company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"905","transactions are recorded as necessary to permi"
"906","t preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"907","with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"908","and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"909","are being made in accordance with authorizations"
"910"," of management and directors of the company;"
"911","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding p"
"912","revention or timely detection of the unauthorized"
"913","acquisition, use, or disposition of the company'"
"914","s assets that could have a material affect on the"
"915","financial statements."
"916","Because of its inherent limitations, internal co"
"917","ntrol over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"918","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any e"
"919","valuation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"920","subject to the risk that controls may become ina"
"921","dequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"922","the degree of compliance with the policies or pro"
"923","cedures may deteriorate."
"924","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"925","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"926","control does not allow management or employees,"
"927","in the normal course of performing their"
"928","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstate"
"929","ments on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"930","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"931","internal control over financial reporting, such that"
"932","there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"933","misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim"
"934","financial statements will not be prevented or dete"
"935","cted on a timely basis."
"936","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control o"
"937","ver financial reporting was for the limited"
"938","purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"939"," not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"940","internal control that might be material weaknesses"
"941"," under standards established by the Public"
"942","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)"
"943",".. However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"944","Funds' internal control over financial reporting a"
"945","nd its operation, including controls over"
"946","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a m"
"947","aterial weakness as defined above as of"
