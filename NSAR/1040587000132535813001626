"1251","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1252","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"1253","Direxion Funds"
"1254","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of the funds listed in the accompanying Attachment A (the &#147;Funds&#148;), which comprise the Direxion Funds as of and for the period ended October 31, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1255","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. The Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Funds; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Funds are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Funds; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Funds&#146; assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1256","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1257","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds&#146; annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1258","Our consideration of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting and their operations, including controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2013."
"1259","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the Board of Trustees of the Direxion Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1324","dated February 1, 2012, as supplemented May 31, 2012 and August 31, 2012"
"1325","Effective February 1, 2013, the Board of Trustees of the Direxion Funds (the &#147;Trust&#148;), based upon the recommendation of Rafferty Asset Management, LLC, the adviser for the Direxion/Wilshire Dynamic Fund (the &#147;Fund&#148;), a series of the Trust, has approved revisions to the Fund&#146;s investment strategy.  The Fund&#146;s investment strategy will be as follows:"
"1326","Principal Investment Strategy"
"1327","Under normal circumstances, the Fund is managed by the Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (&#147;Rafferty&#148; or the &#147;Adviser&#148;) pursuant to Wilshire Associates Incorporated&#146;s (&#147;Wilshire&#148; or the &#147;Subadviser&#148;) traditional asset allocation model which allocates approximately 60% of the Fund&#146;s total assets to equity securities and 40% to fixed income securities, with a tactical overlay to increase or decrease the Fund&#146;s risk exposure based on the Subadviser&#146;s outlook for the market.  By comparing the Subadviser&#146;s own forecasts with those forecasts of a universe of institutional investors, the Subadviser is able to identify asset classes that it believes are over- and under-valued.  The differences between the Subadviser&#146;s forecasts and those of the universe of institutional investors represent opportunities that can be exploited through disciplined tactical, or short-term, asset allocation strategies.  The Subadviser&#146;s tactical model evaluates asset class allocations on a monthly basis and makes relevant adjustments, which may result in a high portfolio turnover rate for the Fund."
"1328","The Adviser will implement these strategies for the Fund through the use of financial instruments, including futures contracts; options on securities, indices and futures contracts; equity caps, collars and floors; swap agreements; forward contracts, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements (collectively, &#147;Financial Instruments&#148;), to maximize the Fund&#146;s risk-adjusted return.  The equity portion of the Fund is comprised of the common stocks, preferred stocks, convertible securities and warrants of U.S. and foreign issuers, including small and mid capitalization companies and open- and closed-end investment companies, exchange-traded funds (&#147;ETFs&#148;) and Financial Instruments that provide exposure to U.S. and foreign equity indices.  The fixed income portion of the Fund&#146;s portfolio is comprised of high-quality fixed income securities (including investment-grade bonds and debt securities issued by U.S. and foreign government and corporate issuers) and Financial Instruments.  The Fund may also invest in ETFs and open- and closed-end investment companies to gain exposure to high-quality fixed income securities."
"1329","In response to market conditions, the Subadviser may recommend that the Adviser rebalance the Fund&#146;s portfolio, use short positions and/or employ leverage in its tactical allocations.  In addition, for temporary defensive purposes, the Fund may invest significantly in cash and/or cash equivalents."
"1330","The Fund is a &#147;non-diversified&#148; fund, meaning that a relatively high percentage of its assets may be invested in a limited number of issuers of securities."
