"8100","paragraph 3, the Performance Adjustment is added to or subtracted from the Basic Fee depending on whether the Fund experienced better or worse performance than an appropriate index (the &quot;Index&quot;).  The Performance Adjustment is not cumulative.  An increased fee will result even though the performance of the Fund over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been behind that of the Index, and, conversely, a reduction in the fee will be made for a month even"
"8101","though the performance of the Fund over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been ahead of that of"

"8109","business day throughout the month. For this purpose, the monthly average net assets of registered investment companies"
"8110","that previously had Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser and currently have Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with Fidelity SelectCo, LLC are included. The Group Fee Rate shall be determined on a cumulative basis pursuant to the following schedule:"

"8816","</P>"
"8817","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	1.	(a)	Investment Advisory Services.  The Adviser undertakes to act as investment adviser of the Fund and"
"8818","shall, subject to the supervision of the Trust's Board of Trustees, direct the investments of the Fund in accordance with the"
"8819","investment objective, policies and limitations as provided in the Fund's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as"
"8820","amended from time to time, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and rules thereunder, as amended from time to time (the"

"8823","research, statistical and investment activities.  The Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with"
"8824","the Fund, to buy, sell, lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment instruments on behalf"
"8825","of the Fund.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Fund are and shall at all times be subject to the control and"
"8826","direction of the Trust's Board of Trustees."
"8827","</P>"
"8828","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(b)	Management Services.  The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for the performance by its affiliates of) the"
"8829","management and administrative services necessary for the operation of the Trust.  The Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees, perform various services for the Fund, including but not limited to: (i) providing the Fund with"
"8830","office space, equipment and facilities (which may be its own) for maintaining its organization; (ii) on behalf of the Fund, supervising relations with, and monitoring the performance of, custodians, depositories, transfer and pricing agents, accountants, attorneys, underwriters, brokers and dealers, insurers and other persons in any capacity deemed to be necessary or desirable; (iii) preparing all general shareholder communications, including shareholder reports; (iv) conducting shareholder"
"8831","relations; (v) maintaining the Trust's existence and its records; (vi) during such times as shares are publicly offered, maintaining the registration and qualification of the Fund's shares under federal and state law; and (vii) investigating the development"
"8832","of and developing and implementing, if appropriate, management and shareholder services designed to enhance the value or"
"8833","convenience of the Fund as an investment vehicle."
"8834","</P>"
"8835","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	The Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations, information or analyses to the Trust as the Trust's Board of"

"8840","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(c)	The Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Fund's account"
"8841","with brokers or dealers selected by the Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the Adviser.  The Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Fund and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a"
"8842","particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms"
"8843","are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the Fund and/or the other accounts over which the"
"8844","Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such"
"8845","brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Fund which is in excess of the"
"8846","amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Adviser determines in"
"8847","good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"8848","responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Trust shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Fund to determine if the commissions"
"8849","paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Fund."

"8859","Adviser shall receive a monthly management fee, payable monthly as soon as practicable after the last day of each month, composed"
"8860","of a Basic Fee and a Performance Adjustment.  Except as otherwise provided in sub-paragraph (e) of this paragraph 3, the Performance Adjustment is added to or subtracted from the Basic Fee depending on whether the Fund experienced better or worse performance than an appropriate index (the &quot;Index&quot;).  The Performance Adjustment is not cumulative.  An increased fee will result even"
"8861","though the performance of the Fund over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been behind that of the Index,"
"8862","and, conversely, a reduction in the fee will be made for a month even though the performance of the Fund over some period of time"
"8863","shorter than the performance period has been ahead of that of the Index.  The Basic Fee and the Performance Adjustment will be"
"8864","computed as follows:"
"8865","</P>"
"8866","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(a)	Basic Fee Rate:  The annual Basic Fee Rate shall be the sum of the Group Fee Rate and the Individual Fund Fee Rate"
"8867","calculated to the nearest millionth decimal place as follows:"

"8869","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(i) Group Fee Rate.  The Group Fee Rate shall be based upon the monthly average of the net assets of the registered"
"8870","investment companies having Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser (computed in the manner set forth in"
"8871","the Trust's Declaration of Trust or other organizational document) determined as of the close of business on each business day"
"8872","throughout the month.  For this purpose, the monthly average net assets of registered investment companies that previously had Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser and currently have Advisory and Service or Management Contracts"
"8873","with Fidelity SelectCo, LLC are included.  The Group Fee Rate shall be determined on a cumulative basis pursuant to the following"

"9575","</P>"
"9576","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	1.	(a)	Investment Advisory Services.  The Adviser undertakes to act as investment adviser of the Fund and"
"9577","shall, subject to the supervision of the Trust's Board of Trustees, direct the investments of the Fund in accordance with the"
"9578","investment objective, policies and limitations as provided in the Fund's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as"
"9579","amended from time to time, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and rules thereunder, as amended from time to time (the"
"9580","&quot;1940 Act&quot;), and such other limitations as the Fund may impose by notice in writing to the Adviser.  The Adviser shall also"
"9581","furnish for the use of the Fund office space and all necessary office facilities, equipment and personnel for servicing the investments of the Fund; and shall pay the salaries and fees of all officers of the Trust, of all Trustees of the Trust who are &quot;interested persons&quot; of the Trust or of the Adviser and of all personnel of the Trust or the Adviser performing services relating to"
"9582","research, statistical and investment activities.  The Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with"
"9583","the Fund, to buy, sell, lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment instruments on behalf"
"9584","of the Fund.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Fund are and shall at all times be subject to the control and"
"9585","direction of the Trust's Board of Trustees."
"9586","</P>"
"9587","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(b)	Management Services.  The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for the performance by its affiliates of) the"
"9588","management and administrative services necessary for the operation of the Trust.  The Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees, perform various services for the Fund, including but not limited to: (i) providing the Fund with"
"9589","office space, equipment and facilities (which may be its own) for maintaining its organization; (ii) on behalf of the Fund, supervising relations with, and monitoring the performance of, custodians, depositories, transfer and pricing agents, accountants, attorneys, underwriters, brokers and dealers, insurers and other persons in any capacity deemed to be necessary or desirable; (iii) preparing all general shareholder communications, including shareholder reports; (iv) conducting shareholder"
"9590","relations; (v) maintaining the Trust's existence and its records; (vi) during such times as shares are publicly offered, maintaining the registration and qualification of the Fund's shares under federal and state law; and (vii) investigating the development"
"9591","of and developing and implementing, if appropriate, management and shareholder services designed to enhance the value or"
"9592","convenience of the Fund as an investment vehicle."
"9593","</P>"
"9594","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	The Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations, information or analyses to the Trust as the Trust's Board of"
"9595","Trustees may request from time to time or as the Adviser may deem to be desirable.  The Adviser shall make recommendations to the Trust's Board of Trustees with respect to Trust policies, and shall carry out such policies as are adopted by the"
"9596","Trustees.  The Adviser shall, subject to review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other services as the Adviser shall from"
"9597","time to time determine to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under this Contract."
"9598","</P>"
"9599","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(c)	The Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Fund's account"
"9600","with brokers or dealers selected by the Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the Adviser.  The Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Fund and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a"
"9601","particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms"
"9602","are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the Fund and/or the other accounts over which the"
"9603","Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such"
"9604","brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Fund which is in excess of the"
"9605","amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Adviser determines in"
"9606","good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"9607","responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Trust shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Fund to determine if the commissions"
"9608","paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Fund."
"9609","</P>"
"9610","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	The Adviser shall, in acting hereunder, be an independent contractor.  The Adviser shall not be an agent of the Fund."

"9612","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	2.	It is understood that the Trustees, officers and shareholders of the Trust are or may be or become interested in"
"9613","the Adviser as directors, officers or otherwise and that directors, officers and stockholders of the Adviser are or may be or"
"9614","become similarly interested in the Trust, and that the Adviser may be or become interested in the Trust as a shareholder or"
"9615","otherwise."
"9616","</P>"
"9617","<P ID=C__\desktop\MC101-13.html.2 ALIGN=LEFT>	3.	The Adviser will be compensated on the following basis for the services and facilities to be furnished hereunder.  The"
"9618","Adviser shall receive a monthly management fee, payable monthly as soon as practicable after the last day of each month, composed"
"9619","of a Basic Fee, a Performance Adjustment and, until May 31, 2015, a Transitional Management Fee Adjustment.  Except as otherwise provided in sub-paragraph (e) of this paragraph 3, the Performance Adjustment is added to or subtracted from the Basic Fee"
"9620","depending on whether the Fund experienced better or worse performance than an appropriate index (the &quot;Index&quot;).  The Performance"
"9621","Adjustment is not cumulative.  An increased fee will result even though the performance of the Fund over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been behind that of the Index, and, conversely, a reduction in the fee will be made for a month"
"9622","even though the performance of the Fund over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been ahead of that of the"
"9623","Index.  The Basic Fee, the Performance Adjustment and the Transitional Management Fee Adjustment will be computed as follows:"
"9624","</P>"
"9625","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(a)	Basic Fee Rate:  The annual Basic Fee Rate shall be the sum of the Group Fee Rate and the Individual Fund Fee Rate"
"9626","calculated to the nearest millionth decimal place as follows:"
"9627","</P>"
"9628","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(i) Group Fee Rate.  The Group Fee Rate shall be based upon the monthly average of the net assets of the registered"
"9629","investment companies having Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser (computed in the manner set forth in"
"9630","the Trust's Declaration of Trust or other organizational document) determined as of the close of business on each business day"
"9631","throughout the month.  For this purpose, the monthly average net assets of registered investment companies that previously had Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser and currently have Advisory and Service or Management Contracts"
"9632","with Fidelity SelectCo, LLC are included.  The Group Fee Rate shall be determined on a cumulative basis pursuant to the following"

"10391","of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Adviser or its"

The Adviser shall receive a monthly management fee, payable monthly as soon as practicable after the last day of each month, composed of a Basic Fee and a Performance Adjustment.  The Performance Adjustment is added to or subtracted from the Basic Fee depending on whether the Portfolio experienced"
"10410","better or worse performance than the Standard &amp; Poor's Composite Index of 500 Stocks (the &quot;Index&quot;).  The"
"10411","Performance Adjustment is not cumulative.  An increased fee will result even though the performance of the"
"10412","Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been behind that of the Index, and,"
"10413","conversely, a reduction in the fee will be made for a month even though the performance of the Portfolio over"
"10414","some period of time shorter than the performance period has been  ahead of that of the Index.  The Basic Fee"
"10415","and the Performance Adjustment will be computed as follows:"
"10416","</P>"
"10417","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(a)	Basic Fee Rate:  The annual Basic Fee Rate shall be the sum of the Group Fee Rate"
"10418","and the Individual Fund Fee Rate calculated to the nearest millionth decimal place as follows:"

"10420","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(i)	Group Fee Rate.  The Group Fee Rate shall be based upon the monthly average of the net assets of the registered investment companies having Advisory and Service or Management"
"10421","Contracts with the Adviser (computed in the manner set forth in the fund's Declaration of Trust or other organizational document) determined as of the close of business on each business day throughout the month. For this"
"10422","purpose, the monthly average net assets of registered investment companies that previously had Advisory and"
"10423","Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser and currently have Advisory and Service or Management"
"10424","Contracts with Fidelity SelectCo, LLC are included. The Group Fee Rate shall be determined on a cumulative"
"10425","basis pursuant to the following schedule:"

"12460","month even though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been ahead of"

"12470","with Fidelity SelectCo, LLC are included. The Group Fee Rate shall be determined on a cumulative basis pursuant to the following"

"13286","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	AGREEMENT made this 13th day of November, 2013, by and between FMR Co., Inc., a Massachusetts corporation with principal offices at 245 Summer Street, Boston, Massachusetts  (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Sub-Adviser&quot;)"
"13287","and Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, a Massachusetts corporation with principal offices at 245 Summer"
"13288","Street, Boston, Massachusetts (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Adviser&quot;)."
"13289","</P>"
"13290","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Adviser has entered into a Management Contract with Fidelity Commonwealth Trust, a Massachusetts business trust which may issue one or more series of shares of beneficial interest (hereinafter called the"
"13291","&acute;&acute;Trust&quot;), on behalf of Fidelity Advisor Event Driven Opportunities Fund (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Fund&quot;), pursuant"
"13292","to which the Adviser is to act as investment manager and adviser to the Fund, and"
"13293","</P>"
"13294","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Sub-Adviser was formed for the purpose of providing investment management of equity and"
"13295","high income funds and advising generally with respect to equity and high income instruments<B>.</B>"
"13296","</P>"
"13297","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises hereinafter set forth, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser agree as follows:"
"13298","</P>"
"13299","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	1.	(a)  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Adviser, direct the investments of all or"
"13300","such portion of the Fund's assets as the Adviser shall designate in accordance with the investment objective, policies"
"13301","and limitations as provided in the Fund's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as amended from time to time,"
"13302","the Investment Company Act of 1940 and rules thereunder, as amended from time to time (the &acute;&acute;1940 Act&quot;), and"
"13303","such other limitations as the Fund may impose by notice in writing to the Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser"
"13304","shall also furnish for the use of the Fund office space and all necessary office facilities, equipment and personnel for"
"13305","servicing the investments of the Fund; and shall pay the salaries and fees of all personnel of the Sub-Adviser performing services for the Fund relating to research, statistical and investment activities.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with the Fund or the Adviser, to buy, sell, lend and otherwise"
"13306","trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment instruments on behalf of the Fund.  The investment"
"13307","policies and all other actions of the Fund are and shall at all times be subject to the control and direction of the"
"13308","Trust's Board of Trustees."
"13309","</P>"
"13310","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(b)  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations, information or analyses to the Trust and the"
"13311","Adviser as the Trust's Board of Trustees or the Adviser may request from time to time or as the Sub-Adviser may"
"13312","deem to be desirable.  The Sub-Adviser shall make recommendations to the Trust's Board of Trustees with respect to"
"13313","Fund policies, and shall carry out such policies as are adopted by the Trustees.  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to"
"13314","review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other services as the Sub-Adviser shall from time to time determine to"
"13315","be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under this Agreement and which are not otherwise furnished by the"
"13316","Adviser."
"13317","</P>"
"13318","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(c)  The Sub-Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Fund's account with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the"
"13319","Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices"
"13320","which are advantageous to the Fund and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"13321","Exchange Act of 1934) to the Fund and/or the other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser, Adviser or their affiliates"
"13322","exercise investment discretion.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Fund which is in excess of the"
"13323","amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Adviser"
"13324","determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"13325","research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts"
"13326","over which they exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Trust shall periodically review the commissions"
"13327","paid by the Fund to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Fund."
"13328","</P>"
"13329","<P ID=C__\desktop\FMRFM313_1.html.2 ALIGN=LEFT>	2.	As compensation for the services to be furnished by the Sub-Adviser hereunder, the Adviser agrees"
"13330","to pay the Sub-Adviser a monthly fee equal to 50% of the management fee (including performance adjustments, if"
"13331","any) that the Fund is obligated to pay the Adviser under the Fund's Management Contract with the Adviser in respect of that portion of the Fund's assets managed by the Sub-Adviser during such month.  Such fee shall not be reduced to reflect expense reimbursements or fee waivers by the Adviser, if any, in effect from time to time."

"13333","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	3.	It is understood that Trustees, officers, and shareholders of the Trust are or may be or become interested in the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser as directors, officers or otherwise and that directors, officers and stockholders of the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser are or may be or become similarly interested in the Trust, and that the Adviser"
"13334","or the Sub-Adviser may be or become interested in the Trust as a shareholder or otherwise."
"13335","</P>"
"13336","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	4.	It is understood that the Fund will pay all its expenses other than those expressly stated to be payable"
"13337","by the Sub-Adviser hereunder or by the Adviser under the Management Contract with the Fund."
"13338","</P>"
"13339","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	5.	The Services of the Sub-Adviser to the Adviser are not to be deemed to be exclusive, the Sub-Adviser being free to render services to others and engage in other activities, provided, however, that such other services"
"13340","and activities do not, during the term of this Agreement, interfere, in a material manner, with the Sub-Adviser's ability to meet all of its obligations with respect to rendering investment advice hereunder.  The Sub-Adviser shall for all"
"13341","purposes be an independent contractor and not an agent or employee of the Adviser or the Trust."
"13342","</P>"
"13343","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	6.	In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of obligations"
"13344","or duties hereunder on the part of the Sub-Adviser, the Sub-Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Advisor,"
"13345","the Trust or to any shareholder of the Fund for any act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering"
"13346","services hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security."
"13347","</P>"
"13348","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	7.	(a)	Subject to prior termination as provided in sub-paragraph (d) of this paragraph 7, this Agreement shall continue in force until July 31, 2015<B> </B>and indefinitely thereafter, but only so long as"
"13349","the continuance after such period shall be specifically approved at least annually by vote of the"

"13351","Fund."
"13352","</P>"
"13353","<P ALIGN=LEFT>(b)	This Agreement may be modified by mutual consent subject to the provisions of Section 15 of the"
"13354","1940 Act, as modified by or interpreted by any applicable order or orders of the Securities and"

"13358","<P ALIGN=LEFT>(c)	In addition to the requirements of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph 7, the terms of any"
"13359","continuance or modification of the Agreement must have been approved by the vote of a majority"
"13360","of those Trustees of the Trust who are not parties to such Agreement or interested persons of any"

"13561","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	1.	(a)  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Adviser, direct the investments of all or"

"13563","and limitations as provided in the Fund's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as amended from time to time,"
"13564","the Investment Company Act of 1940 and rules thereunder, as amended from time to time (the &acute;&acute;1940 Act&quot;), and"

"13586","determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"

"13588","over which they exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Trust shall periodically review the commissions"
"13589","paid by the Fund to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Fund."

"13810","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"

"13816","</P>"
"13817","<P ALIGN=LEFT>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because"

"13822","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a fund's annual or interim financial statements will not"
