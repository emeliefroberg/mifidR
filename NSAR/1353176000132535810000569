"1034","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1035","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of"
"1036","American Century Growth Funds, Inc.:"
"1037","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"1038","of American Century Growth Funds, Inc. (the &#147;Corporation&#148;), including"
"1039","Legacy Focused Large Cap Fund, Legacy Large Cap Fund, and Legacy Multi"
"1040","Cap Fund, as of and for the year ended July 31, 2010, in accordance"
"1041","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1042","(United States), we considered the Corporation&#146;s internal control"
"1043","over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1044","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"1045","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"1046","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1047","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1048","Corporation&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"1049","we express no such opinion."
"1050","The management of the Corporation is responsible for establishing and"
"1051","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1052","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"1053","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1054","controls. A corporation&#146;s internal control over financial reporting"
"1055","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1056","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1057","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1058","accounting principles.  A corporation&#146;s internal control over financial"
"1059","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"1060","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1061","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"1062","corporation; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1063","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"1064","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"1065","receipts and expenditures of the corporation are being made only in"
"1066","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"1067","corporation; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1068","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition"
"1069","of a corporation&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1070","financial statements."
"1071","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1072","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"1073","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"1074","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1075","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1076","procedures may deteriorate."
"1077","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1078","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1079","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"1080","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness"
"1081","is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"1082","over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"1083","that a material misstatement of the corporation&#146;s annual or interim"
"1084","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1085","Our consideration of the Corporation&#146;s internal control over financial"
"1086","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"1087","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"1088","that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1089","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"1090","we noted no deficiencies in the Corporation&#146;s internal control over"
"1091","financial reporting and its operation, including controls for"
"1092","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness"
"1093","as defined above, as of July 31, 2010."

"1166","THIS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (&#147;Agreement&#148;) is effective as of the 16th day"
"1167","of February, 2010, by and between AMERICAN CENTURY GROWTH FUNDS, INC.,"
"1168","a Maryland corporation (hereinafter called the &#147;Company&#148;), and AMERICAN"
"1169","CENTURY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, INC., a Delaware corporation (hereinafter"
"1170","called the &#147;Investment Manager&#148;)."
"1171","WHEREAS, the Investment Manager is registered as an investment advisor"

"1175","Act&#148;), and has registered its shares for public offering under the"
"1176","Securities Act of 1933, as amended; and"

"1178","its own separate investment portfolio of which the beneficial interests"
"1179","are represented by a separate series of shares of the Company, including"
"1180","those Funds listed on Schedule A hereto."
"1181","      NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION of the mutual promises and"
"1182","agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:"
"1183","1.	Investment Management Services.  The Investment Manager shall"
"1184","supervise the investments of each class of each series of shares of the"
"1185","Company contemplated as of the date hereof, and each class of each subsequent"
"1186","series of shares as the Company shall select the Investment Manager to manage."
"1187","In such capacity, the Investment Manager shall either directly, or through the"
"1188","utilization of others as contemplated by Section 7 below, maintain a continuous"
"1189","investment program for each series, determine what securities shall be"
"1190","purchased or sold by each series, secure and evaluate such information as"
"1191","it deems proper and take whatever action is necessary or convenient to perform"
"1192","its functions, including the placing of purchase and sale orders.  In performing"
"1193","its duties hereunder, the Investment Manager will manage the portfolio of all"
"1194","classes of shares of a particular series as a single portfolio."
"1195","2.	Compliance with Laws.  All functions undertaken by the Investment"

"1206","3.	Board Supervision.  All of the functions undertaken by the Investment"
"1207","Manager hereunder shall at all times be subject to the direction of the Board"
"1208","of Directors of the Company, its executive committee, or any committee or"
"1209","officers of the Company acting under the authority of the Board of Directors."
"1210","4.	Payment of Expenses.  The Investment Manager will pay all of the expenses"
"1211","of each class of each series of the Company&#146;s shares that it shall manage other"
"1212","than interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, extraordinary expenses, the fees"
"1213","and expenses of those directors who are not &#147;interested persons&#148; as defined in"
"1214","the 1940 Act (hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Independent Directors&#148;) (including"
"1215","counsel fees), and expenses incurred in connection with the provision of"
"1216","shareholder services and distribution services under a plan adopted pursuant"
"1217","to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act.  The Investment Manager will provide the"
"1218","Company with all physical facilities and personnel required to carry on the"
"1219","business of each class of each series of the Company&#146;s shares that it shall"
"1220","manage, including but not limited to office space, office furniture, fixtures"
"1221","and equipment, office supplies, computer hardware and software and salaried"
"1222","and hourly paid personnel.  The Investment Manager may at its expense"
"1223","employ others to provide all or any part of such facilities and personnel."
"1224","5.	Account Fees.  The Company, by resolution of the Board of Directors,"
"1225","including a majority of the Independent Directors, may from time to time authorize"
"1226","the imposition of a fee as a direct charge against shareholder accounts of any"
"1227","class of one or more of the series, such fee to be retained by the Company or to"
"1228","be paid to the Investment Manager to defray expenses which would otherwise be paid"
"1229","by the Investment Manager in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4 of this"
"1230","Agreement.  At least sixty days prior written notice of the intent to impose such"
"1231","fee must be given to the shareholders of the affected class and series."
"1232","6.	Management Fees."
"1233","(a)	In consideration of the services provided by the Investment Manager,"
"1234","each class of each series of shares of the Company managed by the Investment"
"1235","Manager shall pay to the Investment Manager a management fee that is calculated"
"1236","as described in this Section 6 using the fee schedules set forth on Schedule A."
"1237","(b)	Definitions"
"1238","(1)	An &#147;Investment Team&#148; is the Portfolio Managers that the Investment"
"1239","Manager has designated to manage a given portfolio."
"1240","(2)	An &#147;Investment Strategy&#148; is the processes and policies implemented"
"1241","by the Investment Manager for pursuing a particular investment objective"
"1242","managed by an Investment Team."
"1243","(3)	A &#147;Primary Strategy Portfolio&#148; is each series of the Company, as well"
"1244","as any other series of any other registered investment company for which the"
"1245","Investment Manager serves as the investment manager and for which American"
"1246","Century Investment Services, Inc. serves as the distributor."
"1247","(4)	A &#147;Secondary Strategy Portfolio&#148; of a series of the Company is another"
"1248","account managed by the Investment Manager that is managed by the same Investment"
"1249","Team but is not a Primary Strategy Portfolio."
"1250","(5)	The &#147;Secondary Strategy Share Ratio&#148; of a series of the Company is"
"1251","calculated by dividing the net assets of the series by the sum of the Primary"
"1252","Strategy Portfolios that share a common Investment Strategy."
"1253","(6)	The &#147;Secondary Strategy Assets&#148; of a series of the Company is the sum"
"1254","of the net assets of the series&#146; Secondary Strategy Portfolios multiplied by"
"1255","the series&#146; Secondary Strategy Share Ratio."
"1256","(7)	The &#147;Investment Strategy Assets&#148; of a series of the Company is the"
"1257","sum of the net assets of the series and the series&#146; Secondary Strategy Assets."
"1258","(8)	The &#147;Per Annum Fee Dollar Amount&#148; is the dollar amount resulting from"
"1259","applying the applicable Fee Schedule for a class of a series of the Company"
"1260","using the Investment Strategy Assets."
"1261","(9)	The &#147;Per Annum Fee Rate&#148; for a class of a series of the Company is"
"1262","the percentage rate that results from dividing the Per Annum Fee Dollar"
"1263","Amount for the class of a series by the Investment Strategy Assets of the"
"1264","series."
"1265","(c)	Daily Management Fee Calculation. For each calendar day, each class"
"1266","of each series of shares set forth on Schedule A shall accrue a fee calculated"
"1267","by multiplying the Per Annum Fee Rate for that class times the net assets of"
"1268","the class on that day, and further dividing that product by 365 (366 in leap"
"1269","years)."
"1270","(d)	Monthly Management Fee Payment. On the first business day of each month,"
"1271","each class of each series of shares set forth on Schedule A shall pay the"
"1272","management fee to the Investment Manager for the previous month.  The fee for"
"1273","the previous month shall be the sum of the Daily Management Fee Calculations"
"1274","for each calendar day in the previous month."
"1275","(e)	Additional Series or Classes. In the event that the Board of Directors"
"1276","of the Company shall determine to issue any additional series or classes of"
"1277","shares for which it is proposed that the Investment Manager serve as investment"
"1278","manager, the Company and the Investment Manager may enter into an Addendum to"
"1279","this Agreement setting forth the name of the series and/or class, the Fee"
"1280","Schedule for each and such other terms and conditions as are applicable to"
"1281","the management of such series of shares."
"1282","7.	Subcontracts.  In rendering the services to be provided pursuant to"
"1283","this Agreement, the Investment Manager may, from time to time, engage or"
"1284","associate itself with such persons or entities as it determines is necessary"
"1285","or convenient in its sole discretion and may contract with such persons or"
"1286","entities to obtain information, investment advisory and management services,"
"1287","or such other services as the Investment Manager deems appropriate.  Any fees,"
"1288","compensation or expenses to be paid to any such person or entity shall be"
"1289","paid by the Investment Manager, and no obligation to such person or entity"
"1290","shall be incurred on behalf of the Company.  Any arrangement entered into"
"1291","pursuant to this paragraph shall, to the extent required by law, be subject"
"1292","to the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, including"
"1293","a majority of the Independent Directors, and the shareholders of the"
"1294","Company."
"1295","8.	Continuation of Agreement.  This Agreement shall become effective"
"1296","for each series of shares of the Company as of the date first set forth"
"1297","above (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;) and shall continue in effect for each series"
"1298","of shares of the Company until the earlier of (i) 150 days from the"
"1299","Effective Date, or (ii) the date as of which the shareholders of each"
"1300","series of shares of the Company approve a new management agreement."
"1301","9.	Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated by the Investment"
"1302","Manager at any time without penalty upon giving the Company 60 days&#146;"
"1303","written notice, and may be terminated at any time without penalty by"
"1304","the Board of Directors of the Company or by vote of a majority of the"
"1305","outstanding voting securities of each class of each series on 60 days&#146;"
"1306","written notice to the Investment Manager."
"1307","10.	Effect of Assignment.  This Agreement shall automatically"
"1308","terminate in the event of assignment by the Investment Manager, the"
"1309","term &#147;assignment&#148; for this purpose having the meaning  defined in"
"1310","Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act."
"1311","11.	Other Activities.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit"
"1312","or restrict the right of the Investment Manager, or the right of"
"1313","any of its officers, directors or employees (who may also be a director,"
"1314","officer or employee of the Company), to engage in any other business or"
"1315","to devote time and attention to the management or other aspects of any"
"1316","other business, whether of a similar or dissimilar nature, or to render"
"1317","services of any kind to any other corporation, firm, individual or"
"1318","association."
"1319","12.	Standard of Care.  In the absence of willful misfeasance,"
"1320","bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of its obligations"
"1321","or duties hereunder on the part of the Investment Manager, it, as an"
"1322","inducement to it to enter into this Agreement, shall not be subject"
"1323","to liability to the Company or to any shareholder of the Company for"
"1324","any act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering"
"1325","services hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the"
"1326","purchase, holding or sale of any security."
"1327","13.	Separate Agreement.  The parties hereto acknowledge that"
"1328","certain provisions of the 1940 Act, in effect, treat each series"
"1329","of shares of an investment company as a separate investment company."
"1330","Accordingly, the parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that,"
"1331","to the extent deemed appropriate and consistent with the 1940 Act,"
"1332","this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a separate agreement"
"1333","between the Investment Manager and each series of shares of the"
"1334","Company managed by the Investment Manager."
"1335","14.	Use of the Name &#147;American Century&#148;.  The name &#147;American"
"1336","Century&#148; and all rights to the use of the name &#147;American Century&#148;"
"1337","are the exclusive property of American Century Proprietary Holdings,"
"1338","Inc. (&#147;ACPH&#148;).  ACPH has consented to, and granted a non-exclusive"
"1339","license for, the use by the Company of the name &#147;American Century&#148;"
"1340","in the name of the Company and any series of shares thereof.  Such"
"1341","consent and non-exclusive license may be revoked by ACPH in its"
"1342","discretion if ACPH, the Investment Manager, or a subsidiary or"
"1343","affiliate of either of them is not employed as the investment"
"1344","adviser of each series of shares of the Company.  In the event"
"1345","of such revocation, the Company and each series of shares thereof"

"1481","Investment Manager has designated to manage a given portfolio."
"1482","(2)	An &#147;Investment Strategy&#148; is the processes and policies"
"1483","implemented by the Investment Manager for pursuing a particular"
"1484","investment objective managed by an Investment Team."
"1485","(3)	A &#147;Primary Strategy Portfolio&#148; is each Fund, as well as"
"1486","any other series of any other registered investment company for"
"1487","which the Investment Manager, or an affiliated investment advisor,"

"1491","managed by the Investment Manager that is managed by the same"
"1492","Investment Team but is not a Primary Strategy Portfolio."
"1493","(5)	The &#147;Secondary Strategy Share Ratio&#148; of a Fund is calculated by"
"1494","dividing the net assets of the Fund by the sum of the net assets of the"
"1495","Primary Strategy Portfolios that share a common Investment Strategy."
"1496","(6)	The &#147;Secondary Strategy Assets&#148; of a Fund is the sum of the net"

"1505","rate that results from dividing the Per Annum Fee Dollar Amount for the"
"1506","class of a Fund by the Investment Strategy Assets of the Fund."
"1507","(c)	Daily Management Fee Calculation. For each calendar day, each"
"1508","class of each Fund shall accrue a fee calculated by multiplying the"
"1509","Per Annum Fee Rate for that class by the net assets of the class on"
"1510","that day, and further dividing that product by 365 (366 in leap years)."
"1511","(d)	Monthly Management Fee Payment. On the first business day of"
"1512","each month, each class of each Fund shall pay the management fee to"
"1513","the Investment Manager for the previous month.  The fee for the"
"1514","previous month shall be the sum of the Daily Management Fee Calculations"
"1515","for each calendar day in the previous month."
"1516","(e)	Additional Series or Classes. In the event that the Board"
"1517","of Directors shall determine to issue any additional series or"

"1521","series and/or classes, the fee schedule for each and such other terms"

"1529","persons or entities to obtain information, investment advisory and"
"1530","management services, or such other services as the Investment Manager"
"1531","deems appropriate.  Any fees, compensation or expenses to be paid to"
"1532","any such person or entity shall be paid by the Investment Manager, and"
"1533","no obligation to such person or entity shall be incurred on behalf of"
"1534","the Company.  Any arrangement entered into pursuant to this paragraph"
"1535","shall, to the extent required by law, be subject to the approval of"
"1536","the Board of Directors, including a majority of the Independent Directors,"
"1537","and the shareholders of the Company."

"1543","as long as such continuance is specifically approved at least annually (i)"
"1544","by either the Board of Directors or by the vote of a majority of the"
"1545","outstanding voting securities of such Fund, and (ii) by the vote of"
"1546","a majority of the Directors who are not parties to the Agreement or"
"1547","interested persons of any such party, cast in person at a meeting called"
"1548","for the purpose of voting on such approval.  The annual approvals provided"
"1549","for herein shall be effective to continue this Agreement from year to year"
"1550","if given within a period beginning not more than 90 days prior to the date"
"1551","on which it would otherwise terminate in each applicable year,"
"1552","notwithstanding the fact that more than 365 days may have elapsed since"
"1553","the date on which such approval was last given."
"1554","9.	Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated, with respect to"
"1555","any Fund, by the Investment Manager at any time without penalty upon"
"1556","giving the Company 60 days&#146; written notice, and may be terminated, with"
"1557","respect to any Fund, at any time without penalty by the Board of Directors"

"1563","in Section 2(a)(4) of the Investment Company Act."
"1564","11.	Other Activities.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit or"
"1565","restrict the right of the Investment Manager, or the right of any of"
"1566","its officers, directors or employees (who may also be a Director,"
"1567","officer or employee of the Company), to engage in any other business"
"1568","or to devote time and attention to the management or other aspects of"
"1569","any other business, whether of a similar or dissimilar nature, or to"
"1570","render services of any kind to any other corporation, firm, individual"
"1571","or association."
"1572","12.	Standard of Care.  In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad"
"1573","faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of its obligations or"
"1574","duties hereunder on the part of the Investment Manager, it, as an"
"1575","inducement to it to enter into this Agreement, shall not be subject to"
"1576","liability to the Company or to any shareholder of the Company for any"
"1577","act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering services"
"1578","hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase,"
"1579","holding or sale of any security."
"1580","13.	Separate Agreement.  The parties hereto acknowledge that certain"
"1581","provisions of the Investment Company Act, in effect, treat each series"
"1582","of shares of an investment company as a separate investment company."
"1583","Accordingly, the parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that, to"

"1585","Act, this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a separate agreement"
