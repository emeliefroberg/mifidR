"1626"," procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"1627"," and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"

"1630","<p align=justify><font face=Arial size=2>The management of the Fund is responsible"

"1639"," in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"1640"," of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1641"," recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"

"1755","<p align=justify><font face=Arial size=2>The management of the Fund is responsible"

"1757"," In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required"

"1764"," in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"1765"," of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1766"," recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"1767"," with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"1768"," accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"1769"," reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1770"," use or disposition of a fund&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on"
"1771"," the financial statements.</font></p>"
"1772","<p align=justify><font face=Arial size=2>Because of its inherent limitations, internal"

"1774"," projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
