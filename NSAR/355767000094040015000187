"517","NEW ALTERNATIVES FUND"
"518","Policies With Respect to Securities Investments"
"519","       In connection with the shell reorganization whereby New Alternatives"
"520","Fund, Inc. (the Fund) was re-domesticated from a New York corporation into"
"521","a Delaware statutory Trust named New Alternatives Fund (the Trust), the"
"522","Trust made a material change to its investment policy with respect to its"
"523","ability to invest in the securities of other investment companies.  This"
"524","change was not separately approved by the shareholders of the Fund but was"
"525","approved as part of the overall reorganization."
"526","       The Fund had a fundamental investment restriction stating that it may"
"527","not purchase securities of any other investment company, except as part of a"
"528","merger, consolidation or other reorganization."
"529","       As part of the reorganization, the fundamental investment restriction"
"530","of the Fund with respect to investments in the securities of other investment"
"531","companies was made non-fundamental.  Further, the investment restriction was"
"532","changed to read that the Trust may not purchase securities of any other"
"533","investment company, except as part of a merger, consolidation or other"
"534","reorganization, or where otherwise permitted by the Investment Company Act of"
"535","1940, as amended (the 1940 Act)."
"536","       As a result of this change, the Trust can now invest short-term cash in"
"537","money market mutual funds or in mutual funds that invest their assets in U."
"538","S. government securities.  The Trust's investment advisor does not intend to"
"539","invest the Trust's assets in other mutual funds for the purpose of pursuing"
"540","its objective of investing in alternative energy."
"541","       Under the 1940 Act, the Trust's investment in securities of other"
"542","investment companies, subject to certain exceptions, currently is limited to"
"543","(i) 3% of the total voting stock of any one investment company, (ii) 5% of"
"544","the Trust's total assets with respect to any one investment company and (iii)"
"545","10% of the Trust's total assets in the aggregate.  As a shareholder of"
"546","another investment company, the Trust would bear, along with other"
"547","shareholders, its pro rata portion of the other investment company's"
"548","expenses, including advisory fees.  These expenses would be in addition to"
"549","the advisory fees and other expenses that the Trust bears directly in"
"550","connection with its own operations."
"551","       The limits in the above paragraph would not apply to the Trust's"
"552","investments in money market mutual funds so long as the money market share"
"553","class that the Trust invests into does not charge any shareholder service"
"554","fees."

"567","Terms of Any New or Amended Securities"
"568","(a)	In connection with the shell reorganization whereby New"
"569","Alternatives Fund, Inc. (the Fund) was re-domesticated from a"
"570","New York corporation into a Delaware statutory Trust named New"
"571","Alternatives Fund (the Trust), the constituent instruments"
"572","defining the rights of the holders of the Fund's shares were"
"573","materially modified as described in the next paragraph.  A copy"
"574","of the Trust's Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the"
"575","Declaration of Trust) and By-Laws are being filed with this"
"576","Form N-SAR at Sub-Item 77Q1(a)."
"577","      The Fund is governed by its Articles of Incorporation, By-"
"578","laws and by applicable New York law and the Investment Company"
"579","Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act).  The Trust is governed"
"580","by its Declaration of Trust, By-laws and by applicable Delaware"
"581","and 1940 Act law."
"582","      Shares of the Fund:  (i) are entitled to one vote for each"
"583","full share held, fractional shares have no voting rights; and"
"584","(ii) are entitled to participate equally in the dividends and"
"585","distributions that are declared with respect to its investment"
"586","portfolio and in the net distributable assets of such portfolio"
"587","on liquidation.  Shares of the Trust: (i) are entitled to one"
"588","vote for each full share held and a proportionate fractional"
"589","vote for each fractional share held; (ii) will vote in the"
"590","aggregate and not by class except as otherwise expressly"
"591","required by law or when class voting is permitted by the Board"
"592","of Trustees; and (iii) are entitled to participate equally in"
"593","the dividends and distributions that are declared with respect"
"594","to its investment portfolio and in the net distributable assets"
"595","of such portfolio on liquidation."
"596","      The Fund's authorized capital is forty million (40,000,000)"
"597","common shares of $0.01 par value.  There is only one class of"
"598","shares of the Fund.  The Trust is authorized to issue an"
"599","unlimited amount of shares of beneficial interest with no par"
"600","value.  The Trust is currently only offering shares of one"
"601","series or investment portfolio, which will be a continuation of"
"602","the Fund.  The Trust is permitted by its Declaration of Trust to"
"603","offer additional series or portfolios, and may offer multiple"
"604","classes of shares in any series."
"605","      The Trust currently offers two classes of shares:  Class A"
"606","Shares and Investor Shares.  Class A Shares represent a"
"607","continuance of the original class of shares offered by the Fund"
"608","prior to the reorganization.  Class A Shares are sold subject to"
"609","a front-end sales charge.  The Class A Shares of the Trust do"
"610","not have any distribution (i.e., Rule 12b-1) charges, service"
"611","charges or redemption fees."
"612","      The Declaration of Trust can be amended by the Board of"
"613","Trustees without shareholder approval.  The Articles of"
"614","Incorporation require that most changes be submitted to the"
"615","shareholders for approval."
"616","      New York Business Corporation Law and the Fund's by-laws"
"617","each require that the Fund hold an annual meeting of"
"618","shareholders for the election of directors and the transaction"
"619","of other business.  The Trust is not required under Delaware law"
"620","to hold annual shareholder meetings and intends to do so only if"
"621","required by the 1940 Act."
"622","(b)	In connection with the reorganization, the Trust now offers"
"623","a second class of shares, Investor Shares.  Investor Shares were"
"624","first offered on November 17, 2014.  Investor Shares are sold at"
"625","net asset value.  Investor Shares are not subject to a sales"
"626","charge but are subject to a 2.00% redemption fee imposed on any"
"627","Investor Shares redeemed within sixty (60) days of their initial"
"628","purchase.  Investor Shares are also subject to Rule 12b-1 fees."

"791","BENEFICIAL INTEREST"
"792","      Section 2.1  Shares of Beneficial Interest.  The beneficial"
"793","interest in the Trust shall be divided into such transferable"
"794","Shares of one or more separate and distinct Portfolios and"
"795","Classes within a Portfolio as the Trustees shall from time to"
"796","time create and establish.  The number of Shares of each"

"798","Share shall have no par value, unless otherwise determined by"
"799","the Trustees in connection with the creation and establishment"
"800","of a Portfolio or Class.  All Shares issued hereunder, including"
"801","without limitation, Class Shares issued in connection with a"
"802","dividend in Shares or a split or reverse split of Shares, shall"
"803","be fully paid and non-assessable."

"812","appropriate, and may in such manner acquire other assets"
"813","(including the acquisitions of assets subject to, and in"
"814","connection with, the assumption of liabilities) and businesses."
"815","In connection with any issuance of Shares, the Trustees may"
"816","issue fractional Shares and Shares held in the treasury.  The"
"817","Trustees may from time to time divide or combine the Shares into"
"818","a greater or lesser number without thereby changing the"
"819","proportionate beneficial interests in the Trust.  The Trustees"
"820","may classify or reclassify any un-issued Shares or any Shares"
"821","previously issued and reacquired of any Portfolio or Class into"
"822","one or more Portfolios or Classes that may be established and"
"823","designated from time to time."
"824","            Any Trustee, officer or other agent of the Trust, and"
"825","any organization in which any such person is interested, may"
"826","acquire, own, hold and dispose of Shares of any Portfolio or"
"827","Class of the Trust to the same extent as if such person were not"

"832","limitations, restrictions or other provisions applicable to the"
"833","sale or purchase of Shares of such Portfolio or Class generally."
"834","      Section 2.3  Register of Shares and Share Certificates.  A"
"835","register shall be kept at the principal office of the Trust or"

"837","names and addresses of the Shareholders of each Portfolio and"
"838","Class, the number of Shares of that Portfolio and Class thereof"
"839","held by them respectively and a record of all transfers thereof."
"840","As to Shares for which no certificate has been issued, such"

"847","he or she has given his or her address to the transfer agent or"
"848","such other officer or agent of the Trust as shall keep the said"
"849","register for entry thereon.  The Trustees, in their discretion,"
"850","may authorize the issuance of share certificates and promulgate"
"851","appropriate rules and regulations as to their use.  In the event"
"852","that one or more certificates are issued, whether in the name of"
"853","a Shareholder or a nominee, such certificate or certificates"
"854","shall constitute evidence of ownership of Shares for all"
"855","purposes, including transfer, assignment or sale of such Shares,"
"856","subject to such limitations as the Trustees may, in their"
"857","discretion, prescribe."
"858","      Section 2.4  Transfer of Shares.  Except as otherwise"
"859","provided by the Trustees, Shares shall be transferable on the"
"860","records of the Trust only by the record holder thereof or by his"
"861","or her agent thereunto duly authorized in writing, upon delivery"
"862","to the Trustees or the Trust's transfer agent of a duly executed"

"864","one is outstanding, and such evidence of the genuineness of each"
"865","such execution and authorization and of such other matters as"

"869","to be the holder of such Shares for all purposes hereunder and"
"870","neither the Trustees nor the Trust, nor any transfer agent or"
"871","registrar nor any officer, employee or agent of the Trust shall"
"872","be affected by any notice of the proposed transfer."
"873","      Section 2.5  Treasury Shares.  Shares held in the treasury"
"874","shall, until reissued pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof, not confer"

"876","entitled to any dividends or other distributions declared with"

"878","      Section 2.6  Establishment of Portfolios and Classes.  The"
"879","Trust shall consist of one or more Portfolios and Classes and"

"882","power and authority, in their sole discretion, and without"
"883","obtaining any prior authorization or vote of the Shareholders of"
"884","any Portfolio or Class of the Trust, to establish and designate"
"885","and to change in any manner any initial or additional Portfolios"
"886","or Classes and to fix such preferences, voting powers, rights"
"887","and privileges of such Portfolios or Classes as the Trustees may"
"888","from time to time determine, to divide or combine the Shares or"
"889","any Portfolios or Classes into a greater or lesser number, to"
"890","classify or reclassify any issued Shares of any Portfolios or"
"891","Classes into one or more Portfolios or Classes of Shares, and to"
"892","take such other action with respect to the Shares as the"
"893","Trustees may deem desirable.  Unless another time is specified"
"894","by the Trustees, the establishment and designation of any"
"895","Portfolio or Class shall be effective upon the adoption of a"
"896","resolution by the Trustees setting forth such establishment and"
"897","designation and the preferences, powers, rights and privileges"
"898","of the Shares of such Portfolio or Class, whether directly in"
"899","such resolution or by reference to, or approval of, another"
"900","document that sets forth such relative rights and preferences of"
"901","such Portfolio (or Class) including, without limitation, any"
"902","registration statement of the Trust, or as otherwise provided in"
"903","such resolution.  The Trust may issue any number of Shares of"
"904","each Portfolio or Class and need not issue certificates for any"
"905","Shares."
"906","            All references to Shares in this Declaration of Trust"
"907","shall be deemed to be Shares of any or all Portfolios or Classes"
"908","as the context may require.  All provisions herein relating to"
"909","the Trust shall apply equally to each Portfolio and Class of the"
"910","Trust except as the context otherwise requires."
"911","            All Shares of each Class of a particular Portfolio"
"912","shall represent an equal proportionate interest in the assets"
"913","belonging to that Portfolio (subject to the liabilities"
"914","belonging to the Portfolio, and, in the case of each Class, to"
"915","the liabilities belonging to that Class), and each Share of any"
"916","Class of a particular Portfolio shall be equal to each other"
"917","Share of that Class; but the provisions of this sentence shall"
"918","not restrict any distinctions permissible under this Section"
"919","2.6."
"920","      Section 2.7  Investment in the Trust.  The Trustees shall"
"921","accept investments in any Portfolio of the Trust or Class, if"
"922","the Portfolio has been divided into Classes, from such persons"
"923","and on such terms as they may from time to time authorize.  At"
"924","the Trustees' discretion, such investments, subject to"
"925","applicable law, may be in the form of cash or securities in"
"926","which the affected Portfolio is authorized to invest, valued as"
"927","provided in Section 7.4 hereof.  Unless the Trustees otherwise"
"928","determine, investments in a Portfolio shall be credited to each"
"929","Shareholder's account in the form of full Shares at the Net"
"930","Asset Value per Share next determined after the investment is"
"931","received.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the"
"932","Trustees may, in their sole discretion, (a) fix the Net Asset"
"933","Value per Share of the initial capital contribution, (b) impose"
"934","sales or other charges upon investments in the Trust or (c)"
"935","issue fractional Shares."
"936","      Section 2.8  Assets and Liabilities Belonging to"
"937","Portfolios, etc.  All consideration received by the Trust for"
"938","the issue or sale of Shares of a particular Portfolio, together"
"939","with all assets in which such consideration is invested or"
"940","reinvested, all income, earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof,"
"941","including any proceeds derived from the sale, exchange or"
"942","liquidation of such assets, and any funds or payments derived"
"943","from any reinvestment of such proceeds in whatever form the same"
"944","may be, shall be held and accounted for separately from the"
"945","other assets of the Trust and of every other Portfolio and may"
"946","be referred to herein as assets belonging to that Portfolio."
"947","The assets belonging to a particular Portfolio shall belong to"
"948","that Portfolio for all purposes, and to no other Portfolio,"
"949","subject only to the rights of creditors of that Portfolio.  In"
"950","addition, any assets, income, earnings, profits or funds, or"
"951","payments and proceeds with respect thereto, which are not"
"952","readily identifiable as belonging to any particular Portfolio"
"953","shall be allocated by the Trustees between and among one or more"
"954","of the Portfolios in such manner as the Trustees, in their sole"
"955","discretion, deem fair and equitable.  If there are classes of"
"956","Shares within a Portfolio, the assets belonging to the Portfolio"
"957","shall be further allocated to each Class in the proportion that"
"958","the assets belonging to the Class (calculated in the same"
"959","manner as with determination of assets belonging to the"
"960","Portfolio) bears to the assets of all Classes within the"
"961","Portfolio.  Each such allocation shall be conclusive and binding"
"962","upon the Shareholders of all Portfolios and Classes for all"
"963","purposes, and such assets, income, earnings, profits or funds,"
"964","or payments and proceeds with respect thereto shall be assets"
"965","belonging to that Portfolio or Class, as the case may be.  The"
"966","assets belonging to a particular Portfolio and Class shall be so"
"967","recorded upon the books of the Trust, and shall be held by the"
"968","Trustees in trust for the benefit of the holders of Shares of"
"969","that Portfolio or Class, as the case may be."
"970","            The assets belonging to each Portfolio shall be"
"971","charged with the liabilities of that Portfolio and all expenses,"
"972","costs, charges and reserves attributable to that Portfolio.  Any"
"973","general liabilities, expenses, costs, charges or reserves of the"
"974","Trust which are not readily identifiable as belonging to any"
"975","particular Portfolio shall be allocated and charged by the"
"976","Trustees between or among any one or more of the Portfolios in"
"977","such manner as the Trustees in their sole discretion deem fair"
"978","and equitable.  Each such allocation shall be conclusive and"
"979","binding upon the Shareholders of all Portfolios for all"
"980","purposes.  The liabilities, expenses, costs, charges and"
"981","reserves allocated and so charged to a Portfolio are herein"
"982","referred to as liabilities belonging to that Portfolio."
"983","Except as provided in the next sentence or otherwise required or"
"984","permitted by applicable law or any rule or order of the"
"985","Commission, the liabilities belonging to such Portfolio shall"
"986","be allocated to each Class of a Portfolio in the proportion that"
"987","the assets belonging to such Class bear to the assets belonging"
"988","to all Classes in the Portfolio.  To the extent permitted by"
"989","rule or order of the Commission, the Trustees may allocate all"
"990","or a portion of any liabilities belonging to a Portfolio to a"
"991","particular Class or Classes (collectively, Class Expenses) as"
"992","the Trustees may from time to time determine is appropriate.  In"
"993","addition, all liabilities, expenses, costs, charges and reserves"
"994","belonging to a Class shall be allocated to such Class."
"995","            Without limitation of the foregoing provisions of this"
"996","Section 2.8, but subject to the right of the Trustees in their"
"997","discretion to allocate general liabilities, expenses, costs,"
"998","charges or reserves as herein provided, the debts, liabilities,"
"999","obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise"
"1000","existing with respect to a particular Portfolio shall be"
"1001","enforceable against the assets belonging to such Portfolio only,"
"1002","and not against the assets of the Trust generally or any other"
"1003","Portfolio.  Notice of this limitation on inter-Portfolio"
"1004","liabilities shall be set forth in the certificate of trust of"
"1005","the Trust (whether originally or by amendment) as filed or to be"
"1006","filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of"
"1007","Delaware pursuant to the Act, and upon the giving of such notice"
"1008","in the certificate of trust, the statutory provisions of Section"
"1009","3804 of the Act relating to limitations on inter-Portfolio"
"1010","liabilities (and the statutory effect under Section 3804 of"
"1011","setting forth such notice in the certificate of trust) shall"
"1012","become applicable to the Trust and each Portfolio.  Any person"
"1013","extending credit to, contracting with or having any claim"
"1014","against any Portfolio may satisfy or enforce any debt,"
"1015","liability, obligation or expense incurred, contracted for or"
"1016","otherwise existing with respect to that Portfolio from the"
"1017","assets of that Portfolio only.  No Shareholder or former"
"1018","Shareholder of any Portfolio shall have a claim on or any right"
"1019","to any assets allocated or belonging to any other Portfolio."
"1020","            Similarly, the debts, liabilities, obligations and"
"1021","expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with"
"1022","respect to a particular Class shall be enforceable against the"
"1023","assets belonging to such Class only, and not against other"
"1024","assets of the Portfolio or the Trust generally or any other"
"1025","Class.  Each contract entered into by the Trust which is or may"
"1026","be an obligation of a Class within a Portfolio shall contain a"
"1027","provision to the effect that the parties to the contract will"
"1028","look only to the assets belonging to the Class for the"
"1029","satisfaction of any liability, and not to any extent to the"
"1030","assets of any other Class or Portfolio or the Trust generally."
"1031","If, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any liability"
"1032","properly charged to a Class is paid from the assets of another"
"1033","Class, the Class from whose assets the liability was paid shall"
"1034","be reimbursed from the assets of the Class to which such"
"1035","liability belonged."
"1036","      Section 2.9  No Preemptive Rights.  Shareholders shall have"
"1037","no preemptive or other similar rights to subscribe to any"
"1038","additional Shares or other securities issued by the Trust or the"
"1039","Trustees, whether of the same or another Portfolio or Class."
"1040","      Section 2.10  Conversion Rights.  The Trustees shall have"
"1041","the authority to provide from time to time that the holders of"
"1042","Shares of any Portfolio or Class shall have the right to convert"
"1043","or exchange said Shares for or into Shares of one or more other"
"1044","Portfolios or Classes in accordance with such requirements and"
"1045","procedures as may be established from time to time by the"
"1046","Trustees."
"1047","      Section 2.11  Legal Proceedings.  No person, other than a"
"1048","Trustee, who is not a Shareholder of a particular Portfolio or"
"1049","Class shall be entitled to bring any derivative action, suit or"
"1050","other proceeding on behalf of or with respect to such Portfolio"
"1051","or Class.  No Shareholder of a Portfolio or a Class may maintain"
"1052","a derivative action with respect to such Portfolio or Class"
"1053","unless holders of at least ten percent (10%) of the outstanding"
"1054","Shares of such Portfolio or Class join in the bringing of such"
"1055","action.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 3816 of the Act"
"1056","and the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.11, all matters"
"1057","relating to the bringing of derivative actions in the right of"
"1058","the Trust shall be governed by the General Corporation Law of"
"1059","the State of Delaware relating to derivative actions, and"
"1060","judicial interpretations thereunder, as if the Trust were a"
"1061","Delaware Corporation and the Shareholders were shareholders of a"
"1062","Delaware corporation."
"1063","            In addition to the requirements set forth in Section"
"1064","3816 of the Act, a Shareholder may bring a derivative action on"
"1065","behalf of the Trust with respect to a Portfolio or Class only if"
"1066","the following conditions are met:  (a) the Shareholder or"
"1067","Shareholders must make a pre-suit demand upon the Trustees to"
"1068","bring the subject action unless an effort to cause the Trustees"
"1069","to bring such an action is not likely to succeed; and a demand"
"1070","on the Trustees shall only be deemed not likely to succeed and"
"1071","therefore excused if a majority of the Trustees, or a majority"
"1072","of any committee established to consider the merits of such"
"1073","action, has a personal financial interest in the transaction at"
"1074","issue, and a Trustee shall not be deemed interested in a"
"1075","transaction or otherwise disqualified from ruling on the merits"
"1076","of a Shareholder demand by virtue of the fact that such Trustee"
"1077","receives remuneration for his or her service as a Trustee of the"
"1078","Trust or as a trustee or director of one or more investment"
"1079","companies that are under common management with or otherwise"
"1080","affiliated with the Trust; and (b) unless a demand is not"
"1081","required under clause (a) of this paragraph, the Trustees must"
"1082","be afforded a reasonable amount of time to consider such"
"1083","shareholder request and to investigate the basis of such claim;"
"1084","and the Trustees shall be entitled to retain counsel or other"
"1085","advisors in considering the merits of the request and shall"
"1086","require an undertaking by the Shareholders making such request"
"1087","to reimburse the Trust for the expense of any such advisors in"
"1088","the event that the Trustees determine not to bring such action."
"1089","For purposes of this Section 2.11, the Trustees may designate a"
"1090","committee of one Trustee to consider a Shareholder demand if"
"1091","necessary to create a committee with a majority of Trustees who"
"1092","do not have a personal financial interest in the transaction at"
"1093","issue."
"1094","      Section 2.12  Status of Shares.  Shares shall be deemed to"
"1095","be personal property giving only the rights provided in this"
"1096","instrument.  Every Shareholder by virtue of having become a"
"1097","Shareholder shall be held to have expressly assented and agreed"
"1098","to the terms hereof.  The death of a Shareholder during the"
"1099","continuance of the Trust shall not operate to terminate the"
"1100","Trust nor entitle the representative of any deceased Shareholder"
"1101","to an accounting or to take any action in court or elsewhere"
"1102","against the Trust or the Trustees, but only to the rights of"
"1103","said decedent under this Trust.  Ownership of Shares shall not"
"1104","entitle the Shareholder to any title in or to the whole or any"
"1105","part of the Trust property or right to call for a partition or"
"1106","division of the same or for an accounting, nor shall the"
"1107","ownership of Shares constitute the Shareholders partners."
"1108","ARTICLE III"
"1109","THE TRUSTEES"
"1110","      Section 3.1  Management of the Trust.  The Trustees shall"
"1111","have exclusive and absolute control over the Trust Property and"
"1112","over the business of the Trust to the same extent as if the"
"1113","Trustees were the sole owners of the Trust Property and business"
"1114","in their own right, but with such powers of delegation as may be"
"1115","permitted by this Declaration of Trust.  The Trustees shall have"
"1116","power to conduct the business of the Trust and carry on its"
"1117","operations in any and all of its branches and maintain offices"
"1118","both within and without the State of Delaware, in any and all"
"1119","states  of  the United States of America, in the District of"
"1120","Columbia, in any and all commonwealths, territories,"
"1121","dependencies, colonies, or possessions of the United States of"
"1122","America, and in any foreign jurisdiction and to do all such"
"1123","other things and execute all such instruments as they deem"
"1124","necessary, proper or desirable in order to promote the interests"
"1125","of the Trust although such things are not herein specifically"
"1126","mentioned.  Any determination as to what is in the interests of"
"1127","the Trust made by the Trustees in good faith shall be"
"1128","conclusive.  In construing the provisions of this Declaration of"
"1129","Trust, the presumption shall be in favor of a grant of power to"
"1130","the Trustees."
"1131","            The enumeration of any specific power in this"
"1132","Declaration of Trust shall not be construed as limiting the"
"1133","aforesaid power.  The powers of the Trustees may be exercised"
"1134","without order of or resort to any court."
"1135","            Except for the Trustees named herein or appointed"
"1136","pursuant to Section 3.8, or Trustees appointed to fill vacancies"
"1137","pursuant to Section 3.3 hereof, the Trustees shall be elected by"
"1138","the Shareholders owning of record a plurality of the Shares"
"1139","voting at a meeting of Shareholders.  The initial Trustee of the"
"1140","Trust shall be David J. Schoenwald."
"1141","      Section 3.2  Term of Office of Trustees.  Each Trustee"
"1142","shall hold office during the existence of this Trust, and until"
"1143","its termination as herein provided; except:  (a) that any"
"1144","Trustee may resign his or her trust by written instrument signed"
"1145","by him and delivered to the Chairperson, President, Secretary,"
"1146","or other Trustee of the Trust, which shall take effect upon such"
"1147","delivery or upon such later date as is specified therein; (b)"
"1148","that any Trustee may be removed at any time by written"
"1149","instrument, signed by at least two-thirds of the number of"
"1150","Trustees prior to such removal, specifying the date when such"
"1151","removal shall become effective; (c) that any Trustee who"
"1152","requests in writing to be retired or who has died, become"
"1153","physically or mentally incapacitated by reason of disease or"
"1154","otherwise, or is otherwise unable to serve, may be retired by"
"1155","written instrument signed by a majority of the other Trustees,"
"1156","specifying the date of his or her retirement; and (d) that a"
"1157","Trustee may be removed at any meeting of the Shareholders of the"
"1158","Trust by a vote of Shareholders owning at least two-thirds of"
"1159","the outstanding Shares of all Portfolios."
"1160","      Section 3.3  Vacancies and Appointment of Trustees.  In"
"1161","case of the declination to serve, death, resignation,"
"1162","retirement, removal, physical or mental incapacity by reason of"

"1166","Trustees shall occur, until such vacancy is filled, the other"
"1167","Trustees shall have all the powers hereunder and the certificate"
"1168","of the other Trustees of such vacancy shall be conclusive.  In"

"1735","entitled to vote in person or by proxy on a particular matter"
"1736","shall be a quorum for the transaction of business at a"

"1738","number shall be sufficient for adjournments.  Any adjourned"
"1739","session or sessions may be held without the necessity of further"
"1740","notice.  Except when a larger vote is required by law, by any"
"1741","provision of this Declaration of Trust or by the Trustees, a"

"1770","the election of the Trustees, may be paid pursuant to a standing"

"1774","shall be distributed pro rata to the Shareholders of that"
"1775","Portfolio or Class in proportion to the number of Shares of that"

"1793","items shall be treated as income and which items as capital; and"
"1794","each such determination and allocation shall be conclusive and"

"1797","            (a)	Unless the Trustees otherwise determine with"

"1807","the Shares are properly tendered for redemption, less such"

"1813","or partly in securities or other assets belonging to the"
"1814","applicable Portfolio at the value of such securities or assets"
"1815","used in such determination of Net Asset Value."
"1816","            (b)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust may"
"1817","postpone payment of the redemption price and may suspend the"

"1830","established and designated is subject to redemption (out of the"
"1831","assets belonging to the applicable Portfolio or Class) by the"
"1832","Trust at the redemption price which would be applicable if such"
"1833","Share was then being redeemed by the Shareholder pursuant to"
"1834","Section 7.2 at any time if the Trustees determine in their sole"
"1835","discretion that failure to so redeem may have materially adverse"
"1836","consequences to the holders of the Shares, or any Portfolio or"
"1837","Class of the Trust, and upon such redemption the holders of the"
"1838","Shares so redeemed shall have no further right with respect"
"1839","thereto other than to receive payment of such redemption price."
"1840","In addition, the Trustees, in their sole discretion, may cause"
"1841","the Trust to redeem (out of the assets belonging to the"
"1842","applicable Portfolio or Class) all of the Shares of one or more"

"1849","Shareholder to reimburse the Trust for any loss or expense it"
"1850","has sustained or incurred by reason of the failure of such"
"1851","Shareholder to make full payment for Shares purchased by such"
"1852","Shareholder, or by reason of any defective redemption request,"
"1853","or by reason of indebtedness incurred because of such"
"1854","Shareholder as described in Section 9.11 or to collect any"
"1855","charge relating to a transaction effected for the benefit of"
"1856","such Shareholder or as provided in the prospectus relating to"

"1862","that Portfolio or Class less the liabilities belonging to that"
"1863","Portfolio or Class) by the total number of Shares of that"
"1864","Portfolio or Class outstanding, all determined in accordance"
"1865","with the methods and procedures, including without limitation"
"1866","those with respect to rounding, established by the Trustees from"
"1867","time to time."
"1868","            The Trustees may determine to maintain the Net Asset"
"1869","Value per Share of any Portfolio at a designated constant dollar"
"1870","amount and in connection therewith may adopt procedures not"
"1871","inconsistent with the 1940 Act for the continuing  declarations"
"1872","of income attributable to that Portfolio or Class thereof as"
"1873","dividends payable in additional Shares of that Portfolio or"
"1874","Class thereof at the designated constant dollar amount and for"
"1875","the handling of any losses attributable to that Portfolio or"
"1876","Class thereof.  Such procedures may, among other things, provide"
"1877","that in the event of any loss each Shareholder of a Portfolio or"
"1878","Class thereof shall be deemed to have contributed to the capital"
"1879","of the Trust attributable to that Portfolio or Class thereof his"
"1880","or her pro rata portion of the total number of Shares required"
"1881","to be cancelled in order to permit the Net Asset Value per Share"
"1882","of that Portfolio or Class thereof to be maintained, after"
"1883","reflecting such loss, at the designated constant dollar amount."
"1884","Each Shareholder of the Trust shall be deemed to have agreed, by"
"1885","his or her investment in the Trust, to make the contribution"
"1886","referred to in the preceding sentence in the event of any such"

"2148","or effect the adoption of a new Declaration of Trust of the"
"2149","Trust if it is the surviving or resulting trust in the merger or"
"2150","consolidation.  Any merger or consolidation of the Trust other"
"2151","than as described in the foregoing provisions of this Section"
"2152","9.5 shall, in addition to the approval of the Trustees; require"
"2153","a Majority Shareholder Vote.  Nothing in this Section 9.5 shall"
"2154","require, however, Shareholder approval of any transaction"

"2165","made and as to any matters in connection with the Trust"
"2166","hereunder, and with the same effect as if it were the original,"
"2167","may rely on a copy certified by an officer or Trustee of the"
"2168","Trust to be a copy of this Declaration of Trust or of any such"
"2169","amendment or supplemental Declaration of Trust.  In this"
"2170","Declaration of Trust or in any such amendment or supplemental"
"2171","Declaration of Trust, references to this Declaration of Trust,"
"2172","and all expressions like herein, hereof' and hereunder,
shall be deemed to refer to this Declaration of Trust as amended
or affected by any such supplemental Declaration of Trust.  All
expressions like his, he and him, shall be deemed to
include the feminine and neuter, as well as masculine, genders.
Headings are placed herein for convenience of reference only and
in case of any conflict, the text of this Declaration of Trust
rather than the headings, shall control.  This Declaration of
Trust may be executed in any number of counterparts each of
which shall be deemed an original.
      Section 9.7  Applicable Law.  The trust set forth in this
instrument is made in the State of Delaware, and the Trust and
this Declaration of Trust, and the rights and obligations of the
Trustees and Shareholders hereunder, are to be governed by and
construed and administered according to the Act and the laws of
said State; provided, however, that there shall not be
applicable to the Trust, the Trustees or this Declaration of
Trust (a) the provisions of Section 3540 of Title 12 of the
Delaware Code or (b) any provisions of the laws (statutory or
common) of the State of Delaware (other than the Act) pertaining
to trusts which relate to or regulate:  (i) the filing with any
court or governmental body or agency of trustee accounts or
schedules of trustee fees and charges, (ii) affirmative
requirements to post bonds for trustees, officers, agents or
employees of a trust, (iii) the necessity for obtaining court or
other governmental approval concerning the acquisition, holding
or disposition of real or personal property, (iv) fees or other
sums payable to trustees, officers, agents or employees of a
trust, (v) the allocation of receipts and expenditures to income
or principal, (vi) restrictions or limitations on the
permissible nature, amount or concentration of trust investments
or requirements relating to the titling, storage or other manner
of holding of trust assets, or (vii) the establishment of
fiduciary or other standards or responsibilities or limitations
on the acts or powers of trustees, which are inconsistent with
the limitations or liabilities or authorities and powers of the
Trustees set forth or referenced in this Declaration of Trust.
The Trust shall be of the type commonly called a statutory"
"2173","trust, and without limiting the provisions hereof, the Trust
may exercise all powers which are ordinarily exercised by such a
trust under Delaware law.  The Trust specifically reserves the
right to exercise any of the powers or privileges afforded to
trusts or actions that may be engaged in by trusts under the
Act, and the absence of a specific reference herein to any such
power, privilege or action shall not imply that the Trust may
not exercise such power or privilege or take such actions.
      Section 9.8  Amendments.  Except as specifically provided
herein, the Trustees may, without Shareholder vote, amend or
otherwise supplement this Declaration of Trust by making an
amendment, a Declaration of Trust supplemental hereto or an
amended and restated Declaration of Trust.  Shareholders shall
have the right to vote:  (i) on any amendment which would affect
their right to vote granted in Section 6.1, (ii) on any
amendment to this Section 9.8, (iii) on any amendment for which
such vote is required by law and (iv) on any amendment submitted
to them by the Trustees.  Any amendment required or permitted to
be submitted to Shareholders which, as the Trustees determine,
shall affect the Shareholders of one or more Portfolios or
Classes shall be authorized by vote of the Shareholders of each
Portfolio or Class affected and no vote of shareholders of a
Portfolio or Class not affected shall be required.  Anything in
this Declaration of Trust to the contrary notwithstanding, any
amendment to Article VIII hereof shall not limit the rights to
indemnification or insurance provided therein with respect to
action or omission of any persons protected thereby prior to
such amendment.
      Section 9.9  Fiscal Year.  The fiscal year of the Trust
shall end on a specified date as determined from time to time by
the Trustees.
      Section 9.10  Provisions in Conflict with Law.  The
provisions of this Declaration of Trust are severable, and if
the Trustees shall determine, with the advice of counsel, that
any of such provisions is in conflict with the 1940 Act, the
regulated investment company provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code or with other applicable laws and regulations, the
conflicting provision shall be deemed never to have constituted
a part of this Declaration of Trust; provided, however, that
such determination shall not affect any of the remaining
provisions of this Declaration of Trust or render invalid or
improper any action taken or omitted prior to such
determination.  If any provision of this Declaration of Trust
shall be held invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity or unenforceability shall attach only to such
provision in such jurisdiction and shall not in any manner
affect such provisions in any other jurisdiction or any other
provision of this Declaration of Trust in any jurisdiction.
      Section 9.11  Allocation of Certain Expenses.  Each
Shareholder will, at the discretion of the Trustees, indemnify
the Trust against all expenses and losses resulting from
indebtedness incurred in connection with facilitating (i)
requests pending receipt of the collected funds from investments
sold on the date of such Shareholder's redemption request; (ii)
redemption requests from such Shareholder who has also notified
the Trust of its intention to deposit funds in its accounts on
the date of said redemption request; or (iii) the purchase of
investments pending receipt of collected funds from such
Shareholder who has notified the Trust of its intention to
deposit funds in its accounts on the date of the purchase of the
investments.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN
of
REORGANIZATION
      THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the Agreement)
is made as of the 27th day of June, 2014, by and between New
Alternatives Fund, Inc. (the Company), a New York corporation
and New Alternatives Fund (the Trust), a Delaware statutory
trust.
      This Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 (a) (1) (F) of
the U. S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code),
and is intended to effect the reorganization (the
Reorganization) of the Company as a new series of the Trust
(the Successor Fund).  The Reorganization will include the
transfer of all of the assets of the Company to the Successor
Fund of the Trust solely in exchange for (1) the assumption by
the Successor Fund of all liabilities of the Company and (2) the
issuance by the Trust to the Company of Class A Shares of
beneficial interest of the Successor Fund (the Class A Shares).
The aggregate number of Class A Shares of the Successor Fund
issued to the Company will be equal to the number of full and
fractional shares of common stock (Shares) of the Company
outstanding immediately before the Reorganization.  These
transactions will be promptly followed by a pro rata distribution
by the Company of the Class A Shares of the Successor Fund that
it receives in the exchange described above to the holders of its
Shares in exchange for those Shares, in liquidation of the
Company, and the cancellation of the Company's Shares, all upon
the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth in this Agreement.
      In consideration of the promises and of the covenants and
agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto covenant and
agree as follows.
      1.	Transfer of Assets of the Company in Exchange for
Assumption of Liabilities and Issuance of Class A Shares.
            1.1.	Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein and on the basis of the representations and warranties
contained herein, the Company agrees to transfer all of its
assets (as described in paragraph 1.2) and to assign and transfer
all of its liabilities to the Successor Fund which was organized
solely for the purpose of acquiring all of the assets and
assuming all of the liabilities of the Company.  The Trust, on
behalf of its Successor Fund, agrees that in exchange for all of
the assets of the Company:  (1) the Successor Fund shall assume

be registered with the Trust by the Shareholder.  Notice of any
Shareholder meeting need not be given to any Shareholder if a
written waiver of notice, executed before or after such meeting,
is filed with the record of such meeting, or to any Shareholder
who shall attend such meeting in person or by proxy.  Notice of
adjournment of a Shareholders' meeting to another time or place
need not be given, if such time and place are announced at the
meeting or reasonable notice is given to persons present at the

      Section 4.2 Voting-Proxies.  Subject to the provisions of
the Declaration of Trust, Shareholders entitled to vote may vote
either in person or by proxy, provided that either (i) an
instrument authorizing such proxy to act is executed by the

before the meeting, unless the instrument specifically provides
for a longer period or (ii) the Trustees adopt by resolution an

before the meeting.  Proxies shall be delivered to the Secretary

limited by their terms, proxies shall entitle the holder thereof
to vote at any adjournment of a meeting.  A proxy purporting to

burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger.  At

by inspectors, all questions relating to the qualifications of
voters, the validity of proxies, and the acceptance or rejection
of votes shall be decided by the Chairperson of the meeting.
Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Declaration of
Trust, all matters relating to the giving, voting or validity of
proxies shall be governed by the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware relating to proxies, and judicial
interpretations thereunder, as if the Trust were a Delaware
corporation and the Shareholders were shareholders of a Delaware
corporation.
      Section 4.3 Place of Meeting.  All meetings of the
Shareholders shall be held at such places as the Trustees may
designate.
ARTICLE V
SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST
      Section 5.1 Share Certificate.  No certificates certifying
the ownership of Shares shall be issued except as the Trustees
may otherwise authorize.  The Trustees may issue certificates to
a Shareholder of any Series or Class thereof for any purpose and
the issuance of a certificate to one or more Shareholders shall
not require the issuance of certificates generally.  In the
event that the Trustees authorize the issuance of Share
certificates, such certificate shall be in the form prescribed
from time to time by the Trustees and shall be signed by the
President or a Vice President and by the Treasurer, Assistant
Treasurer, Secretary or Assistant Secretary.  Such signatures
may be facsimiles if the certificate is signed by a transfer or
shareholder services agent or by a registrar, other than a
Trustee, officer or employee of the Trust.  In case any officer
who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed on
such certificate shall have ceased to be such officer before
such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Trust with
the same effect as if he or she were such officer at the time of
its issue.
      Section 5.2 Loss of Certificate.  In case of the alleged
loss or destruction or the mutilation of a Share certificate, a
duplicate certificate may be issued in place thereof, upon such
terms as the Trustees may prescribe.
      Section 5.3 Discontinuance of Issuance of Certificates.
The Trustees may at any time discontinue the issuance of Share
certificates and may, by written notice to each Shareholder,
require the surrender of Share certificates to the Trust for
cancellation.  Such surrender and cancellation shall not affect
the ownership of Shares in the Trust.
ARTICLE VI

      The Trustees shall from time to time determine whether and
to what extent, and at what times and places, and under what
conditions and regulations the accounts and books of the Trust
or any of them shall be open to the inspection of the
Shareholders; and no Shareholder shall have any right to inspect
any account or book or document of the Trust except as conferred
by law or otherwise by the Trustees.
ARTICLE VII
AMENDMENTS
      These By-laws may be amended from time to time by the
Trustees.

INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
            AGREEMENT made as of November 14, 2014 between New
Alternatives Fund (the Fund), a series of shares of New
Alternatives Fund, a Delaware statutory trust (the Trust), and
Accrued Equities, Inc., a New York corporation (the Investment"
"2178","Advisor).
            WHEREAS, the Fund is registered as an open-end,
diversified, management investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (1940 Act); and
            WHEREAS, the Trust desires to retain the Investment
Advisor to furnish investment advisory services to the Fund and
the Investment Advisor is willing to so furnish such services;
            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual
covenants herein contained, it is agreed between the parties
hereto as follows:
            1.	Appointment.  The Trust hereby appoints the
Investment Advisor to act as investment advisor to the Fund for
the period and on the terms set forth in this Agreement.  The
Investment Advisor accepts such appointment and agrees to
furnish the services herein set forth, for the compensation
herein provided.
            2.	Management.  Subject to the supervision of the
Trust's Board of Trustees, the Investment Advisor will perform
the following services:
      (i)	Provide a continuous investment program and
strategy for the Fund, including investment research
and management with respect to all securities and
investments and cash equivalents in the Fund,
determining from time to time what securities and
other investments will be invested, reinvested, owned,
held or traded by the Fund.  The Investment Advisor
will provide this service under this Agreement in
accordance with the Fund's investment objective,
policies and restrictions as stated in the Prospectus
and resolutions of the Fund's Board of Trustees
adopted from time to time;
      (ii)	The Investment Advisor shall, to the extent
requested by the Board of Trustees, provide the
personnel to act as officers of the Trust and pay the
salaries of such officers;
      (iii)	Transmit information concerning
purchases and sales of the Fund's portfolio securities
to the custodian for proper settlement;
      (iv)	Supply the Trust and its Board of Trustees
with reports and statistical data as requested; and
      (v)	Prepare a quarterly brokerage allocation
summary and monthly security transaction listing for
the Fund.
            3.	Other Covenants.
            The Investment Advisor further agrees that:
      (i)	It will conform with all applicable Rules
and Regulations of the U. S. Securities and Exchange
Commission;
      (ii)	It will place orders pursuant to its
investment determinations for the Fund either directly
with the issuer or with any broker or dealer.  In
executing portfolio transactions and selecting brokers
or dealers, the Investment Advisor will use its best
efforts to seek on behalf of the Fund the best overall
terms available.  In assessing the best overall terms
available for any transaction, the Investment Advisor
shall consider all factors that it deems relevant,
including the breadth of the market in the security,
the price of the security, the financial condition and
execution capability of the broker or dealer, and the
reasonableness of the commission, if any, both for the
specific transaction and on a continuing basis.  In
evaluating the best overall terms available, and in
selecting the broker dealer to execute a particular
transaction, the Investment Advisor may also consider
the brokerage and research services (as those terms
are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) provided to the Fund and/or
other accounts over which the Investment Advisor or an
affiliate of the Investment Advisor exercises
investment discretion.  The Investment Advisor is
authorized to pay to a broker or dealer who provides
such brokerage and research services a commission for
executing a portfolio transaction for the Fund which
is in excess of the amount of commission another
broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that
transaction if, but only if, the Investment Advisor
determines in good faith that such commission was
reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage
and research services provided by such broker or
dealer, viewed in terms of that particular transaction
or in terms of the overall responsibilities of the
Investment Advisor to the Fund.  The Investment
Advisor will make investment decisions for the Fund
independently from those of other clients of the
Investment Advisor.  However, the same security may be
held in the portfolio of more than one client when the
same security is believed suited for the investment
objectives of more than one client.  Should two or
more clients of the Investment Advisor simultaneously
be engaged in the purchase or sale of the same
security, to the extent possible, the transactions
will be allocated as to price and amount in a manner
fair and equitable to each client;
      (iii)	It will maintain or supervise the
maintenance of all books and records with respect to
the securities transactions of the Fund and will
furnish the Trust's Board of Trustees with such
periodic and special reports as the Board may request;
and
      (iv)	It will treat confidentially and as
proprietary information of the Trust all records and
other information relative to the Fund and prior,
present or potential shareholders, and will not use
such records and information for any purpose other
than performance of its responsibilities and duties
hereunder (except after prior notification to and
approval in writing by the Trust, which approval may
not be withheld where the Investment Advisor would be
exposed to civil or criminal contempt proceedings for
failure to comply, when requested to divulge such
information by duly constituted authorities, or when
so requested by the Trust).
            4.	Services Not Exclusive.  The investment
management services furnished by the Investment Advisor
hereunder are deemed not to be exclusive, and the Investment
Advisor shall be free to furnish similar services to others so
long as its services under this Agreement are not impaired
thereby.  The Investment Advisor will for all purposes herein be
deemed to be an independent contractor and will, unless
otherwise expressly authorized, have no authority to act for or
represent the Trust in any way or otherwise be deemed to be its
agent.
            5.	Books and Records.  In compliance with the
requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Investment
Advisor hereby agrees that all records which it maintains for
the Fund are the property of the Trust and further agrees to
surrender promptly to the Trust any of such records upon the
Trust's request.  The Investment Advisor further agrees to
preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940
Act the records required to be maintained by Rule 31a-i under
the 1940 Act, and to permit the Trust access to the Investment
Advisor's records upon the Trust's request.
            6.	Expenses.
      (i)	During the term of this Agreement, the
Investment Advisor will pay all expenses incurred by
it in connection with its activities under this
Agreement.  The Investment Advisor, at the expense of
the Trust, may lease office space and provide office
furnishings, facilities and equipment as may be
reasonably required for managing and administering the
operations of the Fund.  Other Fund expenses include
supplies and customary clerical and professional
services.
      (ii)	The Fund will bear all of its own expenses
not specifically assumed by the Investment Advisor.
In addition to the investment advisory fee, the Trust
or the Fund pays other operating expenses including,
among others, taxes, brokerage commissions, fees of
Trustees who are not affiliated with the Advisor,
securities registration fees, charges for custodians,
regulatory administration services and transfer agent
services, blue sky filing fees, dividend disbursing
and reinvestment expenses, auditing and legal
expenses, the fees for filing and printing
prospectuses sent to existing shareholders and the
fees for filing and printing shareholder reports.
            7.	Compensation.  For the services provided to the
Fund pursuant to this Agreement, the Trust will pay to the
Investment Advisor and the Investment Advisor will accept as
full compensation therefor, a fee accrued daily and payable
monthly, in arrears, at the annual rate of 1.00% of the first
$25 million of average daily net assets; 0.50% of the next $475
million of average daily net assets; and 0.40% of average daily
net assets more than $500 million.
            8.	Limitation of Liability.  The Investment Advisor
shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law
or for any loss suffered by the Fund in connection with the
performance of this Agreement, except a loss resulting from a
breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of
compensation for services or a loss resulting from willful
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of the
Investment Advisor in the performance of its duties or from
reckless disregard by it of its obligations and duties under
this Agreement.  Any person, even though also an officer,
partner, employee, or agent of the Investment Advisor, who may
be or become an officer, director, employee or agent of the
Trust, shall be deemed, when rendering service to the Fund or
acting on any business of the Fund (other than services or
business in connection with the Investment Advisor's duties as
investment advisor hereunder), to be rendering such services to
or acting solely, for, the Trust and not as an officer, partner,
employee or agent or one under the control or direction of the
Investment Advisor even though paid by it.
            9.	Duration and Termination.  This Agreement will
become effective on the date first written above, and unless
sooner terminated as provided herein, shall continue in effect
until June 30, 2015.  Thereafter, if not terminated, this
Agreement shall continue in effect for successive annual
periods, provided such continuance is specifically approved at
least annually (a) by the vote of a majority of those members of
the Trust's Board of Trustees who are not interested persons of
any party to this Agreement, cast in person at a meeting called
for the purpose of voting on such approval, and (b) by the
Trust's Board of Trustees or by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated at any time, without
the payment of any penalty, by the Fund (by vote of the Trust's
Board of Trustees or by vote of a majority of the outstanding
voting securities of the Fund), or by the Investment Advisor on
sixty days' written notice.  This Agreement will immediately and
automatically terminate in the event of its assignment.  (As
used in this Agreement, the terms majority of the outstanding"
"2179","voting securities, interested persons and assignment shall
have the same meaning of such terms in the 1940 Act.)
            10.	Amendment of this Agreement.  No provision of
this Agreement may be changed, discharged or terminated orally,
but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against
which enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or
termination is sought.  No amendment of this Agreement shall be
effective until approved by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund.
            11.	Miscellaneous.  Any notice made pursuant to this
Agreement shall be given in writing, addressed and delivered or
mailed postage prepaid, return-receipt requested, to the other
party to this Agreement at its principal place of business.
Notice given by a party's attorney shall be deemed to be notice
given by the party.  The captions in this Agreement are included
for convenience of reference only and in no way define or limit
any of the provisions hereof or otherwise affect their
construction or effect.  If any provisions of this Agreement
shall be held or made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule
or otherwise, the remainder of this Agreement shall not be
affected thereby.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and shall be governed by Delaware law.
            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused
this instrument to be executed by their officers designated
below as of the day and year first above written.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of New Alternative
Fund

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements
of the New Alternatives Fund (the Fund) as of December 31,
2014 and for the year then ended, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB), we considered internal control over
financial reporting, including control activities over
safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing
procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the
financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form
N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.
In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by
management are required to assess the expected benefits and
related costs of controls.  A company's internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (GAAP).  A company's internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists
when the design or operation of a control does not allow
management or employees, in the normal course of performing
their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on
a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial
reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first
paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in
internal control that might be material weaknesses under
standards established by the PCAOB.  However, we noted no
deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting
and operations, including controls over safeguarding securities
that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above, as
of December 31, 2014.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of
management, the shareholders of the New Alternatives Fund, the
Board of Trustees of New Alternatives Fund and the Securities
and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not
be used by anyone other than these specified parties.
