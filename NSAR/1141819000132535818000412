"2569","Results of the Shareholder Meeting (Unaudited)"
"2570","A special meeting of the shareholders of the Fund was held on October 13, 2017 (the special
meeting). The sole proposal at the special meeting was to approve an Investment Advisory"
"2571","Agreement between the Adviser and the Trust, on behalf of the Fund (the proposal). As of the"
"2572","July 17, 2017 record date for the special meeting, there were 15,139,067 shares of the Fund"
"2573","outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. The quorum required to conduct business"
"2574","at the special meeting was one-third of the outstanding shares of the Fund as of the July 17, 2017"
"2575","record date. The shares present at the October 13, 2017 special meeting for purposes of"
"2576","determining whether a quorum existed were 7,614,415 present by proxy, representing 50.30% of"
"2577","the total outstanding shares of the Fund. Of the 7,614,415 shares present at the special meeting"
"2578","by proxy, 6,530,681 shares or 85.77% voted in favor (representing 43.14% of total outstanding"
"2579","shares), 77,615 shares or 1.02% voted against (representing 0.51% of total outstanding shares),"
"2580","and 1,006,120 shares or 13.21% abstained from voting (representing 6.65% of total outstanding"
"2581","shares). The vote required for approval of the proposal was the affirmative vote of a majority of
the outstanding voting securities of the Fund. Under the 1940 Act, a majority of the
outstanding voting securities means the affirmative vote of the lesser of (i) 67% of the shares"
"2582","present at the meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are present in"
"2583","person or by proxy; or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund. As such, the"
"2584","proposal was determined to have passed."

"2628","(collectively, the Funds), each portfolios of the diversified series constituting Trust for"

"2630","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)(PCAOB),"
"2631","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"2632","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2633","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"2634","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"2635","Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2636","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective"
"2637","internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"2638","judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs"
"2639","of controls. A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"2640","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"2641","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2642","principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"2643","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"2644","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"2645","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2646","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2647","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"2648","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the fund; and (3) provide"

"2650","use, or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2651","statements."
"2652","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent"

"2654","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2655","conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2656","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation"
"2657","of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"2658","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"2659","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"2660","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2661","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"2662","basis."
"2663","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was for the limited"
"2664","purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"

"2751","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"2752","To the Shareholders of Dearborn Partners Rising Dividend Fund and"
"2753","Board of Trustees of Trust for Professional Managers"
"2754","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Dearborn Partners Rising Dividend Fund (the"
"2755","Fund) as of and for the year ended February 28, 2018, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"2756","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"2757","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2758","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"2759","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"2760","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2761","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over"
"2762","financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"2763","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"2764","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"2765","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  A"
"2766","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2767","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"2768","the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2769","preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"2770","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"2771","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"2772","fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2773","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2774","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"2775","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"2776","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2777","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"2778","allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"2779","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in"
"2780","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"2781","the Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2782","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"2783","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"2784","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"2785","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"2786","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"2787","February 28, 2018."
"2788","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the Board of Trustees of the Fund"
"2789","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"2790","than these specified parties."
