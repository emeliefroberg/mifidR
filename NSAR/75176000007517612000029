"519","<FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>and related costs of controls. A company&#146;s internal </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or d</FONT><FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>isposition of a company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</FONT></P>"
"520","<P style=text-align: left;>"
"521","<FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</FONT></P>"
"522","<P style=text-align: left;>"
"523","<FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>company&#146;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis</FONT><FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>.</FONT></P>"
