"2597","<TEXT>"
"2598","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2599","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"2600","Franklin Alternative Strategies Funds:"
"2601","In planning and performing our audits of the (consolidated)"
"2602","financial statements of Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy"
"2603","Fund, Franklin K2 Alternative Strategies Fund, Franklin K2"
"2604","Long Short Credit Fund and Franklin K2 Global Macro Opportunities"
"2605","Fund (four of the Funds comprising Franklin Alternative"
"2606","Strategies Funds) (collectively, the Funds) as of and for the"
"2607","year ended May 31, 2018, in accordance with the standards of the"
"2608","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"2609","considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"2610","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"2611","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"2612","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"2613","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"2614","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"2615","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2616","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"2617","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"2618","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"2619","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"2620","costs of controls. A company's internal control over financial"
"2621","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2622","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"2623","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"2624","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"2625","A company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"2626","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"2627","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2628","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"2629","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"2630","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"2631","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"2632","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only"
"2633","in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"2634","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"2635","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"2636","use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"2637","material effect on the financial statements."
"2638","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2639","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2640","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"2641","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2642","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"2643","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"2644","deteriorate."
"2645","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"2646","exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"2647","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"2648","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
"2649","basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"2650","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"2651","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"2652","of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"2653","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2654","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2655","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2656","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"2657","in internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"2658","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"2659","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"2660","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"2661","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities"
"2662","that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above"
"2663","as of May 31, 2018."
"2664","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"2665","of management and Board of Trustees of Franklin Alternative"
"2666","Strategies Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"2667","and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone"

"2685","1.	From the Prospectus Supplement GOF P9 03/18:"
"2686","SUPPLEMENT DATED MARCH 15, 2018"
"2687","TO THE CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE PROSPECTUS"
"2688","OF EACH OF THE FUNDS LISTED BELOW"
"2689","Franklin Alternative Strategies Funds"
"2690","Franklin K2 Global Macro Opportunities Fund"
"2691","I.	For the Franklin K2 Global Macro Opportunities Fund, the"
"2692"," following is added to the Fund Details - Principal Investment
 Policies and Practices section:"
"2693","The Sub-Advisors may from time to time also invest in credit-linked"
"2694"," notes. The use of such instruments may allow the Fund to obtain"
"2695","exposure to selected countries, regions or credit risks. The"
"2696","Sub-Advisors consider various factors, such as availability and"
"2697","cost, in deciding whether, when and to what extent to enter into"
"2698","derivative transactions."
"2699","A typical credit-linked note is set-up as a pass-through note"
"2700","structure created by a broker or bank as an alternative investment"
"2701","for the Fund or other purchaser to buying directly a bond or group"
"2702","of bonds. Credit-linked notes are typically issued at par, with a"
"2703","one to one relationship with the notional value to the underlying"
"2704","bond. The performance of the credit-linked notes, however,"
"2705","including maturity value, is linked to the performance of the"
"2706","specified underlying bond as well as that of the issuing entity."
"2707","A credit-linked note is typically structured as a limited recourse,"
"2708","unsecured obligation of the issuer of the note so that the note"
"2709","will usually be the obligation solely of the issuer and will not"
"2710","be an obligation or responsibility of any other person, including"
"2711","the issuer of the underlying bond."
"2712","II.	For the Franklin K2 Global Macro Opportunities Fund, the"
"2713","following is added to the Fund Details - Principal Risks
-Derivative Instruments section:
With respect to credit-linked notes, in addition to the risk
of loss of its principal investment or failure of the issuer of
the note to perform, a downgrade or impairment to the credit rating
of the issuer will also likely impact negatively the price of the
credit-linked note, regardless of the price of the bond(s)
underlying the credit-linked note. Changes in liquidity may
result in significant, rapid and unpredictable changes in the
prices of credit-linked notes. In certain cases, a market price
for a credit-linked note may not be available or may not be
reliable, and the Fund could experience difficulty in selling such
security at a price the Sub-Advisor believes is fair.


2.	From the Statement of Information Supplement GOF SA8 03/18:

SUPPLEMENT DATED MARCH 2, 2018
TO THE CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE STATEMENTS OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
OF EACH OF THE FUNDS LISTED BELOW
Franklin Alternative Strategies Funds
Franklin K2 Alternative Strategies Fund

III.	For Franklin K2 Alternative Strategies Fund, the following
 is added to the Goals, Strategies and Risks - Glossary of"
"2714","Investments, Techniques, Strategies and Their Risks - Developing"
"2715","markets or emerging markets section of the SAI:

Investing through the Bond Connect Program. Foreign investors may
invest in China Interbank bonds traded on the China Interbank Bond
Market (CIBM) through the China - Hong Kong Bond Connect program
(Bond Connect).  In China, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
Central Money Markets Unit holds Bond Connect securities on behalf
of ultimate investors (such as the Fund) in accounts maintained with
a China-based custodian
(either the China Central Depository & Clearing Co. or the
Shanghai Clearing House). This recordkeeping system subjects the
Fund to various risks, including the risk that the Fund may have a
limited ability to enforce rights as a bondholder and the risks of
settlement delays and counterparty default of the Hong Kong
sub-custodian. In addition, enforcing the ownership rights of
a beneficial holder of Bond Connect securities is untested and
courts in China have limited experience in applying the concept
of beneficial ownership.
Bond Connect uses the trading infrastructure of both Hong Kong
and China and is not available on trading holidays in Hong Kong.
As a result, prices of securities purchased through Bond Connect
may fluctuate at times when a Fund is unable to add to or exit
its position. Securities offered through Bond Connect may lose
their eligibility for trading through the program at any time.
If Bond Connect securities lose their eligibility for trading
through the program, they may be sold but can no longer be
purchased through Bond Connect.
Bond Connect is subject to regulation by both Hong Kong and
China and there can be no assurance that further regulations
will not affect the availability of securities in the program,
the frequency of redemptions or other limitations. Bond Connect
trades are settled in Chinese currency, the renminbi (RMB).
It cannot be guaranteed that investors will have timely access
to a reliable supply of RMB in Hong Kong.
Bond Connect is relatively new and its effects on the Chinese
interbank bond market are uncertain. In addition, the trading,
settlement and IT systems required for non-Chinese investors in
Bond Connect are relatively new. In the event of systems
malfunctions, trading via Bond Connect could be disrupted.
In addition, the Bond Connect program may be subject to further
interpretation and guidance. There can be no assurance as to the
program's continued existence or whether future developments
regarding the program may restrict or adversely affect the
Fund's investments or returns. Finally, uncertainties in
China tax rules governing taxation of income and gains from
investments via Bond Connect could result in unexpected
tax liabilities for a Fund.

EXHIBIT ITEM No. 77q1 (a): Copies of any material amendments
to the registrant's charter or by-laws

Amendment Effective February 1, 2018
To the By-Laws of
Franklin Alternative Strategies Funds
(the Trust)

WHEREAS, Article VIII, Section 2 of the By-Laws provides that
the By-Laws may be amended by the Board of Trustees; and

WHEREAS, by resolutions adopted October 23, 2017 at a meeting of
the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Board of Trustees
unanimously authorized the By-Laws to be amended as set forth below.

NOW THEREFORE, the By-Laws are hereby amended as follows:

1.	ARTICLE VII, Sections 3, 4 and 6 are replaced in their entirety
with the following:

*  *  *  *  *  *

Section 3.	CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES.  No certificate or certificates
for Shares shall be issued to Shareholders and no Shareholder shall
have the right to demand or require that a certificate for Shares be
issued to it.  The Trust shall adopt and use a system of issuance,
recordation and transfer of its shares by electronic or other means.
Section 4.	LOST CERTIFICATES.  No new certificate for Shares
shall be issued to replace an old certificate that is surrendered to
the Trust for cancellation.  In case any Share certificate or
certificate for any other security is lost, stolen, or destroyed,
such certificate shall be cancelled and the ownership of an
uncertificated Share shall be recorded upon the books of the Trust,
on such terms and conditions as the Board may require, including a
provision for indemnification of the Board and the Trust secured by
a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the Trust
and the Board against any claim that may be made against either,
including any expense or liability on account of the alleged loss,
theft, or destruction of the certificate.
*  *  *  *  *  *

Section 6.	TRANSFERS OF SHARES.  Shares are transferable, if
authorized by the Declaration of Trust, only on the record books of
the Trust by the Person in whose name such Shares are registered,
or by his or her duly authorized attorney-in-fact or
representative.  Upon receipt of proper transfer instructions
from the registered owner of certificated Shares, and upon the
surrender for cancellation of such certificates representing the
number of Shares to be transferred with an assignment and power
of transfer endorsed thereon or attached thereto, duly executed,
with such proof of the authenticity of the signature as the Trust
or its agents may reasonably require, the Trust shall cancel the
old certificate and record the transaction and ownership of
uncertificated Shares upon the books of the Trust.  Upon receipt
of proper transfer instructions from the registered owner of
uncertificated Shares, such uncertificated Shares shall be
transferred on the record books to the Person entitled thereto.
The Trust, its transfer agent or other duly authorized agents may
refuse any requested transfer of Shares, or request additional
evidence of authority to safeguard the assets or interests of the
Trust or of its Shareholders, in their sole discretion.  In all
cases of transfer by an attorney-in-fact, the original power of
attorney, or an official copy thereof duly certified, shall be
deposited and remain with the Trust, its transfer agent or other
duly authorized agent.  In case of transfers by executors,
administrators, guardians or other legal representatives,
duly authenticated evidence of their authority shall be presented
to the Trust, its transfer agent or other duly authorized agent,
and may be required to be deposited and remain with the Trust,
its transfer agent or other duly authorized agent.


Adopted and approved as of October 23, 2017 by the Board of Trustees.
