"1179","for the year ended December 31, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"

"1181","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"1182","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund&rsquo;s"

"1194","with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
