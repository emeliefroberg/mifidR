"1914","Fund), as of and for the year ended May 31, 2017, in"
"1915","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1916","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"1917","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1918","control activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1919","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1920","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"1921","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1922","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1923","Fund's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"1924","we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"

"1928","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"

"1932","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"1933","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"1934","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"

"1937","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1938","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"1939","of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1940","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"

"2069","Effective February 16, 2017, the Fund's principal"

"2075","arrangement with the fund's Advisor."
"2076","CROCI(r) Investment Process. The CROCI(r)"
"2077","Investment Process is based on the belief that the"
"2078","data used in traditional valuations (i.e. accounting"
"2079","data) does not accurately appraise assets, reflect all"
"2080","liabilities or represent the real value of a company."
"2081","This is because the accounting rules are not always"
"2082","designed specifically for investors and often utilize"
"2083","widely differing standards which can make"
"2084","measuring the real asset value of companies"
"2085","difficult. The CROCI (r) Investment Process seeks to"
"2086","generate data that will enable valuation comparisons"
"2087","on a consistent basis, resulting in what port- folio"
"2088","management believes is an effective and efficient"
"2089","sector and stock selection process targeting investment"
"2090","in real value."
"2091","Effective May 26, 2017, the main investments"
"2092","section of the Fund's principal investment strategy"

"2096","approximately 30 companies selected from among"
"2097","the largest European, US and Japanese companies"

"2102","Portfolio management will choose investments from"
