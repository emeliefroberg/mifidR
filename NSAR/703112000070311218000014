"495","<TEXT>"
"496","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"497","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Franklin"
"498","New York Tax-Free Income Fund:"
"499","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"500","Franklin New York Tax-Free Income Fund (the Fund) as of and for the"
"501","year ended May 31, 2018, in accordance with the standards of the"
"502","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"503","considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"504","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"505","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"506","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"507","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"508","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"509","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an"
"510","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"511","over financial reporting."
"512","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"513","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"514","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"515","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"516","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's"
"517","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"518","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"519","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"520","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"521","with generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's"
"522","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"523","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"524","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"525","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"526","the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"527","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"528","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"529","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"530","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"531","and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"532","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"533","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could"
"534","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"535","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"536","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"537","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"538","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"539","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"540","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"541","deteriorate."
"542","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"543","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"544","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"545","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"546","on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"547","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"548","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"549","material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial"
"550","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"551","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"552","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"553","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"554","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"555","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"556","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"557","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"558","and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities"
"559","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above"
"560","as of April 30, 2018."
"561","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"562","management and the Board of Trustees of Franklin Federal Tax-Free"
"563","Income Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"564","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"565","specified parties."

"661","Amendment Effective February 1, 2018"
"662","To the By-Laws of"
"663","Franklin New York Tax-Free Income Fund"
"664","(the Trust)"
"665","WHEREAS, Article VIII, Section 2 of the By-Laws"
"666","provides that the By-Laws may be amended by the"
"667","Board of Trustees; and"
"668","WHEREAS, by resolutions adopted October 24, 2017 at a"
"669","meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Board of"
"670","Trustees unanimously authorized the By-Laws to be amended as"
"671","set forth below."
"672","NOW THEREFORE, the By-Laws are hereby amended as follows:"
"673","1.	ARTICLE VII, Sections 3, 4 and 6 are replaced in their"
"674","entirety with the following:"
"675","*  *  *  *  *  *"
"676","Section 3.	CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES.  No certificate or certificates"
"677","for Shares shall be issued to Shareholders and no Shareholder shall have"
"678","the right to demand or require that a certificate for Shares be issued"
"679","to it.  The Trust shall adopt and use a system of issuance, recordation"
"680","and transfer of its shares by electronic or other means."
"681","Section 4.	LOST CERTIFICATES.  No new certificate for Shares shall"
"682","be issued to replace an old certificate that is surrendered to the Trust"
"683","for cancellation.  In case any Share certificate or certificate for any"
"684","other security is lost, stolen, or destroyed, such certificate shall be"
"685","cancelled and the ownership of an uncertificated Share shall be recorded"
"686","upon the books of the Trust, on such terms and conditions as the Board"
"687","may require, including a provision for indemnification of the Board and"
"688","the Trust secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to"
"689","protect the Trust and the Board against any claim that may be made"
"690","against either, including any expense or liability on account of the"
"691","alleged loss, theft, or destruction of the certificate."
"692","*  *  *  *  *  *"
"693","Section 6.	TRANSFERS OF SHARES.  Shares are transferable, if"
"694","authorized by the Declaration of Trust, only on the record books of"
"695","the Trust by the Person in whose name such Shares are registered, or"
"696","by his or her duly authorized attorney-in-fact or representative."
"697","Upon receipt of proper transfer instructions from the registered owner"
"698","of certificated Shares, and upon the surrender for cancellation of"
"699","such certificates representing the number of Shares to be transferred"
"700","with an assignment and power of transfer endorsed thereon or attached"
"701","thereto, duly executed, with such proof of the authenticity of the"
"702","signature as the Trust or its agents may reasonably require, the"
"703","Trust shall cancel the old certificate and record the transaction"
"704","and ownership of uncertificated Shares upon the books of the Trust."
"705","Upon receipt of proper transfer instructions from the registered owner"
"706","of uncertificated Shares, such uncertificated Shares shall be"
"707","transferred on the record books to the Person entitled thereto.  The"
"708","Trust, its transfer agent or other duly authorized agents may refuse"
"709","any requested transfer of Shares, or request additional evidence of"
"710","authority to safeguard the assets or interests of the Trust or of its"
"711","Shareholders, in their sole discretion.  In all cases of transfer by"
"712","an attorney-in-fact, the original power of attorney, or an official"
"713","copy thereof duly certified, shall be deposited and remain with the"
"714","Trust, its transfer agent or other duly authorized agent.  In case"
"715","of transfers by executors, administrators, guardians or other legal"
"716","representatives, duly authenticated evidence of their authority shall"
"717","be presented to the Trust, its transfer agent or other duly authorized"
"718","agent, and may be required to be deposited and remain with the Trust,"
"719","its transfer agent or other duly authorized agent."
