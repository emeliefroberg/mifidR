"1785","International Equity Index Funds, hereafter referred to as the"
"1786","?Trust?) as of and for the year ended October 31, 2013, in"
"1787","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1788","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1789","Trust's internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1790","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1791","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1792","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"1793","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1794","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial"
"1795","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"1796","effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial"
"1797","reporting."
"1798","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"1799","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"1800","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1801","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1802","related costs of controls.  A company?s internal control over"
"1803","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1804","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1805","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1806","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1807","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1808","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1809","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"1810","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"1811","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"1812","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1813","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1814","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"1815","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1816","trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1817","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1818","acquisition, use or disposition of a company?s assets that could"
"1819","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1820","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1821","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"1822","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"1823","are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"1824","because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1825","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1826","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1827","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1828","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1829","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1830","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1831","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1832","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1833","material misstatement of the Trust's annual or interim financial"
"1834","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1835","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial"
"1836","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1837","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1838","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"1839","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1840","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"1841","no deficiencies in the Trust's internal control over financial"

"1863","Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund"
"1864","Supplement to the Prospectus and Summary Prospectus"
"1865","New Target Index"
"1866","Effective immediately, Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund has"
"1867","begun tracking its new target index, the FTSE Emerging Index, as previously"
"1868","approved by the Fund?s board of trustees. The board believes that the new"
"1869","index is wellconstructed and offers comprehensive coverage of the Fund's"
"1870","market segment. In addition, Vanguard?s agreement with FTSE may result"
"1871","in considerable savings to shareholders over time in the form of lower"
"1872","expense ratios. The new index measures the same market segment as the"
"1873","previous index, so the investment objective and risks described in the"
"1874","Fund's current prospectus have not changed. The Fund's new target index"
"1875","could provide different investment returns (either lower or higher) or"
"1876","different levels of volatility from those of the previous index."
"1877","Prospectus and Summary Prospectus Text Changes"
"1878","The paragraph under ?Primary Investment Strategies is replaced with"
"1879","the following:"
"1880","The Fund employs an indexing investment approach by investing substantially"
"1881","all (approximately 95%) of its assets in the common stocks included in the"
"1882","FTSE Emerging Index, while employing a form of sampling to reduce risk."
"1883","The FTSE Emerging Index includes approximately 851 common stocks of"
"1884","companies located in emerging markets around the world. As of May 31, 2013,"
"1885","the largest markets covered in the Index were China, Brazil, Taiwan, and"
"1886","India (which made up approximately 20%, 15%, 13%, and 9%, respectively,"
"1887","of the Index's market capitalization)."
"1888","The following credit line is added:"
"1889","Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund (the Fund) is not in any way"
"1890","sponsored, endorsed, sold, or promoted by FTSE International Limited"
"1891","(FTSE) or the London Stock Exchange Group companies (?LSEG?) (together"
"1892","the Licensor Parties), and none of the Licensor Parties make any claim,"
"1893","prediction, warranty, or representation whatsoever, expressly or impliedly,"
"1894","either as to (i) the results to be obtained from the use of the FTSE"
"1895","Emerging Index (the Index) (upon which the Fund is based), (ii) the"
"1896","figure at which the Index is said to stand at any particular time on any"
"1897","particular day or otherwise, or (iii) the suitability of the Index for the"
"1898","purpose to which it is being put in connection with the Fund. None of the"
"1899","Licensor Parties have provided or will provide any financial or investment"
"1900","advice or recommendation in relation to the Index to Vanguard or to its"
"1901","clients. The Index is calculated by FTSE or its agent. None of the Licensor"
"1902","Parties shall be (a) liable (whether in negligence or otherwise) to any"
"1903","person for any error in the Index or (b) under any obligation to"
"1904","advise any person of any error therein. All rights in the Index vest in FTSE."
"1905","FTSE? is a trademark of LSEG and is used by FTSE under licence."
"1906","Prospectus Text Changes"
"1907","The following replaces similar text in the More on the Funds section under the"
"1908","heading Security Selection:"

"1910","stocks included in the FTSE Emerging Index, while employing a form of"

"1914","Brazil, Taiwan, and India (which made up approximately 20%, 15%, 13%, and 9%,"
"1915","respectively, of the Index's market capitalization)."
"1916","Emerging markets can be substantially more volatile, and substantially less"
"1917","liquid, than both U.S. and more developed foreign markets. Therefore, the Fund"
"1918","may expose investors to a higher degree of volatility and illiquidity than"
"1919","funds that invest in more developed markets. As of May 31, 2013, the Fund had"
"1920","an asset-weighted median market capitalization of $17 billion."
"1921","Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund (the ?Fund?) is not in any way"
"1922","sponsored, endorsed, sold, or promoted by FTSE International Limited (FTSE)"
"1923","or the London Stock Exchange Group companies (?LSEG?) (together the Licensor
Parties), and none of the Licensor Parties make any claim, prediction,"
