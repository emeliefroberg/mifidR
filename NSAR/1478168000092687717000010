"1213","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"1214","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1215","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1216","Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Funds Trust"
"1217","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1218","statements of Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Funds"
"1219","Trust comprising Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Select"
"1220","40 Fund, Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Alpha Fund,"
"1221","Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Income Fund, and"
"1222","Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Alpha Plus Fund (the"
"1223","Funds) as of and for the year ended November 30,"
"1224","2016, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1225","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1226","States), we considered the Funds  internal control"
"1227","over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1228","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1229","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"1230","our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"1231","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"1232","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1233","effectiveness of the Funds  internal control over"
"1234","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such"
"1235","opinion."
"1236","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"1237","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1238","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1239","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1240","management are required to assess the expected"
"1241","benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund s"
"1242","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"1243","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1244","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1245","preparation of financial statements for external"
"1246","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1247","accounting principles (GAAP).  A fund s internal"
"1248","control over financial reporting includes those"
"1249","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1250","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1251","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1252","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1253","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"1254","as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1255","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that"
"1256","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"1257","made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1258","management and trustees of the fund; and (3)"
"1259","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1260","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"1261","or disposition of a fund s assets that could have a"
"1262","material effect on the financial statements."
"1263","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1264","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1265","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1266","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1267","risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"1268","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1269","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1270","deteriorate."
"1271","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1272","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1273","control does not allow management or employees,"
"1274","in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1275","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1276","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"1277","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"1278","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1279","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds"
"1280","annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1281","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1282","Our consideration of the Funds  internal control over"
"1283","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1284","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1285","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"1286","that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"1287","established by the Public Company Accounting"
"1288","Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"1289","no deficiencies in the Funds  internal control over"
"1290","financial reporting and its operation, including"
"1291","controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"1292","consider to be a material weakness as defined above"
"1293","as of November 30, 2016."
"1294","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"1295","use of management and the Board of Trustees of the"
"1296","Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"1297","and is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"1298","anyone other than these specified parties."

"1310","N-SAR EXHIBIT 77E"
"1311","ALL FUNDS ADVISED BY OFI STEELPATH"
"1312","(based upon Non Defendant Version)"
"1313","Pending Litigation.  In 2009, several putative class"
"1314","action lawsuits were filed  and later consolidated before"
"1315","the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado in"
"1316","connection with the investment performance of"
"1317","Oppenheimer Rochester California Municipal Fund (the"
"1318","California Fund ), a fund advised by"
"1319","OppenheimerFunds, Inc. ( OFI ) - the parent company"
"1320","of the manager and distributed by OppenheimerFunds"
"1321","Distributor, Inc. ( OFDI ) .  The plaintiffs asserted"
"1322","claims against OFI, OFDI and certain present and"
"1323","former trustees and officers of the California Fund"
"1324","under the federal securities laws, alleging, among other"
"1325","things, that the disclosure documents of the California"
"1326","Fund contained misrepresentations and omissions and"
"1327","the investment policies of the California Fund were not"
"1328","followed.  An amended complaint and a motion to"
"1329","dismiss were filed, and in 2011, the court issued an"
"1330","order which granted in part and denied in part the"
"1331","defendants  motion to dismiss.  In October 2015,"
"1332","following a successful appeal by defendants and a"
"1333","subsequent hearing, the court granted plaintiffs  motion"
"1334","for class certification and appointed class"
"1335","representatives and class counsel."
"1336","OFI and OFDI believe the suit is without merit; that it"
"1337","is premature to render any opinion as to the likelihood"
"1338","of an outcome unfavorable to them in the Suit; and that"
"1339","no estimate can yet be made as to the amount or range"
"1340","of any potential loss.  Furthermore, OFI believes that"
"1341","the suit should not impair the ability of OFI or OFDI to"
"1342","perform their respective duties to the Fund and that the"
"1343","outcome of the suit should not have any material effect"
"1344","on the operations of any of the Oppenheimer funds."
