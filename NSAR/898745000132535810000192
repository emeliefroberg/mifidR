"30652","limitations as to dividends, qualifications, and terms and conditions"
"30653","of redemption as shall be fixed and determined from time to time by the"

"30659","borne solely by such class as shall be determined by the Board of"
"30660","Directors and may cause differences in rights as described in the"
"30661","following sentence.  The shares of a class may be converted into shares"
"30662","of another class upon such terms and conditions as shall be determined"

"30665","Expenses related to the distribution of, and other identified expenses"
"30666","that should properly be allocated to, the shares of a particular series"
"30667","or class may be charged to and borne solely by such series or class,"
"30668","and the bearing of expenses solely by a series or class may be"
"30669","appropriately reflected (in a manner determined by the Board of"
"30670","Directors) and cause differences in the net asset value attributable"
"30671","to, and the dividend, redemption and liquidation rights of, the shares"

"32573","or other shares) other than any right which the Board of Directors of the"
"32574","Corporation, in its discretion, may determine."
"32575","	Section 4.  Determination of Net Asset Value: The net asset value of each"
"32576","share of each series or class of each series of the Corporation shall be"
"32577","the quotient obtained by dividing the value of the net assets of the"

"32592","expenses or creation of reserves and for the determination of the number"
"32593","of shares issued and outstanding at any given time."

"33574","identifiable as belonging to any particular class (collectively General
Items), such General Items shall be allocated by or under the"

"33607","determined by the Board of Directors as belonging to such class."

"33609","reflect differing allocations of the expense of each class of that series"

"33611","appropriate.  The Board of Directors shall have the power, in its sole"
"33612","discretion, to distribute in any fiscal year as dividends, including"
"33613","dividends designated in whole or in part as capital gains distributions,"
"33614","amounts sufficient, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, to enable"
"33615","the Corporation, or where applicable each series of shares or class of a"
"33616","series, to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal"
"33617","Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any successor or comparable statute"

"33620","Federal income and excise taxes in respect of that or any other year."
"33621","	(4)	Liquidation.  In the event of the liquidation of the Corporation or"

"35083","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"35084","The Shareholders and Board of Directors"
"35085","Principal Funds, Inc."
"35086","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"35087","Principal Funds, Inc. as of and for the year ended October 31, 2009, in"
"35088","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"35089","Oversight Board (United States), we considered its internal controls"
"35090","over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"35091","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"35092","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"35093","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"35094","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Principal Funds, Inc.'s"
"35095","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"35096","such opinion."
"35097","The management of Principal Funds, Inc. is responsible for establishing"
"35098","and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"35099","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"35100","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"35101","controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"35102","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"35103","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"35104","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"35105","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"35106","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"35107","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"35108","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"35109","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"35110","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"35111","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that"
"35112","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"35113","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"35114","company and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"35115","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"35116","company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"35117","statements."
"35118","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"35119","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"35120","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"35121","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"35122","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"35123","procedures may deteriorate."
"35124","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"35125","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"35126","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"35127","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"35128","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"35129","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"35130","possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or"
"35131","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"35132","timely basis."
"35133","Our consideration of Principal Funds, Inc.'s internal control over"
"35134","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"35135","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"35136","internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"35137","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"35138","States). However, we noted no deficiencies in Principal Funds, Inc.'s"
"35139","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"35140","controls for safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material"
"35141","weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2009."
"35142","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"35143","management and the Board of Directors of Principal Funds, Inc. and the"
"35144","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should"
"35145","not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"35200","of the Closing Date."
"35201","         On the Closing Date, LargeCap Value I will issue to LargeCap"

from time to time in effect.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the
officers, in taking such steps as are reasonably necessary or appropriate
to carry out the decisions of its Board of Directors, and any appropriate
committees of such Board, regarding the general conduct of the investment
business of the Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment advisory
services provided to the Series, its compliance with the 1940 Act and the
regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder
and the Series' investment strategies and restrictions as stated in the
Fund's prospectus and statement of additional information, subject to
receipt of such additional information as may be required from the Manager
and provided in accordance with Section 11(d) of this Agreement. The Sub-
Advisor has no responsibility for the maintenance of Fund records except
insofar as is directly related to the services it provides to the Series.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and in such
detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem appropriate in order
to enable it to determine that the investment policies, procedures and
approved investment program of the Series are being observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination of the fair value
of certain securities when reliable market quotations are not readily
available for purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance with
procedures and methods established by the Fund's Board of Directors.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and
management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other personnel
required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii) administrative
facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment
necessary for the efficient conduct of its duties under this Agreement.

(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission merchants
(broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all transactions for
the Series, place all necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers
(including affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if
applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell
orders for the Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or
sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation
of securities so sold or purchased, as well as the expenses incurred in
the transaction, will be made by the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-
Advisor considers to be the most equitable and consistent with its
fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients.  The Manager
recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure may limit the size of the
position that may be acquired or sold for the Series.  The Sub-Advisor
will report on such allocations at the request of the Manager, the Fund or
the Fund's Board of Directors providing such information as the number of
aggregated trades to which the Series was a party, the broker-dealers to
whom such trades were directed and the basis for the allocation for the
aggregated trades.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain
execution of transactions for the Series at prices which are advantageous
to the Series and at commission rates that are reasonable in relation to
the benefits received. However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or
dealers on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or other
services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with
applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of
commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount
of commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would have charged
for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith
that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of
the brokerage and research products and/or services provided by such
broker or dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and
research products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either that
particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-
Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to the Series as well as to
accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Not all such
services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the
Series. In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be
utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under any exemptive
order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions of such
order are complied with.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the Series as
are required of an investment advisor of a registered investment company
pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment Advisor's Act of 1940 (the
Investment Advisor's Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the
Fund and the Manager with such periodic and special reports as the Fund or
Manager may reasonably request.  In compliance with the requirements of
Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all
records that it maintains for the Series are the property of the Fund,
agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940
Act any records that it maintains for the Fund and that are required to be
maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to
surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it maintains for the
Series upon request by the Fund or the Manager.

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the Sub-
Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as the same may be
amended from time to time.  The Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy of
Sub-Advisor's current Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward
to the Manager a copy of any material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code
of Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request, furnish the
requesting party reports on portfolio transactions and reports on
investments held by the Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the
Fund may reasonably request.  The Sub-Advisor will make available its
officers and employees to meet with the Fund's Board of Directors at the
Fund's principal place of business on due notice to review the investments
of the Series.

(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-advisor
and may be required for the Fund or the Manager to comply with their
respective obligations under applicable laws, including, without
limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code),
the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and any
rule or regulation thereunder.  Sub-Advisor will advise Manager of any
changes in Sub-Advisor's general partners within a reasonable time after
any such change.  Manager acknowledges receipt of Sub-Advisor's Form ADV
more than 48 hours prior to the execution of this Agreement.

(n)	Perform quarterly and annual tax compliance tests to monitor the
Series' compliance with Subchapter M of the Code and Section 817(h) of the
Code, subject to receipt of such additional information as may be required
from the Manager and provided in accordance with Section 11(d) of this
Agreement.  The Sub-Advisor shall notify the Manager immediately upon
having a reasonable basis for believing that the Series has ceased to be
in compliance or that it might not be in compliance in the future.  If it
is determined that the Series is not in compliance with the requirements
noted above, the Sub-Advisor, in consultation with the Manager, will take
prompt action to bring the Series back into compliance (to the extent
possible) within the time permitted under the Code.

(o)	Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies solicited by, or
with respect to, the issuers of securities held in the Series.  The
Manager shall cause to be forwarded to Sub-Advisor all proxy solicitation
materials that it receives and shall assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to
conduct the proxy voting process.

3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-Advisor
will not consult with any other investment advisory firm that provides
investment advisory services to any investment company sponsored by
Principal Life Insurance Company regarding transactions for the Fund in
securities or other assets.

4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations assumed by
the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the Fund, the Manager shall pay
the compensation specified in Appendix A to this Agreement.



5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers, employees,
agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager, the Fund or its
shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or the Fund resulting
from any error of judgment made in the good faith exercise of the
Sub-Advisor's duties under this Agreement or as a result of the failure by
the Manager or any of its affiliates to comply with the terms of this
Agreement except for losses resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith
or gross negligence of, or from reckless disregard of, the duties of the
Sub-Advisor or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents
(excluding any broker-dealer selected by the Sub-Advisor), or affiliates.

6.	Indemnification

The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Sub-Advisor from and
against any and all claims, losses, liabilities or damages (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and other related expenses), (Losses)
howsoever arising, from or in connection with this Agreement or the
performance by the Sub-Advisor of its duties hereunder, so long as the
Sub-Advisor shall, after receipt of notice of any claim or commencement of
any action, promptly notify the Manager in writing of the claim or
commencement of such action.  The Manager shall not be liable for any
settlement of any claim or action effected without its written consent.
Nothing contained herein shall require the Manager to indemnify the Sub-
Advisor for Losses resulting from the Sub-Advisor's willful misfeasance,
bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or from its
reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.

7.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other persons affiliated
with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third parties to better enable
the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement for the
provision of certain personnel and facilities to the Sub- Advisor, subject
to written notification to and approval of the Manager and, where required
by applicable law, the Board of Directors of the Fund.

having jurisdiction over the services provided pursuant to this Agreement
any information, reports or other material which any such body may request
or require pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.

9.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement

unless otherwise terminated, shall continue in effect for a period of two
years and thereafter from year to year provided that the continuance is
specifically approved at least annually either by the Board of Directors

cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such
approval.

If the shareholders of a Series fail to approve the Agreement or any
continuance of the Agreement in accordance with the requirements of the
1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor will continue to act as Sub-Advisor with respect
to the Series pending the required approval of the Agreement or its
continuance or of any contract with the Sub-Advisor or a different manager
or Sub-Advisor or other definitive action; provided, that the compensation
received by the Sub-Advisor in respect to the Series during such period is
in compliance with Rule 15a-4 under the 1940 Act.

This Agreement may be terminated at any time without the payment of any
penalty by the Board of Directors of the Fund or by the Sub-Advisor, the

Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and services to be provided

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the Manager
hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser to perform the services described in
Section 2 below for investment and reinvestment of the securities and other
assets of each Series, subject to the control and direction of the Manager
and the Fund's Board of Directors, for the period and on the terms
hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Adviser accepts such appointment and agrees
to furnish the services hereinafter set forth for the compensation herein
provided. The Sub-Adviser shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an
independent contractor and shall, except as expressly provided or
authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the Fund or the
Manager in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or the
Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Adviser

		The Sub-Adviser will:

(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited to
research, advice and supervision for each Series.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval (or any
appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from time to time as
conditions require, a recommended investment program for each Series
consistent with each Series investment objective and policies.

(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing orders for the
purchase and sale of securities without prior consultation with the Manager
and without regard to the length of time the securities have been held, the
resulting rate of portfolio turnover or any tax considerations, subject
always to the provisions of the Fund's registration statement, Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws and the requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of
the same shall be from time to time in effect.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the officers,
in taking such steps as are necessary or appropriate to carry out the
decisions of its Board of Directors, and any appropriate committees of such
Board, regarding the general conduct of the investment business of each
Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Adviser's investment advisory services
obligations, compliance with the 1940 Act and the regulations adopted by
the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder and the Series'
investment strategies and restrictions as stated in the Fund's prospectus
and statement of additional information.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and in such
detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem appropriate in order
to enable it to determine that the investment policies, procedures and
approved investment program of each Series are being observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide assistance and recommendations for the determination

not readily available for purposes of calculating net asset value in

facilities, including salaries of clerical and other personnel required for
it to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities,
including bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment necessary for the

(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission merchants
(broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all transactions for
each Series, place all necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers
(including affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if
applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell
orders for each Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or
sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Adviser. In such event allocation
of securities so sold or purchased, as well as the expenses incurred in the
transaction, will be made by the Sub-Adviser in the manner the Sub-Adviser
considers to be the most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Fund and to other clients.  The Sub-Adviser will report
on such allocations at the request of the Manager, the Fund or the Fund's
Board of Directors providing such information as the number of aggregated
trades to which each Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such
trades were directed and the basis for the allocation for the aggregated
trades.  The Sub-Adviser shall use its best efforts to obtain execution of
transactions for each Series at prices which are advantageous to the Series

basis that they provide brokerage, research or other services or products
to the Sub-Adviser. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-
Adviser may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a
securities transaction in excess of the amount of commission or dealer
spread another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that
transaction if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of
commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and
research products and/or services provided by such broker or dealer. This
determination, with respect to brokerage and research products and/or
services, may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or
the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates have
with respect to each Series as well as to accounts over which they exercise
investment discretion. Not all such services or products need be used by
the Sub-Adviser in managing the Series.  In addition, joint repurchase or
other accounts may not be utilized by the Series except to the extent
permitted under any exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Adviser provided
that all conditions of such order are complied with.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to each Series
as are required of an investment advisor of a registered investment company
pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the
Investment Advisers Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund
and the Manager with such periodic and special reports as the Fund or
Manager may reasonably request.  In compliance with the requirements of
Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that all
records that it maintains for each Series are the property of the Fund,
agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940
Act any records that it maintains for the Series and that are required to
be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to
surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it maintains for a Series
upon request by the Fund or the Manager.  The Sub-Adviser has no
responsibility for the maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is
directly related to the services the Sub-Adviser provides to a Series.

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the Sub-Adviser's
Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as the same may be amended
from time to time.  The Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-
Adviser's current Code of Ethics.  Sub-Adviser shall promptly forward to
the Manager a copy of any material amendment to the Sub-Adviser's Code of
Ethics along with certification that the Sub-Adviser has implemented
procedures for administering the Sub-Adviser's Code of Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request, furnish the
requesting party reports on portfolio transactions and reports on
investments held by a Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the Fund
may reasonably request.  The Sub-Adviser will make available its officers
and employees to meet with the Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's
principal place of business on due notice to review the investments of a
Series.

may be required for the Fund or the Manager to comply with their respective
obligations under applicable laws, including, without limitation, the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the
Investment Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and any rule or
regulation thereunder.

(n)	Perform quarterly and annual tax compliance tests to monitor each Series'
compliance with Subchapter M of the Code.  The Sub-Adviser shall notify the
Manager immediately upon having a reasonable basis for believing that a
Series has ceased to be in compliance or that it might not be in compliance
in the future.  If it is determined that a Series is not in compliance with
the requirements noted above, the Sub-Adviser, in consultation with the
Manager, will take prompt action to bring the Series back into compliance
(to the extent possible) within the time permitted under the Code.

(o)	Provide a copy of the Sub-Adviser's Form ADV and any amendments thereto
contemporaneously with the filing of such documents with the Securities and
Exchange Commission or other regulatory agency.

(p)	Vote proxies received on behalf of the Series in a manner consistent
with Sub-Adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures and provide a
record of votes cast containing all of the voting information required by
Form N-PX in an electronic format to enable the Series to file Form N-PX as
required by SEC rule.

(q)	Respond to tender offers, rights offerings and other voluntary
corporate action requests affecting securities held by the Fund and
complete and file notices of claims in connection with class action
lawsuits concerning securities owned by the Fund.

the Sub-Adviser hereunder with respect to each Series, the Manager shall
pay the compensation specified in Appendix A to this Agreement.

     5.	Liability of Sub-Adviser

Neither the Sub-Adviser nor any of its directors, officers, employees,
agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager, the Fund or its
shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or the Fund resulting
from any error of judgment made in the good faith exercise of the
Sub-Adviser's investment discretion in connection with selecting
investments for a Series or as a result of the failure by the Manager or
any of its affiliates to comply with the terms of this Agreement, except
for losses resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence of, or from reckless disregard of, the duties of the Sub-Adviser
or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, or affiliates.



     6.	Supplemental Arrangements

APPENDIX A

CCI shall serve as investment sub-adviser for each Series identified below.
The Manager will pay CCI, as full compensation for all services provided
under this Agreement, a fee, computed and paid monthly, at an annual rate as
shown below of the Series' net assets managed by CCI as of the first day of
each month allocated to CCI's management.

In calculating the fee for a series included in the table, assets of any
unregistered separate account of Principal Life Insurance Company and any
investment company sponsored by Principal Life Insurance Company to which
CCI provides investment advisory services and which have the same investment
mandate (e.g. LargeCap Growth) as the series for which the fee is
calculated, will be combined with the assets of the series to arrive at net
assets.

If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates before the end of any
month, the fee (if any) for the period from the effective date to the end of
such month or from the beginning of such month to the date of termination,
as the case may be, shall be prorated according to the proportion which such
period bears to the full month in which such effectiveness or termination
occurs.

PRINCIPAL  FUNDS, INC.
SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT
 SMALLCAP GROWTH FUND II


AGREEMENT executed as of the 1st day of July, 2009, by and between
PRINCIPAL MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, an Iowa Corporation (hereinafter
called the Manager) and EMERALD ADVISORS, INC. (Emerald)
(hereinafter called the Sub-Advisor).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to Principal
 Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end management investment company
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
1940 Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it
with portfolio selection and related research and statistical services
in connection with the investment advisory services for the   SmallCap
Growth Fund II of the Fund (hereinafter called the Series), which the
Manager has agreed to provide to the Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires
to furnish such services; and

WHEREAS, the Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies properly
certified or authenticated of each of the following and will promptly
provide the Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or authenticated
of any amendment or supplement thereto:

 	(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement) between the
Manager and the Fund;

 	(b)	The Fund's registration statement as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the Registration Statement);

 	(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the
Board of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and services
provided by the Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the Manager
hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the services described in
Section 2 below for investment and reinvestment of the securities and
other assets of the Series, subject to the control and direction of the
Fund's Board of Directors, for the period and on the terms hereinafter
set forth. The Sub-Advisor accepts such appointment and agrees to
furnish the services hereinafter set forth for the compensation herein
provided. The Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be
an independent contractor and shall, except as expressly provided or
authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the Fund or the
Manager in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or the
Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited to
research, advice and supervision, for the Series.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund (or any appropriate
committee of such Board), and revise from time to time as conditions
require, a recommended investment program for the portfolio of the
Series consistent with the Series' investment objective and policies as
set forth in the Registration Statement, as may be amended from time to
time.

c)	Implement such of its recommended investment program as the Board of
Directors (or any appropriate committee of the Board) shall approve, by
placing orders for the purchase and sale of securities, subject always
to the provisions of the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and
the requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same shall be from time
to time in effect.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as reasonably
requested by the officers, in taking such steps as are necessary or
appropriate to carry out the decisions of its Board of Directors, and
any appropriate committees of such Board, regarding the general conduct
of the investment business of the Series.

(e)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and in
such detail as the Board of Directors may deem appropriate in order to
enable it to determine that the investment policies, procedures and
approved investment program of the Series are being observed.

(f)	Upon reasonable request, provide assistance and recommendations
for the determination of the fair value of certain securities when
market quotations are not readily available for purposes of calculating
net asset value in accordance with procedures and methods established by
the Fund's Board of Directors.

(g)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and
management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other
personnel required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii)
administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical personnel and
equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of the investment advisory
affairs of the Series. Except for expenses specifically assumed or
agreed to be paid by the Sub-Advisor under this Agreement, the Sub-
Advisor shall not be liable for any expenses of the Manager, the Fund or
the Series including, without limitation, (i) interest and taxes, (ii)
brokerage commissions and other costs in connection with the purchase or
sale of securities or other investment instruments with respect to the
Series, and (iii) custodian fees and expenses.

(h)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and future commission merchants
(broker-dealers), select brokers and dealers to effect all
transactions for the Series (which may include brokers or dealers
affiliated with the Sub-Advisor, provided such transactions comply with
applicable requirements under the 1940 Act), place all necessary orders
with brokers, dealers, or issuers, and negotiate brokerage commissions,
if applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or
sell orders for the Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous
purchase or sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor.  In such
event, allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as the
expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Sub-Advisor in
a manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be equitable and consistent with
its fiduciary obligations to the Series and to other clients.  The Sub-
Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain execution of transactions
for the Fund at prices that are advantageous to the Fund and at
commission rates that are reasonable in relation to the benefits
received.  In doing so, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on
the basis that they also provide brokerage, research or other services
or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable
law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission
for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount of
commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would have charged
for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good
faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the
value of the brokerage and research products and/or services provided by
such broker or dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and
research products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either that
particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-
Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to the Series as well as to
accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Not all such
services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the
Series.  In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be
utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under any
exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor and provided that all
conditions of such order are complied with.

(i)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the
Series as are required of an investment adviser of a registered
investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment Advisers Act
of 1940, as amended,  (the Investment Advisers Act), and the rules
thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with such periodic and
special reports as the Fund or Manager may reasonably request.  In
compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the
Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it maintains for the
Series are the property of the Fund and it will surrender promptly to
the Fund any records that it maintains for the Series upon request by
the Fund or the Manager provided, however, that the Sub-Advisor may
retain a copy of such records.  The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility
for the maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is directly
related to the services provided to the Series.

(j)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the
Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as the same
may be amended from time to time.  The Manager acknowledges receipt of a
copy of Sub-Advisor's current Code of Ethics.  The Sub-Advisor shall
promptly forward to the Manager a copy of any material amendments to the
Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics.

(k)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may reasonably
request, furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio transactions
and reports on investments held by the Series, all in such detail as the
Manager or the Fund may reasonably request.  The Sub-Advisor will make
available its officers and employees to meet with the Fund's Board of
Directors at reasonable times at the Fund's principal place of business
upon reasonable notice to review the investments of the Series.

(l)	Provide such information as may be required for the Fund or the
Manager to comply with their respective obligations under applicable
laws, including, without limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act, the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and any state
securities laws, and any rule or regulation thereunder.

(m)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment advisory
services obligations provided hereunder, compliance with the 1940 Act
and the regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission
thereunder and each Series' investment strategies and restrictions as
stated in the Series' current prospectus and statement of additional
information.

(n)	Provide to the Manager a copy of its Form ADV as filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, as amended from time to time, and a
list of the persons whom the Sub-Advisor wishes to have authorized to
give written and/or oral instructions to custodians of assets of the
Series.

3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-Advisor
will not consult with any other investment advisory firm that provides
investment sub-advisory services to the Fund or a fund that is under
common control with the Fund regarding transactions for the Fund in the
securities or other assets allocated to the Sub-Advisor pursuant to this
Agreement, except as permitted by Rule 12d-3-1 under the 1940 Act.

4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations assumed
by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the Series, the Manager
shall pay the compensation specified in Appendix A to this Agreement.
Although the Manager may from time to time waive the compensation it is
entitled to receive from the Series, such waiver will have no effect on
the Manager's obligation to pay the Sub-Advisor the compensation
provided for herein.



5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers or employees
shall be liable to the Manager, the Fund, the Series or any shareholder
of the Fund for any loss suffered by the Manager, the Fund, the Series
or any shareholder of the Fund resulting from any error of judgment made
in the good faith exercise of the Sub-Advisor's investment discretion in
connection with selecting investments for the Series except for losses
resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of, or
from reckless disregard of, the duties of the Sub-Advisor or any of its
directors, officers or employees. The Manager shall hold harmless and
indemnify the Sub-Advisor for any loss, liability, cost, damage or
expense (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs) arising from any
claim or demand by any past or present shareholder of the Series or the
Fund that is not based upon the obligations of the Sub-Advisor with
respect to the Series under this Agreement. The Manager acknowledges and
agrees that the Sub-Advisor makes no representation or warranty, express
or implied, that any level of performance or investment results will be
achieved by the Series or that the Series will perform comparably with
any standard or index, including other clients of the Sub-Advisor,
whether public or private.

6.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other persons
affiliated with the Sub-Advisor for the provision of certain personnel
and facilities to the Sub-Advisor to better enable it to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement.

7.	Regulation

The Sub-Advisor shall submit to all regulatory and administrative bodies
having jurisdiction over the services provided pursuant to this
Agreement any information, reports or other material which any such body
may request or require pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.

8.	Manager's Representations

The Manager represents and warrants that (i) it is registered as an
investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act and will continue
to be so registered for so long as this Agreement remains in effect;
(ii) it is not prohibited by the 1940 Act or the Investment Advisers Act
from performing the services contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) it
has met, and will continue to meet for so long as this Agreement remains
in effect, any applicable federal or state requirements, or the
applicable requirements of any regulatory or industry self-regulatory

contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) it has the authority to enter into
and perform the services contemplated by this Agreement, and (v) it will
immediately notify the Sub-Advisor of the occurrence of any event that
would disqualify the Manager from serving as an investment advisor of an
investment company pursuant to Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act or
otherwise.

9.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement

This Agreement shall become effective as of the date of execution and,
unless otherwise terminated, shall continue in effect thereafter from
year to year provided that the continuance is specifically approved at
least annually either by the Board of Directors of the Fund or by a vote
of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Series and in
either event by a vote of a majority of the directors of the Fund who
are not interested persons of the Manager, Principal Life Insurance
Company, the Sub-Advisor or the Fund cast in person at a meeting called
for the purpose of voting on such approval.

If the shareholders of the Account fail to approve the Agreement or any
continuance of the Agreement in accordance with the requirements of the
1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor will continue to act as Sub-Advisor with
respect to the Account pending the required approval of the Agreement or
its continuance or of any contract with the Sub-Advisor or a different
manager or sub-advisor or other definitive action; provided, that the
compensation received by the Sub-Advisor in respect to the Account
during such period is in compliance with Rule 15a-4 under the 1940 Act.

This Agreement may, on sixty days written notice, be terminated at any
time without the payment of any penalty, by the Board of Directors of
the Fund, the Sub-Advisor or the Manager or by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Series.  This Agreement shall
automatically terminate in the event of its assignment or upon

APPENDIX A


The Sub-Advisor shall serve as investment sub-advisor for the Series.
With respect to the Series, the Manager will pay the Sub-Advisor, as
full compensation for all services provided under this Agreement, a fee
computed at an annual rate as follows (the Sub-Advisor Percentage"
"36059","Fee):

SmallCap Growth Fund II

				Net Asset Value of Fund
	Sub-Advisor Percentage Fee

				First $200 million		    0.50%
				Over $200 million		    0.45%


In calculating the fee for the Series, assets of any unregistered
separate account of Principal Life Insurance Company and any investment
company sponsored by Principal Life Insurance Company to which the Sub-
Advisor provides investment advisory services and which have the same
investment mandate as the Series, will be combined (together, the
Aggregated Assets).  The fee charged for the assets in the Series
shall be determined by calculating a fee on the value of the Aggregated
Assets and multiplying the aggregate fee by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the amount of assets in the Series and the denominator of which
is the amount of the Aggregated Assets.

The Sub-Advisor Percentage Fee shall be accrued for each calendar day
and the sum of the daily fee accruals shall be paid monthly to the
Sub-Advisor. The daily fee accruals will be computed by multiplying the
fraction of one over the number of calendar days in the year by the
applicable annual rate described above and multiplying this product by
the net assets of the Series as determined in accordance with the Fund's
prospectus and statement of additional information as of the close of
business on the previous business day on which the Series was open for
business.

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to each Fund of
the Principal  Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end management
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the 1940 Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it with
portfolio selection and related research and statistical services in
connection with the investment advisory services for each series
identified in Appendix A ( hereinafter called the Series), which the
Manager has agreed to provide to the Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to
furnish such services; and

WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies properly
certified or authenticated of each of the following and will promptly
provide the Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or authenticated of
any amendment or supplement thereto:

 	(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement) with the Fund;

 	(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

 	(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the Board
of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and services provided by
the Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the Manager
hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the services described in
Section 2 below for investment and reinvestment of the securities and
other assets of the Series, subject to the control and direction of the
Manager and the Fund's Board of Directors, for the period and on the terms
hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor accepts such appointment and agrees
to furnish the services hereinafter set forth for the compensation herein
provided. The Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an
independent contractor and shall, except as expressly provided or
authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the Fund or the
Manager in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or the
Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

		The Sub-Advisor will:

(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited to
research, advice and supervision for the Series.

(b)	Furnish or present to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval
(or any appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from time to time
as economic conditions require, a recommended investment program for the
Fund consistent with the Series' investment objective and policies.

(c)	In accordance with the approved investment program, identify
securities to purchase, select securities to sell, and execute
documentation for the purchase and sale of securities, and implement the
approved investment program by placing orders for the purchase and sale of
securities without prior consultation with the Manager and without regard
to (i) the length of time the securities have been held, (ii) the
resulting rate of portfolio turnover or (iii) any tax considerations,
subject always to the provisions of the Fund's Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws, the requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same shall be
from time to time in effect.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the
officers, in taking such steps as are reasonably necessary or appropriate
to carry out the decisions of its Board of Directors, and any appropriate
committees of such Board, regarding the general conduct of the investment
business of the Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment advisory
services provided to the Series, its compliance with the 1940 Act and the
regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder
and the Series' investment strategies and restrictions as stated in the
Fund's prospectus and statement of additional information, subject to
receipt of such additional information as may be required from the Manager
and provided in accordance with Section 12(d) of this Agreement. The Sub-
Advisor has no responsibility for the maintenance of Fund records except
insofar as is directly related to the services it provides to the Series.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and in
such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem appropriate in
order to enable it to determine that the investment policies, procedures
and approved investment program of the Series are being observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination of the fair
value of certain securities when reliable market quotations are not
readily available for purposes of calculating net asset value in
accordance with procedures and methods established by the Fund's Board of
Directors.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and
management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other personnel
employed by the Sub-Advisor required for it to execute its duties
hereunder, and (ii) administrative facilities, including bookkeeping,
clerical personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of
its duties under this Agreement.

(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission merchants
(broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all transactions for
the Series, place all necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers
(including affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if
applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell
orders for the Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or
sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation
of securities so sold or purchased, as well as the expenses incurred in
the transaction, will be made by the Sub-Advisor in accordance with its
allocation policies and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the
Fund and to other clients.  The Manager recognizes that, in some cases,
this procedure may limit the size of the position that may be acquired or
sold for the Series.  The Sub-Advisor will report on such allocations at
the request of the Manager, the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors
providing such information as the number of aggregated trades to which the
Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades were directed
and the basis for the allocation for the aggregated trades.  The Sub-
Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain execution of transactions for
the Series at prices which are advantageous to the Series and at
commission rates that are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.
However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the basis that
they provide brokerage, research or other services or products to the Sub-
Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may
pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a securities
transaction in excess of the amount of commission or dealer spread another
broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the
Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that such amount of commission is
reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research products
and/or services provided by such broker or dealer. This determination,
with respect to brokerage and research products and/or services, may be
viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall
responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with
respect to the Series as well as to accounts over which they exercise
investment discretion. Not all such services or products need be used by
the Sub-Advisor in managing the Series. In addition, joint repurchase or
other accounts may not be utilized by the Series except to the extent
permitted under any exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided
that all conditions of such order are complied with.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the Series
as are required of an investment advisor of a registered investment
company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment Advisor's Act of 1940 (the
Investment Advisor's Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the
Fund and the Manager with such periodic and special reports as the Fund or
Manager may reasonably request.  In compliance with the requirements of
Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all
records that it maintains for the Series are the property of the Fund,
agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940
Act any records that it maintains for the Fund and that are required to be
maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to
surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it maintains for the
Series upon request by the Fund or the Manager.

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the Sub-
Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as the same may be
amended from time to time.  The Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy of
Sub-Advisor's current Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward
to the Manager a copy of any material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code
of Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request, furnish the
requesting party reports on portfolio transactions and reports on
investments held by the Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the
Fund may reasonably request.  The Sub-Advisor will make available its
officers and employees to meet with the Fund's Board of Directors at the
Fund's principal place of business on due notice to review the investments
of the Series.

(m)	Provide such information as is reasonably requested by the Fund or
Manager and required for the Fund or the Manager to comply with their
respective obligations under applicable laws, including, without
limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code),
the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and any
rule or regulation thereunder.  Manager acknowledges receipt of Sub-
Advisor's Form ADV more than 48 hours prior to the execution of this
Agreement.

(n)	Cooperate with the Manager in its performance of quarterly and annual
tax compliance tests to monitor the Series' compliance with Subchapter M
of the Code and Section 817(h) of the Code.  If it is determined by the
Manager or its tax advisors that the Series is not in compliance with the
requirements noted above, the Sub-Advisor, in consultation with the
Manager and its tax advisors, will take prompt action to bring the Series
back into compliance (to the extent possible) within the time permitted
under the Code.

(o)	Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies solicited by,
or with respect to, the issuers of securities held in the Series.  The
Manager shall cause to be forwarded to Sub-Advisor all proxy solicitation
materials that it receives and shall assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to
conduct the proxy voting process.

(p)	Have the authority to exercise, on behalf of the Fund and/or Series,
rights and remedies associated with securities held by the Series,
including right to petition to place an obligor or issuer in bankruptcy
proceedings, voting to accelerate the maturity of an asset, waiving any
default or amending any credit documentation.

(q)	Have the authority to execute trade confirmations, trade tickets,
purchase orders, assignment agreements, engagement letters, amendments,
forbearance agreements and all other documents related to the purchase,
sale, amendment or restructuring of assets of the Series, and shall have
the authority to direct the Custodian (defined below) to perform any and
all actions necessary in order to consummate or effectuate any such
purchase, sale or other action.

3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-Advisor
will not consult with any other investment advisory firm that provides
investment advisory services to any investment company sponsored by
Principal Life Insurance Company regarding transactions for the Fund in
securities or other assets.

4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations assumed by
the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the Fund, the Manager shall pay
the compensation specified in Appendix A to this Agreement.



5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers, employees,
agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager, the Fund or its
shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or the Fund resulting
from any error of judgment made in the good faith exercise of the
Sub-Advisor's duties under this Agreement or as a result of the failure by
the Manager or any of its affiliates to comply with the terms of this
Agreement except for losses resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith
or gross negligence of, or from reckless disregard of, the duties of the
Sub-Advisor or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents
(excluding any broker-dealer selected by the Sub-Advisor), or affiliates.

6.	Indemnification

The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Sub-Advisor from and
against any and all claims, losses, liabilities or damages (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and other related expenses), (Losses)
howsoever arising, from or in connection with this Agreement or the
performance by the Sub-Advisor of its duties hereunder.  The Sub-Advisor
shall, after receipt of notice of any claim or commencement of any action,
promptly notify the Manager in writing of the claim or commencement of
such action; provided any failure to so notify the Manager shall not
affect the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder.   The Manager
shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim or action effected
without its written consent.  Nothing contained herein shall require the
Manager to indemnify the Sub-Advisor for Losses resulting from the Sub-
Advisor's willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the
performance of its duties or from its reckless disregard of its
obligations and duties under this Agreement.  In addition, while the Sub-
Adviser, in accordance with section 2(h), shall bear its own expenses
incurred in the performance of its duties hereunder, it shall not be
responsible for any costs or expenses of the Manager or the Fund,
including without limitation the fees or expenses of attorneys or other
professionals engaged on behalf of the Manager or the Fund in connection
with the bankruptcy of, or general negotiations surrounding the
restructuring of, Securities or other assets of the Series, irrespective
of whether such engagement was entered into by the Manager or the Fund, or
the Sub-Advisor  with written permission from the Manager, on behalf of
the Fund.

7.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other persons affiliated
with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third parties to better enable
the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement for the
provision of certain personnel and facilities to the Sub- Advisor, subject
to written notification to and approval of the Manager and, where required
by applicable law, the Board of Directors of the Fund.

PRINCIPAL  FUNDS, INC.
AMENDED AND RESTATED SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT
SMALLCAP VALUE FUND II AND
 MIDCAP VALUE FUND I

AGREEMENT executed as of May 1, 2009, by and between PRINCIPAL
MANAGEMENT CORPORATION (hereinafter called the Manager), and LOS
ANGELES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND EQUITY RESEARCH, INC. (LA Capital)
(hereinafter called the Sub-Advisor).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to each
Series of Principal  Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end management
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the 1940 Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it
with investment advisory services with respect to assets allocated by
the Manager for management by the Sub-Adviser for a portion of the
portfolios of the  SmallCap Value Fund II and  MidCap Value Fund I of
the Fund (each hereinafter called the Series), which the Manager has
agreed to provide to the Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to furnish
such services; and

WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies properly
certified or authenticated of each of the following and will promptly
provide the Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or authenticated
of any amendment or supplement thereto:

	(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement) with the Fund;

	(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

	(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the
Board of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and services to
be provided by the Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the Manager
hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to act as the Manager's agent and
attorney-in-fact with respect to the investment and reinvestment of
assets in the Series with full power and authority to direct any
custodian of the assets of the Series to purchase, sell or exchange any
stocks, bonds, or other securities or such other assets which are
acceptable to the Sub-Advisor (individually, security and
collectively, securities) and to issue directly to a broker or dealer
such orders for the purchase, sale or exchange of securities or other
property, as the Sub-Advisor may deem appropriate and without prior
consultation with the Manager, subject to the control and direction of
the Manager and the Fund's Board of Directors, for the period and on the
terms hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor accepts such appointment
and agrees to furnish the services hereinafter set forth for the
compensation herein provided. The Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes
herein be deemed to be an independent contractor and shall, except as
expressly provided or authorized, have no authority to act for or
represent the Fund or the Manager in any way or otherwise be deemed an
agent of the Fund or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

		The Sub-Advisor will:

(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited to
research, advice and supervision for the Series.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval (or any
appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from time to time as
conditions require, a recommended investment program for the Series
consistent with each Series investment objective and policies.

(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing orders for the
purchase and sale of securities without prior consultation with the
Manager and without regard to the length of time the securities have
been held, the resulting rate of portfolio turnover or any tax
considerations, subject always to the provisions of the Fund's
registration statement, Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and the
requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same shall be from time to
time in effect.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the
officers, in taking such steps as are necessary or appropriate to carry
out the decisions of its Board of Directors, and any appropriate
committees of such Board, regarding the general conduct of the
investment business of the Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment advisory
services obligations, compliance with the 1940 Act and the regulations
adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder and the
Series' investment strategies and restrictions as stated in the Fund's
prospectus and statement of additional information.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and in
such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem appropriate in
order to enable it to determine that the investment policies, procedures
and approved investment program of the Series are being observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide assistance and recommendations for the
determination of the fair value of certain securities when reliable
market quotations are not readily available for purposes of calculating
net asset value in accordance with procedures and methods established by
the Fund's Board of Directors.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and
management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other
personnel required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii)
administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical personnel and
equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of the investment advisory
affairs of the Series. Except for expenses specifically assumed or
agreed to be paid by the Sub-Advisor under this Agreement, the Sub-
Advisor shall not be liable for any expenses of the Manager, the Fund or
the Series including, without limitation, (i) interest and taxes, (ii)
brokerage commissions and other costs in connection with the purchase or
sale of securities or other investment instruments with respect to the
Series, and (iii) custodian fees and expenses.

(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission merchants
(broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all transactions for
the Series, place all necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers
(including affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if
applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or
sell orders for the Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous
purchase or sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such
event allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as the
expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Sub-Advisor in
the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the most equitable and
consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other
clients.  The Sub-Advisor will report on such allocations at the request
of the Manager, the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors providing such
information as the number of aggregated trades to which the Series was a
party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades were directed and the
basis for the allocation for the aggregated trades.  The Sub-Advisor
shall use its best efforts to obtain execution of transactions for the
Series at prices which are advantageous to the Series and at commission
rates that are reasonable in relation to the benefits received. However,
the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the basis that they
provide brokerage, research or other services or products to the Sub-
Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor
may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a
securities transaction in excess of the amount of commission or dealer
spread another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that
transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that such amount
of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage
and research products and/or services provided by such broker or dealer.
This determination, with respect to brokerage and research products
and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either that particular
transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and
its affiliates have with respect to the Series as well as to accounts
over which they exercise investment discretion. Not all such services or
products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the Series.  In
addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized by the
Series except to the extent permitted under any exemptive order obtained
by the Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions of such order are
complied with.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the Series
as are required of an investment advisor of a registered investment
company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment Advisers Act of 1940
(the Investment Advisers Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish
the Fund and the Manager with such periodic and special reports as the
Fund or Manager may reasonably request.  In compliance with the
requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby
agrees that all records that it maintains for the Series are the
property of the Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by
Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains for the
Series and that are required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the
1940 Act, and further agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any
records that it maintains for a Series upon request by the Fund or the
Manager. The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility for the maintenance of
Fund records except insofar as is directly related to the services the
Sub-Advisor provides to a Series.

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the Sub-
Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as the same may
be amended from time to time.  The Manager acknowledges receipt of a
copy of Sub-Advisor's current Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall
promptly forward to the Manager a copy of any material amendment to the
Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics along with certification that the Sub-
Advisor has implemented procedures for administering the Sub-Advisor's
Code of Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request, furnish
the requesting party reports on portfolio transactions and reports on
investments held by a Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the
Fund may reasonably request.  The Sub-Advisor will make available its
officers and employees to meet with the Fund's Board of Directors at the
Fund's principal place of business on due notice to review the
investments of a Series.

(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-
advisor and may be required for the Fund or the Manager to comply with
their respective obligations under applicable laws, including, without
limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code),
the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and
any rule or regulation thereunder.



(n)	Vote proxies received on behalf of the Series in a manner
consistent with Sub-Advisor's proxy voting policies and procedures and
provide a record of votes cast containing all of the voting information
required by Form N-PX in an electronic format to enable the Series to
file Form N-PX as required by SEC rule.

(o)	Respond to tender offers, rights offerings and other voluntary
corporate action requests affecting securities held by the Fund and
complete and file notices of claims in connection with class action
lawsuits concerning securities owned by the Fund.

3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-Advisor
will not consult with any other investment advisory firm that provides
investment sub-advisory services to the Fund or a fund that is under
common control with the Fund regarding transactions for the Fund in the
securities or other assets allocated to the Sub-Advisor pursuant to this
Agreement, except as provided by Rule 12d-3-1 under the 1940 Act.

	4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations assumed
by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the Series, the Manager
shall pay the compensation specified in Appendix A to this Agreement.

5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers, employees,
agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager, the Fund or its
shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or the Fund resulting
from any error of judgment made in the good faith exercise of the Sub-
Advisor's investment discretion in connection with selecting investments
for a Series or as a result of the failure by the Manager or any of its
affiliates to comply with the terms of this Agreement and/or insurance
laws and rules except for losses resulting from willful misfeasance, bad
faith or gross negligence of, or from reckless disregard of, the duties
of the Sub-Advisor or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents,
or affiliates.  The Sub-Advisor shall not have any responsibilities with
respect to any assets of the Fund other than the Series.  The Manager
shall not be responsible for any loss incurred by reason of any act or
omission of any dealer or broker, or the Manager, or any custodian.

The Sub-Advisor shall be responsible only for managing the Series in
good faith and in accordance with the investment objectives, fundamental
policies and restrictions, and shall have no responsibility whatsoever
for, and shall incur no liability on account of (i) selection or
establishment of such investment objectives, fundamental policies and
restrictions (ii) advice on, or management of, any other assets for
Manager or the Fund, (iii) filing of any tax or information returns or
forms, withholding or paying any taxes, or seeking any exemption or
refund for the Manager or the Fund, (iv) registration of the Fund or
Series with any government or agency, or (v) administration of the plans
and trusts investing through the Fund, (vi) overall Fund compliance with
the requirements of the 1940 Act, which requirements are outside of the
Sub-Advisor's control, and any requirements of Subchapter M of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which are outside of the Sub-
Advisor's control and shall be indemnified and held harmless by Manager
for any loss in carrying out the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
including reasonable attorney's fees, indemnification to the Fund, or
any shareholder thereof and, brokers and commission merchants, fines,
taxes, penalties and interest.  Sub-Advisor, however, shall be liable
for any liability, damages, or expenses of Manager or the Fund arising
out of the negligence, malfeasance or violation of applicable law by any
of its employees in providing investment management services under this
Agreement; and, in such cases, the indemnification by Manager, referred
to above, shall be inapplicable, and the Sub-Advisor shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Fund and Manager for any loss arising therefrom.

6.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other persons
affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third parties to
better enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations under this
Agreement for the provision of certain personnel and facilities to the
Sub-Advisor, subject to written notification to and approval of the
Manager and, where required by applicable law, the Board of Directors of
the Fund.

otherwise.

"36536","2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor"
"36537","		The Sub-Advisor will:"
"36538","(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited to"

"36540","(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval (or any"
"36541","appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from time to time as"

"36544","(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing orders for the"
"36545","purchase and sale of securities without prior consultation with the"
"36546","Manager and without regard to the length of time the securities have been"
"36547","held, the resulting rate of portfolio turnover or any tax considerations,"
"36548","subject always to the provisions of the Fund's Articles of Incorporation"
"36549","and Bylaws, the requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same shall be"
"36550","from time to time in effect."
"36551","(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the"
"36552","officers, in taking such steps as are reasonably necessary or appropriate"
"36553","to carry out the decisions of its Board of Directors, and any appropriate"

"36555","business of the Series."
"36556","(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment advisory"
"36557","services provided to the Series, its compliance with the 1940 Act and the"
"36558","regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder"
"36559","and the Series' investment strategies and restrictions as stated in the"
"36560","Fund's prospectus and statement of additional information, subject to"
"36561","receipt of such additional information as may be required from the Manager"
"36562","and provided in accordance with Section 11(d) of this Agreement. The Sub-"
"36563","Advisor has no responsibility for the maintenance of Fund records except"
"36564","insofar as is directly related to the services it provides to the Series."
"36565","(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and in such"
"36566","detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem appropriate in order"
"36567","to enable it to determine that the investment policies, procedures and"
"36568","approved investment program of the Series are being observed."
"36569","(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination of the fair value"
"36570","of certain securities when reliable market quotations are not readily"
"36571","available for purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance with"
"36572","procedures and methods established by the Fund's Board of Directors."
"36573","(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and"
"36574","management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other personnel"
"36575","required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii) administrative"
"36576","facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment"
"36577","necessary for the efficient conduct of its duties under this Agreement."
"36578","(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission merchants"
"36579","(broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all transactions for"
"36580","the Series, place all necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers"
"36581","(including affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if"
"36582","applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell"
"36583","orders for the Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or"
"36584","sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation"
"36585","of securities so sold or purchased, as well as the expenses incurred in"
"36586","the transaction, will be made by the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-"
"36587","Advisor considers to be the most equitable and consistent with its"
"36588","fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients.  The Manager"
"36589","recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure may limit the size of the"
"36590","position that may be acquired or sold for the Series.  The Sub-Advisor"
"36591","will report on such allocations at the request of the Manager, the Fund or"
"36592","the Fund's Board of Directors providing such information as the number of"
"36593","aggregated trades to which the Series was a party, the broker-dealers to"
"36594","whom such trades were directed and the basis for the allocation for the"
"36595","aggregated trades.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain"
"36596","execution of transactions for the Series at prices which are advantageous"
"36597","to the Series and at commission rates that are reasonable in relation to"
"36598","the benefits received. However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or"
"36599","dealers on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or other"
"36600","services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with"
"36601","applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of"
"36602","commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount"
"36603","of commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would have charged"
"36604","for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith"
"36605","that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of"
"36606","the brokerage and research products and/or services provided by such"
"36607","broker or dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and"
"36608","research products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either that"
"36609","particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-"
"36610","Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to the Series as well as to"
"36611","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Not all such"
"36612","services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the"
"36613","Series. In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be"
"36614","utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under any exemptive"
"36615","order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions of such"
"36616","order are complied with. The Sub-advisor has no obligation to seek to"
"36617","obtain any material non-public (inside) information about any issuer or"
"36618","securities, and will not purchase or sell for the Series the securities of"
"36619","any issuer on the basis of any inside information known by Sub-advisor."
"36620","The Manager recognizes that the Sub-advisor shall not be the Custodian nor"
"36621","be considered to have custody of the Series' holdings as that term is"
"36622","used in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Sub-advisor may issue"
"36623","such instructions to the Custodian as Sub-advisor deems appropriate to"
"36624","settle Series transactions. Notices of transactions executed by Sub-"
"36625","advisor will be sent promptly to the Custodian. The Manager represents"
"36626","that the custodial agreement with the Fund's Custodian requires that the"
"36627","Custodian provide the Fund, at least quarterly, with a statement detailing"
"36628","all monies disbursed from the custodial account, including all monies paid"
"36629","to the Sub-advisor."
"36630","(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the Series as"
"36631","are required of an investment advisor of a registered investment company"
"36632","pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment Advisor's Act of 1940 (the"
"36633","Investment Advisor's Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the"
"36634","Fund and the Manager with such periodic and special reports as the Fund or"
"36635","Manager may reasonably request.  In compliance with the requirements of"
"36636","Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all"
"36637","records that it maintains for the Series are the property of the Fund,"
"36638","agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940"
"36639","Act any records that it maintains for the Fund and that are required to be"
"36640","maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to"
"36641","surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it maintains for the"
"36642","Series upon request by the Fund or the Manager. The Sub-Advisor shall be"
"36643","entitled to retain originals or copies of records pursuant to the"
"36644","requirements of applicable laws or regulations."
"36645","(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the Sub-"
"36646","Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as the same may be"
"36647","amended from time to time.  The Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy of"
"36648","Sub-Advisor's current Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward"
"36649","to the Manager a copy of any material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code"
"36650","of Ethics."
"36651","(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request, furnish the"
"36652","requesting party reports on portfolio transactions and reports on"
"36653","investments held by the Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the"
"36654","Fund may reasonably request.  The Sub-Advisor will make available its"
"36655","officers and employees to meet with the Fund's Board of Directors at the"
"36656","Fund's principal place of business on due notice to review the investments"
"36657","of the Series."
"36658","(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-advisor"
"36659","and may be required for the Fund or the Manager to comply with their"
"36660","respective obligations under applicable laws, including, without"
"36661","limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code),"
"36662","the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as"
"36663","amended (the Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and any"
"36664","rule or regulation thereunder.  Sub-Advisor will advise Manager of any"
"36665","changes in Sub-Advisor's general partners within a reasonable time after"
"36666","any such change.  Manager acknowledges receipt of Sub-Advisor's Form ADV"
"36667","more than 48 hours prior to the execution of this Agreement."
"36668","(n)	Perform quarterly and annual tax compliance tests to monitor the"
"36669","Series' compliance with Subchapter M of the Code and Section 817(h) of the"
"36670","Code, subject to receipt of such additional information as may be required"
"36671","from the Manager and provided in accordance with Section 11(d) of this"
"36672","Agreement.  The Sub-Advisor shall notify the Manager immediately upon"
"36673","having a reasonable basis for believing that the Series has ceased to be"
"36674","in compliance or that it might not be in compliance in the future.  If it"
"36675","is determined that the Series is not in compliance with the requirements"
"36676","noted above, the Sub-Advisor, in consultation with the Manager, will take"
"36677","prompt action to bring the Series back into compliance (to the extent"
"36678","possible) within the time permitted under the Code."
"36679","(o)	Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies solicited by, or"
"36680","with respect to, the issuers of securities held in the Series.  The"
"36681","Manager shall cause to be forwarded to Sub-Advisor all proxy solicitation"
"36682","materials that it receives and shall assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to"
"36683","conduct the proxy voting process."

"36693","investment advisory services to any investment company sponsored by"
"36694","Principal Life Insurance Company regarding transactions for the Fund in"
"36695","securities or other assets."
"36696","4.	Compensation"
"36697","As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations assumed by"

"37483","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"37484","research products and/or services provided by such broker or"
"37485","dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and"
"37486","research products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of"

"37852","no responsibility for the maintenance of Fund records except insofar as"
"37853","is directly related to the services provided to the Series. The Manager"
"37854","acknowledges that the Sub-Advisor is not the compliance agent for the"
"37855","Fund or the Manager, and does not have full access to all of the Fund's"
"37856","books and records necessary to perform certain compliance testing. To"
"37857","the extent that the Sub-Advisor has agreed to perform the services"
"37858","specified in this Section 2 in accordance with applicable law (including"
"37859","sub-chapters M and L of the Code, the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act"

"37861","upon its books and records with respect to the Fund, which comprise a"
"37862","portion of the Fund's books and records, and in accordance with written"
"37863","instructions received from the Fund or the Manager, if any, and shall"
"37864","not be held responsible under this Agreement so long as it performs such"
"37865","services in accordance with this Agreement and Applicable Law based upon"

"37867","Manager, and such materials provided by the Manager to the Sub-Advisor"
"37868","pursuant to Section 12(d) of this Agreement."
"37869","(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund on a quarterly and annual"
"37870","basis and in such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem"
"37871","appropriate in order to enable it to determine that the investment"
"37872","policies, procedures and approved investment program of the Series are"
"37873","being observed."
"37874","(g)	Upon request, provide reasonable assistance for the determination of"
"37875","the fair value of certain securities when reliable market quotations are"
"37876","not readily available for purposes of calculating net asset value in"
"37877","accordance with procedures and methods established by the Fund's Board of"
"37878","Directors, provided Pyramis shall not bear responsibility or liability for"
"37879","the determination or accuracy of the valuation of any securities and other"
"37880","assets of the Series."
"37881","(h)	Furnish, at its own expense for the provision of its services pursuant"
"37882","to this Agreement, (i) all necessary investment and management facilities,"
"37883","including salaries of clerical and other personnel required for it to"
"37884","execute its duties faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities,"
"37885","including bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment necessary for the"
"37886","efficient conduct of the investment advisory affairs of the Series"
"37887","(excluding brokerage expenses and pricing and bookkeeping services). The"
"37888","Sub-Advisor shall not be obligated to pay any expenses of the Manager, the"
"37889","Fund or the Series, including, without limitation: (a) interest and taxes;"
"37890","(b) brokerage commissions and other costs in connection with the purchase"
"37891","or sale of securities or other investment instruments of the Fund; and (c)"
"37892","custodian fees and expenses."
"37893","(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission merchants"
"37894","(broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all transactions for"
"37895","the Series, place all necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers"
"37896","(including affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if"
"37897","applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell"
"37898","orders for the Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or"
"37899","sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation"
"37900","of securities so sold or purchased, as well as the expenses incurred in"
"37901","the transaction, will be made by the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-"
"37902","Advisor considers to be the most equitable and consistent with its"
"37903","fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients.  The Sub-Advisor"
"37904","will report on such allocations at the request of the Manager, the Fund or"
"37905","the Fund's Board of Directors providing such information as the number of"
"37906","aggregated trades to which the Series was a party, the broker-dealers to"
"37907","whom such trades were directed and the basis for the allocation for the"
"37908","aggregated trades.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain"
"37909","execution of transactions for the Series at prices which are advantageous"
"37910","to the Series and at commission rates that are reasonable in relation to"
"37911","the benefits received. However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or"
"37912","dealers on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or other"
"37913","services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with"
"37914","applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of"
"37915","commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount"
"37916","of commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would have charged"
"37917","for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith"
"37918","that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of"
"37919","the brokerage and research products and/or services provided by such"
"37920","broker or dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and"
"37921","research products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either that"
"37922","particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-"
"37923","Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to the Series as well as to"
"37924","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Not all such"
"37925","services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the"
"37926","Series. In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be"
"37927","utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under any exemptive"
"37928","order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions of such"
"37929","order are complied with."
"37930","(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the Series as"
"37931","are required of a sub-investment advisor of a registered investment"
"37932","company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the"
"37933","Investment Advisers Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund"

furnish such services; and

WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies properly
certified or authenticated of each of the following and will promptly
provide the Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or authenticated of
any amendment or supplement thereto:

 	(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement) with the Fund;

 	(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

 	(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the Manager
hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the services described in
Section 2 below for investment and reinvestment of the securities and
other assets of the Series, subject to the control and direction of the
Manager and the Fund's Board of Directors, for the period and on the terms
hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor accepts such appointment and agrees
to furnish the services hereinafter set forth for the compensation herein
provided. The Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an
independent contractor and shall, except as expressly provided or
authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the Fund or the
Manager in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or the
Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

		The Sub-Advisor will:

(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited to
research, advice and supervision for the Series.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval (or any
appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from time to time as
economic conditions require, a recommended investment program for the Fund
consistent with the Series' investment objective and policies.

(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing orders for the
purchase and sale of securities without prior consultation with the
Manager or the Board of Directors of the Fund and without regard to the
length of time the securities have been held, the resulting rate of
portfolio turnover or any tax considerations, subject always to the
provisions of the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, the
requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same shall be from time to
time in effect.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the
officers, in taking such steps as are reasonably necessary or appropriate
to carry out the decisions of its Board of Directors, and any appropriate
committees of such Board, regarding the general conduct of the investment
business of the Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment advisory
services provided to the Series, its compliance with the 1940 Act and the
regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder
and the Series' investment strategies and restrictions as stated in the
Fund's prospectus and statement of additional information, subject to
receipt of such additional information as may be required from the Manager
and provided in accordance with Section 11(d) of this Agreement. The Sub-
Advisor has no responsibility for the maintenance of Fund records except
insofar as is directly related to the services it provides to the Series.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and in
such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem appropriate in
order to enable it to determine that the investment policies, procedures
and approved investment program of the Series are being observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination of the fair
value of certain securities when reliable market quotations are not
readily available for purposes of calculating net asset value in
accordance with procedures and methods established by the Fund's Board of
Directors.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and
management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other personnel
required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii) administrative
facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment
necessary for the efficient conduct of its duties under this Agreement.

(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers (broker-dealers), select broker-
dealers to effect all transactions for the Series, place all necessary
orders with broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated broker-
dealers), and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the extent
consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders for the Series may
be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of other
clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation of securities so sold
or purchased, as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be
made by the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the
most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund
and to other clients.  The Manager recognizes that, in some cases, this
procedure may limit the size of the position that may be acquired or sold
for the Series.  The Sub-Advisor will report on such allocations at the
request of the Manager, the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors
providing such information as the number of aggregated trades to which the
Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades were directed
and the basis for the allocation for the aggregated trades.  The Sub-
Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain execution of transactions for
the Series at prices which are advantageous to the Series and at
commission rates that are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.
However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the basis that
they provide brokerage, research or other services or products to the Sub-
Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may
cause the Series to pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission for
effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount of commission
or dealer spread another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting
that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that such
amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the
brokerage and research products and/or services provided by such broker or
dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and research
products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either that particular
transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its
affiliates have with respect to the Series as well as to accounts over
which they exercise investment discretion. Not all such services or
products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the Series. In
addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized by the
Series except to the extent permitted under any exemptive order obtained
by the Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions of such order are complied
with.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the Series
as are required of an investment advisor of a registered investment
company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment Advisor's Act of 1940 (the
Investment Advisor's Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the
Fund and the Manager with such periodic and special reports as the Fund or
Manager may reasonably request.  In compliance with the requirements of
Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all
records that it maintains for the Series are the property of the Fund,
agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940
Act any records that it maintains for the Fund and that are required to be
maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to
surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it maintains for the
Series upon request by the Fund or the Manager.

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the Sub-
Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as the same may be
amended from time to time.  The Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy of
Sub-Advisor's current Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward
to the Manager a copy of any material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code
of Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request, furnish the
requesting party reports on portfolio transactions and reports on
investments held by the Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the
Fund may reasonably request.  The Sub-Advisor will make available its
officers and employees to meet with the Fund's Board of Directors at the
Fund's principal place of business on due notice to review the investments
of the Series.

(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-advisor
and may be required for the Fund or the Manager to comply with their
respective obligations under applicable laws, including, without
limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code),
the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and any
rule or regulation thereunder.  Sub-Advisor will advise Manager of any
changes in Sub-Advisor's managing directors within a reasonable time after
any such change.  Manager acknowledges receipt of Sub-Advisor's Form ADV
more than 48 hours prior to the execution of this Agreement.

(n)	Perform quarterly and annual tax compliance tests to monitor the
Series' compliance with Subchapter M of the Code and Section 817(h) of the
Code, subject to receipt of such additional information as may be required
from the Manager and provided in accordance with Section 11(d) of this
Agreement.  The Sub-Advisor shall notify the Manager immediately upon
having a reasonable basis for believing that the Series has ceased to be
in compliance or that it might not be in compliance in the future.  If it
is determined that the Series is not in compliance with the requirements
noted above, the Sub-Advisor, in consultation with the Manager, will take
prompt action to bring the Series back into compliance (to the extent
possible) within the time permitted under the Code.

(o)	Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies solicited by,
or with respect to, the issuers of securities held in the Series.  The
Manager shall cause to be forwarded to Sub-Advisor all proxy solicitation
materials that it receives and shall assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to
conduct the proxy voting process.

3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-Advisor
will not consult with any other investment advisory firm that provides
investment advisory services to any investment company sponsored by
Principal Life Insurance Company regarding transactions for the Fund in
securities or other assets.

4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations assumed by
the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the Fund, the Manager shall pay
the compensation specified in Appendix A to this Agreement.



5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers, employees,
agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager, the Fund or its
shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or the Fund resulting
from any error of judgment made in the good faith exercise of the
Sub-Advisor's duties under this Agreement or as a result of the failure by
the Manager or any of its affiliates to comply with the terms of this
Agreement except for losses resulting from the Sub-Advisor's willful
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of, or from reckless disregard
of, the duties of the Sub-Advisor under this Agreement.

6.	Indemnification

The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Sub-Advisor from and
against any and all claims, losses, liabilities or damages (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and other related expenses), (Losses)
howsoever arising, from or in connection with this Agreement or the
performance by the Sub-Advisor of its duties hereunder, so long as the
Sub-Advisor shall, after receipt of notice of any claim or commencement of
any action, promptly notify the Manager in writing of the claim or
commencement of such action.  The Manager shall not be liable for any
settlement of any claim or action effected without its written consent.
Nothing contained herein shall require the Manager to indemnify the Sub-
Advisor for Losses resulting from the Sub-Advisor's willful misfeasance,
bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or from its
reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.

7.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other persons affiliated
with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third parties to better enable
the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement for the
provision of certain personnel and facilities to the Sub- Advisor, subject
to written notification to and approval of the Manager and, where required
by applicable law, the Board of Directors of the Fund.

8.	Regulation

The Sub-Advisor shall submit to all regulatory and administrative bodies
having jurisdiction over the services provided pursuant to this Agreement
any information, reports or other material which any such body may request
or require pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.

9.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement

This Agreement shall become effective as of the date of its execution and,
unless otherwise terminated, shall continue in effect for a period of two
years and thereafter from year to year provided that the continuance is
specifically approved at least annually either by the Board of Directors
of the Fund or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting

the Board of Directors of the Fund who are not interested persons of the

cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such
approval.

If the shareholders of a Series fail to approve the Agreement or any
continuance of the Agreement in accordance with the requirements of the
1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor will continue to act as Sub-Advisor with respect
to the Series pending the required approval of the Agreement or its
continuance or of any contract with the Sub-Advisor or a different manager
or Sub-Advisor or other definitive action; provided, that the compensation
received by the Sub-Advisor in respect to the Series during such period is
