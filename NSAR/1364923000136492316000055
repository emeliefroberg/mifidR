"1964","<P style=margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:11.133px; font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman>In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Fidelity International Enhanced Index Fund, Fidelity Large Cap Core Enhanced Index Fund, Fidelity Large Cap Growth Enhanced Index Fund, Fidelity Large Cap Value Enhanced Index Fund, Fidelity Mid Cap Enhanced Index Fund, and Fidelity Small Cap Enhanced Index Fund (funds of Fidelity Commonwealth Trust II) (the <font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8220;</font>Funds<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8221;</font>) as of and for the year ended February 29, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font> internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, &nbsp;but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font> internal control over financial reporting. &nbsp;Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font> internal control over financial reporting.</P>"
"1965","<P style=margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:11.133px; font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman>The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. &nbsp;In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. &nbsp;A fund<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. &nbsp;A fund<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
"1966","<P style=margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:11.133px; font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. &nbsp;Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>"
