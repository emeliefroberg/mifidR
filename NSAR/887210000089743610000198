"3377","and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and"

"3379","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability"
"3380","of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"3381","purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A"
"3382","company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"

"3384","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"3385","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"3386","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"3387","accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"3388","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"3389","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"3390","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's"
