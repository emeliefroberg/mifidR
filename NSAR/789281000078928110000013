"601","LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"602","Since February 2004,"
"603","Federated and related"
"604","entities (collectively,"
"605","Federated) have been"
"606","named as"
"607","defendants in several"
"608","lawsuits that are now"
"609","pending in the United"
"610","States District Court"
"611","for the Western"
"612","District of Pennsylvania."
"613","These lawsuits have been"
"614","consolidated into a"
"615","single action alleging"
"616","excessive"
"617","advisory fees involving"
"618","one of the Federated-"
"619","sponsored mutual funds"
"620","(Funds)."
"621","     Federated and its"
"622","counsel have been"
"623","defending this litigation."
"624","Additional lawsuits based"
"625","upon similar"
"626","allegations may be filed"
"627","in the future. The"
"628","potential impact of these"
"629","lawsuits, all of which"
"630","seek monetary"
"631","damages, attorneys' fees"
"632","and expenses, and future"
"633","potential similar suits"
"634","is uncertain. Although we do"
"635","not believe that these"
"636","lawsuits will have a"
"637","material adverse effect"
"638","on the Funds, there can"
"639","be no"

"641","ongoing adverse publicity"
"642","and/or other developments"
"643","resulting from the"

"658","Report of Independent"
"659","Registered Public"
"660","Accounting Firm"
"661","To the Shareholders and"
"662","Board of Trustees of"
"663","Federated Income"
"664","Securities Trust:"
"665","In planning and"
"666","performing our audit of"
"667","the financial statements"
"668","of Federated Muni and"
"669","Stock Advantage Fund"
"670","(one of the portfolios"
"671","constituting Federated"
"672","Income Securities"
"673","Trust) (the Fund) as"
"674","of and for the year"
"675","ended October 31, 2010,"
"676","in accordance with the"
"677","standards of the Public"
"678","Company Accounting"
"679","Oversight Board (United"
"680","States), we"
"681","considered the Fund's"
"682","internal control over"
"683","financial reporting,"
"684","including controls over"
"685","safeguarding securities,"
"686","as a basis for designing"
"687","our auditing procedures"
"688","for the purpose"
"689","of expressing our opinion"
"690","on the financial statements"
"691","and to comply with the"
"692","requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"693","but not for the purpose of"
"694","expressing an opinion on the"
"695","effectiveness of the Fund's"
"696","internal control over"
"697","financial reporting."
"698","Accordingly, we"
"699","express no such opinion."
"700","The management of the"
"701","Fund is responsible for"
"702","establishing and maintaining"
"703","effective"
"704","internal control over"
"705","financial reporting.  In"
"706","fulfilling this responsibility,"
"707","estimates and"
"708","judgments by management are"
"709","required to assess the"
"710","expected benefits and related"
"711","costs"
"712","of controls.  A company's"
"713","internal control over financial"
"714","reporting is a process designed"
"715","to provide reasonable assurance"
"716","regarding the reliability of"
"717"," financial reporting and the"
"718","preparation of financial"
"719","statements for external"
"720","purposes in accordance with"
"721","generally"
"722","accepted accounting principles."
"723","A company's internal control"
"724","over financial reporting"
"725","includes those policies and"
"726","procedures that (1) pertain"
"727","to the maintenance of records"
"728","that,"
"729","in reasonable detail, accurately"
"730","and fairly reflect the transactions"
"731","and dispositions of the"
"732","assets of the company; (2)"
"733","provide reasonable assurance"
"734","that transactions are recorded"
"735","as"
"736","necessary to permit preparation"
"737","of financial statements in"
"738","accordance with generally"
"739","accepted accounting principles,"
"740","and that receipts and expenditures"
"741","of the company are"
"742","being made only in accordance with"
"743","authorizations of management and"
"744","directors of the"
"745","company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"746","assurance regarding prevention or"
"747","timely detection"
"748","of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"749","or disposition of a company's"
"750","assets that could have a"
"751","material effect on the financial"
"752","statements."
"753","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"754","internal control over financial"
"755","reporting may not"
"756","prevent or detect misstatements."
"757","Also, projections of any evaluation"
"758","of effectiveness to"
"759","future periods are subject to the"
"760","risk that controls may become"
"761","inadequate because of"
"762","changes in conditions, or that"
"763","the degree of compliance with"
"764","the policies or procedures"
"765","may deteriorate."
"766","A deficiency in internal control"
"767","over financial reporting exists"
"768","when the design or"
"769","operation of a control does not"
"770","allow management or employees,"
"771","in the normal course of"
"772","performing their assigned"
"773","functions, to prevent or detect"
"774","misstatements on a timely basis."
"775","A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"776","or a combination of deficiencies,"
"777","in internal control"
"778","over financial reporting, such"
"779","that there is a reasonable"
"780","possibility that a material"
"781","misstatement of the company's"
"782","annual or interim financial"
"783","statements will not be"
"784","prevented or detected on a timely"
"785","basis."
"786","Our consideration of the Fund's"
"787","internal control over financial"
"788","reporting was for the"
"789","limited purpose described in the"
"790","first paragraph and would not"
"791","necessarily disclose all"
"792","deficiencies in internal control"
"793","that might be material weaknesses"
"794"," under standards"
"795","established by the Public Company"
"796","Accounting Oversight Board"
"797","(United States)."
"798","However, we noted no deficiencies"
"799","in the Fund's internal control"
"800","over financial reporting"
"801","and its operation, including"
"802","controls over safeguarding securities"
"803","that we consider to be a"
"804","material weakness as defined"
"805","above as of October 31, 2010."
"806","This report is intended solely"
"807","for the information and use of"
"808","management and the Board"
"809","of Trustees of the Fund and the"
"810","Securities and Exchange Commission"
"811","and is not intended"
"812","to be and should not be used by"
"813","anyone other than these specified"
