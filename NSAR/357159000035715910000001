"540","Report of Independent"
"541"," Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"542","To the Shareholders and"
"543"," Board of Directors of"
"544","Federated U.S. Government"
"545"," Securities Fund: 2-5 Years:"
"546","In planning and performing"
"547","our audit of the financial"
"548","statements of Federated"
"549"," U.S. Government"
"550","Securities Fund: 2-5 Years"
"551","(the  Fund) as of and for"
"552"," the year ended January 31,"
"553"," 2010, in"
"554","accordance with the"
"555","standards of the Public"
"556","Company Accounting"
"557"," Oversight Board (United"
"558","States), we considered"
"559"," the Fund's internal"
"560","control over financial"
"561"," reporting, including controls"
"562","over safeguarding"
"563","securities, as a basis"
"564"," for designing our"
"565","auditing procedures for"
"566","the purpose of"
"567","expressing our opinion"
"568","on the financial statements"
"569"," and to comply with the"
"570"," requirements of Form"
"571","N-SAR, but not for the"
"572","purpose of expressing"
"573","an opinion on the"
"574","effectiveness of the Fund's"
"575","internal control over"
"576","financial reporting."
"577"," Accordingly, we express"
"578","no such opinion."
"579","The management of the"
"580","Fund is responsible for"
"581"," establishing and"
"582","maintaining effective internal"
"583","control over financial"
"584","reporting. In fulfilling"
"585","this responsibility,"
"586","estimates and judgments by"
"587","management are required"
"588","to assess the expected"
"589","benefits and related"
"590"," costs of controls. A"
"591","company's internal control"
"592"," over financial reporting"
"593"," is a process designed"
"594"," to provide reasonable"
"595","assurance regarding the"
"596","reliability of financial"
"597"," reporting and the"
"598"," preparation of financial"
"599","statements for external"
"600"," purposes in accordance"
"601","with generally accepted"
"602","accounting principles. A"
"603","company's internal control"
"604"," over financial reporting"
"605","includes those policies"
"606","and procedures that (1)"
"607","pertain to the maintenance"
"608","of records that, in"
"609"," reasonable detail,"
"610","accurately and fairly"
"611","reflect the"
"612","transactions and dispositions"
"613"," of the assets of the"
"614","company; (2) provide"
"615","reasonable assurance that"
"616","transactions are recorded"
"617","as necessary to permit"
"618","preparation of financial"
"619"," statements in accordance"
"620","with generally accepted"
"621","accounting principles,"
"622"," and that receipts and"
"623"," expenditures of the company"
"624","are being made only in"
"625"," accordance with"
"626"," authorizations of"
"627"," management and directors"
"628","of the"
"629","company; and (3) provide"
"630","reasonable assurance"
"631","regarding prevention or"
"632","timely detection of"
"633","unauthorized acquisition,"
"634"," use or disposition of"
"635"," a company's assets"
"636","that could have a material"
"637","effect on the financial"
"638"," statements."
"639","Because of its inherent"
"640"," limitations, internal"
"641"," control over financial"
"642"," reporting may not prevent or"
"643","detect misstatements."
"644","Also, projections of any"
"645"," evaluation of effectiveness"
"646","to future periods are"
"647","subject to the risk that"
"648"," controls may become"
"649","inadequate because of"
"650"," changes in conditions,"
"651"," or that"
"652","the degree of compliance"
"653","with the policies or"
"654"," procedures may deteriorate."
"655","A deficiency in internal"
"656"," control over financial"
"657"," reporting exists when"
"658","the design or operation of a"
"659","control does not allow"
"660","management or employees,"
"661"," in the normal course of"
"662","performing their"
"663","assigned functions, to"
"664","prevent or detect"
"665","misstatements on a timely"
"666","basis. A material weakness is a"
"667","deficiency, or a combination"
"668"," of deficiencies, in internal"
"669"," control over financial"
"670","reporting, such that"
"671","there is a reasonable possibility"
"672"," that a material misstatement"
"673"," of the company's annual or"
"674","interim"
"675","financial statements will"
"676","not be prevented or detected"
"677","on a timely basis."
"678","Our consideration of the"
"679","Fund's internal control over"
"680"," financial reporting was for"
"681","the limited"
"682","purpose described in the first"
"683"," paragraph and would not"
"684","necessarily disclose all"
"685","deficiencies in"
"686","internal control that might"
"687"," be material weaknesses under"
"688"," standards established by"
"689","the Public"
"690","Company Accounting Oversight"
"691","Board (United States)."
"692","However, we noted no"
"693"," deficiencies in the"
"694","Fund's internal control"
"695","over financial reporting"
"696","and its operation, including"
"697"," controls over"
"698","safeguarding securities that"
"699"," we consider to be a material"
"700"," weakness as defined above as"
"701","of January"
"702","31, 2010."
"703","This report is intended"
"704","solely for the information"
"705","and use of management and"
"706","the Board of"
"707","Trustees of the Fund and the"
"708","Securities and Exchange"

"724","LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"725","Since October 2003,"
"726","Federated and related"
"727","entities (collectively,"
"728"," Federated), and various"
"729"," Federated funds"
"730","(Funds), have been named"
"731"," as defendants in several"
"732","class action lawsuits now"
"733","pending in the United States"
"734","District"
"735","Court for the District of"
"736","Maryland. The lawsuits were"
"737","purportedly filed on behalf"
"738"," of people who purchased, owned"
"739","and/or redeemed shares of"
"740","Federated-sponsored mutual"
"741","funds during specified periods"
"742"," beginning November 1, 1998."
"743","The suits are generally similar"
"744","in alleging that Federated"
"745","engaged in illegal and improper"
"746","trading practices including"
"747","market timing and late trading"
"748"," in concert with certain"
"749"," institutional traders, which"
"750"," allegedly caused financial injury to"
"751","the mutual fund shareholders."
"752","These lawsuits began to be filed"
"753","shortly after Federated's first"
"754"," public announcement"
"755","that it had received requests"
"756","for information on shareholder"
"757","trading activities in the Funds"
"758","from the SEC, the Office"
"759","of the New York State Attorney"
"760"," General (NYAG), and other"
"761"," authorities. In that"
"762","regard, on November 28, 2005,"
"763","Federated announced that"
"764","it had reached final"
"765","settlements with the SEC"
"766","and the NYAG with respect"
"767"," to those matters."
"768","Specifically, the SEC and"
"769","NYAG settled proceedings"
"770","against three Federated"
"771","subsidiaries involving"
"772","undisclosed"
"773","market timing arrangements"
"774"," and late trading. The SEC"
"775"," made findings: that"
"776"," Federated Investment Management"
"777","Company (FIMC), an"
"778","SEC-registered investment"
"779"," adviser to various Funds,"
"780"," and Federated Securities"
"781"," Corp., an"
"782","SEC-registered broker-dealer"
"783","and distributor for the Funds,"
"784","violated provisions of"
"785","the Investment Advisers Act and"
"786","Investment Company Act by"
"787","approving, but not disclosing,"
"788"," three market timing arrangements,"
"789"," or the associated"
"790","conflict of interest between"
"791","FIMC and the funds involved in"
"792"," the arrangements, either to"
"793"," other fund shareholders or to"
"794","the funds' board; and that"
"795"," Federated Shareholder"
"796"," Services Company, formerly"
"797"," an SEC-registered transfer agent,"
"798","failed to prevent a customer"
"799"," and a Federated employee"
"800","from late trading in violation"
"801","of provisions of the Investment"
"802","Company Act. The NYAG found"
"803","that such conduct violated"
"804","provisions of New York State"
"805","law. Federated entered"
"806","into the settlements without"
"807"," admitting or denying the"
"808","regulators' findings. As"
"809"," Federated previously reported"
"810","in 2004,"
"811","it has already paid approximately"
"812"," $8.0 million to certain funds as"
"813"," determined by an independent"
"814"," consultant. As part"
"815","of these settlements, Federated"
"816","agreed to pay disgorgement and"
"817","a civil money penalty in the"
"818","aggregate amount of an"
"819","additional $72 million and,"
"820"," among other things, agreed"
"821","that it would not serve as"
"822","investment adviser to any"
"823","registered investment company"
"824"," unless (i) at least 75% of"
"825","the fund's directors are"
"826","independent of Federated, (ii) the"
"827","chairman of each such fund is"
"828","independent of Federated, (iii)"
"829"," no action may be taken by"
"830"," the fund's board or any"
"831","committee thereof unless"
"832","approved by a majority of the"
"833"," independent trustees of the"
"834","fund or committee, respectively,"
"835","and (iv) the fund appoints"
"836"," a senior officer who reports"
"837"," to the independent trustees"
"838"," and is responsible for"
"839","monitoring compliance by"
"840","the fund with applicable laws"
"841"," and fiduciary duties and"
"842","for managing the process by which"
"843","management fees charged to"
"844","a fund are approved. The"
"845","settlements are described"
"846","in Federated's announcement"
"847","which, along with previous"
"848"," press releases and related"
"849","communications on those"
"850","matters, is available in the About
Us section of Federated's"
"851","website at FederatedInvestors.com."
"852","Federated entities have also"
"853"," been named as defendants in"
"854"," several additional lawsuits"
"855"," that are now pending in the"
"856","United States District Court"
"857"," for the Western District of"
"858"," Pennsylvania, alleging,"
"859","among other things, excessive"
"860","advisory and Rule 12b-1 fees."
"861","The Board of the Funds retained"
"862","the law firm of Dickstein Shapiro"
