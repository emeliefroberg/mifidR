"6377","LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"6378","Since October 2003, Federated"
"6379","and related entities (collectively,"
"6380","Federated) and various"
"6381","Federated-sponsored mutual funds"
"6382","(Funds) have been named as defendants"
"6383","in several class action"
"6384","lawsuits now pending in the United"
"6385","States District Court for the District"
"6386","of Maryland. The lawsuits were"
"6387","purportedly filed on behalf of"
"6388","people who purchased, owned and/or"
"6389","redeemed shares of certain Funds"
"6390","during specified periods beginning"
"6391","November 1, 1998. The suits are"
"6392","generally similar in alleging that"
"6393","Federated engaged in illegal and"
"6394","improper trading practices including"
"6395","market timing and late trading in"
"6396","concert with certain institutional"
"6397","traders, which allegedly caused"
"6398","financial injury to the mutual fund"
"6399","shareholders. Federated without"
"6400","admitting the validity of any"
"6401","claim has reached a preliminary"
"6402","settlement"
"6403","with the Plaintiffs in these cases."
"6404","Any settlement would have to be"
"6405","approved by the Court."
"6406","     Federated entities have also"
"6407","been named as defendants in several"
"6408","additional lawsuits that are now"
"6409","pending in the United States District"
"6410","Court for the Western District of"
"6411","Pennsylvania. These lawsuits have"
"6412","been consolidated into a single action"
"6413","alleging excessive advisory fees"
"6414","involving one of the Funds."
"6415","     The Board of the Funds retained"
"6416","the law firm of Dickstein Shapiro"
"6417","LLP to represent the Funds in"
"6418","each of the lawsuits described in"
"6419","the preceding two paragraphs."
"6420","Federated and the Funds, and their"
"6421","respective counsel, have been"
"6422","defending this litigation, and none"
"6423","of the Funds remains a defendant in"
"6424","any of the lawsuits. Additional"
"6425","lawsuits based upon similar allegations"
"6426","may be filed in the future. The"
"6427","potential impact of these lawsuits,"
"6428","all of which seek monetary damages,"
"6429","attorneys' fees and expenses,"
"6430","and future potential similar suits is"
"6431","uncertain. Although we do not believe"
"6432","that these lawsuits will have a"
"6433","material adverse effect on the Funds,"
"6434","there can be no assurance that these"
"6435","suits, ongoing adverse"
"6436","publicity and/or other developments"
"6437","resulting from the allegations in"
"6438","these matters will not result in"
"6439","increased redemptions, or reduced"
"6440","sales of shares of the Funds or"
"6441","other adverse consequences for the"
"6442","Funds."

"6599"," effectiveness of the Funds'"
"6600"," internal"
"6601","control over financial"
"6602","reporting. Accordingly,"
"6603","we express no such opinion."
"6604","The management of the Funds"
"6605","is responsible for"
"6606","establishing and"
"6607","maintaining effective"

"6609","financial reporting. In"
"6610"," fulfilling this responsibility,"
"6611","estimates and"
"6612","judgments by management"
"6613","are required to assess the"
"6614","expected benefits and related"
"6615","costs"
"6616","of controls. The company's"
"6617","internal control over financial"
"6618"," reporting is a process designed"
"6619","to provide reasonable"
"6620","assurance regarding the"
"6621","reliability of financial"
"6622","reporting and the"
"6623","preparation of financial"
"6624"," statements for external"
"6625"," purposes in accordance with"
"6626","generally"
"6627","accepted accounting principles."
"6628","A company's internal control"
"6629"," over financial reporting"
"6630","includes those policies and"
"6631","procedures that (1) pertain"
"6632","to the maintenance of records"

"6634","in reasonable detail,"
"6635","accurately and fairly reflect"
"6636","the transactions and"

"6642","necessary to permit preparation"
"6643"," of financial statements"
"6644","in accordance with generally"
"6645","accepted accounting principles,"
"6646"," and that receipts and"
"6647"," expenditures of the company"

"6657","use or disposition of a"
"6658"," company's assets that could"
"6659"," have a"
"6660","material effect on the financial"
"6661"," statements."
"6662","Because of its inherent"
"6663","limitations, internal control"
"6664"," over financial reporting may not"
"6665","prevent or detect misstatements."
"6666"," Also, projections of any"
"6667","evaluation of effectiveness to"
"6668","future periods are subject to"

"6672"," the degree of compliance with"
"6673"," the policies or procedures"
"6674","may deteriorate."
"6675","A deficiency in internal"
"6676","control over financial reporting"
"6677","exists when the design or"

"6682","performing their assigned"

"6686","A material weakness is a"
"6687","deficiency, or a combination"
"6688","of deficiencies, in internal"
"6689","control"

"6691","that there is a reasonable"
"6692","possibility that a material"
"6693","misstatement of the company's"
"6694"," annual or interim financial"
