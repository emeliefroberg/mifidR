"4099","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"4100","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Old Mutual"
"4101","Funds II:"
"4102","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"4103","statements of Old Mutual Analytic U.S. Long/Short Fund, Old"
"4104","Mutual Barrow Hanley Value Fund, Old Mutual Focused"
"4105","Fund, Old Mutual Heitman REIT Fund, Old Mutual Large Cap"
"4106","Growth Fund, Old Mutual Strategic Small Company Fund,"
"4107","Old Mutual TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund, Old Mutual TS&W"
"4108","Small Cap Value Fund, Old Mutual Barrow Hanley Core"
"4109","Bond Fund, Old Mutual Cash Reserves Fund, Old Mutual"
"4110","Dwight High Yield Fund, Old Mutual Dwight Intermediate"
"4111","Fixed Income Fund, and Old Mutual Dwight Short Term Fixed"
"4112","Income Fund (constituting Old Mutual Funds II, hereafter"
"4113","referred to as the Funds) as of and for the year ended"
"4114","March 31, 2011, in accordance with the standards of the"
"4115","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"4116","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"4117","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"4118","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"4119","of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"4120","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"4121","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"4122","Funds' internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"4123","we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"4124","Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"4125","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"4126","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"4127","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"4128","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"4129","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's"
"4130","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed"
"4131","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"4132","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"4133","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"4134","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"4135","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"4136","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"4137","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"4138","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"4139","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"4140","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"4141","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"4142","and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"4143","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"4144","of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"4145","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"4146","use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a"
"4147","material effect on the financial statements."
"4148","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"4149","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"4150","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"4151","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"4152","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"4153","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"4154","deteriorate."
"4155","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"4156","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"4157","management or employees, in the normal course of"
"4158","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"4159","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"4160","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"4161","over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"4162","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds' annual"
"4163","or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"4164","detected on a timely basis."
"4165","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"4166","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"4167","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"4168","in internal control over financial reporting that might be"
"4169","material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"4170","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"4171","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal"
"4172","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"4173","controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be"
"4174","material weaknesses as defined above as of March 31, 2011."
"4175","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"4176","the Board of Trustees, management and the Securities and"
"4177","Exchange and is not intended to be and should not be used"

"4342","Assistant Secretaries, Assistant Treasurers, and other"
"4343","officers, agents and employees, who shall have such"
"4344","authority and perform such duties as the Board may"

"4364","so removed.  Any officer may resign from office at any"
"4365","time by delivering a written resignation to the Trustees or"

"4383","otherwise assigned by the Board of Trustees or the"
"4384","President shall devolve upon the Vice Presidents in the"

"4390","kept the minutes of such meetings of Shareholders, the"
"4391","Board of Trustees and any committees thereof, and (c)"

"4400","       Section 6.	Treasurer.  The Treasurer shall"
"4401","have the care and custody of the funds and securities of"

"4828","or any Vice President, certifying the number of Shares"
"4829","owned by him, her or it in a Class or Portfolio of the"

"4831","require that a certificate be issued to him, her or it."
"4832","       Section 2.	Countersignature.  Where a"
"4833","certificate is countersigned (1) by a transfer agent other"
"4834","than the Trust or its employee, or (2) by a registrar other"
"4835","than the Trust or its employee, the signature of the"

"4841","stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of"
"4842","the fact by the person claiming the certificate to be lost,"
"4843","stolen or destroyed.  When authorizing such issue of a"
"4844","new certificate or certificates, the Board of Trustees"
"4845","may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to"
"4846","the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,"
"4847","stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his"
"4848","legal representative, to advertise the same in such"
"4849","manner as it shall require and/or to give the Trust a"
"4850","bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against"
"4851","any claim that may be made against the Trust with"
"4852","respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost,"
"4853","stolen or destroyed."
"4854","       Section 4.	Transfer of Shares.  The"
"4855","Trustees shall make such rules as they consider"
"4856","appropriate for the transfer of Shares and similar matters."
"4857","To the extent certificates are issued in accordance with"
"4858","Section 1 of this Article VI, upon surrender to the Trust"
"4859","or the transfer agent of the Trust of such certificate for"
"4860","Shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper"
"4861","evidence of succession, assignment or authority to"
"4862","transfer, it shall be the duty of the Trust to issue a new"
"4863","certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old"
"4864","certificate and record the transaction upon its books."
"4865","       Section 5.	Shareholder Book.  The Trust"
"4866","shall keep or cause to be kept a Shareholder book, which"
"4867","may be maintained by means of computer systems,"

"4869","persons who are Shareholders of the Trust, showing their"
"4870","places of residence, the number and Class of any Shares"
"4871","held by them, respectively, and the dates when they"
"4872","became the record owners thereof."
"4873","       Section 6.	Fixing Record Date.  In order"
"4874","that the Trustees may determine the Shareholders"
"4875","entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of"
"4876","Shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express"
"4877","consent to action in writing without a meeting, or"
"4878","entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other"
"4879","distribution of allotment of any rights, or entitled to"
"4880","exercise any rights in respect of any change,"
"4881","conversion or exchange of beneficial interests or for"
"4882","the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of"
"4883","Trustees may fix a record date, which record date shall"
"4884","not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing"
"4885","the record date is adopted by the Board of Trustees,"
"4886","and which record date shall not be more than ninety"
"4887","nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting,"
"4888","nor more than ten days after the date upon which the"
"4889","resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the"
"4890","Board of Trustees for action by Shareholder consent in"
"4891","writing without a meeting, nor more than ninety days"
"4892","prior to any other action.  A determination of"
"4893","shareholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote"
"4894","at a meeting of Shareholders shall apply to any"
"4895","adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the"
"4896","Board of Trustees may fix a new record date for the"
"4897","adjourned meeting."
"4898","       Section 7.	Registered Shareholders.  The"
"4899","Trust shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right"
"4900","of a person registered on its books as the owner of"
"4901","Shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner,"
"4902","and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or"
"4903","other claim of interest in such Share or Shares on the"
"4904","part of any other person, whether or not it shall have"
"4905","express or other notice hereof."
"4906","ARTICLE VII"
"4907","GENERAL PROVISIONS"
"4908","       Section 1.	Seal.  The Board of Trustees"
"4909","may provide that the Trust have a business seal.  The"
"4910","business seal shall have inscribed thereon the name of"
"4911","the statutory trust, the year of its organization and the"
"4912","words Trust Seal and Delaware.  The seal may be"
"4913","used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed"
"4914","or affixed or otherwise reproduced.  Any officer or"
"4915","Trustee of the Trust shall have authority to affix the seal"
"4916","of the Trust to any document requiring the same."
"4917","       Section 2.	Severability.  The provisions of"
"4918","these Bylaws are severable.  If any provision hereof"
"4919","shall be held invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction,"
"4920","such invalidity or unenforceability shall attach only to"
"4921","such provision only in such jurisdiction and shall not"
"4922","affect any other provision of these Bylaws."
"4923","       Section 3.	Headings.  Headings are placed"
"4924","in these Bylaws for convenience of reference only and in"
"4925","case of any conflict, the text of these Bylaws rather than"
"4926","the headings shall control."
"4927","ARTICLE VIII"
"4928","INDEMNIFICATION"
"4929","       Section 1.	Indemnification.  For the"
"4930","purpose of this Section 1, Trust includes any domestic"
"4931","or foreign predecessor entity of this Trust in a merger,"
"4932","consolidation, or other transaction in which the"
"4933","predecessor's existence ceased upon consummation of"
"4934","the transaction; proceeding means any threatened,"
"4935","pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether"
"4936","civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative; and"
"4937","expenses includes without limitation attorney's fees"
"4938","and any expenses of establishing a right to"
"4939","indemnification under this Section 1."
"4940","                    (a)	The Trust shall"
"4941","indemnify any person who was or is a party or is"
"4942","threatened to be made a party to any proceeding (other"
"4943","than an action by or in the right of the Trust) by reason"
"4944","of the fact that such person is or was a Covered Person,"
"4945","against expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in"
"4946","settlements actually and reasonably incurred by such"
"4947","person in connection with such proceeding, if it is"
"4948","determined that person acted in good faith and"
"4949","reasonably believed: (a) in the case of conduct in his"
"4950","official capacity as a Covered Person, that his conduct"
"4951","was in the Trust's best interests and (b) in all other"
"4952","cases, that his conduct was at least not opposed to the"
"4953","Trust's best interests and (c) in the case of a criminal"
"4954","proceeding, that he had no reasonable cause to believe"
"4955","that his conduct was unlawful.  The termination of any"
"4956","proceeding by judgment, order or settlement shall not,"
"4957","of itself, create a presumption that the person did not"
"4958","meet the requisite standard of conduct set forth in this"
"4959","Section 1.  The termination of any proceeding by"
"4960","conviction, or a plea of nolo contendere or its"
"4961","equivalent, or an entry of an order of probation prior to"
"4962","judgment, creates a rebuttable presumption that the"
"4963","person did not meet the requisite standard of conduct"
"4964","set forth in this Section 1."
"4965","                    (b)	The Trust shall"
"4966","indemnify any person who was or is a party or is"
"4967","threatened to be made a party to any proceeding by or"
"4968","in the right of the Trust to procure a judgment in its"
"4969","favor by reason of the fact that person is or was a"
"4970","Covered Person, against expenses actually and"
"4971","reasonably incurred by that person in connection with"
"4972","the defense or settlement of such action or suit if that"
"4973","person acted in good faith, in a manner that person"
"4974","believed to be in the best interests of the Trust and with"
"4975","such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily"
"4976","prudent person in a like position would use under"
"4977","similar circumstances."
"4978","                    (c)	Notwithstanding any"
"4979","provision to the contrary contained herein, there shall"
"4980","be no right to indemnification for any liability arising"
"4981","by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross"
"4982","negligence, or the reckless disregard of the duties"
"4983","involved in the conduct of the Covered Person's office"
"4984","with the Trust."
"4985","       Section 2.	Advance Payments of"
"4986","Indemnifiable Expenses.  To the maximum extent"
"4987","permitted by law, the Trust or applicable Portfolio may"
"4988","advance to a Covered Person, in connection with the"
"4989","preparation and presentation of a defense to any claim,"
"4990","action, suit, or proceeding, expenses for which the"
"4991","Covered Person would ultimately be entitled to"
"4992","indemnification; provided that the Trust or applicable"
"4993","Portfolio has received an undertaking by or on behalf of"
"4994","such Covered Person that such amount will be paid over"
"4995","by him to the Trust or applicable Portfolio if it is"
"4996","ultimately determined that he is not entitled to"
"4997","indemnification for such expenses, and further provided"
"4998","that (i) such Covered Person shall have provided"
"4999","appropriate security for such undertaking, (ii) the Trust"
"5000","is insured against losses arising out of any such advance"
"5001","payments, or (iii) either a majority of the Trustees who"
"5002","are not interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of"
"5003","the Trust nor parties to the matter, or independent legal"
"5004","counsel in a written opinion shall have determined,"
"5005","based upon a review of readily available facts (as"
"5006","opposed to a full trial-type inquiry) that there is reason to"
"5007","believe that such Covered Person will not be disqualified"
"5008","from indemnification for such expenses."
"5009","ARTICLE IX"
"5010","AMENDMENTS"
"5011","       Section 1.	Amendments.  These Bylaws"
"5012","may be altered or repealed by the Board of Trustees"
"5013","without the approval of the Shareholders at any regular"
"5014","or special meeting of the Board of Trustees without"
"5015","prior notice.  These Bylaws may also be altered or"
"5016","repealed by the Shareholders at any special meeting of"
"5017","the Shareholders, but only if the Board of Trustees"
"5018","resolves to put a proposed alteration or repealer to the"
"5019","vote of the Shareholders and notice of such alteration or"
"5020","repealer is contained in a notice of the special meeting"

"5029","<DESCRIPTION>LITIGATION"
"5030","<TEXT>"
"5031","Sub-Item 77E:  Litigation"
"5032","PBHG Funds (now known as Old Mutual Funds II) and"
"5033","PBHG Fund Distributors (now known as Old Mutual"
"5034","Investment Partners) have been named as defendants"
"5035","in a Class Action Suit (Class Action Suit) and a separate"
"5036","Derivative Suit (Derivative Suit) (together the Civil
Litigation). The Civil Litigation consolidates and"
"5037","coordinates a number of individual class action suits"
"5038","and derivative suits based on similar claims, which were"
"5039","previously filed against PBHG Funds and PBHG Fund"
"5040","Distributors in other jurisdictions, and were transferred"
"5041","to the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland"
"5042","(the Maryland District Court). Consolidated"
"5043","complaints in the Class Action and Derivative Suits were"
"5044","filed in the Civil Litigation on September 29, 2004 (MDL"
"5045","1586)."
"5046","The Civil Litigation and the previously filed suits are"
"5047","primarily based upon allegations that the defendants"
"5048","engaged in or facilitated market timing of PBHG Funds,"
"5049","and also made selective disclosure of confidential"
"5050","portfolio information to certain defendants and other"
"5051","parties. The Civil Litigation alleges a variety of theories"
"5052","for recovery, including but not limited to: (i) violations"
"5053","of various provisions of the Federal securities laws; (ii)"
"5054","breaches of fiduciary duty; and (iii) false or misleading"
"5055","prospectus disclosure. The Civil Litigation requests"
"5056","compensatory and punitive damages. In addition, the"
"5057","Derivative Suit requests the removal of each of the"
"5058","Trustees, the removal of PBHG Fund Distributors as"
"5059","distributor, rescission of the management and other"
"5060","contracts between PBHG Funds and the defendants,"
"5061","and rescission of PBHG Funds' 12b-1 Plan."
"5062","Plaintiffs have reached settlements that will resolve the"
"5063","claims asserted in the Class Action Suit and the"
"5064","Derivatives Suit (together, the Settlement).  A"
"5065","description of the Settlement and its terms may be"
"5066","found at"
"5067","http://www.mutualfundsettlements.com/pb/index.php."
"5068","Old Mutual Capital does not believe that the terms of"
"5069","the Settlement will materially affect the Fund or its"
"5070","ability to carry out its duty as investment adviser to the"
"5071","Fund."
