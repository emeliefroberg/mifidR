"1979","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1980","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Natixis Funds Trust I:"
"1981","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of CGM Advisor"
"1982","Targeted Equity Fund, Loomis Sayles Multi-Asset Income Fund (formerly Natixis"
"1983","Diversified Income Fund), Vaughan Nelson Small Cap Value Fund, Natixis U.S."
"1984","Equity Opportunities Fund, and Natixis Oakmark International Fund, each a"
"1985","series of Natixis Funds Trust I (the Funds) as of and for the year ended"
"1986","December 31, 2015, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1987","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds internal"
"1988","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1989","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"1990","of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1991","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"1992","on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"1993","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds"
"1994","internal control over financial reporting."
"1995","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1996","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1997","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1998","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A funds internal control"
"1999","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2000","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"2001","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"2002","accepted accounting principles.  A funds internal control over financial"
"2003","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2004","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2005","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"2006","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"2007","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"2008","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"2009","is being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"2010","of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"2011","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a funds"
"2012","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2013","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2014","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"2015","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"2016","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"2017","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2018","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"2019","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"2020","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2021","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2022","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"2023","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"2024","the Funds annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"2025","detected on a timely basis."
"2026","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial reporting was"
"2027","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"2028","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"2029","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"2030","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"2031","no deficiencies in the Funds internal control over financial reporting and"
"2032","its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we"
"2033","consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of December 31, 2015."
"2034","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"2035","the Board of Trustees of Natixis Funds Trust I and the Securities and Exchange"
"2036","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"

"2050","proposal described in answer to sub-item 77D"
"2051","Effective August 31, 2015 with respect to Loomis"
"2052","Sayles Multi-Asset Income Fund"
"2053","The Fund intends to pursue its investment goal by"
"2054","utilizing a flexible investment approach that"
"2055","allocates investments across a broad range of"
"2056","income-producing securities, while employing risk"
"2057","management strategies to mitigate downside risk."
"2058","The Fund may invest in equity securities (including"
"2059","common stocks, preferred stocks, depositary"
"2060","receipts, warrants, securities convertible into"
"2061","common or preferred stocks and real estate"
"2062","investment trusts (REITS)). The Fund may also"
"2063","invest up to 25% of its assets in publicly traded"
"2064","master limited partnerships (MLPs). The Fund"
"2065","may invest in fixed-income securities (including"
"2066","exchange-traded notes, structured notes, corporate"
"2067","debt, foreign and U.S. government and agency"
"2068","fixed-income securities, bank loans, adjustable"
"2069","floating rate loans and other floating rate debt"
"2070","instruments issued by U.S. and non-U.S."
"2071","corporations and other business entities and"
"2072","convertible debt securities). The Fund may invest in"
"2073","below investment grade fixed-income securities"
"2074","(commonly known as junk bonds). Below"
"2075","investment grade fixed-income securities are rated"
"2076","below investment grade quality (i.e., none of the"
"2077","three major ratings agencies (Moody's Investors"
"2078","Service, Inc. (Moody's), Fitch Investors Services,"
"2079","Inc. (Fitch) or Standard and Poor's Ratings Group"
"2080","(S&P)), have rated the securities in one of its top"
"2081","four rating categories) or, if unrated, are determined"
"2082","by Loomis Sayles & Company, L.P. (Loomis
Sayles or the Subadviser) to be of comparable"
"2083","quality. There is no minimum rating for the fixed-"
"2084","income securities in which the Fund may invest."
"2085","The Fund may invest in securities of any maturity"
"2086","or market capitalization. The Fund may invest in"
"2087","foreign securities including those in emerging"
"2088","markets."
"2089","The Fund may shift its assets among various types"
"2090","of income-producing securities based upon the"
"2091","Subadviser's evaluation of changing market"
"2092","conditions, yield expectations and security-specific"
"2093","opportunities. Changes to the Fund's asset"
"2094","allocations are based on several criteria, including"
"2095","global market cycles, global economic regimes and"
"2096","the relative attractiveness of particular asset"
"2097","categories. Under normal market conditions, the"
"2098","Fund will typically invest between 20% and 80% of"
"2099","its assets in fixed-income securities and between"
"2100","30% and 70% in equity securities. However, the"
"2101","Fund is not required to allocate its investments"
"2102","among asset classes in any fixed proportion and"
"2103","may invest up to 100% of its assets in either equity"
"2104","securities or fixed-income securities. A sudden"
"2105","change in market conditions could cause the"
"2106","Subadviser to substantially change the allocation of"
"2107","the Fund's assets over a relatively short period of"
"2108","time."
"2109","In selecting individual investments for the Fund, the"
"2110","Subadviser considers factors including, but not"
"2111","limited to, economic and business cycles as well as"
"2112","top-down sector valuations and fundamental,"
"2113","bottom-up security valuations. In deciding which"
"2114","equity securities to buy and sell, the Subadviser"
"2115","seeks to identify securities that it believes are,"
"2116","among other things, attractively valued based on the"
"2117","Subadviser's estimate of what a security is actually"
"2118","worth, with additional consideration given to"
"2119","income-producing securities."
"2120","In deciding which fixed-income securities to buy"
"2121","and sell, the Subadviser may consider a number of"
"2122","factors including, but not limited to, diverging"
"2123","business cycles among countries and regions, the"
"2124","stability and volatility of a country's bond markets,"
"2125","the financial strength of the issuer, current interest"
"2126","rates, the Subadviser's expectations regarding"
"2127","general trends in interest rates and currency"
"2128","considerations. The Subadviser will also consider"
"2129","how purchasing or selling a security would impact"
"2130","the overall portfolio's risk profile (for example, its"
"2131","sensitivity to currency risk, interest rate risk and"
"2132","sector-specific risk) and potential return (income"
"2133","and capital gains)."
"2134","When constructing the Fund's portfolio the"
"2135","Subadviser will use risk management tools in an"
"2136","effort to manage risk on an ongoing basis. These"
"2137","tools include the use of models that evaluate risk"
"2138","correlation to various market factors or asset"
"2139","classes, scenario analysis to measure the impact of"
"2140","certain market events and measuring the volatility"
"2141","of certain sectors and securities to understand the"
"2142","level of risk being contributed by these sectors and"
"2143","securities. The portfolio management team expects"
"2144","to actively evaluate each investment idea and to"
"2145","decide to buy or sell an investment based upon: (i)"
"2146","its return potential; (ii) its level of risk; and (iii) its"
"2147","fit within the team's overall macro strategy, with"
"2148","the goal of continually optimizing the Fund's"
"2149","portfolio."
"2150","The Fund may also:"
"2151","*	Invest in mortgage-related and asset-backed"
"2152","securities"
"2153","*	Invest in securities offered in initial public"
"2154","offerings (IPOs) and securities issued"
"2155","pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act"
"2156","of 1933 (Rule 144A securities). Rule 144A"
"2157","securities are privately offered securities and"
"2158","can be resold only to certain qualified"
"2159","institutional buyers."
"2160","*	Engage in over-the-counter (OTC) options,"
"2161","swap contracts (including credit default swaps)"
"2162","and currency transactions as well as futures"
"2163","transactions and other derivatives for hedging"
"2164","and investment purposes. The Fund may take"
"2165","both long and short positions in derivatives."
"2166","*	Engage in active and frequent trading of"
"2167","securities and other instruments. Effects of"
"2168","frequent trading may include high transaction"
"2169","costs, which may lower the Fund's returns, and"
"2170","realization of short-term capital gains,"
"2171","distributions of which are taxable to"
"2172","shareholders who are individuals as ordinary"
"2173","income. Trading costs and tax effects associated"
"2174","with frequent trading may adversely affect the"
"2175","Fund's performance."
