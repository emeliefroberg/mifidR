"1723","       Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1724","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"1725","Prudential Investment Portfolios 3:"
"1726","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"1727","Prudential Jennison Select Growth Fund (hereafter referred to as the"
"1728","Fund), a series of Prudential Investment Portfolios 3, as of and for"
"1729","the year ended February 29, 2012, in accordance with the standards"
"1730","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"1731","we considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"1732","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1733","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1734","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1735","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"1736","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"1737","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1738","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1739","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1740","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"1741","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1742","controls. A Fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1743","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1744","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1745","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1746","accepted accounting principles. A Fund's internal control over"
"1747","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1748","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1749","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1750","assets of the Fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"1751","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1752","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1753","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Fund are being"
"1754","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1755","trustees of the Fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1756","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"1757","disposition of the Fund's assets that could have a material effect on"
"1758","the financial statements."
"1759","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1760","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
