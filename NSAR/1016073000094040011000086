"2329","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2330","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"2331","Driehaus Mutual Funds"
"2332","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"2333","statements of each of the Driehaus Mutual Funds (comprising"
"2334","the Driehaus Emerging Markets Growth Fund, the Driehaus"
"2335","International Discovery Fund, the Driehaus International"
"2336","Small Cap Growth Fund, the Driehaus Mid Cap Growth Fund,"
"2337","the Driehaus Large Cap Growth Fund, the Driehaus Global"
"2338","Growth Fund, the Driehaus Select Credit Fund, and the"
"2339","Driehaus Active Income Fund) (the Funds) as of and for"
"2340","the respective periods ended December 31, 2010, in"
"2341","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"2342","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"2343","their internal control over financial reporting, including"
"2344","control activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"2345","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2346","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"2347","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"2348","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"2349","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"2350","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2351","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"2352","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"2353","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"2354","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"2355","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"2356","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"2357","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"2358","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"2359","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"2360","with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's"
"2361","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"2362","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"2363","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"2364","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"2365","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"2366","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2367","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"2368","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"2369","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"

"2371","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"2372","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"2373","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"2374","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2375","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2376","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2377","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2378","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"2379","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2380","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"2381","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2382","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"2383","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"2384","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"2385","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2386","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"2387","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2388","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"2389","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2390","company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"2391","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2392","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"2393","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"2394","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"2395","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"2396","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"2397","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"2398","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal"
"2399","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"2400","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"2401","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"

"2587","the Driehaus Select Credit Fund series of the Trust (the"

"2589","      WHEREAS, the Trust is a Delaware statutory trust, and is"
"2590","registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended"
"2591","(the 1940 Act), as an open-end management company of the"

"2593","      WHEREAS, the Trust and the Adviser have entered into an"

"2599","      WHEREAS, the Trust and the Adviser have determined that it"
"2600","is appropriate and in the best interests of the Fund and its"

"2602","below the level to which the Fund may otherwise be subject;"
"2603","      NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:"
"2604","1.	EXPENSE LIMITATION."
"2605","      1.1	Applicable Expense Limit.  To the extent that the"
"2606","ordinary operating expenses incurred by the Fund for the three-"
"2607","year period beginning on the effective date listed above (the"
"2608","Expense Limit Period), including but not limited to investment"

"2612","as litigation and other expenses not incurred in the ordinary"
"2613","course of the Fund's business (Fund Operating Expenses),"
"2614","exceed the Operating Expense Limit, as defined in Section 1.2"
"2615","below, such excess amount (the Excess Amount) shall be the"
"2616","liability of the Adviser to the extent set forth in this"
"2617","Agreement."
"2618","      1.2	Operating Expense Limit.  The Operating Expense Limit"
"2619","with respect to the Fund shall be 1.75% (annualized) of the"
"2620","average daily net assets of the Fund."
"2621","      1.3	Duration of Operating Expense Limit.  The Operating"
"2622","Expense Limit with respect to the Fund shall remain in effect"
"2623","during the term of this Agreement."
"2624","      1.4	Method of Computation.  To determine the Adviser's"
"2625","obligation with respect to the Excess Amount, each day the Fund"
"2626","Operating Expenses for the Fund shall be annualized.  If the"
"2627","annualized Fund Operating Expenses for any day of the Fund"
"2628","exceed the Operating Expense Limit of the Fund, the Adviser"
"2629","shall waive or reduce its investment advisory fee or absorb the"
"2630","other Fund expenses in an amount sufficient to pay that day's"
"2631","Excess Amount.  The Trust may offset amounts owed to the Fund"

"2635","Adviser may voluntarily reimburse the Fund for any operating"

"2637","2.	REIMBURSEMENT OF FEE WAIVERS AND EXPENSE"

"2643","advisory fees waived or reduced, and any other expense"
"2644","reimbursements or similar payments remitted by the Adviser to"
"2645","the Fund pursuant to Section 1 hereof (the Reimbursement
Amount) during the Expense Limit Period to the extent that the"
"2646","Fund's annualized Operating Expenses plus the amount so"
"2647","reimbursed equals, for such day, the Operating Expense Limit,"
"2648","provided that such amount paid to the Adviser will in no event"
