"5986","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"5987","To the Shareholders and Directors of"
"5988","The RBB Fund, Inc."
"5989","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"5990","statements of the Robeco Boston Partners Small Cap Value Fund"
"5991","II, Robeco Boston Partners Long/Short Equity Fund, Robeco"
"5992","Boston Partners Long/Short Research Fund, Robeco Boston"

"5996","Fund, S1 Fund and Summit Global Investments U.S. Low"
"5997","Volatility Equity Fund (ten of the series constituting The RBB"
"5998","Fund, Inc.) (the Funds) as of and for the year ended August"
"5999","31, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"6000","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"6001","considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"6002","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"6003","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"6004","of expressing our opinions on the financial statements and to"
"6005","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"6006","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"6007","Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"6008","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"6009","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"6010","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"6011","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"6012","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"6013","benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"6014","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"6015","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"6016","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"6017","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"6018","accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control"
"6019","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"6020","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"6021","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"6022","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"6023","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"6024","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"6025","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"6026","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"6027","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"6028","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"6029","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"6030","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"6031","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"6032","statements."
"6033","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"6034","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"6035","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"6036","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"6037","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"6038","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"6039","deteriorate."
"6040","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"6041","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"6042","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"6043","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"6044","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"6045","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"6046","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"6047","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"6048","company's annual or interim financial statements will not be"

"6083","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"6084","statements of the Bogle Investment Management Small Cap"
"6085","Growth Fund, Free Market Fixed Income Fund, Free Market"
"6086","International Equity Fund, Free Market U.S. Equity Fund, the"

"6088","Value Fund, and Schneider Value Fund, seven separately"
"6089","managed portfolios of The RBB Fund, Inc. (collectively, the"
"6090","Funds) as of and for the year ended August 31, 2013, in"
"6091","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"6092","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"6093","Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including"
"6094","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"6095","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"6096","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"6097","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"6098","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"6099","Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"6100","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"6101","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"6102","reporting."
"6103","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"6104","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"6105","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"6106","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"6107","benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal"
"6108","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"6109","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"6110","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"6111","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"6112","accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control"
"6113","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"6114","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"6115","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"6116","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"6117","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"6118","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"6119","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"6120","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made"
"6121","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"6122","directors of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance"
"6123","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"6124","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could"
"6125","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"6126","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"6127","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"6128","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"6129","future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"6130","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"6131","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"6132","deteriorate."
"6133","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"6134","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"6135","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"6136","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"6137","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"6138","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"6139","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"6140","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"6141","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"6142","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"6143","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"6144","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"6145","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"6146","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting"
"6147","that might be material weaknesses under standards established"
"6148","by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"6149","States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"6150","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"6151","including controls over safeguarding securities that we"
"6152","consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of"

"7162","Adviser from time to time with copies, properly certified or"
"7163","authenticated, of all amendments of or supplements to the"
"7164","foregoing, if any."

"7170","to such documents."
"7171","      SECTION 3.   MANAGEMENT.  Subject to the"
"7172","supervision of the Board of Directors of the Fund, the"
"7173","Investment Adviser will provide for the overall management of"
"7174","the Portfolios including (i) the provision of a continuous"
"7175","investment program for the Portfolios, including investment"
"7176","research and management with respect to all securities,"
"7177","investments, cash and cash equivalents in the Portfolios, (ii)"
"7178","the determination from time to time of the securities and"
"7179","other investments to be purchased, retained, or sold by the"
"7180","Fund for the Portfolios, and (iii) the placement from time to"
"7181","time of orders for all purchases and sales made for the"
"7182","Portfolios.  The Investment Adviser will provide the services"
"7183","rendered by it hereunder in accordance with the Portfolios'"
"7184","respective investment objectives, restrictions and policies as"
"7185","stated in the applicable Prospectus and Statement of"
"7186","Additional Information, provided that the Investment Adviser"
"7187","has actual notice or knowledge of any changes by the Board of"
"7188","Directors to such investment objectives, restrictions or"
"7189","policies.  The Investment Adviser further agrees that it will"
"7190","render to the Fund's Board of Directors such periodic and"
"7191","special reports regarding the performance of its duties under"
"7192","this Agreement as the Board may reasonably request.  The"
"7193","Investment Adviser agrees to provide to the Fund (or its"
"7194","agents and service providers) prompt and accurate data with"
"7195","respect to the Portfolios' transactions and, where not"
"7196","otherwise available, the daily valuation of securities in the"
"7197","Portfolios."
"7198","      SECTION 4.   BROKERAGE.  Subject to the Investment"
"7199","Adviser's obligation to obtain best price and execution, the"
"7200","Investment Adviser shall have full discretion to select"
"7201","brokers or dealers to effect the purchase and sale of"
"7202","securities.  When the Investment Adviser places orders for the"
"7203","purchase or sale of securities for a Portfolio, in selecting"
"7204","brokers or dealers to execute such orders, the Investment"
"7205","Adviser is expressly authorized to consider the fact that a"
"7206","broker or dealer has furnished statistical, research or other"
"7207","information or services for the benefit of the Portfolio"
"7208","directly or indirectly.  Without limiting the generality of"
"7209","the foregoing, the Investment Adviser is authorized to cause a"
"7210","Portfolio to pay brokerage commissions which may be in excess"
"7211","of the lowest rates available to brokers who execute"
"7212","transactions for the Portfolio or who otherwise provide"
"7213","brokerage and research services utilized by the Investment"
"7214","Adviser, provided that the Investment Adviser determines in"
"7215","good faith that the amount of each such commission paid to a"
"7216","broker is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage"
"7217","and research services provided by such broker viewed in terms"
"7218","of either the particular transaction to which the commission"
"7219","relates or the Investment Adviser's overall responsibilities"
"7220","with respect to accounts as to which the Investment Adviser"
"7221","exercises investment discretion.  The Investment Adviser may"
"7222","aggregate securities orders so long as the Investment Adviser"
"7223","adheres to a policy of allocating investment opportunities to"
"7224","each Portfolio over a period of time on a fair and equitable"
"7225","basis relative to other clients.  In no instance will the"
"7226","Portfolios' securities be purchased from or sold to the Fund's"
"7227","principal underwriter, the Investment Adviser, or any"
"7228","affiliated person thereof, except to the extent permitted by"
"7229","SEC exemptive order or by applicable law."
"7230","      The Investment Adviser shall report to the Board of"
"7231","Directors of the Fund at least quarterly with respect to"
"7232","brokerage transactions that were entered into by the"
"7233","Investment Adviser, pursuant to the foregoing paragraph, and"
"7234","shall certify to the Board that the commissions paid were"
"7235","reasonable in terms either of that transaction or the overall"
"7236","responsibilities of the Investment Adviser to the Fund and the"
"7237","Investment Adviser's other clients, that the total commissions"
"7238","paid by the Fund were reasonable in relation to the benefits"
"7239","to the Fund over the long term, and that such commissions were"
"7240","paid in compliance with Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"7241","Exchange Act of 1934."
"7242","      SECTION 5.   CONFORMITY WITH LAW; CONFIDENTIALITY."
"7243","The Investment Adviser further agrees that it will comply with"
"7244","all applicable rules and regulations of all federal regulatory"
"7245","agencies having jurisdiction over the Investment Adviser in"
"7246","the performance of its duties hereunder.  The Investment"
"7247","Adviser will treat confidentially and as proprietary"
"7248","information of the Fund all records and other information"
"7249","relating to the Fund and prior, present, or potential"
"7250","shareholders (except with respect to clients of the Investment"
"7251","Adviser) and will not use such records and information for any"
"7252","purpose other than performance of its responsibilities and"
"7253","duties hereunder, except after prior notification to and"
"7254","approval in writing by the Fund, which approval shall not be"
"7255","unreasonably withheld and may not be withheld where the"
"7256","Investment Adviser may be exposed to civil or criminal"
"7257","contempt proceedings for failure to comply, when requested to"
"7258","divulge such information by duly constituted authorities, or"
"7259","when so requested by the Fund. Where the Investment Adviser"
"7260","may be exposed to civil or criminal contempt proceedings for"
"7261","failure to comply with a request for records or other"
"7262","information relating to the Fund, the Investment Adviser may"
"7263","comply with such request prior to obtaining the Fund's written"
"7264","approval, provided that the Investment Adviser has taken"
"7265","reasonable steps to promptly notify the Fund, in writing, upon"
"7266","receipt of the request."
"7267","      SECTION 6.   SERVICES NOT EXCLUSIVE.  The"
"7268","Investment Adviser and its officers may act and continue to"
"7269","act as investment managers for others, and nothing in this"
"7270","Agreement shall in any way be deemed to restrict the right of"
"7271","the Investment Adviser to perform investment management or"
"7272","other services for any other person or entity, and the"
"7273","performance of such services for others shall not be deemed to"
"7274","violate or give rise to any duty or obligation to the"
"7275","Portfolios or the Fund."
"7276","      Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict"
"7277","the Investment Adviser or any of its directors, officers,"
"7278","affiliates or employees from buying, selling or trading in any"
"7279","securities for its or their own account.  The Fund"
"7280","acknowledges that the Investment Adviser and its directors,"
"7281","officers, affiliates, employees and other clients may, at any"
"7282","time, have, acquire, increase, decrease, or dispose of"
"7283","positions in investments which are at the same time being"
"7284","acquired or disposed of for one or more of the Portfolios."
"7285","The Investment Adviser shall have no obligation to acquire for"
"7286","a Portfolio a position in any investment which the Investment"
"7287","Adviser, its directors, officers, affiliates or employees may"
"7288","acquire for its or their own accounts or for the account of"
"7289","another client, so long as it continues to be the policy and"
"7290","practice of the Investment Adviser not to favor or disfavor"
"7291","consistently or consciously any client or class of clients in"
"7292","the allocation of investment opportunities so that, to the"
"7293","extent practical, such opportunities will be allocated among"
"7294","clients over a period of time on a fair and equitable basis."
"7295","      The Investment Adviser agrees that this Section 6"
"7296","does not constitute a waiver by the Fund of the obligations"
"7297","imposed upon the Investment Adviser to comply with Sections"
"7298","17(d) and 17(j) of the 1940 Act, and the rules thereunder, nor"
"7299","constitute a waiver by the Fund of the obligations imposed"
"7300","upon the Investment Adviser under Section 206 of the"
"7301","Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the rules thereunder."
"7302","Further, the Investment Adviser agrees that this Section 6"
"7303","does not constitute a waiver by the Fund of the fiduciary"
"7304","obligation of the Investment Adviser arising under federal or"
"7305","state law, including Section 36 of the 1940 Act.  The"
"7306","Investment Adviser agrees that this Section 6 shall be"
"7307","interpreted consistent with the provisions of Section 17(i) of"
"7308","the 1940 Act."
"7309","      SECTION 7.   BOOKS AND RECORDS.  In compliance with"
"7310","the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the"
"7311","Investment Adviser hereby agrees that all records which it"
"7312","maintains for the Portfolios are the property of the Fund and"
"7313","further agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any of such"
"7314","records upon the Fund's request.  The Investment Adviser"
"7315","further agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule"
"7316","31a-2 under the 1940 Act the records required to be maintained"
"7317","by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act."
"7318","      SECTION 8.   EXPENSES.  During the term of this"
"7319","Agreement, the Investment Adviser will pay all expenses"
"7320","incurred by it in connection with its activities under this"
"7321","Agreement.  Each Portfolio shall bear all of its own expenses"
"7322","not specifically assumed by the Investment Adviser.  General"
"7323","expenses of the Fund not readily identifiable as belonging to"
"7324","an investment portfolio of the Fund shall be allocated among"

"7377","Adviser shall at all times have all rights in and to a"

"7386","as investment adviser to a Portfolio, the name of such"
"7387","Portfolio will be changed to one that does not suggest an"

"7391","assumed pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the"
"7392","Portfolios, the Fund will pay the Investment Adviser from the"

"7394","accept as full compensation therefore a fee, computed daily"
"7395","and payable monthly, at the annual rate of the Portfolios'"
"7396","average daily net assets as specified on Schedule B of this"
"7397","Agreement.  For any period less than a full month during which"
"7398","this Agreement is in effect, the fee shall be prorated"
"7399","according to the proportion which such period bears to a full"
"7400","month."
"7401","         (b)   The fee attributable to a Portfolio shall"
"7402","be satisfied only against the assets of that Portfolio and not"
"7403","against the assets of any other investment portfolio of the"
"7404","Fund.  The Investment Adviser may from time to time agree not"
"7405","to impose all or a portion of its fee otherwise payable"
"7406","hereunder (in advance of the time such fee or portion thereof"

"7409","required to be borne or reimbursed by the Investment Adviser."
"7410","      SECTION 12.   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  The"
"7411","Investment Adviser shall not be liable for any error of"
"7412","judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the"
"7413","Fund in connection with the matters to which this Agreement"
"7414","relates, except a loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary"
"7415","duty with respect to the receipt of compensation for services"
"7416","or a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or"
"7417","gross negligence on the part of the Investment Adviser in the"
"7418","performance of its duties or from reckless disregard by it of"
"7419","its obligations and duties under this Agreement (disabling
conduct).  Each Portfolio will indemnify the Investment"
"7420","Adviser against and hold it harmless from any and all losses,"
"7421","claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (including reasonable"
"7422","counsel fees and expenses) resulting from any claim, demand,"
"7423","action or suit not resulting from disabling conduct by the"
"7424","Investment Adviser.  Indemnification shall be made only"
"7425","following:  (i) a final decision on the merits by a court or"
"7426","other body before whom the proceeding was brought that the"
"7427","Investment Adviser was not liable by reason of disabling"
"7428","conduct or (ii) in the absence of such a decision, a"
"7429","reasonable determination, based upon a review of the facts,"
"7430","that the Investment Adviser was not liable by reason of"
"7431","disabling conduct by (a) the vote of a majority of a quorum of"
"7432","directors of the Portfolio who are neither interested
persons of the Fund nor parties to the proceeding"
"7433","(disinterested non-party directors) or (b) an independent"
"7434","legal counsel in a written opinion.  The Investment Adviser"
"7435","shall be entitled to advances from a Portfolio for payment of"
"7436","the reasonable expenses incurred by it in connection with the"
"7437","matter as to which it is seeking indemnification in the manner"
"7438","and to the fullest extent permissible under the Maryland"
"7439","General Corporation Law.  The Investment Adviser shall provide"
"7440","to a Portfolio a written affirmation of its good faith belief"
"7441","that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by"
"7442","the Portfolio has been met and a written undertaking to repay"
"7443","any such advance if it should ultimately be determined that"
"7444","the standard of conduct has not been met.  In addition, at"
"7445","least one of the following additional conditions shall be met:"
"7446","(a) the Investment Adviser shall provide a security in form"
"7447","and amount acceptable to a Portfolio for its undertaking; (b)"
"7448","a Portfolio is insured against losses arising by reason of the"
"7449","advance; or (c) a majority of a quorum of disinterested non-"
"7450","party directors, or independent legal counsel, in a written"
"7451","opinion, shall have determined, based upon a review of facts"
"7452","readily available to a Portfolio at the time the advance is"
"7453","proposed to be made, that there is reason to believe that the"
"7454","Investment Adviser will ultimately be found to be entitled to"
"7455","indemnification.  Any amounts payable by a Portfolio under"
"7456","this Section 12 shall be satisfied only against the assets of"
"7457","that Portfolio and not against the assets of any other"
"7458","Portfolio or any other investment portfolio of the Fund."
"7459","      The limitations on liability and indemnification"
"7460","provisions of this Section 12 shall not be applicable to any"
"7461","losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses arising from"
"7462","the Investment Adviser's rights to a Portfolio's name.  The"
"7463","Investment Adviser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Fund"
"7464","and each Portfolio for any claims arising from the use of the"
"7465","term Robeco in the names of the Portfolios."
"7466","      SECTION 13.   DURATION AND TERMINATION.  This"
"7467","Agreement shall become effective with respect to each"
"7468","Portfolio as of the date first above written and, unless"
"7469","sooner terminated as provided herein, shall continue with"
"7470","respect to each Portfolio until August 16, 2014. Thereafter,"

"7473","August 16, provided such continuance is specifically approved"
"7474","at least annually (a) by the vote of a majority of those"
"7475","members of the Board of Directors of the Fund who are not"
"7476","parties to this Agreement or interested persons of any such"
"7477","party, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of"
"7478","voting on such approval, and (b) by the Board of Directors of"
"7479","the Fund or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting"
"7480","securities of the Portfolio; provided, however, that this"
"7481","Agreement may be terminated with respect to a Portfolio by the"
"7482","Fund at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by the"
"7483","Board of Directors of the Fund or by vote of a majority of the"
"7484","outstanding voting securities of the Portfolio, on 60 days'"
"7485","prior written notice to the Investment Adviser, or by the"
"7486","Investment Adviser at any time, without payment of any"
"7487","penalty, on 60 days' prior written notice to the Fund. This"
"7488","Agreement will immediately terminate in the event of its"
"7489","assignment. (As used in this Agreement, the terms majority of

"7497","permitted by the 1940 Act, no amendment of this Agreement"
"7498","affecting a Portfolio shall be effective until approved by"

"7615","            Sub-Advisory Agreement (this Agreement) entered"
"7616","into as of the  16th day of May, 2013, by and between Simple"
"7617","Alternatives, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the"

"7624","            WHEREAS, the Advisory Agreement provides that the"

"7628","            WHEREAS, pursuant to the authority granted to the"

"7631","desire to retain the Sub-Adviser to render portfolio"
"7632","management services to the Portfolio in the manner and on the"
"7633","terms set forth in this Agreement, and the Sub-Adviser is"
"7634","willing to provide such services."
"7635","            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and"
"7636","mutual covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto"
"7637","agree as follows:"
"7638","1.   Sub-Advisory Services."
"7639","(a)   The Adviser hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser to"
"7640","act as a sub-adviser to the Portfolio for the"
"7641","periods and on the terms herein set forth.  The"
"7642","Sub-Adviser accepts such appointment and agrees"
"7643","to render the services herein set forth, for the"
"7644","compensation herein provided."
"7645","(b)   The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to the"
"7646","supervision and oversight of the Adviser, manage"
"7647","the investment and reinvestment of such portion"
"7648","of the assets of the Portfolio, as the Adviser"
"7649","may from time to time allocate to the Sub-"
"7650","Adviser for management (the Sub-Advised
Assets).  The Sub-Adviser shall manage the Sub-"
"7651","Advised Assets in conformity with (i) the"
"7652","investment objective, policies and restrictions"
"7653","of the Portfolio set forth in the Portfolio's"
"7654","prospectus and statement of additional"
"7655","information, as they may be amended from time to"
"7656","time, any additional policies or guidelines,"
"7657","including without limitation compliance policies"
"7658","and procedures, established by the Adviser, the"
"7659","Fund's Chief Compliance Officer, or by the"
"7660","Fund's Board of Directors (Board) that have"
"7661","been furnished in writing to the Sub-Adviser,"
"7662","(ii) the asset diversification tests applicable"
"7663","to regulated investment companies pursuant to"
"7664","section 851(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code,"
"7665","(iii) the written instructions and directions"
"7666","received from the Adviser or the Fund as"
"7667","delivered; and (iv) the requirements of the"
"7668","Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act),"
"7669","the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers
Act), and all other applicable federal and"
"7670","state laws governing the performance of the Sub-"
"7671","Adviser's duties under this Agreement, all as"
"7672","may be in effect from time to time.  The"
"7673","foregoing are referred to below together as the"
"7674","Policies."
"7675","For purposes of compliance with the Policies,"
"7676","the Sub-Adviser shall be entitled to treat the"
"7677","Sub-Advised Assets as though the Sub-Advised"
"7678","Assets constituted the entire Portfolio, and the"
"7679","Sub-Adviser shall not be responsible in any way"
"7680","for the compliance of any assets of the"
"7681","Portfolio, other than the Sub-Advised Assets,"
"7682","with the Policies.  Subject to the foregoing,"
"7683","the Sub-Adviser is authorized, in its discretion"
"7684","and without prior consultation with the Adviser,"
"7685","to buy, sell, lend and otherwise trade in any"
"7686","stocks, bonds and other securities and"
"7687","investment instruments on behalf of the"
"7688","Portfolio, without regard to the length of time"
"7689","the securities have been held and the resulting"
"7690","rate of portfolio turnover or any tax"
"7691","considerations; and the majority or the whole of"
"7692","the Sub-Advised Assets may be invested in such"
"7693","proportions of stocks, bonds, other securities"
"7694","or investment instruments, or cash, as the Sub-"
"7695","Adviser shall determine.  Notwithstanding the"
"7696","foregoing provisions of this Section 1(b),"
"7697","however, (i) the Sub-Adviser shall, upon and in"
"7698","accordance with written instructions from the"
"7699","Adviser, effect such portfolio transactions for"
"7700","the Sub-Advised Assets as the Adviser shall"
"7701","determine are necessary in order for the"
"7702","Portfolio to comply with the Policies, and (ii)"
"7703","upon notice to the Sub-Adviser, the Adviser may"
"7704","effect in-kind redemptions with shareholders of"
"7705","the Portfolio with securities included within"
"7706","the Sub-Advised Assets or effect such portfolio"
"7707","transactions for the Sub-Advised Assets as the"
"7708","Adviser shall determine are necessary in order"
"7709","for the Portfolio to comply with the Policies."
"7710","(c)   Absent instructions from the Adviser or the"
"7711","officers of the Fund to the contrary, the Sub-"
"7712","Adviser shall place orders pursuant to its"
"7713","determinations either directly with the issuer"
"7714","or with any broker and/or dealer or other person"
"7715","who deals in the securities in which the"
"7716","Portfolio is trading.  In executing portfolio"
"7717","transactions and selecting brokers, dealers or"
"7718","other persons, the Sub-Adviser shall use its"
"7719","best judgment to obtain the best overall terms"
"7720","available.  In assessing the best overall terms"
"7721","available for any transaction, the Sub-Adviser"
"7722","shall consider all factors it deems relevant,"
"7723","including the breadth of the market in the"
"7724","security, the price of the security, the"
"7725","financial condition and execution capability of"
"7726","the broker or dealer, and the reasonableness of"
"7727","the commission, if any, both for the specific"
"7728","transaction and on a continuing basis.  In"
"7729","evaluating the best overall terms available and"
"7730","in selecting the broker or dealer to execute a"
"7731","particular transaction, the Sub-Adviser may also"
"7732","consider the brokerage and research services (as"
"7733","those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the"
"7734","Securities Exchange Act of 1934) provided to the"
"7735","Portfolio and/or other account over which the"
"7736","Sub-Adviser and/or an affiliate of the Sub-"
"7737","Adviser exercises investment discretion."
"7738","Brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser"
"7739","for the purchase and sale of securities or other"
"7740","investment instruments for the Sub-Advised"
"7741","Assets may include brokers or dealers affiliated"
"7742","with the Sub-Adviser, provided such orders"
"7743","comply with Rules 17e-1 and 10f-3 under the 1940"
"7744","Act and the Fund's Rule 17e-1 and Rule 10f-3"
"7745","Procedures, respectively, in all respects or any"
"7746","other applicable exemptive rules or orders"
"7747","applicable to the Sub-Adviser.  Notwithstanding"
"7748","the foregoing, the Sub-Adviser will not effect"
"7749","any transaction with a broker or dealer that is"
"7750","an affiliated person (as defined under the"
"7751","1940 Act) of the Sub-Adviser or the Adviser"
"7752","without the prior approval of the Adviser.  The"
"7753","Adviser shall provide the Sub-Adviser with a"
"7754","list of brokers or dealers that are affiliated"
"7755","persons of the Adviser."
"7756","(d)   The Sub-Adviser acknowledges that the Adviser"
"7757","and the Fund may rely on Rules 17a-7, 17a-10,"
"7758","10f-3 and 17e-1 under the 1940 Act, and the Sub-"
"7759","Adviser hereby agrees that it shall not consult"
"7760","with any other investment adviser to the Fund"
"7761","with respect to transactions in securities for"
"7762","the Sub-Advised Assets or any other transactions"
"7763","in the Fund's assets, other than for the"
"7764","purposes of complying with the conditions of"
"7765","paragraphs (a) and (b) of Rule 12d3-1 under the"
"7766","1940 Act."
"7767","(e)   The Sub-Adviser has provided the Adviser with a"
"7768","true and complete copy of its compliance"
"7769","policies and procedures for compliance with"
"7770","Rule 206(4)-7 of the Advisers Act (the Sub-
Adviser Compliance Policies).  The Sub-"

"7776","Sub-Adviser Compliance Policies;"
"7777","(ii)   a report of any compliance matter about"
"7778","which the Adviser or the Fund's Board of"
"7779","Directors would reasonably need to know to"
"7780","oversee Fund compliance, and that involves,"
"7781","without limitation:  (A) a violation of the"
"7782","securities laws by the Sub-Adviser or any"
"7783","of its officers, directors, employees or"
"7784","agents; (B) a violation of the Policies or"
"7785","the Sub-Adviser Compliance Policies by the"

"7791","Fund CCO may request) certification"
"7792","regarding the Sub-Adviser's compliance with"

"7794","Policies and this Agreement ."
"7795","(f)   The Sub-Adviser may, on occasions when it deems"
"7796","the purchase or sale of a security to be in the"
"7797","best interests of the Portfolio as well as other"

"7799","Adviser, aggregate, to the extent permitted by"

"7805","other securities.  In such event, allocation of"
"7806","the securities so purchased or sold, as well as"
"7807","the expenses incurred in the transaction, will"
"7808","be made by the Sub-Adviser in the manner it"
"7809","considers to be most fair and equitable over"
"7810","time to the Portfolio and to its other accounts."
"7811","(g)   The Sub-Adviser, in connection with its rights"

"7816","like capacity and familiar with such matters"
"7817","would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a"
"7818","like character and with like aims."
"7819","(h)   The services of the Sub-Adviser hereunder are"
"7820","not deemed exclusive and the Sub-Adviser shall"
"7821","be free to render similar services to others"
"7822","(including other investment companies) so long"
"7823","as its services under this Agreement are not"

"7825","enforcement of any non-compete agreement or"
"7826","other agreement or arrangement to which it is"
"7827","currently a party that restricts, limits, or"
"7828","otherwise interferes with the ability of the"
"7829","Adviser to employ or engage any person or entity"
"7830","to provide investment advisory or other services"
"7831","and will transmit to any person or entity notice"
"7832","of such waiver as may be required to give effect"
"7833","to this provision; and the Sub-Adviser will not"
"7834","become a party to any non-compete agreement or"
"7835","any other agreement, arrangement, or"
"7836","understanding that would restrict, limit, or"

"7848","upon, and agrees to review the Sub-Advised"

"7853","or their delegates for copies of the pertinent"
"7854","books and records maintained by the Sub-Adviser"

"8256","willing to provide such services."
"8257","            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and"
"8258","mutual covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto"
"8259","agree as follows:"
"8260","1.   Sub-Advisory Services."
"8261","(a)   The Adviser hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser to"
"8262","act as a sub-adviser to the Portfolio for the"
"8263","periods and on the terms herein set forth.  The"
"8264","Sub-Adviser accepts such appointment and agrees"
"8265","to render the services herein set forth, for the"
"8266","compensation herein provided."
"8267","(b)   The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to the"

"8278","time, any additional policies or guidelines,"
"8279","including without limitation compliance policies"
"8280","and procedures, established by the Adviser, the"
"8281","Fund's Chief Compliance Officer, or by the"
"8282","Board   that have been furnished in writing to"
"8283","the Sub-Adviser, (ii) the asset diversification"
"8284","tests applicable to regulated investment"
"8285","companies pursuant to section 851(b)(3) of the"
"8286","Internal Revenue Code, (iii) the written"
"8287","instructions and directions received from the"
"8288","Adviser or the Board as delivered to the Sub-"
"8289","Adviser; and (iv) the requirements of the"
"8290","Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act),"
"8291","the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers
Act), and all other applicable federal and"
"8292","state laws governing the performance of the Sub-"
"8293","Adviser's duties under this Agreement, all as"
"8294","may be in effect from time to time.  The"
"8295","foregoing are referred to below together as the"
"8296","Policies."
"8297","For purposes of compliance with the Policies,"
"8298","the Sub-Adviser shall be entitled to treat the"
"8299","Sub-Advised Assets as though the Sub-Advised"
"8300","Assets constituted the entire Portfolio, and the"
"8301","Sub-Adviser shall not be responsible in any way"
"8302","for the compliance of any assets of the"
"8303","Portfolio, other than the Sub-Advised Assets,"
"8304","with the Policies.  Subject to the foregoing,"
"8305","the Sub-Adviser is authorized, in its discretion"
"8306","and without prior consultation with the Adviser,"
"8307","to buy, sell, lend and otherwise trade in any"
"8308","stocks, bonds and other securities and"
"8309","investment instruments on behalf of the"
"8310","Portfolio, without regard to the length of time"
"8311","the securities have been held and the resulting"
"8312","rate of portfolio turnover or any tax"
"8313","considerations; and the majority or the whole of"
"8314","the Sub-Advised Assets may be invested in such"
"8315","proportions of stocks, bonds, other securities"
"8316","or investment instruments, or cash, as the Sub-"
"8317","Adviser shall determine.  Notwithstanding the"
"8318","foregoing provisions of this Section 1(b),"
"8319","however, (i) the Sub-Adviser shall, upon and in"
"8320","accordance with written instructions from the"
"8321","Adviser, effect such portfolio transactions for"
"8322","the Sub-Advised Assets as the Adviser shall"
"8323","determine are necessary in order for the"
"8324","Portfolio to comply with the Policies, and (ii)"
"8325","upon notice to the Sub-Adviser, the Adviser may"
"8326","effect in-kind redemptions with shareholders of"
"8327","the Portfolio with securities included within"
"8328","the Sub-Advised Assets or effect such portfolio"
"8329","transactions for the Sub-Advised Assets as the"
"8330","Adviser shall determine are necessary in order"
"8331","for the Portfolio to comply with the Policies."
"8332","(c)   Absent instructions from the Adviser or the"
"8333","officers of the Fund to the contrary, the Sub-"
"8334","Adviser shall place orders pursuant to its"
"8335","determinations either directly with the issuer"
"8336","or with any broker and/or dealer or other person"
"8337","who deals in the securities in which the"
"8338","Portfolio is trading.  In executing portfolio"
"8339","transactions and selecting brokers, dealers or"
"8340","other persons, the Sub-Adviser shall use its"
"8341","best judgment to obtain the best overall terms"
"8342","available.  In assessing the best overall terms"
"8343","available for any transaction, the Sub-Adviser"
"8344","shall consider all factors it deems relevant,"
"8345","including the breadth of the market in the"
"8346","security, the price of the security, the"
"8347","financial condition and execution capability of"
"8348","the broker or dealer, and the reasonableness of"
"8349","the commission, if any, both for the specific"
"8350","transaction and on a continuing basis.  In"
"8351","evaluating the best overall terms available and"
"8352","in selecting the broker or dealer to execute a"
