"515","Report of Independent"
"516","Registered Public"
"517","Accounting Firm"
"518","To the Board of"
"519","Trustees of Two Roads"
"520","Shared Trust"
"521","and the Shareholders of"
"522","Anfield Universal Fixed"
"523","Income Fund"
"524","In planning and"
"525","performing our audit of"
"526","the financial statements"
"527","of Anfield Universal"
"528","Fixed Income Fund (the"
"529","Fund), a series of the"
"530","Two Roads Shared"
"531","Trust, as of and for the"
"532","year ended October 31,"
"533","2015, in accordance"
"534","with the standards of"
"535","the Public Company"
"536","Accounting Oversight"
"537","Board (United States),"
"538","we considered the"
"539","Fund's internal control"
"540","over financial reporting,"
"541","including controls over"
"542","safeguarding securities,"
"543","as a basis for designing"
"544","our auditing procedures"
"545","for the purpose of"
"546","expressing our opinion"
"547","on the financial"
"548","statements and to"
"549","comply with the"
"550","requirements of Form"
"551","N-SAR, but not for the"
"552","purpose of expressing"
"553","an opinion on the"
"554","effectiveness of the"
"555","Fund's internal control"
"556","over financial reporting."
"557","Accordingly, we express"
"558","no such opinion."
"559","The management of the"
"560","Fund is responsible for"
"561","establishing and"
"562","maintaining effective"
"563","internal control over"
"564","financial reporting. In"
"565","fulfilling this"
"566","responsibility, estimates"
"567","and judgments by"
"568","management are"
"569","required to assess the"
"570","expected benefits and"
"571","related costs of"
"572","controls. A fund's"
"573","internal control over"
"574","financial reporting is a"
"575","process designed to"
"576","provide reasonable"
"577","assurance regarding the"
"578","reliability of financial"
"579","reporting and the"
"580","preparation of financial"
"581","statements for external"
"582","purposes in accordance"
"583","with generally accepted"
"584","accounting principles"
"585","(GAAP). A fund's"
"586","internal control over"
"587","financial reporting"
"588","includes those policies"
"589","and procedures that (a)"
"590","pertain to the"
"591","maintenance of records"
"592","that, in reasonable"
"593","detail, accurately and"
"594","fairly reflect the"
"595","transactions and"
"596","dispositions of the"
"597","assets of the fund; (b)"
"598","provide reasonable"
"599","assurance that"
"600","transactions are"
"601","recorded as necessary"
"602","to permit preparation of"
"603","financial statements in"
"604","accordance with GAAP,"
"605","and that receipts and"
"606","expenditures of the fund"
"607","are being made only in"
"608","accordance with"
"609","authorizations of"
"610","management and"
"611","directors of the fund;"
"612","and (c) provide"
"613","reasonable assurance"
"614","regarding prevention or"
"615","timely detection of"
"616","unauthorized"
"617","acquisition, use or"
"618","disposition of a fund's"
"619","assets that could have a"
"620","material effect on the"
"621","financial statements."
"622","Because of inherent"
"623","limitations, internal"
"624","control over financial"
"625","reporting may not"
"626","prevent or detect"
"627","misstatements. Also,"
"628","projections of"
"629","effectiveness to future"
"630","periods are subject to"
"631","the risk that controls"
"632","may become"
"633","inadequate because of"
"634","changes in conditions,"
"635","or that the degree of"
"636","compliance with the"
"637","policies or procedures"
"638","may deteriorate."
"639","A deficiency in internal"
"640","control over financial"
"641","reporting exists when"
"642","the design or operation"
"643","of a control does not"
"644","allow management or"
"645","employees, in the"
"646","normal course of"
"647","performing their"
"648","assigned functions, to"
"649","prevent or detect"
"650","misstatements on a"
"651","timely basis. A material"
"652","weakness is a"
"653","deficiency, or"
"654","combination of"
"655","deficiencies, in internal"
"656","control over financial"
"657","reporting, such that"
"658","there is a reasonable"
"659","possibility that a"
"660","material misstatement"
"661","of the Fund's annual or"
"662","interim financial"
"663","statements will not be"
"664","prevented or detected"
"665","on a timely basis."
"666","Our consideration of the"
"667","Fund's internal control"
"668","over financial reporting"
"669","was for the limited"
"670","purpose described in"
"671","the first paragraph and"
"672","would not necessarily"
"673","identify all deficiencies"
"674","in internal control that"
"675","might be material"
"676","weaknesses under"
"677","standards established"
"678","by the Public Company"
"679","Accounting Oversight"
"680","Board (United States)."
"681","However, we noted no"
"682","deficiencies in the"
"683","Fund's internal control"
"684","over financial reporting"
"685","and its operation,"
"686","including controls over"
"687","safeguarding of"
"688","securities that we"
"689","consider to be a"
"690","material weakness as"
"691","defined above as of"
"692","October 31, 2015."
"693","This report is intended"
"694","solely for the"
"695","information and use of"
"696","management and the"
"697","Board of Trustees of the"
"698","Fund and the Securities"
"699","and Exchange"
"700","Commission and is not"
"701","intended to be and"
"702","should not be used by"
"703","anyone other than these"
"704","specified parties."
