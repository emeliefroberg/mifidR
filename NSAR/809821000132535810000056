"1101","<PRE>"
"1102","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1103","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1104","Delaware Group Equity Funds V"
"1105","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Delaware Group Equity Funds V (the Trust) as of and for the"
"1106","year ended November 30, 2009, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1107","States), we considered its internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1108","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1109","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control"
"1110","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1111","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1112","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"1113","costs of controls.  A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1114","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"1115","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1116","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"1117","and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1118","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1119","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"1120","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"1121","disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1122","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"1123","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"1124","because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1125","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1126","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1127","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1128","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements"
"1129","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1130","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1131","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1132","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"1133","the Trust's internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we"
"1134","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of November 30, 2009."
"1135","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the Board of Trustees of the Trust and the Securities"
"1136","and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1186","DELAWARE GROUP EQUITY FUNDS V"
"1187","         The undersigned Trustees of Delaware Group Equity Funds V, a Delaware statutory trust"
"1188","(the Trust), constituting a majority of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, do hereby certify that"
"1189","pursuant to the authority granted to the Trustees in Article VIII, Section 5 of the Agreement and"
"1190","Declaration of Trust of the Trust made as of December 17, 1998, as amended November 15, 2006"
"1191","(the Declaration of Trust), the Declaration of Trust is hereby amended as follows:"
"1192","	FIRST.	ARTICLE IV, Section 3 of the Declaration of Trust is hereby amended by"
"1193","adding the following at the end thereof:"
"1194","	The Trustees shall be subject to the same fiduciary duties to which the directors of a Delaware"
"1195","corporation would be subject if the Trust were a Delaware corporation, the Shareholders were"
"1196","shareholders of such Delaware corporation and the Trustees were directors of such Delaware"
"1197","corporation, and such modified duties shall replace any fiduciary duties to which the Trustees would"
"1198","otherwise be subject.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all actions and omissions of the"
"1199","Trustees shall be evaluated under the doctrine commonly referred to as the business judgment rule, as"
"1200","defined and developed under Delaware law, to the same extent that the same actions or omissions of"
"1201","directors of a Delaware corporation in a substantially similar circumstance would be evaluated under"
"1202","such doctrine.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Declaration of Trust and the By-"
"1203","Laws, to the extent that they restrict or eliminate the duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities"
"1204","relating thereto of a Trustee otherwise applicable under the foregoing standard or otherwise existing at"
"1205","law or in equity, are agreed by each Shareholder and the Trust to replace such other duties and liabilities"
"1206","of such Trustee."
"1207","	SECOND.	ARTICLE VIII, Section 7 of the Declaration of Trust is hereby amended by"
"1208","deleting such provision in its entirety and replacing it with the following:"
"1209","	Section 7.	Applicable Law.  This Declaration of Trust is created under and is to be"
"1210","governed by and construed and administered according to the laws of the State of Delaware and the"
"1211","applicable provisions of the 1940 Act and the Code; provided, that, all matters relating to or in"
"1212","connection with the conduct of Shareholders' and Trustees' meetings (excluding, however, the"
"1213","Shareholders' right to vote), including, without limitation, matters relating to or in connection with record"
"1214","dates, notices to Shareholders or Trustees, nominations and elections of Trustees, voting by, and the"
"1215","validity of, Shareholder proxies, quorum requirements, meeting adjournments, meeting postponements"
"1216","and inspectors, which are not specifically addressed in this Declaration of Trust, in the By-Laws or in"
"1217","the DSTA (other than DSTA Section 3809), or as to which an ambiguity exists, shall be governed by"
"1218","the Delaware General Corporation Law, and judicial interpretations thereunder, as if the Trust were a"
"1219","Delaware corporation, the Shareholders were shareholders of such Delaware corporation and the"
"1220","Trustees were directors of such Delaware corporation; provided, further, however, that there shall not"
"1221","be applicable to the Trust, the Trustees, the Shareholders or any other Person or to this Declaration of"
"1222","Trust or the By-Laws (a) the provisions of Sections 3533, 3540 and 3583(a) of Title 12 of the"
"1223","Delaware Code or (b) any provisions of the laws (statutory or common) of the State of Delaware (other"
"1224","than the DSTA) pertaining to trusts which relate to or regulate (i) the filing with any court or"
"1225","governmental body or agency of trustee accounts or schedules of trustee fees and charges, (ii)"
"1226","affirmative requirements to post bonds for trustees, officers, agents or employees of a trust, (iii) the"
"1227","necessity for obtaining court or other governmental approval concerning the acquisition, holding or"
"1228","disposition of real or personal property, (iv) fees or other sums payable to trustees, officers, agents or"
"1229","employees of a trust, (v) the allocation of receipts and expenditures to income or principal, (vi)"
"1230","restrictions or limitations on the permissible nature, amount or concentration of trust investments or"
"1231","requirements relating to the titling, storage or other manner of holding of trust assets, or (vii) the"
"1232","establishment of fiduciary or other standards or responsibilities or limitations on the indemnification, acts"
"1233","or powers of trustees or other Persons, which are inconsistent with the limitations of liabilities or"
"1234","authorities and powers of the Trustees or officers of the Trust set forth or referenced in this Declaration"
"1235","of Trust or the By-Laws.  The Trust shall be a Delaware statutory trust pursuant to the DSTA, and"
"1236","without limiting the provisions hereof, the Trust may exercise all powers that are ordinarily exercised by"
"1237","such a statutory trust."
"1238","	THIRD.	This Certificate of Amendment may be signed in one or more counterparts,"
"1239","each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same"
"1240","instrument."

"1284","         The undersigned Trustees of Delaware Group Equity Funds V, a Delaware statutory trust"
"1285","(the Trust), constituting a majority of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, do hereby certify that"
"1286","pursuant to the authority granted to the Trustees in Article VIII, Section 5 of the Agreement and"
"1287","Declaration of Trust of the Trust made as of December 17, 1998, as amended to date (the Declaration
of Trust), the Declaration of Trust is hereby amended as follows:"
"1288","	FIRST.	ARTICLE III, Section 6(b) is amended by replacing the first paragraph with the"
"1289","following:"
"1290","	(b) Liabilities Held with Respect to a Particular Series.  The assets of the Trust held with respect"
"1291","to each particular Series shall be charged against the liabilities of the Trust held with respect to that"
"1292","Series and all expenses, costs, charges, and reserves attributable to that Series, and any liabilities,"
"1293","expenses, costs, charges and reserves of the Trust which are not readily identifiable as being held with"
"1294","respect to any particular Series (collectively, General Liabilities) shall be allocated and charged by the"
"1295","Board of Trustees to and among any one or more of the Series in such manner and on such basis as the"
"1296","Board of Trustees in its sole discretion deems fair and equitable.  The liabilities, expenses, costs,"
"1297","charges and reserves so charged to a Series are herein referred to as liabilities held with respect to"
"1298","that Series.  Each allocation of liabilities, expenses, costs, charges and reserves by the Board of"

"1300","Persons who have extended credit which has been allocated to a particular Series, or who have a claim"
