"593","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"594","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"595","Putnam Equity Income Fund:"
"596","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"597","of Putnam Equity Income Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year"
"598","ended November 30, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the"
"599","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"600","considered the Funds internal control over financial reporting,"
"601","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"602","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"603","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"604","requirements of Form N SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"605","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"606","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no"
"607","such opinion."
"608","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"609","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"610","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"611","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"612","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"613","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"614","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"615","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"616","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"617","A companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"618","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"619","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"620","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"621","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"622","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"623","financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"624","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"625","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"626","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"627","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"628","or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material"
"629","effect on the financial statements."
"630","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"631","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"632","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"633","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"634","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"635","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"636","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"637","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"638","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"639","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"640","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"641","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"642","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"643","material misstatement of a funds annual or interim financial"
"644","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"645","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"646","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"647","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"648","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"649","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"650","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"651","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"652","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"653","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"654","November 30, 2014."
"655","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"656","management and the Board of Trustees of Putnam Equity Income"
"657","Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"658","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"659","specified parties."

"978","debt or duty that is intended to be secured thereby.  Such new"
"979","certificate shall express on its face that it is held as collateral"
"980","security, and the name of the pledgor shall be stated thereon, who"
"981","alone shall be liable as a Shareholder and entitled to vote thereon."

"1139","       12.1  General.  Each class of Shares of the Trust or of a"
"1140","particular series of the Trust, as the case may be, will represent"

"1142","series) and be identical in all respects, except as set forth in the"
"1143","Rule 18f 3 Plan (the Plan) of the Trust, as amended from time to time."
"1144"," The Plan is incorporated herein by reference and any amendments to"

"1541","ARTICLE V"
"1542","Shareholders Voting Powers and Meetings"
"1543","Voting Powers"
"1544","       Section 1.	Subject to the voting powers of one or more classes of"
"1545","Shares as set forth elsewhere in this Declaration of Trust or in the"
"1546","Bylaws, the Shareholders shall have power to vote only (i) for the"
"1547","election of Trustees as provided in Article IV, Section 1, (ii) for"
"1548","the removal of Trustees as provided in Article IV, Section 2, (iii)"
"1549","with respect to any Manager as provided in Article IV, Section 6, (iv)"
"1550","with respect to any termination of this Trust to the extent and as"
"1551","provided in Article IX, Section 4, (v) with respect to any amendment"
"1552","of this Declaration of Trust to the extent and as provided in Article"
"1553","IX, Section 8, and (vi) with respect to such additional matters"
"1554","relating to the Trust as may be required by this Declaration of Trust,"
"1555","the Bylaws or any registration of the Trust with the Securities and"
"1556","Exchange Commission (or any successor agency) or any state, or as the"
"1557","Trustees may consider necessary or desirable.  Each whole Share shall"
"1558","be entitled to one vote as to any matter on which it is entitled to"
"1559","vote and each fractional Share shall be entitled to a proportionate"
"1560","fractional vote.  On any matter submitted to a vote of Shareholders,"
"1561","all Shares of the Trust then entitled to vote shall, except as"
"1562","otherwise provided in the Bylaws, be voted in the aggregate as a"
"1563","single class without regard to series or classes of shares, except (1)"
"1564","when required by the 1940 Act or when the Trustees shall have"
"1565","determined that the matter affects one or more series or classes of"
"1566","Shares materially differently, Shares shall be voted by individual"
"1567","series or class; and (2) when the Trustees have determined that the"
"1568","matter affects only the interests of one or more series or classes,"
"1569","only Shareholders of such series or classes shall be entitled to vote"
"1570","thereon.  There shall be no cumulative voting in the election of"
"1571","Trustees.  Shares may be voted in person or by proxy.  A proxy with"
"1572","respect to Shares held in the name of two or more persons shall be"
"1573","valid if executed by any one of them unless at or prior to exercise of"
"1574","the proxy the Trust receives a specific written notice to the contrary"
"1575","from any one of them.  A proxy purporting to be executed by or on"
"1576","behalf of a Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or"
"1577","prior to its exercise and, in the case of a challenge by any person"
"1578","other than the Trust, the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on"
"1579","the challenger.  Until Shares of any series or class are issued, the"
"1580","Trustees may exercise all rights of Shareholders and may take any"
"1581","action required by law, this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws to be"
"1582","taken by Shareholders as to such series or class."
"1583","Voting Power and Meetings"
"1584","       Section 2.	Meetings of Shareholders of any or all series or classes"
"1585","may be called by the Trustees from time to time for the purpose of"
"1586","taking action upon any matter requiring the vote or authority of the"
"1587","Shareholders of such series or classes as herein provided or upon any"
"1588","other matter deemed by the Trustees to be necessary or desirable."
"1589","Written notice of any meeting of Shareholders shall be given or caused"
"1590","to be given by the Trustees by mailing such notice at least seven days"
"1591","before such meeting, postage prepaid, stating the time, place and"
"1592","purpose of the meeting, to each Shareholder entitled to vote at such"
"1593","meeting at the Shareholders address as it appears on the records of"
"1594","the Trust.  If the Trustees shall fail to call or give notice of any"
"1595","meeting of Shareholders for a period of 30 days after written"
"1596","application by Shareholders holding at least 10% of the then"
"1597","outstanding shares of all series and classes entitled to vote at such"
"1598","meeting requesting a meeting to be called for a purpose requiring"
"1599","action by the Shareholders as provided herein or in the Bylaws, then"
"1600","Shareholders holding at least 10% of the then outstanding Shares of"
"1601","all series and classes entitled to vote at such meeting may call and"
"1602","give notice of such meeting, and thereupon the meeting shall be held"
"1603","in the manner provided for herein in case of call thereof by the"
"1604","Trustees.  Notice of a meeting need not be given to any Shareholder if"
"1605","a written waiver of notice, executed by him or her before or after the"
"1606","meeting, is filed with the records of the meeting, or to any"
"1607","Shareholder who attends the meeting without protesting prior thereto"
"1608","or at its commencement the lack of notice to him or her."
"1609","Quorum and Required Vote"
"1610","       Section 3.	Thirty percent of Shares entitled to vote on a particular"
"1611","matter shall be a quorum for the transaction of business on that"
"1612","matter at a Shareholders meeting, except that where any provision of"
"1613","law or of this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws requires that"
"1614","holders of any series or class shall vote as an individual series or"
"1615","class, then thirty percent of the aggregate number of Shares of that"
"1616","series or class entitled to vote shall be necessary to constitute a"
"1617","quorum for the transaction of business by that series or class.  Any"
"1618","lesser number shall be sufficient for adjournments.  Any adjourned"
"1619","session or sessions may be held, within a reasonable time after the"
"1620","date set for the original meeting, without the necessity of further"
"1621","notice.  Except when a larger vote is required by any provision of law"
"1622","or of this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws, a majority of the"
"1623","Shares voted shall decide any questions and a plurality shall elect a"
"1624","Trustee, provided that where any provision of law or of this"
"1625","Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws requires that the holders of any"
"1626","series or class shall vote as an individual series or class then a"
"1627","majority of the Shares of that series or class voted on the matter (or"
"1628","a plurality with respect to the election of a Trustee) shall decide"
"1629","that matter insofar as that series or class is concerned."
"1630","Action by Written Consent"
"1631","       Section 4.	Any action taken by Shareholders may be taken without a"
"1632","meeting if a majority of Shareholders entitled to vote on the matter"
"1633","(or such larger proportion thereof as shall be required by any express"
"1634","provision of this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws) consent to the"
"1635","action in writing and such written consents are filed with the records"
"1636","of the meetings of Shareholders.  Such consent shall be treated for"
"1637","all purposes as a vote taken at a meeting of Shareholders."
"1638","Additional Provisions"
"1639","       Section 5.	The Bylaws may include further provisions, not"
"1640","inconsistent with this Declaration of Trust, regarding Shareholders"
"1641","voting powers, the conduct of meetings and related matters."
"1642","ARTICLE VI"
"1643","Distributions, Redemptions and Repurchases"
"1644","Distributions"
"1645","       Section 1.	The Trustees may each year, or more frequently if they so"
"1646","determine, distribute to the Shareholders of each series out of the"
"1647","assets of such series such amounts as the Trustees may determine.  Any"
"1648","such distribution to the Shareholders of a particular series shall be"
"1649","made to said Shareholders pro rata in proportion to the number of"
"1650","Shares of such series held by each of them, except to the extent"
"1651","otherwise required or permitted by the preferences and special or"
"1652","relative rights and privileges of any classes of Shares of that"
"1653","Series, and any distribution to the Shareholders of a particular class"
"1654","of Shares shall be made to such Shareholders pro rata in proportion to"
"1655","the number of Shares of such class held by each of them.  Such"
"1656","distributions shall be made in cash, Shares or other property, or a"
"1657","combination thereof, as determined by the Trustees.  Any such"
"1658","distribution paid in Shares will be paid at the net asset value"
"1659","thereof as determined in accordance with the Bylaws."
"1660","Redemptions and Repurchases"
"1661","       Section 2.	The Trust shall purchase such Shares as are offered by"
"1662","any Shareholder for redemption, upon the presentation of any"
"1663","certificate for the Shares to be purchased, a proper instrument of"
"1664","transfer and a request directed to the Trust or a person designated by"
"1665","the Trust that the Trust purchase such Shares, or in accordance with"
"1666","such other procedures for redemption as the Trustees may from time to"
"1667","time authorize; and the Trust will pay therefor the net asset value"
"1668","thereof, as next determined in accordance with the Bylaws, less any"
"1669","redemption charge fixed by the Trustees.  Payment for said Shares"
"1670","shall be made by the Trust to the Shareholder within seven days after"
"1671","the date on which the request is made.  The obligation set forth in"
"1672","this Section 2 is subject to the provision that in the event that at"
"1673","any time the New York Stock Exchange is closed for other than"
"1674","customary weekends or holidays, or, if permitted by rules of the"
"1675","Securities and Exchange Commission, during periods when trading on the"
"1676","Exchange is restricted or during any emergency which makes it"
"1677","impractical for the Trust to dispose of its investments or to"
"1678","determine fairly the value of its net assets, or during any other"
"1679","period permitted by order of the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"1680","for the protection of investors, such obligation may be suspended or"
"1681","postponed by the Trustees.  The Trust may also purchase or repurchase"
"1682","Shares at a price not exceeding the net asset value of such Shares in"
"1683","effect when the purchase or repurchase or any contract to purchase or"
"1684","repurchase is made.  Payment for any redemption, purchase or"
"1685","repurchase may be made in cash or, except to the extent prohibited by"
"1686","the laws of any jurisdiction in which Shares are registered for sale,"
"1687","in other property, or any combination thereof.  The composition of any"
"1688","such payment shall be determined by the Trust in its sole discretion,"
"1689","and the Trust shall have no obligation to effect a pro rata division"
"1690","of cash or other property in making any such payment.  In no event"
"1691","shall the Trust be liable for any delay of any other person in"
"1692","transferring securities or other property selected for delivery as all"
"1693","or part of any such payment."
"1694","Redemption at the Option of the Trust"
"1695","       Section 3.	The Trust shall have the right at its option and at any"
"1696","time to redeem Shares of any Shareholder at the net asset value"
"1697","thereof as determined in accordance with the Bylaws: (i) if at such"
"1698","time such Shareholder owns fewer Shares than, or Shares having an"
"1699","aggregate net asset value of less than, an amount determined from time"
"1700","to time by the Trustees, in which case the Trust may redeem all Shares"
"1701","owned by such Shareholder or only so many of such Shares as may be"
"1702","required to compensate the Trust for any fee fixed from time to time"
"1703","by the Trustees for the maintenance of small accounts; (ii) to the"
"1704","extent that such Shareholder owns Shares of a particular series of"
"1705","Shares equal to or in excess of a percentage of the outstanding Shares"
"1706","of that series determined from time to time by the Trustees; (iii) to"
"1707","the extent that such Shareholder owns Shares of the Trust representing"
"1708","a percentage equal to or in excess of such percentage of the aggregate"
"1709","number of outstanding Shares of the Trust or the aggregate net asset"
"1710","value of the Trust determined from time to time by the Trustees; (iv)"
"1711","if such Shareholder fails to supply appropriate personal and tax"
"1712","identification information requested by the Trust; (v) if such"
"1713","Shareholder fails to meet or maintain the qualifications for ownership"
"1714","of a particular series or class; or (vi) if the Trustees determine for"
"1715","any other reason, in their sole discretion, that the ownership of"
"1716","Shares by a Shareholder is not in the best interests of the remaining"
"1717","Shareholders of the Trust or of the applicable series or class."
"1718","ARTICLE VII"
"1719","Compensation and Limitation of Liability of Trustees"
"1720","Compensation"
"1721","       Section 1.	The Trustees as such shall be entitled to reasonable"
"1722","compensation from the Trust; they may fix the amount of their"
"1723","compensation.  Nothing herein shall in any way prevent the employment"
"1724","of any Trustee for advisory, management, legal, accounting, investment"
"1725","banking or other services and payment for the same by the Trust."
"1726","Limitation of Liability"
"1727","       Section 2.	A Trustee shall be liable for his or her own willful"
"1728","misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the"
"1729","duties involved in the conduct of the office of Trustee, and for"
"1730","nothing else.  The Trustees shall not be responsible or liable in any"
"1731","event for any neglect or wrongdoing of any officer, agent, employee,"
"1732","manager or principal underwriter of the Trust, nor shall any Trustee"
"1733","be responsible for the act or omission of any other Trustee. The"
"1734","appointment, designation or identification of a Trustee as an officer"
"1735","of the Trustees or of any committee of the Trustees, or as an expert"
"1736","with respect to certain matters (including without limitation"
"1737","identification of a Trustee as an audit committee financial expert)"
"1738","shall not impose on that person any duty, obligation or liability that"
"1739","is greater than the duties, obligations and liabilities imposed on"
"1740","that person as a Trustee in the absence of such appointment,"
"1741","designation or identification, and no Trustee who has special skills"
"1742","or expertise or who is appointed, designated of identified as"
"1743","aforesaid, shall be held to a higher standard of care by virtue"
"1744","thereof or be limited in any way with respect to any right or"
"1745","privilege to which such person would otherwise be entitled as a"
"1746","Trustee hereunder, including without limitation the right of"
"1747","indemnification. Nothing herein contained shall protect any Trustee"
"1748","against any liability to which he or she would otherwise be subject by"
"1749","reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless"
"1750","disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office."
"1751","ARTICLE VIII"
"1752","Indemnification"
"1753","Trustees, Officers, etc."
"1754","       Section 1.	The Trust shall indemnify each of its Trustees and"
"1755","officers (including persons who serve at the Trusts request as"
"1756","directors, officers or trustees of another organization in which the"
"1757","Trust has any interest as a shareholder, creditor or otherwise)"
"1758","(hereinafter referred to as a Covered Person) against all liabilities"
"1759","and expenses, including but not limited to amounts paid in"
"1760","satisfaction of judgments, in compromise or as fines and penalties,"
"1761","and counsel fees reasonably incurred by any Covered Person in"
"1762","connection with the defense or disposition of any threatened, pending,"
"1763","or contemplated action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,"
"1764","administrative, arbitrative, or investigative and whether formal or"
"1765","informal before any court or administrative or legislative or other"
"1766","body, in which such Covered Person may be or may have been involved as"
"1767","a party or otherwise or with which such Covered Person may be or may"
"1768","have been threatened, while in office or thereafter, by reason of"
"1769","being or having been such a Covered Person except with respect to any"
"1770","matter as to which such Covered Person shall have been finally"
"1771","adjudicated in any such action, suit or other proceeding (a) not to"
"1772","have acted in good faith, (b) not to have acted in the reasonable"
"1773","belief that such Covered Persons action was in the best interests of"
"1774","the Trust or at least was not opposed to the best interests of the"
"1775","Trust, (c) in the case of a criminal proceeding, to have had"
"1776","reasonable cause to believe his or her action was unlawful or (d) to"
"1777","be liable to the Trust or its Shareholders by reason of willful"
"1778","misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the"
"1779","duties involved in the conduct of such Covered Persons office (each of"
"1780","such exceptions being referred to hereinafter as Disabling Conduct)."
"1781","Expenses, including counsel fees so incurred by any such Covered"
"1782","Person (but excluding amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in"
"1783","compromise or as fines or penalties), shall be paid from time to time"
"1784","by the Trust in advance of the final disposition of any such action,"
"1785","suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of"
"1786","such Covered Person to repay amounts so paid to the Trust if it is"
"1787","ultimately determined that indemnification of such expenses is not"
"1788","authorized under this Article, provided, however, that either (a) such"
"1789","Covered Person shall have provided appropriate security for such"
"1790","undertaking, (b) the Trust shall be insured against losses arising"
"1791","from any such advance payments or (c) either a majority of the"
"1792","disinterested Trustees acting on the matter (provided that a majority"
"1793","of the disinterested Trustees then in office act on the matter), or"
"1794","independent legal counsel in a written opinion, shall have determined,"
"1795","based upon a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full"
"1796","trial type inquiry) that there is reason to believe that such Covered"
"1797","Person will be found entitled to indemnification under this Article."
"1798","In making any such determination, the disinterested Trustees or such"
"1799","counsel, as the case may be, shall afford the Covered Person a"
"1800","rebuttable presumption that the Covered Person did not engage in"
"1801","Disabling Conduct."
"1802","Compromise Payment"
"1803","       Section 2.	As to any matter disposed of (whether by a compromise"
"1804","payment, pursuant to a consent decree or otherwise) without an"
"1805","adjudication by a court, or by any other body before which the action,"
"1806","suit, or proceeding was brought, that such Covered Person engaged in"
"1807","Disabling Conduct, indemnification shall be provided if (a) approved"
"1808","as in the best interests of the Trust, after notice that it involves"
"1809","such indemnification, by at least a majority of the disinterested"
"1810","Trustees acting on the matter (provided that a majority of the"
"1811","disinterested Trustees then in office act on the matter) upon a"
"1812","determination, based upon a review of readily available facts (as"
"1813","opposed to a full trial type inquiry) that such Covered Person did not"
"1814","engage in Disabling Conduct, or (b) there has been obtained an opinion"
"1815","in writing of independent legal counsel, based upon a review of"
"1816","readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial type inquiry) to"
"1817","the effect that such Covered Person did not engage in Disabling"
"1818","Conduct.  Any approval pursuant to this Section shall not prevent the"
"1819","recovery from any Covered Person of any amount paid to such Covered"
"1820","Person in accordance with this Section as indemnification if such"
"1821","Covered Person is subsequently adjudicated by a court of competent"
"1822","jurisdiction not to have engaged in Disabling Conduct."
"1823","Right Not Exclusive"
"1824","       Section 3.	The right of indemnification hereby provided shall not be"
"1825","exclusive of or affect any other rights to which such Covered Person"
"1826","may be entitled.  As used in this Article VIII, the term Covered"
"1827","Person shall include such persons heirs, executors and administrators"
"1828","and a disinterested Trustee is a Trustee who is not an interested"
"1829","person of the Trust as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (or"
"1830","who has been exempted from being an interested person by any rule,"
"1831","regulation or order of the Securities and Exchange Commission) and"
"1832","against whom none of such actions, suits or other proceedings or"
"1833","another action, suit or other proceeding on the same or similar"
"1834","grounds is then or has been pending.  Nothing contained in this"
"1835","Article shall affect any rights to indemnification to which personnel"
"1836","of the Trust, other than Trustees or officers, and other persons may"
"1837","be entitled by contract or otherwise under law, nor the power of the"
"1838","Trust to purchase and maintain liability insurance on behalf of any"
"1839","such person."
"1840","Shareholders"
"1841","       Section 4.	In case any Shareholder or former Shareholder shall be"
"1842","held to be personally liable solely by reason of his or her being or"
"1843","having been a Shareholder and not because of his or her acts or"
"1844","omissions or for some other reason, the Shareholder or former"
"1845","Shareholder (or his or her heirs, executors, administrators or other"
"1846","legal representative or in the case of a corporation or other entity,"
"1847","its corporate or other general successor) shall be entitled to be held"
"1848","harmless from and indemnified against all loss and expense arising"
"1849","from such liability, but only out of the assets of the particular"
"1850","series of Shares of which he or she is or was a Shareholder."

"1859","claim, and neither the Shareholders nor the Trustees, nor any of the"
"1860","Trusts officers, employees or agents, whether past, present or future,"
"1861","shall be personally liable therefor."
"1862","       Every note, bond, contract, instrument, certificate or"
"1863","undertaking and every other act or thing whatsoever executed or done"
"1864","by any Trustee, officer, employee or agent on behalf of the Trust or"
"1865","the Trustees or any of them in connection with the Trust shall be"
"1866","conclusively deemed to have been executed or done only in or with"

"1868","agent, and such person shall not be personally liable thereon."
