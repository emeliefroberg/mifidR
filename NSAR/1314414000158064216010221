"1392","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1393","assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"1394","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1395","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"1396","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"1397","authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3)"
"1398","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1399","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"1400","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1401","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1402","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"1403","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1404","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1405","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1406","procedures may deteriorate."
"1407","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1408","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1409","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1410","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A"
"1411","material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in"
"1412","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1413","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds'"
"1414","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1415","detected on a timely basis."
"1416","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1417","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"1418","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"1419","that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1420","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1421","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control"
"1422","over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"1423","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material weakness as"
"1424","defined above as of April 30, 2016."
"1425","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1426","management and the Board of Trustees of the Funds and the"
"1427","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"1428","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."
