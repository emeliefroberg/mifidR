"790","Since February 2004, Federated and"
"791","related entities (collectively, ?Federated?)"
"792","have been named as defendants in several"
"793","lawsuits, that were consolidated into a"

"795","Court for the Western District of"
"796","Pennsylvania, alleging excessive advisory"
"797","fees involving one of the Federated-"

"809","Report of Independent Registered"
"810","Public Accounting Firm"
"811","To the Shareholders and"
"812","Board of Trustees of"
"813","Federated Asset Allocation Fund"
"814","In planning and performing our audit"
"815","of the financial statements of"
"816","Federated Asset Allocation Fund (the"
"817","?Fund?) as of and for the year ended"
"818","November 30, 2012, in accordance"
"819","with the standards of the Public"
"820","Company Accounting Oversight"
"821","Board (United States), we considered"
"822","the Fund?s internal control over"
"823","financial reporting, including"
"824","controls over safeguarding securities,"
"825","as a basis for designing our auditing"
"826","procedures for the purpose of"
"827","expressing our opinion on the"
"828","financial statements and to comply"
"829","with the requirements of Form N-"
"830","SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"831","expressing an opinion on the"
"832","effectiveness of the Fund?s internal"
"833","control over financial reporting."
"834","Accordingly, we express no such"
"835","opinion."
"836","Management of the Fund is"
"837","responsible for establishing and"
"838","maintaining effective internal control"
"839","over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"840","this responsibility, estimates and"
"841","judgments by management are"
"842","required to assess the expected"
"843","benefits and related costs of controls."
"844","A company?s internal control over"
"845","financial reporting is a process"
"846","designed to provide reasonable"
"847","assurance regarding the reliability of"
"848","financial reporting and the"
"849","preparation of financial statements"
"850","for external purposes in accordance"
"851","with generally accepted accounting"
"852","principles. A company?s internal"
"853","control over financial reporting"
"854","includes those policies and"
"855","procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"856","maintenance of records that, in"
"857","reasonable detail, accurately and"
"858","fairly reflect the transactions and"
"859","dispositions of the assets of the"
"860","company; (2) provide reasonable"
"861","assurance that transactions are"
"862","recorded as necessary to permit"
"863","preparation of financial statements in"
"864","accordance with generally accepted"
"865","accounting principles, and that"
"866","receipts and expenditures of the"
"867","company are being made in"
"868","accordance with authorizations of"
"869","management and directors of the"
"870","company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"871","assurance regarding prevention or"
"872","timely detection of the unauthorized"
"873","acquisition, use, or disposition of the"
"874","company?s assets that could have a"
"875","material affect on the financial"
"876","statements."
"877","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"878","internal control over financial"
"879","reporting may not prevent or detect"
"880","misstatements. Also, projections of"
"881","any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"882","future periods are subject to the risk"
"883","that controls may become inadequate"
"884","because of changes in conditions, or"
"885","that the degree of compliance with"
"886","the policies or procedures may"
"887","deteriorate."
"888","A deficiency in internal control over"
"889","financial reporting exists when the"
"890","design or operation of a control does"
"891","not allow management or employees,"
"892","in the normal course of performing"
"893","their assigned functions, to prevent"
"894","or detect misstatements on a timely"
"895","basis. A material weakness is a"
"896","deficiency, or a combination of"
"897","deficiencies, in internal control over"
"898","financial reporting, such that there is"
"899","a reasonable possibility that a"
"900","material misstatement of the Fund?s"
"901","annual or interim financial"
"902","statements will not be prevented or"
"903","detected on a timely basis."
"904","Our consideration of the Fund?s"
"905","internal control over financial"
"906","reporting was for the limited purpose"
"907","described in the first paragraph and"
"908","would not necessarily disclose all"
"909","deficiencies in internal control that"
"910","might be material weaknesses under"
"911","standards established by the Public"
"912","Company Accounting Oversight"
"913","Board (United States). However, we"
"914","noted no deficiencies in the Fund?s"
"915","internal control over financial"
"916","reporting and its operation, including"
"917","controls over safeguarding securities"
"918","that we consider to be a material"
"919","weakness as defined above as of"
"920","November 30, 2012."
"921","This report is intended solely for the"
"922","information and use of management"
"923","and the Board of Trustees of"
"924","Federated Asset Allocation Fund and"
