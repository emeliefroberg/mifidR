"2220","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2221","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"2222","of PIMCO Equity Series:"
"2223","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"2224","PIMCO Equity Series (the Funds) as of and for the year ended June 30,"
"2225","2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"2226","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"2227","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"2228","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"2229","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"2230","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"2231","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"2232","Funds' internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"2233","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"2234","control over financial reporting."
"2235","The management of the Funds are responsible for establishing and"
"2236","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"2237","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"2238","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"2239","controls.  A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"2240","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"2241","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"2242","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2243","accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial"
"2244","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"2245","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"2246","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"2247","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"2248","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2249","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"2250","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"2251","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"2252","company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"2253","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"2254","company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2255","statements."
"2256","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2257","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"2258","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"2259","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2260","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"2261","procedures may deteriorate."
"2262","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"2263","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"2264","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"2265","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"2266","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2267","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"2268","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds' annual or"
"2269","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"2270","timely basis."
"2271","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2272","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"2273","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"2274","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"2275","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"2276","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"2277","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"2278","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be material"
"2279","weaknesses as defined above as of June 30, 2012."
"2280","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"2281","management and the Board of Trustees of PIMCO Equity Series and the"
"2282","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should"
"2283","not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"2338","Approval of the Investment Advisory Contract and Second Amended and"
"2339","Restated Supervision and Administration Agreement for"
"2340","PIMCO EqS Long/Short Fund"
"2341","On February 29, 2012, the Board of Trustees (the Board) of PIMCO Equity"
"2342","Series (the Trust), including all of the independent Trustees"
"2343","(the Independent Trustees), approved the Investment Advisory Contract"
"2344","and the Second Amended and Restated Supervision and Administration"
"2345","Agreement (the Supervision and Administration Agreement and together"
"2346","with the Investment Advisory Contract, the Agreements) with Pacific"
"2347","Investment Management Company LLC (PIMCO) on behalf of the"
"2348","PIMCO EqS Long/Short Fund, a new series of the Trust (the New Fund),"
"2349","for an initial two-year term."
"2350","The information, material factors and conclusions that formed the basis for"
"2351","the Board's approvals are described below."
"2352","1. Information Received"
"2353","(a) Materials Reviewed: The Trustees received a wide variety of materials"
"2354","relating to the services to be provided by PIMCO.  The Board reviewed"
"2355","information relating to proposed fund operations, including the New Fund's"
"2356","compliance program, shareholder services, valuation, custody, distribution,"
"2357","and other information relating to the nature, extent and quality of services"
"2358","proposed to be provided by PIMCO to the Trust.  In considering whether to"
"2359","approve the Agreements, the Board also reviewed materials provided by PIMCO,"
"2360","which included, among other things, comparative industry data with regard"
"2361","to expense ratios of funds with investment objectives and policies similar"
"2362","to those of the New Fund.  The Board also reviewed material provided by"
"2363","counsel to the Trust and the independent Trustees, which included, among"
"2364","other things, memoranda outlining legal duties of the Board. The Board also"
"2365","reviewed information about the personnel who would be providing investment"
"2366","management and administrative services to the New Fund."
"2367","(b) Review Process: In connection with the approval of the Agreements,"
"2368","the Board reviewed written materials prepared by PIMCO, which included,"
"2369","among other things, comparative fee data for funds in the appropriate"
"2370","Lipper, Inc. (Lipper) peer group.  Lipper is an independent provider of"
"2371","investment company performance and fee and expense data.  The Board also"
"2372","requested and received assistance and advice regarding applicable legal"
"2373","standards from Trust counsel.  The Board also heard oral presentations on"
"2374","matters related to the Agreements.  The approval determinations were made"
"2375","on the basis of each Trustee's business judgment after consideration of all"
"2376","the information presented.  Individual Trustees may have given different"
"2377","weights to certain factors and assigned various degrees of materiality to"
"2378","information received in connection with the approval process. In deciding"
"2379","to approve the Agreements, the Board did not identify any single factor or"
"2380","particular information that, in isolation, was controlling.  This summary"
"2381","describes the most important, but not all, of the factors considered by"
"2382","the Board."
"2383","2. Nature, Extent and Quality of Services"
"2384","(a) PIMCO, its Personnel, and Resources: The Board considered the depth and"
"2385","quality of PIMCO's investment management process, including: its global"
"2386","research capabilities; the experience, capability and integrity of its"
"2387","senior management and other personnel; the low turnover rates of its key"
"2388","personnel; the overall financial strength and stability of its organization;"
"2389","and the ability of its organizational structure to address the recent growth"
"2390","in assets under management.  The Board also considered that PIMCO makes"
"2391","available to its investment professionals a variety of resources and systems"
"2392","relating to investment management, compliance, trading, performance and"
"2393","portfolio accounting.  The Board noted PIMCO's commitment to investing in"
"2394","information technology supporting investment management and compliance, as"
"2395","well as PIMCO's continuing efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel"
"2396","and to maintain and enhance its resources and systems."
"2397","Ultimately, the Board concluded that the nature, extent and quality of"
"2398","services proposed to be provided by PIMCO under the Agreements are likely to"
"2399","benefit the New Fund and its shareholders."
"2400","(b) Other Services: The Board considered PIMCO's policies, procedures and"
"2401","systems to assure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and its"
"2402","commitment to these programs; its efforts to keep the Trustees informed"
"2403","about matters relevant to the Trust and its shareholders; and its attention"
"2404","to matters that may involve conflicts of interest with the Trust."
"2405","The Board also considered the nature, extent, quality and cost of"
"2406","supervisory and administrative services to be provided by PIMCO to the New"
"2407","Fund under the Agreements."
"2408","The Board considered the terms of the Trust's Supervision and"
"2409","Administration Agreement, under which the Trust pays for the supervisory"
"2410","and administrative services it requires under what is essentially an all-in"
"2411","fee structure (the unified fee).  In return, PIMCO will provide or procure"
"2412","supervisory and administrative services and bears the costs of various third"
"2413","party services required by the New Fund, including audit, custodial,"
"2414","portfolio accounting, legal, transfer agency and printing costs.  The Board"
"2415","considered PIMCO's provision of these services to other series of the Trust"
"2416","and its supervision of the Trust's third party service providers to assure"
"2417","that these service providers provide a high level of service relative to"
"2418","alternatives in the market.  Ultimately, the Board concluded that the nature,"
"2419","extent and quality of the services to be provided by PIMCO would likely"
"2420","benefit the New Fund and its shareholders."
"2421","3. Investment Performance"
"2422","As the New Fund had not yet commenced operations at the time the Agreements"
"2423","were considered, the Trustees did not receive or consider investment"
"2424","performance information for the New Fund.  However, the Trustees did"
"2425","consider the investment performance information for the New Fund's"
"2426","predecessor fund that would be included in the New Fund's registration"
"2427","statement."
"2428","4. Advisory Fees, Supervisory and Administrative Fees and Total Expenses"
"2429","The Board considered that PIMCO strives to price funds with total expense"
"2430","ratios at or below the respective Lipper median, while providing premium"
"2431","investment offerings.  PIMCO reported to the Board that, in proposing fees"
"2432","for the New Fund, it considered a number of factors, including the type and"
"2433","complexity of the services to be provided, the cost of providing services,"
"2434","the risk assumed by PIMCO in the provision of services, the impact on"
"2435","potential returns from different levels of fees, the competitive"
"2436","marketplace for financial products, and the attractiveness of potential"
"2437","returns to potential investors."
"2438","The Board reviewed the proposed advisory fee, supervisory and administrative"
"2439","fee and estimated total expenses of the New Fund (each as a percentage of"
"2440","average net assets) and compared such amounts with the average and median"
"2441","fees and expenses of other similar funds. With respect to advisory fees,"
"2442","the Board reviewed data from Lipper that compared the average and median"
"2443","advisory fees of other funds in a Peer Group Expense Comparison of"
"2444","comparable funds, as well as the universe of other similar funds."
"2445","The Board compared the New Fund's total expenses to other funds in the Peer"
"2446","Group Expense Comparison provided by Lipper and found the New Fund's total"
"2447","expenses were comparable to the median and average."
"2448","At the time the Board considered the Agreements, PIMCO did not manage any"
"2449","separate accounts with similar investment strategies to the New Fund;"
"2450","therefore, the Board did not consider the fees charged by PIMCO to"
"2451","comparable separate accounts."
"2452","The Board also considered the Trusts unified fee structure, under which"
"2453","the Trust pays for the supervisory and administrative services it requires"
"2454","for one set fee, and in return, PIMCO will provide or procure supervisory"
"2455","and administrative services and bear the costs of various third party"
"2456","services required by the New Fund, including audit, custodial, portfolio"
"2457","accounting, legal, transfer agency and printing costs. The Board noted that"
"2458","the unified supervisory and administrative fee creates fund fees that are"
"2459","fixed, rather than variable. The Board concluded that the New Fund's"
"2460","proposed supervisory and administrative fee is reasonable in relation to"
"2461","the value of the services to be provided, including the services to be"
"2462","provided to different classes of shareholders, and that the expenses"
"2463","assumed contractually by PIMCO under the Supervision and Administration"
"2464","Agreement represent, in effect, a cap on fund fees that would be beneficial"
"2465","to the New Fund and its shareholders. The Board further noted"
"2466","that, although the unified fee structure does not have break points, it"
"2467","implicitly reflects economies of scale by fixing the absolute level of Fund"
"2468","fees at competitive levels, in effect, setting the fees as if the New Fund"
"2469","was already at scale."
"2470","The Board also noted that PIMCO had contractually agreed to reduce total"
"2471","annual fund operating expenses for each class of the New Fund by waiving a"
"2472","portion of its supervisory and administrative fee, or reimbursing the New"
"2473","Fund, to the extent that any organizational expenses and the pro rata share"
"2474","of the Trust's Trustees' fees attributable to a class of the New Fund"
"2475","exceeds 0.49 basis points in any year.  Furthermore, the Board noted that"
"2476","PIMCO had contractually agreed to reduce its advisory fee by 9 basis points"
"2477","through October 31, 2013."
"2478","Based on the information presented by PIMCO and Lipper, members of the"
"2479","Board then determined, in the exercise of their business judgment, that the"
"2480","level of the advisory and supervisory and administrative fees to be charged"
"2481","by PIMCO, as well as the estimated total expenses of the New Fund, are"
"2482","reasonable and approval of the Agreements would likely benefit the New Fund"
"2483","and its shareholders."
"2484","5. Adviser Costs, Level of Profits and Economies of Scale"
"2485","As the New Fund is newly organized, information regarding PIMCO's costs in"
"2486","providing services to the New Fund and the profitability of PIMCO's"
"2487","relationship with the New Fund was not available."
"2488","With respect to potential economies of scale, the Board found that because"
"2489","the unified fee protects shareholders against unanticipated increases in"
"2490","expense ratios due to redemptions, declines in asset values, or increases"
"2491","in the costs of services provided or procured by PIMCO, economies of scale"
"2492","are implicitly recognized in the level of the unified fee (which, together"
"2493","with the advisory fee, serves as a proxy for the New Fund's overall expense"
"2494","ratio)."
"2495","The Board concluded that the New Fund's proposed cost structure was"
"2496","reasonable and that the unified fee structure inherently involves the"
"2497","sharing of economies of scale between PIMCO and the New Fund, to the benefit"
"2498","of the New Fund's shareholders."
"2499","6. Ancillary Benefits"
"2500","The Board considered other benefits received by PIMCO and its affiliates as"
"2501","a result of PIMCO's relationship with the Trust, including possible"
"2502","ancillary benefits to PIMCO's institutional investment management business"
"2503","due to the reputation and market penetration of the Trust. The Board also"
"2504","considered that affiliates of PIMCO will provide distribution and shareholder"
"2505","services to the New Fund and its shareholders, for which they may be"
"2506","compensated under the unified fee, or through distribution fees paid pursuant"
"2507","to the New Fund's Rule 12b-1 plans. The Board reviewed PIMCO's soft dollar"
"2508","policies and procedures, noting that while PIMCO has the authority to receive"
"2509","the benefit of research provided by broker-dealers executing portfolio"
"2510","transactions on behalf of the New Fund, it has adopted a policy not to enter"
"2511","into contractual soft dollar arrangements."
"2512","7. Conclusions"
"2513","Based on its review, including its consideration of each of the factors"
"2514","referred to above, the Board concluded that the Agreements were fair and"
"2515","reasonable to the New Fund and its shareholders, that the New Fund's"
"2516","shareholders would likely receive reasonable value in return for the"
"2517","advisory fees and other amounts paid to PIMCO by the New Fund, and that the"
"2518","approval of the Agreements was in the best interests of the New Fund and its"
"2519","shareholders."
