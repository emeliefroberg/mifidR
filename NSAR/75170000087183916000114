"540","<FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Stock Fund, Inc. (the Company) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Co</FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>mpany&#146;s internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.</FONT></P>"
"541","<P style=text-align: left;>"
"542","<FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected be</FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>nefits and related costs of controls. A company&#146;s </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition</FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>, use or disposition of a company&#146;s assets that could have </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>a material effect on the financial statements.</FONT></P>"
"543","<P style=text-align: left;>"
"544","<FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</FONT></P>"
"545","<P style=text-align: left;>"
"546","<FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</FONT></P>"

Advisor Class shares are sold only through unaffiliated brokers and other unaffiliated financial intermediaries. I Class shares generally are available only to investors meeting a &#36;1,000,000 minimum investment or certain other criteria. The Advisor Class operates under a Board-approved Rule 12b-1 plan pursuant to which the class compensates financial intermediaries for distribution, shareholder servicing, and/or certain administrative services; the Investor and I Classes do not pay Rule 12b-1 fees. Each class has exclusive voting rights on matters related solely to that class; separate voting rights on matters that relate to all classes; and, in all other respects, the same rights and obligations as the other classes.</FONT></P>"

"705","<FONT size=2 face=MetaNormalLF-Roman,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>The I Class is subject to an operating expense limitation (I Class limit) pursuant to which Price Associates is contractually required to pay all operating expenses of the I Class, excluding management fees, interest, borrowing-related expenses, taxes, brokerage commissions, and extraordinary expenses, to the extent such operating expenses, on an annualized basis, exceed 0.05% of average net assets. This agreement will continue until April 30, 2018, and may be renewed, revised or revoked only with approval of the fund&#146;s Board. The I Class is required to repay Price Associates for expenses previously paid to the extent the class&#146;s net assets grow or expenses decline sufficiently to allow repayment without causing the class&#146;s operating expenses to exceed the I Class limit. However, no repayment will be made more than three years after the date of a payment or waiver.</FONT></P>"
