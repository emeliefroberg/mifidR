"2599","Fund), as of and for the year ended October 31, 2011, in accordance with the"
"2600","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"2601","considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including"
"2602","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"2603","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"2604","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2605","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"2606","financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"2607","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"2608","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective"
"2609","internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"2610","estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"2611","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over financial"
"2612","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"2613","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"2614","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2615","principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"2616","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"2617","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2618","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"

"2623","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"2624","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"2625","effect on the financial statements."
"2626","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2627","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2628","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2629","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"2630","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2631","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"2632","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"2633","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2634","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2635","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"2636","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2637","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"

"2729","SETTLED REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO MARKET"
"2730","TIMING"
"2731","     On October 8, 2004, Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco), successor by merger"
"2732","to Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc. and INVESCO Funds Group, Inc. (IFG), both former"
"2733","investment advisers, along with Invesco Aim Distributors, n/k/a Invesco"
"2734","Distributors, Inc. (Invesco Distributors) reached final settlements with certain"
"2735","regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York"
"2736","Attorney General and the Colorado Attorney General, to resolve civil enforcement"
"2737","actions and/or investigations related to market timing and related activity in"
"2738","the AIM Funds (n/k/a the Invesco Funds), including those formerly advised by"
"2739","IFG. As part of the settlements, a $325 million fair fund ($110 million of which"
"2740","is civil penalties) was created to compensate shareholders harmed by market"
"2741","timing and related activity in funds formerly advised by IFG. Additionally,"
"2742","Invesco and Invesco Distributors created a $50 million fair fund ($30 million of"
"2743","which is civil penalties) to compensate shareholders harmed by market timing and"
"2744","related activity in funds advised by Invesco, which was done pursuant to the"
"2745","terms of the settlement. The methodology of the fair funds distributions was"
"2746","determined by Invesco's independent distribution consultant (IDC Plan), in"
"2747","consultation with Invesco and the independent trustees of the Invesco Funds, and"
"2748","approved by the SEC on May 23, 2008."
"2749","     On May 23, 2008, the SEC posted its final approval of the plans for"
"2750","distributing market timing settlement proceeds to adversely impacted AIM and"
"2751","INVESCO Fund shareholders. The AIM Fair Fund began distribution of settlement"
"2752","monies to impacted former shareholders on June 1, 2009. After receipt of SEC"
"2753","approval, undistributed residual amounts left in the AIM Fair Fund were"
"2754","deposited in the appropriate fund. The Invesco Fair Fund began distribution of"
"2755","settlement monies to impacted former shareholders on December 11, 2009 and the"
"2756","distribution of checks concluded on September 21, 2010. After receipt of SEC"
"2757","approval, undistributed residual amounts totaling approximately $55 million left"
"2758","in the Invesco Fair Fund were distributed to the appropriate funds. On May 11,"
"2759","2011, the SEC issued an order that amended the Invesco Fair Fund distribution"
"2760","plan to segregate approximately $3.5 million of the Fair Fund's residual amount"
"2761","and to require that a certain financial intermediary take additional steps to"
"2762","identify beneficial accountholders of its historic omnibus positions in the"

"4942","1.    DESCRIPTION OF THE REORGANIZATIONS"
"4943","      1.1. It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Reorganization"
"4944","described herein shall be conducted separately from the others, and a party that"
"4945","is not a party to a Reorganization shall incur no obligations, duties or"
"4946","liabilities with respect to such Reorganization by reason of being a party to"
"4947","this Agreement. If any one or more Reorganizations should fail to be"
"4948","consummated, such failure shall not affect the other Reorganizations in any way."
"4949","      1.2. Provided that all conditions precedent to a Reorganization set forth"
"4950","herein have been satisfied as of the Closing Date (as defined in Section 3.1),"
"4951","and based on the representations and warranties each party provides to the"
"4952","others, each Target Entity and its corresponding Acquiring Entity agree to take"
"4953","the following steps with respect to their Reorganization(s), the parties to"
"4954","which and classes of shares to be issued in connection with which are set forth"
"4955","in Exhibit A:"
"4956","<PAGE>"
"4957","            (a) The Target Fund shall transfer all of its Assets, as defined and"
"4958","      set forth in Section 1.2(b), to the Acquiring Fund, and the Acquiring Fund"
"4959","      in exchange therefor shall assume the Liabilities, as defined and set"
"4960","      forth in Section 1.2(c), and deliver to the Target Fund the number of full"
"4961","      and fractional Acquiring Fund shares determined in the manner set forth in"
"4962","      Section 2."
"4963","            (b) The assets of the Target Fund to be transferred to the Acquiring"
"4964","      Fund shall consist of all assets and property, including, without"
"4965","      limitation, all cash, securities, commodities and futures interests,"
"4966","      claims (whether absolute or contingent, known or unknown, accrued or"
"4967","      unaccrued and including, without limitation, any interest in pending or"
"4968","      future legal claims in connection with past or present portfolio holdings,"
"4969","      whether in the form of class action claims, opt-out or other direct"
"4970","      litigation claims, or regulator or government-established investor"
"4971","      recovery fund claims, and any and all resulting recoveries) and dividends"
"4972","      or interest receivable that are owned by the Target Fund and any deferred"
"4973","      or prepaid expenses shown as an asset on the books of the Target Fund on"
"4974","      the Closing Date, except for cash, bank deposits or cash equivalent"
"4975","      securities in an amount necessary to pay the estimated costs of"
"4976","      extinguishing any Excluded Liabilities (as defined in Section 1.2(c)) and"
"4977","      cash in an amount necessary to pay any distributions pursuant to Section"
"4978","      7.1(f) (collectively, Assets)."
"4979","            (c) The Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the liabilities of the"
"4980","      Target Fund, whether accrued or contingent, known or unknown, existing at"
"4981","      the Closing Date, except for the Target Fund's Excluded Liabilities (as"
"4982","      defined below), if any, pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, with"
"4983","      respect to each Target Fund separately, Liabilities). If prior to the"
"4984","      Closing Date the Acquiring Entity identifies a liability that the"
"4985","      Acquiring Entity and the Target Entity mutually agree should not be"
"4986","      assumed by the Acquiring Fund, such liability shall be excluded from the"
"4987","      definition of Liabilities hereunder and shall be listed on a Schedule of"
"4988","      Excluded Liabilities to be signed by the Acquiring Entity and the Target"
"4989","      Entity at Closing and attached to this Agreement as Schedule 1.2(c) (the"
"4990","      Excluded Liabilities). The Assets minus the Liabilities of a Target Fund"
"4991","      shall be referred to herein as the Target Fund's Net Assets."
"4992","            (d) As soon as is reasonably practicable after the Closing, the"
"4993","      Target Fund will distribute to its shareholders of record (Target Fund
      Shareholders) the shares of the Acquiring Fund of the corresponding class"
"4994","      received by the Target Fund pursuant to Section 1.2(a), as set forth in"
"4995","      Exhibit A, on a pro rata basis within that class, and the Target Fund will"
"4996","      as promptly as practicable completely liquidate and dissolve. Such"
"4997","      distribution and liquidation will be accomplished, with respect to each"
"4998","      class of the Target Fund's shares, by the transfer of the Acquiring Fund"
"4999","      shares of the corresponding class then credited to the account of the"
"5000","      Target Fund on the books of the Acquiring Fund to open accounts on the"
"5001","      share records of the Acquiring Fund in the names of the Target Fund"
"5002","      Shareholders of the class. The aggregate net asset value of the Acquiring"
"5003","      Fund shares to be so credited to the corresponding Target Fund"
"5004","      Shareholders shall be equal to the aggregate net asset value of the"
"5005","      corresponding Target Fund's shares owned by the Target Fund Shareholders"
"5006","      on the Valuation Date. At the Closing, any outstanding certificates"
"5007","      representing shares of a Target Fund will be cancelled. The Acquiring Fund"

"5009","<PAGE>"
"5010","      shall not issue certificates representing shares in connection with such"
"5011","      exchange, irrespective of whether Target Fund shareholders hold their"
"5012","      shares in certificated form."
"5013","            (e) Ownership of Acquiring Fund shares will be shown on its books,"
"5014","      as such are maintained by the Acquiring Fund's transfer agent."
"5015","2.    VALUATION"
"5016","      2.1.  With respect to each Reorganization:"
"5017","            (a) The value of the Target Fund's Assets shall be the value of such"
"5018","      Assets computed as of immediately after the close of regular trading on"
"5019","      the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which shall reflect the declaration"
"5020","      of any dividends, on the business day next preceding the Closing Date (the"
"5021","      Valuation Date), using the Target Fund's valuation procedures"
"5022","      established by the Target Entity's Board of Trustees."
"5023","            (b) The net asset value per share of each class of the Acquiring"
"5024","      Fund shares issued in connection with the Reorganization shall be the net"
"5025","      asset value per share of the corresponding class of each class computed on"
"5026","      the Valuation Date using the Acquiring Fund's valuation procedures"
"5027","      established by the Acquiring Entity's Board of Trustees, which are the"
"5028","      same as the Target Fund's valuation procedures."
"5029","            (c) The number of shares issued of each class of the Acquiring Fund"
"5030","      (including fractional shares, if any, rounded to the nearest thousandth)"
"5031","      in exchange for the Target Fund's Net Assets shall be determined by"
"5032","      dividing the value of the Net Assets of the Target Fund attributable to"
"5033","      each class of Target Fund shares by the net asset value per share of the"
"5034","      corresponding share class of the Acquiring Fund."
"5035","            (d) All computations of value shall be made by the Target Fund's and"
"5036","      the Acquiring Fund's designated recordkeeping agent using the valuation"
"5037","      procedures described in this Section 2."
"5038","3.    CLOSING AND CLOSING DATE"
"5039","      3.1. Each Reorganization shall close on the date identified on Exhibit A"
"5040","or such other date as the parties may agree with respect to any or all"
"5041","Reorganizations (the Closing Date). All acts taking place at the closing of a"
"5042","Reorganization (the Closing) shall be deemed to take place simultaneously as"
"5043","of immediately prior to the opening of regular trading on the NYSE on the"
"5044","Closing Date of that Reorganization unless otherwise agreed to by the parties"
"5045","(the Closing Time)."
"5046","      3.2.  With respect to each Reorganization:"
"5047","            (a) The Target Fund's portfolio securities, investments or other"
"5048","      assets that are represented by a certificate or other written instrument"

"5341","      currently under audit by any Federal, state, local or foreign Tax"
"5342","      authority; no assessment has been asserted with respect to such Returns;"

"5345","      the time to assess any such Taxes are outstanding nor are any written"
"5346","      requests for such waivers pending; and adequate provision has been made in"
"5347","      the Acquiring Fund financial statements for all Taxes in respect of all"

"5354","      has satisfied the requirements of Part I of Subchapter M of the Code to"
"5355","      maintain such qualification for the period beginning on the first day of"

"5357","      Fund has no earnings or profits accumulated in any taxable year in which"
"5358","      the provisions of Subchapter M of the Code did not apply to it. If the"
"5359","      Acquiring Fund serves as a funding vehicle for variable contracts (life"
"5360","      insurance or annuity), the Acquiring Fund, with respect to each of its"
"5361","      taxable years that has ended prior to the Closing Date during which it has"
"5362","      served as such a funding vehicle, has satisfied the diversification"
"5363","      requirements of Section 817(h) of the Code and will continue to satisfy"
"5364","      the requirements of Section 817(h) of the Code for the period beginning on"
"5365","      the first day of its current taxable year and ending on the Closing Date;"
