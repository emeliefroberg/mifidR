"529","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"530","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"531","The Gabelli Utilities Fund"
"532","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"533","of The Gabelli Utilities Fund as of and for the year ended"
"534","December 31, 2009, in accordance with the standards of the"
"535","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"536","considered its internal control over financial reporting,"
"537","including control activities for safeguarding securities, as a"
"538","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"539","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"540","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"541","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of The Gabelli"
"542","Utilities Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"543","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"544","The management of The Gabelli Utilities Fund is responsible for"
"545","establishing and maintaining effective internal control over"
"546","financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"547","estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"548","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"549","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed"
"550","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"551","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"552","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"553","accounting principles. A company's internal control over"
"554","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"555","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"556","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"557","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"558","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"559","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"560","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"561","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"562","with authorizations of management and directors of the company;"
"563","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"564","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"565","of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"566","financial statements."
"567","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"568","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"569","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"570","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"571","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"572","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"573","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"574","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"575","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"576","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"577","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"578","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"579","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"580","material misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"581","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"582","timely basis."
"583","Our consideration of The Gabelli Utilities Fund's internal"
"584","control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"585","described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily"
"586","disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"587","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"588","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we"
"589","noted no deficiencies in The Gabelli Utilities Fund's internal"
"590","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"591","controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"592","material weakness as defined above as of December 31, 2009."
"593","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"594","management and the Board of Trustees of The Gabelli Utilities"
"595","Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"596","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"597","specified parties."

"644","           These By-Laws are made and adopted pursuant to"

"646","Utilities Fund dated as of May 19, 1999, as from time to time"
"647","amended (hereinafter called the Declaration).  All words and"
"648","terms capitalized in these By-Laws shall have the meaning or"
"649","meanings set forth for such words or terms in the Declaration."
"650","                                  ARTICLE I"
"651","                            Shareholder Meetings"
"652","           1.1  Chairman.  The Chairman, if any, shall act as"
"653","chairman at all meetings of the Shareholders; in the Chairman's"
"654","absence, the Trustee or Trustees present at each meeting may"
"655","elect a temporary chairman for the meeting, who may be one of"
"656","themselves."
"657","           1.2  Proxies; Voting.  Shareholders may vote either"
"658","in person or by duly executed proxy and each full share or"
"659","fraction thereof represented at the meeting shall have one vote"
"660","(or such fraction, as the case may be), all as provided in"
"661","Article VII of the Declaration. Shareholders may appoint a proxy"
"662","by instrument by instrument in writing or by transmitting any"
"663","authorization by telegram, cablegram, datagram, electronic mail,"
"664","or any other legally permissible electronic or telephonic means"
"665","in accordance with the Trust's procedures."
"666","           1.3  Fixing Record Dates.  For the purpose of"
"667","determining the Shareholders who are entitled to notice of or to"
"668","vote or act at any meeting, including any adjournment thereof,"
"669","or who are entitled to participate in any dividends, or for any"
"670","other proper purpose, the Trustees may from time to time,"
"671","without closing the transfer books, fix a record date in the"
"672","manner provided in Section 6.3 of the Declaration.  If the"
"673","Trustees do not prior to any meeting of Shareholders so fix a"
"674","record date or close the transfer books, then the date of"
"675","mailing notice of the meeting or the date upon which the"
"676","dividend resolution is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the"
"677","record date."
"678","           1.4  Inspectors of Election.  In advance of any"
"679","meeting of Shareholders, the Trustees may appoint Inspectors of"
"680","Election to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.  If"
"681","Inspectors of Election are not so appointed, the Chairman, if"
"682","any, of any meeting of Shareholders may, and on the request of"
"683","any Shareholder or Shareholder proxy shall, appoint Inspectors"
"684","of Election of the meeting.  The number of Inspectors shall be"
"685","either one or three.  If appointed at the meeting on the request"
"686","of one or more Shareholders or proxies, a majority of Shares"
"687","present shall determine whether one or three Inspectors are to"
"688","be appointed, but failure to allow such determination by the"
"689","Shareholders shall not affect the validity of the appointment of"
"690","Inspectors of Election.  In case any person appointed as"
"691","Inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the"
"692","vacancy may be filled by appointment made by the Trustees in"
"693","advance of the convening of the meeting or at the meeting by the"
"694","person acting as chairman.  The Inspectors of Election shall"
"695","determine the number of Shares outstanding, the Shares"
"696","represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the"
"697","authenticity, validity and effect of proxies, shall receive"
"698","votes, ballots or consents, shall hear and determine all"
"699","challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with"
"700","the right to vote, shall count and tabulate all votes or"
"701","consents, determine the results, and do such other acts as may"
"702","be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all"
"703","Shareholders.  If there are three Inspectors of Election, the"
"704","decision, act or certificate of a majority is effective in all"
"705","respects as the decision, act or certificate of all.  On request"
"706","of the Chairman, if any, of the meeting, or of any Shareholder"
"707","or Shareholder proxy, the Inspectors of Election shall make a"
"708","report in writing of any challenge or question or matter"
"709","determined by them and shall execute a certificate of any facts"
"710","found by them."
"711","           1.5  Records at Shareholder Meetings.  At each"
"712","meeting of the Shareholders, there shall be made available for"
"713","inspection at a convenient time and place during normal business"
"714","hours, if requested by Shareholders, the minutes of the last"
"715","previous Annual or Special Meeting of Shareholders of the Trust"
"716","and a list of the Shareholders of the Trust, as of the record"
"717","date of the meeting or the date of closing of transfer books, as"
"718","the case may be.  Such list of Shareholders shall contain the"
"719","name and the address of each Shareholder in alphabetical order"
"720","and the number of Shares owned by such Shareholder."
"721","Shareholders shall have such other rights and procedures of"
"722","inspection of the books and records of the Trust as are granted"
"723","to shareholders of a Delaware business corporation."

"727","Trustees shall be held from time to time upon the call of the"
