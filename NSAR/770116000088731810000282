"542","<TEXT>"
"543","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"544","Accounting Firm"
"545","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"546","of"
"547","Federated Intermediate Municipal Trust:"
"548","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"549","financial statements of Federated"
"550","Intermediate Municipal Trust (the ?Fund?)"
"551","(the sole portfolio of Intermediate Municipal"
"552","Trust) as of and for the year ended May 31,"
"553","2010, in accordance with the standards of"
"554","the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"555","Board (United States), we considered the"
"556","Fund?s internal control over financial"
"557","reporting, including controls over"
"558","safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"559","designing our auditing procedures for the"
"560","purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"561","financial statements and to comply with the"
"562","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"563","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"564","effectiveness of the Fund?s internal control"
"565","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"566","express no such opinion."
"567","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"568","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"569","internal control over financial reporting. In"
"570","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"571","judgments by management are required to"
"572","assess the expected benefits and related"
"573","costs of controls. A company?s internal"
"574","control over financial reporting is a process"
"575","designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"576","regarding the reliability of financial"
"577","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"578","statements for external purposes in"
"579","accordance with generally accepted"
"580","accounting principles. A company?s internal"
"581","control over financial reporting includes"
"582","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"583","to the maintenance of records that,  in"
"584","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"585","reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"586","the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"587","reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"588","recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"589","of financial statements in accordance with"
"590","generally accepted accounting principles,"
"591","and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"592","company are being made only in accordance"
"593","with authorizations of management and"
"594","directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"595","reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"596","or timely detection of unauthorized"
"597","acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"598","company?s assets that could have a material"
"599","effect on the financial statements."
"600","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"601","control over financial reporting may not"
"602","prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"603","projections of any evaluation of"
"604","effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"605","the risk that controls may become"
"606","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"607","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"608","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"609","A deficiency in internal control over"
"610","financial reporting exists when the design or"
"611","operation of a control does not allow"
"612","management or employees, in the normal"
"613","course of performing their assigned"
"614","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"615","on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"616","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"617","in internal control over financial reporting,"
"618","such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"619","that a material misstatement of the"
"620","company?s annual or interim financial"
"621","statements will not be prevented or detected"
"622","on a timely basis."
"623","Our consideration of the Fund?s internal"
"624","control over financial reporting was for the"
"625","limited purpose described in the first"
"626","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"627","disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"628","that might be material weaknesses under"
"629","standards established by the Public"
"630","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"631","(United States). However, we noted no"
"632","deficiencies in the Fund?s internal control"
"633","over financial reporting and its operation,"
"634","including controls over safeguarding"
"635","securities that we consider to be a material"
"636","weakness as defined above as of May 31,"
"637","2010."
"638","This report is intended solely for the"
"639","information and use of management and the"
"640","Board of Trustees of the Fund and the"
"641","Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"642","not intended to be, and should not be, used"
"643","by anyone other than these specified parties."

"654","<TEXT>"
"655","Since October 2003, Federated and related"
"656","entities (collectively, ?Federated?) and various"
"657","Federated funds (Funds) have been named as"
"658","defendants in several class action lawsuits now"
"659","pending in the United States District Court for"
"660","the District of Maryland. The lawsuits were"
"661","purportedly filed on behalf of people who"
"662","purchased, owned and/or redeemed shares of"
"663","Federated-sponsored mutual funds during"
"664","specified periods beginning November 1, 1998."
"665","The suits are generally similar in alleging that"
"666","Federated engaged in illegal and improper"
"667","trading practices including market timing and"
"668","late trading in concert with certain institutional"
"669","traders, which allegedly caused financial injury"
"670","to the mutual fund shareholders. Federated"
"671","without admitting the validity of any claim has"
"672","reached a preliminary settlement with the"
"673","Plaintiffs in these cases. Any settlement would"
"674","have to be approved by the Court."
"675","     Federated entities have also been named"
"676","as defendants in several additional lawsuits that"
"677","are now pending in the United States District"
"678","Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania."
"679","These lawsuits have been consolidated into a"
"680","single action alleging excessive advisory fees"
"681","involving another Federated Fund."
"682","     The Board of the Funds retained the law"
"683","firm of Dickstein Shapiro LLP to represent the"
"684","Funds in each of the lawsuits described in the"
"685","preceding two paragraphs. Federated and the"
"686","Funds, and their respective counsel, have been"
"687","defending this litigation, and none of the Funds"
"688","remains a defendant in any of the lawsuits"
"689","(though, the other Fund noted above could"
"690","potentially receive a recovery in the action"
"691","alleging excessive advisory fees). Additional"
"692","lawsuits based upon similar allegations may be"
"693","filed in the future. The potential impact of these"
"694","lawsuits, all of which seek monetary damages,"
"695","attorneys? fees and expenses, and future"
"696","potential similar suits is uncertain. Although we"
"697","do not believe that these lawsuits will have a"
"698","material adverse effect on the Funds, there can"
"699","be no assurance that these suits, ongoing"
"700","adverse publicity and/or other developments"
"701","resulting from the allegations in these matters"
"702","will not result in increased Fund redemptions,"
"703","reduced sales of Fund Shares or other adverse"
"704","consequences for the Funds."
