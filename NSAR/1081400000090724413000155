"1117","     This AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT is made as of this 6th day of August"
"1118","2003, and amended as of October 1, 2005 and March 27, 2009, between Wells Fargo"

"1132","(each a Fund and collectively the Funds), and the Adviser is willing to"
"1133","provide those services on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;"
"1134","     NOW THEREFORE, the Trust and the Adviser agree as follows:"
"1135","     SECTION 1. APPOINTMENT OF THE ADVISER. The Trust is engaged in the business"
"1136","of investing and reinvesting its assets in securities of the type and in"
"1137","accordance with the limitations specified in its Declaration of Trust, as"

"1142","information relating to the Funds contained therein and as may be amended or"

"1151","tender securities pursuant to a tender offer, and participate in class actions"
"1152","and other legal proceedings on behalf of the Funds."
"1153","     The Trust hereby employs Adviser, subject to the direction and control of"
"1154","the Board, to manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets in the Funds"
"1155","and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to provide the other"
"1156","services specified in Section 2 hereof."
"1157","<PAGE>"
"1158","     SECTION 2. DUTIES OF THE ADVISER."
"1159","     (a) The Adviser shall make decisions with respect to all purchases and"
"1160","sales of securities and other investment assets for the Funds. Among other"
"1161","things, the Adviser shall make all decisions with respect to the allocation of"
"1162","the Funds' investments in various securities or other assets, in investment"
"1163","styles and, if applicable, in other investment companies or pooled vehicles in"
"1164","which a Fund may invest. To carry out such decisions, the Adviser is hereby"
"1165","authorized, as agent and attorney-in-fact for the Trust, for the account of, at"
"1166","the risk of and in the name of the Trust, to place orders and issue instructions"
"1167","with respect to those transactions of the Funds. In all purchases, sales and"
"1168","other transactions in securities for the Funds, the Adviser is authorized to"
"1169","exercise full discretion and act for the Trust in the same manner and with the"
"1170","same force and effect as the Trust might or could do with respect to such"
"1171","purchases, sales or other transactions, as well as with respect to all other"
"1172","things necessary or incidental to the furtherance or conduct of such purchases,"
"1173","sales or other transactions."
"1174","     (b) The Adviser will report to the Board at each regular meeting thereof"
"1175","regarding the investment performance of the Funds since the prior report, and"
"1176","will also keep the Board informed of important developments affecting the Trust,"
"1177","each Fund and the Adviser, and on its own initiative will furnish the Board from"
"1178","time to time with such information as the Adviser may believe appropriate,"
"1179","whether concerning the individual companies whose securities are held by a Fund,"
"1180","the industries in which they engage, or the economic, social or political"
"1181","conditions prevailing in each country in which a Fund maintains investments. The"
"1182","Adviser will also furnish the Board with such statistical and analytical"
"1183","information with respect to securities in the Funds as the Adviser may believe"
"1184","appropriate or as the Board reasonably may request."
"1185","          The Adviser shall promptly notify the Trust of (i) any changes"
"1186","regarding the Adviser that would impact disclosure in the Trust's Registration"
"1187","Statement, or (ii) any violation of any requirement, provision, policy or"
"1188","restriction that the Adviser is required to comply with under Section 6 of this"
"1189","Agreement. The Adviser shall immediately notify the Trust of any legal process"
"1190","served upon it in connection with its activities hereunder, including any legal"
"1191","process served upon it on behalf of the Funds or the Trust."
"1192","     (c) The Adviser will from time to time employ or sub-contract the services"
"1193","to certain persons as the Adviser believes to be appropriate or necessary to"
"1194","assist in the execution of the Adviser's duties hereunder; provided, however,"
"1195","that the employment or sub-contracting with any such person shall not relieve"
"1196","the Adviser of its responsibilities or liabilities hereunder and provided"
"1197","further that the Adviser shall not have the authority to sub-contract advisory"
"1198","responsibilities without the consent of the Trust. The cost of performance of"
"1199","such duties will be borne and paid by the Adviser. No obligation may be imposed"
"1200","on the Trust in any such respect."
"1201","          The Adviser shall supervise and monitor the activities of its"
"1202","representatives, personnel, sub-contractors, and agents in connection with the"
"1203","execution of its duties and obligations hereunder. The appropriate personnel of"
"1204","the Adviser will be made available to consult with the Board at reasonable times"
"1205","and upon reasonable notice concerning the business of the Trust."

"1208","     (d) The Adviser shall maintain records relating to portfolio transactions"
"1209","and the placing and allocation of brokerage orders as are required to be"
"1210","maintained by the Trust under the 1940 Act. The Adviser shall prepare and"
"1211","maintain, or cause to be prepared and maintained, in such form, for such periods"
"1212","and in such locations as may be required by applicable law, all documents and"
"1213","records relating to the services provided by the Adviser pursuant to this"
"1214","Agreement required to be prepared and maintained by the Trust pursuant to the"
"1215","rules and regulations of any national, state, or local government entity with"
"1216","jurisdiction over the Trust, including the Commission and the Internal Revenue"
"1217","Service. The books and records pertaining to the Trust which are in possession"
"1218","of the Adviser shall be the property of the Trust. The Trust, or the Trust's"
"1219","authorized representatives, shall have access to such books and records at all"
"1220","times during the Adviser's normal business hours. Upon the reasonable request of"
"1221","the Trust, copies of any such books and records shall be provided promptly by"
"1222","the Adviser to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives."
"1223","     (e) With respect to a Fund, the Adviser shall have no duties or obligations"
"1224","pursuant to this Agreement, during any period during which the Fund invests all"
"1225","(or substantially all) of its investment assets in a registered, open-end"
"1226","management investment company, or separate series thereof, in accordance with"
"1227","Section 12(d)(1)(E) under the 1940 Act."
"1228","     SECTION 3. DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO THE ADVISER. The Trust has furnished"
"1229","the Adviser with true, correct and complete copies of the following documents:"
"1230","          (a)  The Declaration of Trust, as in effect on the date hereof;"
"1231","          (b)  The Registration Statement filed with the Commission under the"
"1232","               1940 Act and the Securities Act; and"
"1233","          (c)  Written guidelines, policies and procedures adopted by the Trust."
"1234","     The Trust will furnish the Adviser with all future amendments and"
"1235","supplements to the foregoing as soon as practicable after such documents become"
"1236","available. The Trust shall furnish the Adviser with any further documents,"
"1237","materials or information that the Adviser may reasonably request in connection"
"1238","with the performance of its duties hereunder."
"1239","     SECTION 4. DELEGATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES. The Adviser may carry out any of"
"1240","its obligations under this Agreement by employing, subject to supervision by the"
"1241","Adviser, one or more Sub-Adviser(s) who are registered as investment advisers"
"1242","pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Sub-Advisers). Each"
"1243","Sub-Adviser's employment will be evidenced by a separate written agreement"
"1244","approved by the Board and, if required under the 1940 Act, by the shareholders"
"1245","of the Fund (unless the Commission or its staff has given authorization or"
"1246","issued an interpretation dispensing with the requirement of shareholder"
"1247","approval). The Adviser shall not be liable hereunder for any act or omission of"
"1248","any Sub-Adviser, except for failure to exercise good faith in the employment of"
"1249","the Sub-Adviser and for failure to exercise appropriate supervision of such"
"1250","Sub-Adviser, and as may otherwise be agreed in writing. The Adviser shall be"
"1251","solely responsible for compensating any Sub-Adviser for services rendered under"
"1252","any Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Adviser may, from time to time and at any time,"
"1253","terminate any Sub-Adviser and reassume the responsibilities assigned to such"
"1254","Sub-Adviser with respect to any Fund without obtaining the approval of the"
"1255","shareholders of the Fund."
"1256","                                       3"
"1257","<PAGE>"
"1258","     SECTION 5. CONTROL BY BOARD. Any investment activities undertaken by the"
"1259","Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any other activities undertaken"
"1260","by the Adviser on behalf of the Funds, shall at all times be subject to the"
"1261","direction and control of the Board."
"1262","     SECTION 6. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS. In carrying out its"
"1263","obligations under this Agreement, the Adviser shall at all times comply with:"
"1264","     (a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"1265","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"1266","     (b) the Registration Statement of the Trust, as it may be amended from time"
"1267","to time, filed with the Commission under the Securities Act and the 1940 Act;"
"1268","     (c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it may be"
"1269","amended from time to time;"
"1270","     (d) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,"
"1271","applicable to the Trust or the Funds, and any rules and regulations adopted"
"1272","thereunder; and"
"1273","     (e)any other applicable provisions of state or federal law, and any rules"
"1274","and regulations adopted thereunder."
"1275","     SECTION 7. PROXIES. The Adviser shall have responsibility to vote proxies"
"1276","solicited with respect to issuers of securities in which assets of the Funds are"
"1277","invested in accordance with the Trust's policies on proxy voting."
"1278","     SECTION 8. BROKER-DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. In connection with the purchase and"
"1279","sale of securities for the Funds, the Adviser is responsible for broker-dealer"
"1280","selection and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Adviser's primary"
"1281","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain the best"
"1282","price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular"
"1283","transaction for a Fund, the Adviser will consider among other things: the best"
"1284","net price available, the reliability, integrity and financial condition of the"
"1285","broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value"
"1286","of the expected contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing"
"1287","basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any transaction may be less"
"1288","favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the difference is"
"1289","reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio execution services"
"1290","offered. Subject to such policies as the Board may from time to time determine,"
"1291","the Adviser shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any"
"1292","duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a"
"1293","Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and research services to"
"1294","the Adviser an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"1295","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would"
"1296","have charged for effecting that transaction, if the Adviser determines in good"
"1297","faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of"
"1298","the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in"
"1299","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of"
"1300","the Adviser with respect to the Fund and to other clients of the"
"1301","                                       4"
"1302","<PAGE>"
"1303","Adviser. The Adviser is further authorized to allocate the orders placed by it"
"1304","on behalf of the Funds to brokers and dealers who also provide brokerage and"
"1305","research services within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange"
"1306","Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith. Such allocation shall be in such"
"1307","amounts and proportions as the Adviser shall determine and the Adviser will"
"1308","report on said allocations regularly to the Board, indicating the brokers to"
"1309","whom such allocations have been made and the basis therefore."
"1310","     SECTION 9. EXPENSES. All of the ordinary business expenses incurred in the"
"1311","operations of the Funds and the offering of their shares shall be borne by the"
"1312","Funds unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement. The expenses"
"1313","borne by the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage commissions,"
"1314","taxes, legal, auditing or governmental fees, the cost of preparing share"
"1315","certificates, custodian, transfer agent and shareholder service agent costs,"

"1319","to shareholders, the fees and other expenses incurred by the Funds in connection"
"1320","with membership in investment company organizations and the cost of printing"
"1321","copies of prospectuses and statements of additional information distributed to"
"1322","the Funds' shareholders."
"1323","     The Adviser shall pay its own expenses in connection with the services to"
"1324","be provided by it pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, the Adviser shall be"
"1325","responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the"
"1326","Trust: (a) to amend the Trust's registration statement or supplement the Fund's"
"1327","prospectus, and circulate the same, to reflect a change in the personnel of the"
"1328","Adviser responsible for making investment decisions in relation to a Fund; (b)"
"1329","to obtain shareholder approval of a new sub-advisory agreement as a result of a"
"1330","change in control (as such term in defined in Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act)"

"1333","change; or (c) to meet other legal or regulatory obligations caused by actions"
"1334","of the Adviser."
"1335","     SECTION 10. COMPENSATION."
"1336","     (a) As compensation for the advisory services provided under this"
"1337","Agreement, the Trust shall pay the Adviser fees, payable monthly, at the annual"
"1338","rates indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such Schedule may be amended or"
"1339","supplemented from time to time;"
"1340","     (b) Except as provided in the following paragraph, no fee shall be payable"
"1341","hereunder with respect to a Fund during any period in which the Fund invests all"
"1342","(or substantially all) of its investment assets in a single registered, open-end"
"1343","management investment company, or separate series thereof, in accordance with"
"1344","Section 12(d)(1)(E) under the 1940 Act (a Master-Feeder Fund structure);"
"1345","     (c) The adviser shall receive a fee of 0.25% (0.35% in the case of the"
"1346","WealthBuilder Funds) for asset allocation services if a Fund invests some of its"
"1347","investment assets in two or more registered, open-end management investment"
"1348","companies, or separate series thereof, in each case, in accordance with Section"
"1349","12(d)(1)(G) under the Act, the rules thereunder or an exemptive order"
"1350","                                       5"
"1351","<PAGE>"

"1363","sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security."
"1364","     SECTION 12. NON-EXCLUSIVITY. The services of the Adviser to the Funds are"
"1365","not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Adviser shall be free to render"
"1366","investment advisory or other services to others (including other investment"
"1367","companies) and to engage in other activities. It is understood and agreed that"
"1368","officers or directors of the Adviser may serve as officers and directors of the"
"1369","Trust, and that officers or directors of the Trust may serve as officers or"
"1370","directors of the Adviser, to the extent that such services may be permitted by"

"1477","longer acting as investment adviser to any Fund, the Trust shall, upon request"
"1478","by the Adviser, promptly take such action as may be necessary to change its"
"1479","corporate name to one not containing the words Wells Fargo and following such"
"1480","change, shall not use the words Wells Fargo, or any combination thereof, as a"
"1481","part of its corporate name or for any other commercial purpose, and shall use"
"1482","its best efforts to cause its trustees, officers and shareholders to take any"
"1483","and all actions that the Adviser may request to effect the foregoing and to"

"1486","performance of the Funds or any specific level of performance, the success of"
"1487","any investment decision or strategy that the Adviser may use, or the success of"
"1488","the Adviser's overall management of the Funds. The Trust understands that"
"1489","investment decisions made for the Funds by the Adviser are subject to various"
"1490","market, currency, economic and business risks, and that those investment"
"1491","decisions will not always be profitable. The Adviser will manage only the"
"1492","securities, cash and other investments for which management responsibility is"
"1493","delegated to it and which are held in the Funds' account(s) and, in making"
"1494","investment decisions for the Funds, the Adviser will not consider any other"
