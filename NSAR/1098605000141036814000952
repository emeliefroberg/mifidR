"1680","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1681","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"1682","PIMCO Managed Accounts Trust"
"1683","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"1684","financial statements of PIMCO Fixed Income"
"1685","SHares: Series C, PIMCO Fixed Income SHares:"
"1686","Series LD, PIMCO Fixed Income SHares: Series M,"
"1687","PIMCO Fixed Income SHares: Series R, and PIMCO"
"1688","Fixed Income SHares: TE (constituting PIMCO"
"1689","Managed Accounts Trust, hereafter referred to as the"
"1690","Portfolios) as of and for the year ended October 31,"
"1691","2014, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1692","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1693","States), we considered the Portfolios' internal control"
"1694","over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1695","safeguarding securities,"
"1696","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1697","purpose of expressing our opinion"
"1698","on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1699","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1700","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1701","effectiveness of the Portfolios' internal control over"
"1702","financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express"
"1703","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Portfolios'"
"1704","internal control over financial reporting."
"1705","The management of the Portfolios is responsible"
"1706","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"1707","internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1708","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1709","judgments by management are required to"
"1710","assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1711","controls. A portfolio's internal control over"
"1712","financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1713","provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1714","reliability of financial"
"1715","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1716","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1717","generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"1718","portfolio's internal control over financial reporting"
"1719","includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1720","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1721","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1722","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"1723","portfolio; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1724","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1725","preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"1726","with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1727","that receipts and expenditures of the portfolio are"
"1728","being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"1729","of management and trustees of the portfolio; and"
"1730","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"

"1732","acquisition, use or disposition"
"1733","of a portfolio's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1734","financial statements."
"1735","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1736","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1737","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1738","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"1739","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"1740","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1741","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1742","deteriorate."
"1743","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1744","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1745","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1746","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1747","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1748","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1749","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"1750","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1751","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1752","Portfolios' annual or interim financial statements will"
"1753","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1754","Our consideration of the Portfolios' internal control over financial"

"1757","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"1758","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1759","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"1760","deficiencies in the Portfolios' internal control over financial"
"1761","reporting and their operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1762","securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"

"1944","including expenses incurred in connection with litigation,"
"1945","proceedings, other claims and the legal obligations of the"
"1946","Trust to indemnify its trustees, officers, employees,"
"1947","shareholders, distributors, and agents with respect thereto."
"1948","Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust may enter into a"
"1949","separate agreement, which shall be controlling over this"
"1950","Contract, as amended, pursuant to which some or all of the"
"1951","foregoing expenses of this Section 3(b) shall be the"
"1952","responsibility of the other party or parties to that"
"1953","agreement.  As such, the Adviser or an affiliate may bear"
"1954","some or all of the foregoing expenses under the terms of"
"1955","one or more other agreements."
"1956","4.  (a) The Adviser shall provide to the Trust investment"
"1957","guidance and policy direction in connection with the"
"1958","management of the Portfolios, including oral and written"
"1959","research, analysis, advice, and statistical and economic data"
"1960","and information."
"1961","Consistent with the investment objective(s), policies and"
"1962","restrictions applicable to the Trust and the Portfolios, the"
"1963","Adviser will determine the securities and other assets to be"
"1964","purchased or sold or the other techniques to be utilized"
"1965","(including, but not limited to, the incurrence of leverage"
"1966","and securities lending) by each Portfolio and will determine"
"1967","what portion of each Portfolio shall be invested in"
"1968","securities or other assets, and what portion, if any, should"
"1969","be held uninvested."
"1970","The Trust will have the benefit of the investment analysis"
"1971","and research, the review of current economic conditions"
"1972","and trends and the consideration of long-range investment"
"1973","policy generally available to investment advisory clients of"
"1974","the Adviser. It is understood that the Adviser will not, to"
"1975","the extent inconsistent with applicable law, use any"
"1976","material nonpublic information pertinent to investment"
"1977","decisions undertaken in connection with this Contract that"
"1978","may be in its possession or in the possession of any of its"
"1979","affiliates."
"1980","(b) As manager of the assets of the Portfolios, the Adviser"
"1981","shall make investments for the account of the Portfolios in"
"1982","accordance with the Adviser's best judgment and within the"
"1983","investment objective(s), policies and restrictions set forth in"
"1984","the Prospectus, the 1940 Act, any applicable SEC"
"1985","exemptive relief, no-action letters or other guidance, and"
"1986","the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986"
"1987","relating to regulated investment companies, subject to"
"1988","policy decisions adopted by the Trust's Board of Trustees."
"1989","(c) The Adviser shall furnish to the Trust's Board of"
"1990","Trustees periodic reports on the investment performance of"
"1991","the Trust and its Portfolios and on the performance of its"
"1992","obligations under this Contract and shall supply such"
"1993","additional reports and information as the Trust's officers or"
"1994","Board of Trustees shall reasonably request."
"1995","(d) On occasions when the Adviser deems the purchase or"
"1996","sale of a security to be in the best interest of a Portfolio as"
"1997","well as other of its clients, the Adviser, to the extent"
"1998","permitted by applicable law, may, but shall not be obligated"
"1999","to, aggregate the securities to be so sold or purchased in"
"2000","order to seek to obtain the best execution of the order or"
"2001","lower brokerage commissions or other transaction costs, if"
"2002","any. The Adviser may also on occasion purchase or sell a"
"2003","particular security for one or more clients in different"
"2004","amounts. On either occasion, and to the extent permitted by"
"2005","applicable law and regulations, allocation of the securities"
"2006","so purchased or sold, as well as the expenses incurred in the"
"2007","transaction, will be made by the Adviser in the manner it"
"2008","considers to be equitable and consistent with its fiduciary"
"2009","obligations to the Trust and to such other customers."
"2010","(e) The Adviser may cause a Portfolio to pay a broker"
"2011","which provides brokerage and research services to the"
"2012","Adviser a commission for effecting a securities transaction"
"2013","in excess of the amount another broker might have charged."
"2014","Such higher commissions may not be paid unless the"
"2015","Adviser determines in good faith that the amount paid is"
"2016","reasonable in relation to the services received in terms of"
"2017","the particular transaction or the Adviser's overall"
"2018","responsibilities to the Trust and any other of the Adviser's"
"2019","clients."
"2020","(f) The Adviser may itself, or may cause a Portfolio to,"
"2021","commence, join in, consent to or oppose the reorganization,"
"2022","recapitalization, consolidation, sale, merger, foreclosure,"
"2023","liquidation or readjustment of the finances of any person or"
"2024","the securities or other property thereof, and to deposit any"
"2025","securities or other property with any protective,"
"2026","reorganization or similar committee.  Without limiting the"
"2027","generality of the foregoing, the Adviser may represent a"
"2028","Portfolio on a creditors' (or similar) committee."
"2029","(g) The Adviser shall have sole authority to exercise"
"2030","whatever powers the Trust may possess with respect to any"
"2031","of the assets of a Portfolio, including, but not limited to, the"
"2032","right to vote proxies, the power to exercise rights, options,"
"2033","warrants, conversion privileges and redemption privileges,"
"2034","and to tender securities pursuant to a tender offer."
"2035","5.  The Adviser shall give the Trust the benefit of the"
"2036","Adviser's best judgment and efforts in rendering services"
"2037","under this Contract. The Adviser may rely on information"
"2038","reasonably believed by it to be accurate and reliable.  As an"
"2039","inducement for the Adviser's undertaking to render these"
"2040","services under this Contract, the Trust agrees that neither"
"2041","the Adviser nor its members, officers, directors or"
"2042","employees shall be subject to any liability for, or any"
"2043","damages, expenses or losses incurred in connection with,"
"2044","any act or omission or mistake in judgment connected with"
"2045","or arising out of any services rendered under this Contract,"
"2046","except by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross"
"2047","negligence in performance of the Adviser's duties, or by"
"2048","reason of reckless disregard of the Adviser's obligations"
"2049","and duties hereunder."
"2050","6.  (a) In consideration of the services to be rendered by the"
"2051","Adviser under this Contract, each Portfolio of the Trust"
"2052","shall pay the Adviser a monthly fee on the first business"
"2053","day of each month, based upon the average daily value (as"
"2054","determined on each business day at the time and in the"
"2055","manner set forth in the Prospectus for determining net asset"
"2056","value per share) of the net assets of the Portfolio, as"
"2057","applicable, during the preceding month, at the annual rates"
"2058","provided for in Exhibit A, as such Exhibit A may be"
"2059","amended from time to time. It is understood that the fee"
"2060","rate payable by a Portfolio hereunder may be 0.00%, such"
"2061","that the Adviser agrees to provide the services hereunder to"
"2062","such Portfolio for no compensation. The average daily"
"2063","value of the net assets of a Portfolio shall be determined by"
"2064","taking an average of all the determinations of such amount"
"2065","during such month at the close of business on each business"
"2066","day during such month while this Contract is in effect."
"2067","Such fee, if any, shall be payable for each month within 5"
"2068","business days after the end of such month."
"2069","If the fees (if any) payable to the Adviser pursuant to this"
"2070","paragraph 6 with respect to a Portfolio begin to accrue"
"2071","before the end of any month or if this Contract terminates"
"2072","before the end of any month, the fees payable by the"
"2073","Portfolio for the period from that date to the end of that"
"2074","month or from the beginning of that month to the date of"
"2075","termination, as the case may be, shall be pro-rated"
"2076","according to the proportion which the period bears to the"
"2077","full month in which the effectiveness or termination occurs."
"2078","For purposes of this Contract, a business day is any day a"
"2079","Portfolio is open for business or as otherwise provided in"
"2080","the Trust's Prospectus."
"2081","In the event that the Adviser has agreed to a fee waiver or"
"2082","an expense limitation or reimbursement arrangement with a"
"2083","Portfolio, subject to such terms and conditions as the"
"2084","Adviser and the Trust may set forth in such agreement, the"
"2085","compensation due the Adviser hereunder (if any) shall be"
"2086","reduced, and, if necessary, the Adviser shall bear expenses"
"2087","with respect to the Portfolio, to the extent required by such"
"2088","fee waiver or expense limitation or reimbursement"
"2089","arrangement."
"2090","7.  The Adviser agrees that it shall promptly notify the"
"2091","Trust in the event (i) that the SEC has censured the"
"2092","Adviser; placed limitations upon its activities, functions or"
"2093","operations; suspended or revoked its registration as an"
"2094","investment adviser; or has commenced proceedings or an"
"2095","investigation that may result in any of these actions, and (ii)"
"2096","upon having a reasonable basis for believing that a"
"2097","Portfolio has ceased to qualify or might not qualify as a"
"2098","regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the"
"2099","Internal Revenue Code.  The Adviser further agrees to"
"2100","notify the Trust promptly of any material fact known to the"
"2101","Adviser that is not contained in the Registration Statement,"
"2102","Prospectus or Statement of Additional Information for the"
"2103","Trust, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or of any"
"2104","statement contained therein that becomes untrue in any"
"2105","material respect."
"2106","8.  (a) This Contract shall take effect as to each Portfolio as"
"2107","of the close of business on the date indicated above (and,"
"2108","with respect to any amendment, or with respect to any"
"2109","additional Portfolio, the date of the amendment or"
"2110","supplement hereto), and shall remain in effect, unless"
"2111","sooner terminated as provided herein, for one year from"
"2112","such date (or, with respect to any additional Portfolio, for"
"2113","two years from the date of the supplement), and shall"
"2114","continue thereafter on an annual basis with respect to such"
"2115","Portfolio provided that such continuance is specifically"
"2116","approved at least annually (i) by the vote of a majority of"
"2117","the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940"
"2118","Act) of the Portfolio or by the Trust's Board of Trustees;"
"2119","and (ii) by the vote, cast in person at a meeting called for"
"2120","such purpose, of a majority of the Trust's Trustees who are"
"2121","not parties to this Contract or interested persons (as"
"2122","defined in the 1940 Act) of any such party; provided,"
"2123","however, that if the continuance of this Contract is"
"2124","submitted to the shareholders of a Portfolio for their"
"2125","approval and such shareholders fail to approve such"
"2126","continuance of this Contract as provided herein, the"
"2127","Adviser may continue to serve hereunder with respect to"
"2128","such Portfolio in a manner consistent with the 1940 Act."
"2129","This Contract may not be materially amended with respect"
"2130","to a Portfolio or Portfolios without a vote of a majority of"
"2131","the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940"
"2132","Act) of the pertinent Portfolio or Portfolios.  Exhibit A may"
"2133","be amended from time to time to add new Portfolios"
"2134","without a vote of any shareholders."
