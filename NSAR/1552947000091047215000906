"504","NJ 07068"
"505","Report of Independent"
"506","Registered Public"
"507","Accounting Firm"
"508","To the Shareholders and"
"509","Board of Trustees of"
"510","Conductor Global Fund:"
"511","In planning and"
"512","performing our audit of"
"513","the financial statements"
"514","of Conductor Global"
"515","Fund (the Fund) as of"
"516","October 31, 2015 and"
"517","for the year ended"
"518","October 31, 2015, in"
"519","accordance with the"
"520","standards of the Public"
"521","Fund Accounting"
"522","Oversight Board (United"
"523","States), we considered"
"524","the Fund's internal"
"525","control over financial"
"526","reporting, including"
"527","controls over"
"528","safeguarding securities,"
"529","as a basis for designing"
"530","our auditing procedures"
"531","for the purpose of"
"532","expressing our opinion"
"533","on the financial"
"534","statements and to"
"535","comply with the"
"536","requirements of Form"
"537","N-SAR, but not for the"
"538","purpose of expressing an"
"539","opinion on the"
"540","effectiveness of the"
"541","Fund's internal control"
"542","over financial reporting."
"543","Accordingly, we express"
"544","no such opinion."
"545","The management of the"
"546","Fund is responsible for"
"547","establishing and"
"548","maintaining effective"
"549","internal control over"
"550","financial reporting. In"
"551","fulfilling this"
"552","responsibility, estimates"
"553","and judgments by"
"554","management are"
"555","required to assess the"
"556","expected benefits and"
"557","related costs of controls."
"558","A fund's internal control"
"559","over financial reporting"
"560","is a process designed to"
"561","provide reasonable"
"562","assurance regarding the"
"563","reliability of financial"
"564","reporting and the"
"565","preparation of financial"
"566","statements for external"
"567","purposes in accordance"
"568","with generally accepted"
"569","accounting principles"
"570","(GAAP). A fund's"
"571","internal control over"
"572","financial reporting"
"573","includes those policies"
"574","and procedures that (1)"
"575","pertain to the"
"576","maintenance of records"
"577","that, in reasonable"
"578","detail, accurately and"
"579","fairly reflect the"
"580","transactions and"
"581","dispositions of the"
"582","assets of the fund; (2)"
"583","provide reasonable"
"584","assurance that"
"585","transactions are"
"586","recorded as necessary"
"587","to permit preparation of"
"588","financial statements in"
"589","accordance with GAAP,"
"590","and that receipts and"
"591","expenditures of the fund"
"592","are being made only in"
"593","accordance with"
"594","authorizations of"
"595","management and"
"596","directors of the fund;"
"597","and (3) provide"
"598","reasonable assurance"
"599","regarding prevention or"
"600","timely detection of"
"601","unauthorized"
"602","acquisition, use or"
"603","disposition of a fund's"
"604","assets that could have a"
"605","material effect on the"
"606","financial statements."
"607","Because of its inherent"
"608","limitations, internal"
"609","control over financial"
"610","reporting may not"
"611","prevent or detect"
"612","misstatements. Also,"
"613","projections of any"
"614","evaluation of"
"615","effectiveness to future"
"616","periods are subject to"
"617","the risk that controls"
"618","may become inadequate"
"619","because of changes in"
"620","conditions, or that the"
"621","degree of compliance"
"622","with the policies or"
"623","procedures may"
"624","deteriorate."
"625","A deficiency in internal"
"626","control over financial"
"627","reporting exists when"
"628","the design or operation"
"629","of a control does not"
"630","allow management or"
"631","employees, in the"
"632","normal course of"
"633","performing their"
"634","assigned functions, to"
"635","prevent or detect"
"636","misstatements on a"
"637","timely basis. A material"
"638","weakness is a"
"639","deficiency, or"
"640","combination of"
"641","deficiencies, in internal"
"642","control over financial"
"643","reporting, such that"
"644","there is reasonable"
"645","possibility that a"
"646","material misstatement of"
"647","the fund's annual or"
"648","interim financial"
"649","statements will not be"
"650","prevented or detected on"
"651","a timely basis."
"652","Our consideration of"
"653","the Fund's internal"
"654","control over financial"
"655","reporting was for the"
"656","limited purpose"
"657","described in the first"
"658","paragraph and would"
"659","not necessarily disclose"
"660","all deficiencies in"
"661","internal control that"
"662","might be material"
"663","weaknesses under"
"664","standards established by"
"665","the Public Company"
"666","Accounting Oversight"
"667","Board (United States)."
"668","However, we noted no"
"669","deficiencies in the"
"670","Fund's internal control"
"671","over financial"
"672","reporting and its"
"673","operation, including"
"674","controls over safeguarding"
"675","securities that we consider"
"676","to be a material weakness"
"677","as defined above as of"
"678","October 31, 2015."
"679","This report is intended"
"680","solely for the information"
"681","and use of management"
"682","and the Board of Trustees"
"683","of the Fund and the"
"684","Securities and Exchange"
"685","Commission and is not"
"686","intended to be and should"
"687","not be used by anyone"
"688","other than these specified"
"689","parties."
