"564","</font> The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</div>"

"597","<DESCRIPTION>AUDITOR CHANGE"
"598","<TEXT>"
"599","Prior to July 3, 2017 Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. (the Adviser), the"
"600","Fund's investment adviser, was an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of"
"601","UniCredit S.p.A. (UniCredit). On that date, UniCredit completed the sale of"
"602","its Pioneer Investments business, which includes the Adviser, to Amundi (the"
"603","Transaction). As a result of the Transaction, the Adviser became an indirect,"
"604","wholly-owned subsidiary of Amundi. Amundi is controlled by Credit Agricole"
"605","S.A. Amundi is headquartered in Paris, France, and, as of September 30, 2016,"
"606","had more than $1.1 trillion in assets under management worldwide."
"607","Deloitte & Touche LLP (D&T), the Fund's previous independent registered"
"608","public accounting firm, informed the Audit Committee and the Board that it"
"609","would no longer be independent with respect to the Fund upon the"
"610","completion of the Transaction as a result of certain services being provided to"
"611","Amundi and Credit Agricole, and, accordingly, that it intended to resign as the"
"612","Fund's independent registered public accounting firm upon the completion of"
"613","the Transaction. D&T's resignation was effective on July 3, 2017, when the"
"614","Transaction was completed."
"615","During the periods as to which D&T has served as the Fund's independent"
"616","registered public accounting firm, including the Fund's two most recent fiscal"
"617","years preceding the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, D&T's reports on"
"618","the Fund's financial statements have not contained an adverse opinion or"
"619","disclaimer of opinion and have not been qualified or modified as to"
"620","uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. Further, there have been no"
"621","disagreements with D&T on any matter of accounting principles or practices,"
"622","financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not"
"623","resolved to the satisfaction of D&T, would have caused D&T to make reference"
"624","to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report on the"
"625","financial statements. In addition, there have been no reportable events of the"
"626","kind described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K under the Securities"
"627","Exchange Act of 1934."
"628","Effective immediately following the completion of the Transaction on July 3,"
"629","2017, the Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee,"
"630","engaged a new independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP"
"631","(EY), for the Fund's fiscal year ended October 31, 2017."
"632","Prior to its engagement, EY had advised the Fund's Audit Committee that EY"
"633","had identified the following matters, in each case relating to services rendered"
"634","by other member firms of Ernst & Young Global Limited, all of which are"
"635","located outside the United States, to UniCredit and certain of its subsidiaries"
"636","during the period commencing July 1, 2016, that it determined to be"
"637","inconsistent with the auditor independence rules set forth by the Securities"
"638","and Exchange Commission (SEC): (a) project management support services"
"639","to UniCredit in the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Serbia and Slovenia in"
"640","relation to twenty-two projects, that were determined to be inconsistent with"
"641","Rule 2-01(c)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X (management functions); (b) two"
"642","engagements for UniCredit in Italy where fees were contingent/success based"
"643","and that were determined to be inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(5) of"
"644","Regulation S-X (contingent fees); (c) four engagements where legal and expert"
"645","services were provided to UniCredit in the Czech Republic and Germany, and"
"646","twenty engagements where the legal advisory services were provided to"
"647","UniCredit in Austria, Czech Republic, Italy and Poland, that were determined"
"648","to be inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(4)(ix) and (x) of Regulation S-X (legal and"
"649","expert services); and (d) two engagements for UniCredit in Italy involving"
"650","assistance in the sale of certain assets, that were determined to be"
"651","inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(4)(viii) of Regulation S-X (broker-dealer,"
"652","investment advisor or investment banking services). None of the foregoing"
"653","services involved the Fund, any of the other funds in the Pioneer Family of"
"654","Funds or any other Pioneer entity sold by UniCredit in the Transaction."
"655","EY advised the Audit Committee that it had considered the matters described"
"656","above and had concluded that such matters would not impair EY's ability to"
"657","exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the"
"658","financial statements of the Fund under the SEC and Public Company"
"659","Accounting Oversight Board independence rules, and that a reasonable"
"660","investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would reach"
"661","the same conclusion. Management and the Audit Committee considered these"
"662","matters and discussed the matters with EY and, based upon EY's description of"
"663","the matters and statements made by EY, Management and the Audit"
"664","Committee believe that EY will be capable of exercising objective and"
"665","impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the financial statements of"
"666","the Fund, and Management further believes that a reasonable investor with"
"667","knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would reach the same"
"668","conclusion."
