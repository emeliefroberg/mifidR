"529","Public Company"

"566","The"

"571","maintaining"
"572","effective internal"

"595","assurance"
"596","regarding the"
"597","reliability of"
"598","financial"
"599","reporting and the"
"600","preparation of"
"601","financial"
"602","statements for"
"603","external"
"604","purposes in"
"605","accordance with"
"606","accounting"
"607","principles"
"608","generally"
"609","accepted in the"
"610","United States of"
"611","America"
"612","(GAAP).  A"
"613","company's"
"614","internal control"
"615","over financial"
"616","reporting"
"617","includes those"
"618","policies and"
"619","procedures that"
"620","(1) pertain to the"
"621","maintenance of"
"622","records that, in"
"623","reasonable"
"624","detail, accurately"
"625","and fairly reflect"
"626","the transactions"
"627","and dispositions"
"628","of the assets of"
"629","the company; (2)"
"630","provide"
"631","reasonable"
"632","assurance that"
"633","transactions are"

"635","necessary to"
"636","permit"
"637","preparation of"
"638","the financial"
"639","statements in"
"640","accordance with"
"641","GAAP, and that"
"642","receipts and"
"643","expenditures of"
"644","the company are"
"645","being made only"
"646","in accordance"
"647","with"
"648","authorizations of"
"649","management and"
"650","trustees of the"
"651","company; and (3)"

"653","reasonable"
"654","assurance"

"656","prevention or"
"657","timely detection"
"658","of unauthorized"
"659","acquisition, use"
"660","or disposition of"
"661","a company's"
"662","assets that could"
"663","have a material"
"664","effect on the"
"665","financial"
"666","statements."
"667","Because of"
"668","inherent"
"669","limitations,"
"670","internal control"
"671","over financial"
"672","reporting may not"
"673","prevent or detect"
"674","misstatements."
"675","Also, projections"
"676","of any evaluation"
"677","of effectiveness"
"678","to future periods"
"679","are subject to the"
"680","risk that controls"
"681","may become"
"682","inadequate"
"683","because of"
"684","changes in"
"685","conditions or that"
"686","the degree of"
"687","compliance with"
"688","the policies or"
"689","procedures may"
"690","deteriorate."
"691","A deficiency in"
"692","internal control"
"693","over financial"
"694","reporting exists"
"695","when the design"
"696","or operation of a"
"697","control does not"
"698","allow"
"699","management or"
"700","employees, in"
"701","the normal"
"702","course of"
"703","performing their"
"704","assigned"
"705","functions, to"
"706","prevent or detect"
"707","misstatements"
"708","on a timely basis."
"709","A material"
"710","weakness is a"
"711","deficiency, or"
"712","combination of"
"713","deficiencies, in"
"714","internal control"
"715","over financial"
"716","reporting, such"
"717","that there is a"
"718","reasonable"
"719","possibility that a"
"720","material"
"721","misstatement of"
"722","the Fund's"
"723","annual or interim"
"724","financial"
"725","statements will"
"726","not be prevented"
"727","or detected on a"
"728","timely basis."
"729","Our"
"730","consideration of"
"731","the Fund's"
"732","internal control"
"733","over financial"
"734","reporting was for"
"735","the limited"
"736","purpose"
"737","described in the"
"738","first paragraph"
"739","and would not"
"740","necessarily"
"741","disclose all"
"742","deficiencies in"
"743","internal control"
"744","that might be"
"745","material"
"746","weaknesses"
"747","under standards"
"748","established by"
"749","the PCAOB."
"750","However, we"
"751","noted no"
"752","deficiencies in"
"753","the internal"
"754","control over"
"755","financial"
"756","reporting and"
"757","operations,"
"758","including controls"
"759","over"
"760","safeguarding"
"761","securities that we"
"762","consider to be"
"763","material"
"764","weaknesses, as"
"765","defined above,"
"766","as of December"
"767","31, 2014."
