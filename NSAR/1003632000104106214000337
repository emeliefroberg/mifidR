"2741","Asset Allocation Trust, SEI Institutional"
"2742","Investments Trust, Adviser Managed Trust, New"

"2744","Trust (each a Trust and, collectively, the"
"2745","Trusts) are valuable assets that are vital to"
"2746","the each Trusts success.  The Trusts senior"
"2747","financial officers (SFOs) are responsible for"
"2748","conducting the Trusts business in a manner"
"2749","that demonstrates a commitment to the highest"
"2750","standards of integrity. The Trusts SFOs"
"2751","include the principal executive officer, the"
"2752","principal financial officer, comptroller or"
"2753","principal accounting officer, and any person"
"2754","who performs a similar function."
"2755","The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act)"
"2756","effected sweeping corporate disclosure and"
"2757","financial reporting reform on public"
"2758","companies, including mutual funds, to address"
"2759","corporate malfeasance and assure investors"
"2760","that the companies in which they invest are"
"2761","accurately and completely disclosing financial"
"2762","information.  Under the Act, all public"
"2763","companies (including the Trusts) must either"
"2764","have a code of ethics for their SFOs, or"
"2765","disclose why they do not.  The Act was"
"2766","intended to foster corporate environments"
"2767","which encourage employees to question and"
"2768","report unethical and potentially illegal"
"2769","business practices.  Each Trust has chosen to"
"2770","adopt this Financial Officer Code of Ethics"
"2771","(the Code) to encourage its SFOs to act in a"
"2772","manner consistent with the highest principles"
"2773","of ethical conduct."
"2774","2.	Purposes of the Code"
"2775","The purposes of this Code are:"
"2776","To promote honest and ethical conduct"
"2777","by each Trusts SFOs, including the"
"2778","ethical handling of actual or"
"2779","apparent conflicts of interest"
"2780","between personal and professional"
"2781","relationships;"
"2782","To assist each Trusts SFOs in"
"2783","recognizing and avoiding conflicts of"
"2784","interest, including disclosing to an"
"2785","appropriate person any material"
"2786","transaction or relationship that"
"2787","reasonably could be expected to give"
"2788","rise to such a conflict;"
"2789","To promote full, fair, accurate,"
"2790","timely, and understandable disclosure"
"2791","in reports and documents that the"
"2792","Trusts file with, or submit to, the"
"2793","SEC and in other public"
"2794","communications made by the Trusts;"
"2795","To promote compliance with applicable"
"2796","laws, rules and regulations;"
"2797","To encourage the prompt internal"
"2798","reporting to an appropriate person of"
"2799","violations of this Code; and"
"2800","To establish accountability for"
"2801","adherence to this Code."
"2802","3.	Questions about this Code"
"2803","Each Trusts compliance officer designated to"
"2804","oversee compliance with the Trusts Code of"
"2805","Ethics adopted pursuant to Rule 17j-1 shall"
"2806","serve as Compliance Officer for the"
"2807","implementation and administration of this"
"2808","Code.  You should direct your questions about"
"2809","this Code to the Compliance Officer."
"2810","4.	Conduct Guidelines"
"2811","Each Trust has adopted the following"
"2812","guidelines under which the Trusts SFOs must"
"2813","perform their official duties and conduct the"
"2814","business affairs of the Trust."
"2815","a)	Ethical and honest conduct is of"
"2816","paramount importance.  Each Trusts SFOs"
"2817","must act with honesty and integrity and"
"2818","avoid violations of this Code, including"
"2819","the avoidance of actual or apparent"
"2820","conflicts of interest with the Trust in"
"2821","personal and professional relationships."
"2822","b)	SFOs must disclose material transactions"
"2823","or relationships. Each Trusts SFOs must"
"2824","disclose to the Compliance Officer any"
"2825","actual or apparent conflicts of interest"
"2826","the SFO may have with the Trust that"
"2827","reasonably could be expected to give"
"2828","rise to any violations of this Code."
"2829","Such conflicts of interest may arise as"
"2830","a result of material transactions or"
"2831","business or personal relationships to"
"2832","which the SFO may be a party.  If it is"
"2833","not possible to disclose the matter to"
"2834","the Compliance Officer, it should be"
"2835","disclosed to the Trusts Chief Financial"
"2836","Officer, Chief Executive Officer or"
"2837","another appropriate person.  In addition"
"2838","to disclosing any actual or apparent"
"2839","conflicts of interest in which an SFO is"
"2840","personally involved, the Trusts SFOs"
"2841","have an obligation to report any other"
"2842","actual or apparent conflicts which they"
"2843","discover or of which they otherwise"
"2844","become aware.  If you are unsure whether"
"2845","a particular fact pattern gives rise to"
"2846","a conflict of interest, or whether a"
"2847","particular transaction or relationship"
"2848","is material, you should bring the matter"
"2849","to the attention of the Compliance"
"2850","Officer."
"2851","c)	Standards for quality of information"
"2852","shared with service providers of the"
"2853","Trusts.  Each Trusts SFOs must at all"
"2854","times seek to provide information to the"
"2855","Trusts service providers (adviser,"
"2856","administrator, outside auditor, outside"
"2857","counsel, custodian, etc.) that is"
"2858","accurate, complete, objective, relevant,"
"2859","timely, and understandable."
"2860","d)	Standards for quality of information"
"2861","included in periodic reports. Each"
"2862","Trusts SFOs must at all times endeavor"
"2863","to ensure full, fair, timely, accurate,"
"2864","and understandable disclosure in the"
"2865","Trusts periodic reports."
"2866","e)	Compliance with laws.  Each Trusts SFOs"
"2867","must comply with the federal securities"
"2868","laws and other laws and rules applicable"
"2869","to the Trusts, such as the Internal"
"2870","Revenue Code."
"2871","f)	Standard of care.  Each Trusts SFOs must"
"2872","at all times act in good faith and with"
"2873","due care, competence and diligence,"
"2874","without misrepresenting material facts"
"2875","or allowing your independent judgment to"
"2876","be subordinated. Each Trusts SFOs must"
"2877","conduct the affairs of the Trust in a"
"2878","responsible manner, consistent with this"
"2879","Code."
"2880","g)	Confidentiality of information. Each"
"2881","Trusts SFOs must respect and protect the"
"2882","confidentiality of information acquired"
"2883","in the course of their professional"
"2884","duties, except when authorized by the"
"2885","Trust to disclose it or where disclosure"
"2886","is otherwise legally mandated.  You may"
"2887","not use confidential information"
"2888","acquired in the course of your work for"
"2889","personal advantage."
"2890","h)	Sharing of information and educational"
"2891","standards.  Each Trusts SFOs should"
"2892","share information with relevant parties"
"2893","to keep them informed of the business"
"2894","affairs of the Trust, as appropriate,"
"2895","and maintain skills important and"
"2896","relevant to the Trusts needs."
"2897","i)	Promote ethical conduct. Each Trusts"
"2898","SFOs should at all times proactively"
"2899","promote ethical behavior among peers in"
"2900","your work environment."
"2901","j)	Standards for recordkeeping.  Each"
"2902","Trusts SFOs must at all times endeavor"
"2903","to ensure that the Trusts financial"
"2904","books and records are thoroughly and"
"2905","accurately maintained to the best of"
"2906","their knowledge in a manner consistent"
"2907","with applicable laws and this Code."
"2908","5.	Waivers of this Code"
"2909","You may request a waiver of a provision of"
"2910","this Code by submitting your request in"
"2911","writing to the Compliance Officer for"
"2912","appropriate review.  For example, if a family"
"2913","member works for a service provider that"
"2914","prepares a Trusts financial statements, you"
"2915","may have a potential conflict of interest in"
"2916","reviewing those statements and should seek a"
"2917","waiver of this Code to review the work.  An"
"2918","executive officer of each Trust, or another"
"2919","appropriate person (such as a designated Board"
"2920","or Audit Committee member), will decide"
"2921","whether to grant a waiver.  All waivers of"
"2922","this code must be disclosed to the applicable"
"2923","Trusts shareholders to the extent required by"
"2924","SEC rules."
"2925","6.	Affirmation of the Code"
"2926","Upon adoption of the Code, each Trusts SFOs"
"2927","must affirm in writing that they have"
"2928","received, read and understand the Code, and"
"2929","annually thereafter must affirm that they have"
"2930","complied with the requirements of the Code. To"
"2931","the extent necessary, each Trusts Compliance"
"2932","Officer will provide guidance on the conduct"
"2933","required by this Code and the manner in which"
"2934","violations or suspected violations must be"
"2935","reported and waivers must be requested."
"2936","7.	Reporting Violations"
"2937","In the event that an SFO discovers or, in good"
"2938","faith, suspects a violation of this Code, the"
"2939","SFO must immediately report the violation or"
"2940","suspected violation to the Compliance Officer."
"2941","The Compliance Officer may, in his discretion,"
"2942","consult with another member of the Trusts"
"2943","senior management or the Board in determining"
"2944","how to address the suspected violation.  For"
"2945","example, a Code violation may occur when a"
"2946","periodic report or financial statement of a"
"2947","Trust omits a material fact, or is technically"
"2948","accurate but, in the view of the SFO, is"
"2949","written in a way that obscures its meaning."
"2950","SFOs who report violations or suspected"
"2951","violations in good faith will not be subject"
"2952","to retaliation of any kind.  Reported"
"2953","violations will be investigated and addressed"
"2954","promptly and will be treated as confidential"
"2955","to the extent possible."
"2956","8.	Violations of the Code"
"2957","Dishonest or unethical conduct or conduct that"
"2958","is illegal will constitute a violation of this"
"2959","Code, regardless of whether this Code"
"2960","specifically refers to such particular"
"2961","conduct.  A violation of this Code may result"
"2962","in disciplinary action, up to and including"
"2963","removal as an SFO of the Trust.  A variety of"
"2964","laws apply to the Trusts and their operations,"
"2965","including the Securities Act of 1933, the"
"2966","Investment Company Act of 1940, state laws"
"2967","relating to duties owed by Trust officers, and"
"2968","criminal laws. The Trusts will report any"
"2969","suspected criminal violations to the"
"2970","appropriate authorities, and will investigate,"
"2971","address and report, as appropriate, non-"
"2972","criminal violations."

"2982","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"2983","SEI Asset Allocation Trust:"
"2984","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"2985","financial statements of SEI Asset Allocation Trust,"
"2986","comprised of the Defensive Strategy Fund, Defensive"
"2987","Strategy Allocation Fund, Conservative Strategy"

"2992","Core Market Strategy Allocation Fund, Market Growth"
"2993","Strategy Fund and Market Growth Strategy Allocation"
"2994","Fund (collectively, the Funds) as of and for the"
"2995","year ended March 31, 2014, in accordance with the"
"2996","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"2997","Board (United States), we considered the Funds"
"2998","internal control over financial reporting, including"
"2999","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"3000","for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"3001","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"3002","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"3003","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"3004","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"3005","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"3006","express no such opinion."
"3007","Management of the Funds is responsible for"
"3008","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"3009","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"3010","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"3011","management are required to assess the expected"
"3012","benefits and related costs of controls. A companys"
"3013","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"3014","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"3015","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"3016","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"3017","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"3018","accounting principles. A companys internal control"
"3019","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"3020","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"3021","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"3022","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"3023","the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"3024","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"3025","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"3026","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"3027","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"3028","expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"3029","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"3030","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"3031","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"3032","of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of"
"3033","the companys assets that could have a material"
"3034","effect on the financial statements."
"3035","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"3036","control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"3037","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"3038","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"3039","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3040","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"3041","the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"3042","procedures may deteriorate."
"3043","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"3044","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"3045","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"3046","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"3047","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"3048","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"3049","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"3050","control over financial reporting, such that there is"
"3051","a reasonable possibility that a material"
"3052","misstatement of the Funds annual or interim"
"3053","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"3054","detected on a timely basis."
"3055","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"3056","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"3057","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3058","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"3059","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"3060","standards established by the Public Company"
"3061","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"3062","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds"
"3063","internal control over financial reporting and its"
"3064","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"3065","securities, that we consider to be a material"
"3066","weakness as defined above as of March 31, 2014."
"3067","This report is intended solely for the information"
"3068","and use of management and the Board of Trustees of"
"3069","SEI Asset Allocation Trust and the Securities and"
