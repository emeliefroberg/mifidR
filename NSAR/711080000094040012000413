"2113","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"2114","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"2115","internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"2116","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"2117","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"2118","on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"2119","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2120","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"2121","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"2122","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"2123","internal control over financial reporting."
"2124","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"2125","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"2126","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"2127","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"2128","benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal"
"2129","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"2130","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"2131","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"2132","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"2133","accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control"
"2134","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"2135","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"2136","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"2137","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"2138","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2139","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2140","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"2141","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"2142","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"2143","of the funds; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"2144","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"2145","use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a"
"2146","material effect on the financial statements."
"2147","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2148","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2149","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"2150","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2151","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"2152","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"2153","deteriorate."
"2154","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"2155","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"2156","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"2157","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2158","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"2159","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2160","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"2161","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2162","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"2163","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2164","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"2165","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"2166","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"2167","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that"
"2168","might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"2169","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"2170","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal"

      B. Each Acquired Fund and each Acquiring Fund are each
a separate series of an open-end, registered investment
company of the management type.
      C. Each Acquired Fund and each Acquiring Fund are each
authorized to issue shares of beneficial interest.
      D. The Parties intend this Agreement to be, and adopt
it as, a plan of reorganization within the meaning of the
regulations under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the Code).
      E. Each reorganization shall consist of:  (1) all of
the Fund Assets (as defined below) of an Acquired Fund will be
transferred to the corresponding Acquiring Fund in exchange
for the corresponding class of the Acquiring Fund as set forth
on Exhibit A to this Agreement (each, a Corresponding Class)
and the assumption by the corresponding Acquiring Fund of all
of the Acquired Fund's Liabilities (as defined below), and (2)
Corresponding Class shares of the corresponding Acquiring Fund
of equal value to the net assets of the Acquired Fund being
acquired will be distributed to holders of shares of the
Acquired Fund in the manner set forth in Exhibit A of this
Agreement, in complete liquidation and termination of the
Acquired Fund, all upon the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement (each a Reorganization).
      F. The Board of Trustees of the Acquired Trust (the
Old Mutual Board), including a majority of trustees who are
not interested persons (as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940"
"2244","Act)) (Independent Trustees) of the Acquired Trust, has
determined with respect to each Acquired Fund that:
(1) participation in the Reorganization is in the best
interests of the Acquired Fund and its shareholders, and (2)
the value of the interests of existing shareholders of the
Acquired Fund will not be diluted as a result of its effecting
the Reorganization.
      G. The Board of Trustees of the Acquiring Trust (the
Touchstone Board), including a majority of Independent
Trustees of the Acquiring Trust, has determined with respect
to each Acquiring Fund that: (1) participation in the
Reorganization is in the best interests of the Acquiring Fund
and its shareholders, if any, and (2) the value of the
interests of existing shareholders, if any, of the Acquiring
Fund will not be diluted as a result of its effecting the
Reorganization.
      H. The consummation of any Reorganization shall not be
contingent on the consummation of any other Reorganization and
it is the intention of the parties hereto that each
Reorganization described herein shall be conducted separately
of the others.
      I. For convenience, the balance of this Agreement
refers only to a single Reorganization, one Acquired Fund and
one Acquiring Fund, but the terms and conditions hereof shall
apply separately to each Reorganization and the Acquired Fund
and Acquiring Fund participating therein.
AGREEMENT:
      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises,
representations, and warranties made herein, covenants and
agreements hereinafter contained, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are acknowledged, the Parties, and Old Mutual Capital and
Touchstone to the extent indicated above, intending to be
legally bound hereby, agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
THE REORGANIZATION
      1.1 The Reorganization.  In accordance with the
Agreement and Declaration of Trust and the Amended and
Restated By-laws, as they may be amended from time to time, of
the Acquired Trust (the Old Mutual Governing Documents), at
the Effective Time (as defined below), upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and on the basis
of the representations and warranties contained herein, the
Acquired Fund shall assign, deliver and otherwise transfer all
Fund Assets, subject to all of the liabilities of the Acquired
Fund (the Liabilities), to the Acquiring Fund, and the
Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the Liabilities of the
Acquired Fund.  In consideration of the foregoing, the
Acquiring Fund, at the Effective Time shall deliver to the
Acquired Fund full and fractional (to the third decimal place)
shares of the Acquiring Fund.  The aggregate number of shares
of the Acquiring Fund shall be determined as set forth in
paragraph 2.3 by dividing (a) the value of the Fund Assets
attributable to the Acquired Fund, net of the Acquired Fund's
Liabilities (computed as of the Valuation Time (as defined
below) in the manner set forth in paragraph 2.1), by (b) the
net asset value of one share of the corresponding class of the
Acquiring Fund shares (computed as of the Valuation Time in
the manner set forth in paragraph 2.2).  Holders of each class
of shares of the Acquired Fund will receive shares of the
Corresponding Class, as set forth in Section E of the Recitals
and Exhibit A to this Agreement, of the Acquiring Fund, as set
forth in Section A of the Recitals. At and after the Effective
Time, all of the Fund Assets of the Acquired Fund shall become
and be included in the Fund Assets of the Acquiring Fund and
the Liabilities of the Acquired Fund shall become and be the
Liabilities of and shall attach to the Acquiring Fund.  At and
after the Effective Time, the Liabilities of the Acquired Fund
may be enforced only against the Acquiring Fund to the same
extent as if such Liabilities had been incurred by the
Acquiring Fund subject to any defense and/or set off that the
Acquired Fund was entitled to assert immediately prior to the
Effective Time and further subject to any defense and/or
setoff that the Acquiring Trust or the Acquiring Fund may from
time to time be entitled to assert.
      1.2 The Acquired Fund Assets.
            (a) At least ten Business Days prior to the
Valuation Time, the Acquired Fund will provide the
Acquiring Fund with a schedule of the securities and
other assets and Liabilities of the Acquired Fund.
Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Acquiring
Fund has provided the Acquired Fund with a copy of its
current investment objective, investment policies,
principal investment strategies, and restrictions and
will provide the Acquired Fund with a written notice of
any changes thereto through the Valuation Time.  The
Acquired Fund reserves the right to sell any of the
securities or other assets shown on the schedule it
provides to the Acquiring Fund pursuant to this
paragraph 1.2(a) in the ordinary course as necessary to
meet distribution and redemption requirements prior to
the Valuation Time but will not, without the prior
approval of the Acquiring Fund, acquire any additional
securities other than securities which the Acquiring
Fund may purchase in accordance with its stated
investment objective and policies.
            (b) At least five Business Days prior to the
Valuation Time, the Acquiring Fund will advise the
Acquired Fund of any investments of the Acquired Fund
shown on the Acquired Fund's schedule provided pursuant
to paragraph 1.2(a) which the Acquiring Fund would not
be permitted to hold (i) under its investment objective,
principal investment strategies or investment
restrictions; (ii) under applicable Law; or (iii)
because the transfer of such investments would result in
material operational or administrative difficulties to
the Acquiring Fund in connection with facilitating the
orderly transition of the Acquired Fund's Fund Assets.
Under such circumstances, to the extent practicable, the
Acquired Fund will, if requested by the Acquiring Fund
and, to the extent permissible and consistent with its
own investment objectives and policies and the fiduciary
duties of the investment adviser or sub-adviser
responsible for the portfolio management of the Acquired
Fund, dispose of such investments prior to the Valuation
Time.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein
will require the Acquired Fund to dispose of any
portfolio securities or other investments of the
Acquired Fund, if, in the reasonable judgment of the Old
Mutual Board or the Acquired Fund's investment adviser
or sub-adviser, such disposition would adversely affect
the tax-free nature of the Reorganization for federal
income tax purposes or would otherwise not be in the
best interests of the Acquired Fund and its
shareholders.
      1.3 Assumption of Liabilities.  The Acquired Fund will,
to the extent permissible and consistent with its own
investment objectives and policies, use its best efforts to
discharge all of the Liabilities of the Acquired Fund prior to
or at the Effective Time.  The Acquiring Fund will assume all
of the Liabilities of the Acquired Fund.
      1.4 Distribution of Acquiring Fund Shares.  Immediately
upon receipt, the Acquired Fund will distribute the
Corresponding Class shares of the Acquiring Fund received by

paragraph 1.1  pro rata to the record holders of shares of the
Acquired Fund.  Such distribution will be accomplished by
transferring the Acquiring Fund Shares then credited to the
Acquired Fund's account on the Books and Records of the
Acquiring Fund to open accounts on the Books and Records of
the Acquiring Fund established and maintained by the Acquiring
Fund's transfer agent in the names of record holders of the
Acquired Fund and representing the respective pro rata number
of the Acquiring Fund Shares due to such record holder.  All
issued and outstanding shares of the Acquired Fund will,
without further notice, be cancelled promptly by the Acquired
Fund on the Acquired Fund's Books and Records.  Any such
shares issued and outstanding prior to such cancellation shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Acquiring
Fund Shares issued to the Acquired Fund in accordance with
paragraph 1.1 above.  In addition, each record holder of the
Acquired Fund shall have the right to receive any unpaid
dividends or other distributions which were declared with
respect to his/her or its shares of the Acquired Fund at or
before the Valuation Time.
      1.5 Liquidation of the Acquired Fund.  As soon as
conveniently practicable after the distribution of the
Acquiring Fund Shares pursuant to paragraph 1.4 has been made,

the 1940 Act and the Old Mutual Governing Documents, all such
other steps as may be necessary or appropriate to effect a
complete liquidation and termination of the Acquired Fund.
      1.6 Transfer Taxes.  Any transfer taxes payable on
issuance of the Acquiring Fund Shares in a name other than
that of the record holder of the Acquired Fund shares on the
Acquired Fund's Books and Records shall be paid by the Person
to whom such Acquiring Fund Shares are issued and transferred,
as a condition of that transfer.

or similar rights or options, warrants, rights or
securities in connection with any series of shares.
            (d) Except for consents, approvals, or waivers
to be received prior to the Effective Time, including
shareholder approval by the Acquired Fund, and upon the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the Acquiring Trust on behalf of the Acquiring Fund does
not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein will not:  (i) violate or conflict
with the terms, conditions or provisions of the
Touchstone Governing Documents, or of any material
contract, agreement, indenture, instrument, or other
undertaking to which the Acquiring Trust is a party or
by which the Acquiring Trust or the Acquiring Fund is
bound, (ii) result in the acceleration of any
obligation, or the imposition of any penalty, under any
material agreement, indenture, instrument, contract,
lease or other undertaking to which the Acquiring Trust
is a party or by which the Acquiring Trust or the
Acquiring Fund is bound, (iii) result in a breach or
violation by the Acquiring Trust or the Acquiring Fund
of any terms, conditions, or provisions of any Law or
Order, or (iv) require any consent or approval of,
filing with or notice to, any Governmental or Regulatory
Body.
            (e) Except as set forth in writing to the
Acquired Fund, there is no Action or Proceeding pending
against the Acquiring Trust or the Acquiring Fund or, to
the best of the Acquiring Trust's Knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or affecting, the Acquiring Trust
or the Acquiring Fund.
            (f) No agent, broker, finder or investment or
commercial banker, or other Person or firm engaged by or
acting on behalf of the Acquiring Trust or the Acquiring
Fund in connection with the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement or any other agreement
contemplated hereby, or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, is or will be entitled
to any broker's or finder's or similar fees or other
commissions as a result of the consummation of such
transactions.
            (g) The Acquiring Trust is registered with the
SEC as an open-end management investment company under
the 1940 Act, and its registration with the SEC as such
an investment company is in full force and effect, and
the Acquiring Fund is a separate series of the Acquiring
Trust duly designated in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Touchstone Governing Documents and in
and compliance in all material respects with the 1940
Act and its rules and regulations.
            (h) The Acquiring Fund is, and will at the
Effective Time be, a new series portfolio of the
Acquiring Trust created within the last 12 months, and
such Acquiring Fund will not have had any assets (other
than assets required to meet the requirements of Section
14(a) of the 1940 Act or other seed capital) or
operations at any time prior to the Effective Time.
            (i) The Acquiring Fund was established in
order to effect the transactions described in this
Agreement, and, prior to the Effective Time, shall not
have carried on any business activity (other than such
activities as are customary to the organization of a new
series prior to its commencement of investment
operations).  It has not yet filed its first federal
income tax return and, thus, has not yet elected to be
treated as a regulated investment company for federal
income tax purposes.  However, upon filing its first
federal income tax return at the completion of its first
taxable year, the Acquiring Fund shall elect to be a
regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the
Code and until such time shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to ensure that it qualifies for taxation as a
regulated investment company under Sections 851 and
852 of the Code.  The Acquiring Fund is and will at the
Effective Time be treated as a separate corporation
under Section 851(g) of the Code.
            (j) The shares of the Acquiring Fund to be
issued and delivered to the Acquired Fund for the

the terms of this Agreement will have been duly
authorized at the Effective Time and, when so issued and
delivered, will be registered under the 1933 Act, duly
and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and no
shareholder of the Acquiring Fund shall have any
statutory or contractual preemptive right of
subscription or purchase in respect thereof.  In regard
to the statement above that the Acquiring Fund shares
will be non-assessable, it is noted that the Acquiring
Trust is a Massachusetts business trust and under
Massachusetts' Law, shareholders could, under certain
circumstances, be held personally liable for the
obligations of the Acquiring Fund; however, the
Acquiring Fund has included appropriate provisions
disclaiming such liability in all material contracts
entered into between the Acquiring Fund and any third-
party.
            (k) As of the Valuation Time, the Acquiring
Fund's prospectus and statement of additional
information will conform in all material respects to the
applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act
and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder and will not include any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not materially misleading.
            (l) The Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be
included in the Registration Statement and filed in
connection with this Agreement, and the documents
incorporated therein by reference and any amendment or
supplement thereto insofar as they relate to the
Acquiring Trust and the Acquiring Fund, each comply or
will comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the 1933 Act, 1934 Act and the 1940 Act
and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder on the effective date of such Registration
Statement.  Each of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
Registration Statement and the documents incorporated
therein by reference and any amendment or supplement
thereto, insofar as it relates to the Acquiring Trust
and the Acquiring Fund, does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not materially misleading on the effective date of
such Registration Statement; provided, however, that the
Acquiring Trust makes no representations or warranties
as to the information contained in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, Registration Statement and the
documents incorporated therein by reference and any
amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in
conformity with information relating to the Acquired
Trust or the Acquired Fund and furnished by the Acquired
Fund to the Acquiring Trust specifically for use in
connection with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
Registration Statement and the documents incorporated
therein by reference and any amendment or supplement
thereto.
            (m) The Acquiring Trust has adopted and
implemented written policies and procedures in
accordance with Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act.
            (n) The Acquiring Fund has maintained, or
caused to be maintained on its behalf, in all material
respects, all Books and Records required of a registered
investment company in compliance with the requirements
of Section 31 of the 1940 Act and rules thereunder.
            (o) Except as disclosed in writing to the
Acquired Fund, to the best of the Acquiring Fund's
Knowledge, no events have occurred and no issues,
conditions or facts have arisen which either
individually or in the aggregate have had a Material
Adverse Effect on the Acquiring Fund other than changes
occurring in the ordinary course of business.
            (p) The Acquiring Trust is not under the
jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or similar case
(within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the
Code).
            (q) The Acquiring Fund has no unamortized or
unpaid organizational fees or expenses for which it does
not expect to be reimbursed by Touchstone or its
Affiliates.

call, convene and hold a meeting of shareholders of the

generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis, and there will be no material contingent

and loss realized on the partial sale of any security to be

Reorganization will be calculated based on the CDSC schedule
of Class A and Class C shares, respectively, of the Acquired
Fund and, for purposes of calculating the CDSC, recipients of

to the effect that they have examined the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement (and
any supplement thereto) and this Agreement and that:
                  (i) to the best of their Knowledge, the
representations and warranties of the Acquired Trust in this
Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and
as of the Effective Time and the Acquired Trust has complied
with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on
its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the

business, including, without limitation, dividends and other

as the Acquiring Trust may reasonably deem necessary or
desirable to evidence the transfer to the Acquiring Fund
of all of the right, title and interest of the Acquired
Fund in and to the respective Fund Assets of the
Acquired Fund.  In each case, the Fund Assets of the
Acquired Fund shall be accompanied by all necessary
state stock transfer stamps or cash for the appropriate
purchase price therefor.
            (f) The Acquiring Fund shall have received:

of the record holders of each series of the Acquired
Fund shares and the number and percentage (to three

Acquired Fund shares owned by each such holder as of the
close of business at the Valuation Time.
            (g) At the Valuation Time and Effective Time,
except as previously disclosed to the Acquiring Fund in
writing, and except as have been corrected as required
by applicable Law, there shall have been no material
miscalculations of the net asset value of the Acquired
Fund during the twelve-month period preceding the
Valuation Time and Effective Time, and all such

applicable provisions of the 1940 Act.  At the Valuation
Time and Effective Time, all Liabilities chargeable to
the Acquired Fund which are required to be reflected in

Delaware Law and the 1940 Act.  Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, neither the Acquired Trust nor
the Acquiring Trust may waive the conditions set forth
in this paragraph 6.3(a).
            (b) The Registration Statement shall have
become effective under the 1933 Act, and no stop order
suspending effectiveness of the Registration Statement
shall have been issued and no proceedings for that
purpose shall have been pending or threatened in
writing.
            (c) Each of the Acquiring Fund and the
Acquired Fund shall have received a favorable opinion of

for federal income tax purposes:
                  (i) The acquisition by the Acquiring Fund of
all of the assets of the Acquired Fund solely in exchange for
the Acquiring Fund's assumption of the liabilities of the
Acquired Fund and issuance of the Acquiring Fund Shares,
followed by the distribution of such Acquiring Fund Shares by
the Acquired Fund in liquidation to the Acquired Fund
shareholders in exchange for their Acquired Fund shares, all
as provided in this Agreement, will constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, and the Acquired Fund and the Acquiring Fund each will
be a party to a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(b) of the Code;
                  (ii) Under Code Section 361, no gain or loss
will be recognized by the Acquired Fund (i) upon the transfer
of its assets to the Acquiring Fund solely in exchange for the

assumption of the liabilities of the Acquired Fund and
issuance of the Acquiring Fund Shares as contemplated in this
Agreement;
                  (iv) Under Code Section 362(b), the tax basis of
the assets of the Acquired Fund acquired by the Acquiring Fund
will be the same as the tax basis of such assets in the hands
of the Acquired Fund immediately prior to the Reorganization;
                  (v) Under Code Section 1223(2), the holding
periods of the assets of the Acquired Fund in the hands of the
Acquiring Fund will include the periods during which such
assets were held by the Acquired Fund;
                  (vi) Under Code Section 354, no gain or loss
will be recognized by the Acquired Fund shareholders upon the

be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the Acquired Fund
shares exchanged therefor;

                  (viii) Under Code Section 1223(1), an Acquired
Fund shareholder's holding period for the Acquiring Fund
Shares to be received will include the period during which the
Acquired Fund shares exchanged therefor were held, provided
that the Acquired Fund shareholder held the Acquired Fund
shares as a capital asset on the date of the Reorganization.
No opinion will be expressed as to (1) the effect of the
Reorganization on (A) the Acquired Fund or the Acquiring Fund
with respect to any asset as to which any unrealized gain or
loss is required to be recognized for U.S. federal income tax
purposes at the end of a taxable year (or on the termination
or transfer thereof) under a mark-to-market system of
accounting and (B) any Acquired Fund shareholder or Acquiring
Fund shareholder that is required to recognize unrealized
gains and losses for U.S. federal income tax purposes under a
mark-to-market system of accounting, or (C) the Acquired Fund
or the Acquiring Fund with respect to any stock held in a
passive foreign investment company as defined in Section
1297(a) of the Code or (2) any other federal tax issues
(except those set forth above) and all state, local or foreign
tax issues of any kind.
Such opinion shall be based on customary assumptions,
limitations and such representations as Pepper Hamilton LLP
may reasonably request, and the Acquired Fund and Acquiring
Fund will cooperate to make and certify the accuracy of such
representations.  Such opinion may contain such assumptions
and limitations as shall be in the opinion of such counsel
appropriate to render the opinions expressed therein.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the
Acquiring Fund nor the Acquired Fund may waive the conditions
set forth in this paragraph 6.3(c).

their respective officers or trustees shall be
