"556","<TEXT>"
"557","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"558","To the Board of Directors of SunAmerica Senior Floating Rate Fund, Inc."
"559","and Shareholders of AIG Senior Floating Rate Fund"
"560","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of AIG"
"561","Senior Floating Rate Fund (formerly SunAmerica Senior Floating Rate"
"562","Fund) (the Fund) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, in"
"563","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"564","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"565","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"566","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"567","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"568","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"569","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"570","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"571","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"572","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"573","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.In fulfilling"
"574","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"575","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"576","fund's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"577","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"578","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"579","purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"580","A  fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"581","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"582","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"583","dispositions of the assets of each fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"584","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"585","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"586","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"587","each fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"588","management and directors of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable"
"589","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"590","acquisition, use or disposition of each fund's assets that could have a"
"591","material effect on the financial statements."
"592","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"593","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"594","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"595","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"596","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"597","deteriorate."
"598","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"599","design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"600","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"601","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"602","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"603","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"604","that a material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial"
"605","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"606","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"607","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"608","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"609","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"610","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"611","States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control"
"612","over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"613","safeguarding securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as"
"614","defined above as of December 31, 2017."
"615","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"616","and the Board of Directors of SunAmerica Senior Floating Rate Fund,"
"617","Inc. and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to"
"618","be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"660","from time to time, Class A shares may be"
"661","subject to a contingent deferred sales"

"677","waived for certain eligible investors."
"678","Class C shares automatically convert to"
"679","Class A shares on the 19th day (or next"

"705","manner and will be in the same amount, except that the amount of"
"706","the dividends and other distributions declared and paid by a"
"707","particular class may be different from that paid by another class"
"708","because of Rule 12b-1 Fees and other expenses borne exclusively"
"709","by that class."
"710","EXCHANGE PRIVILEGE"
"711","            Each class of shares is generally exchangeable for"

"715","and Statement of Additional Information from time to time.  In"

"735","fiduciary responsibilities under the 1940 Act and otherwise,"
"736","will monitor the Corporation for the existence of any"
"737","material conflicts among the interests of their several"
"738","classes.  The Directors, including a majority of the"
