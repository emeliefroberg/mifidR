"1087","shares of DWS Global Thematic Fund (the ?Fund?) will be"
"1088","closed to new purchases, except that Class B shares may"
"1089","continue to be purchased in connection with an exchange or"
"1090","the reinvestment of dividends or other distributions"
"1091","(including the investment of dividends and distributions in"
"1092","Class B shares of another fund). From and after the Effective"
"1093","Date, except as noted above, no new purchases of Class B"
"1094","shares will be allowed, whether by new investors or existing"
"1095","shareholders, including purchases under an automatic"
"1096","investment plan. The Effective Date is subject to change."
"1097","The closing of the Class B shares will not affect: (a) the right"
"1098","of shareholders of Class B shares to continue to sell (redeem)"
"1099","their shares as provided in the prospectus, subject to any"
"1100","applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC); or (b)"
"1101","the automatic conversion of Class B shares to Class A shares"
"1102","six years after purchase. Class B shares held as of the"
"1103","Effective Date will continue as Class B shares with all Class"
"1104","B attributes, including Rule 12b-1 fees, until sold or until"
"1105","their automatic conversion to Class A shares."
"1106","Class A and Class C shares will continue to be offered as"
"1107","provided in the Fund prospectus. Investors should note the"
"1108","differences among the classes as described in the prospectus,"
"1109","including differences in sales charges and operating"
"1110","expenses."
"1111","From and after the Effective Date, purchases by shareholders"
"1112","under Class B shares automatic investment plans (?AIPs?)"
"1113","established on or prior to December 1, 2009 will be"
"1114","automatically continued with Class A shares. Such"
"1115","shareholders will then be permitted to purchase Class A"
"1116","shares at net asset value, without a sales charge, whether as"
"1117","part of their AIP or otherwise. The foregoing applies only to"
"1118","purchases under (i) AIPs established directly with DWS"
"1119","Investments (?DWS AIPs?) and, (ii) provided they are"
"1120","identified as an AIP by DWS Investments, AIPs sponsored"
"1121","by others, such as government direct deposit, employer"
"1122","sponsored payroll direct deposit and auto-debit programs"
"1123","established with the shareholder?s bank or credit union"
"1124","(?non-DWS AIP?). Shareholders with a non-DWS AIP"
"1125","should contact DWS Investments prior to the Effective Date"
"1126","to ensure that their account is identified as an AIP. For any"
"1127","AIP established after December 1, 2009, this privilege to"
"1128","purchase Class A shares without a sales charge will not apply"
"1129","and orders for Class B shares from such an AIP received on"
"1130","or after the Effective Date will not be accepted. For this"
"1131","reason, shareholders will not be permitted to establish DWS"
"1132","AIPs for Class B shares after December 1, 2009 and"
"1133","shareholders should not establish non-DWS AIPs for Class B"
"1134","shares after that date."
"1135","Additionally, from and after the Effective Date, certain"
"1136","employer-sponsored employee benefit plans (known as"
"1137","?DWS Investments Flex Plans?) using the ExpertPlan"
"1138","subaccount record keeping system maintained for DWS"
"1139","Investments-branded plans that are currently purchasing"
"1140","Class B shares instead will purchase Class A shares at net"
"1141","asset value, without a sales charge."
"1142","The reinstatement feature described in the prospectus will be"
"1143","modified on the Effective Date to no longer permit certain"
"1144","shareholders who have sold their Class B shares to"
"1145","repurchase Class B shares within the six month period"
"1146","following the sale with a reimbursement (in the form of"
"1147","shares) of the CDSC. However, within the six month period"
"1148","after the sale, such shareholders may continue to purchase"
"1149","Class A shares without a sales charge with the proceeds of"
"1150","the sale of Class B shares (but without a reimbursement of"
"1151","the CDSC), subject to the conditions of the reinstatement"

"1162","Litigation Update"
"1163","Federal Court Market Timing Litigation:A number of"
"1164","private lawsuits have been filed including purported"
"1165","class and derivative lawsuits, making various"
"1166","allegations and naming as defendants various persons,"
"1167","including certain Scudder and Deutsche (now DWS)"
"1168","funds (singularly, a Fund and collectively, the"
"1169","Funds), the Funds' investment advisors and their"
"1170","affiliates, certain individuals (including in some"
"1171","cases Fund Trustees/Directors, officers), and other"
"1172","parties.  Each Fund's investment advisor has agreed"
"1173","to indemnify the applicable Funds in connection with"
"1174","these lawsuits, or other lawsuits or regulatory"
"1175","actions that may be filed making allegations similar"
"1176","to these lawsuits regarding market timing, revenue"
"1177","sharing, fund valuation or other subjects related to"
"1178","investigations of the foregoing matters.  Based on"
"1179","currently available information, the Funds'"
"1180","investment advisors believe the likelihood that the"
"1181","pending lawsuits will have a material adverse"
"1182","financial impact on a Fund is remote and such actions"
"1183","are not likely to materially affect their ability to"
"1184","perform under their investment management agreements"
"1185","with the Funds."
"1186","Fifteen class and derivative actions pertaining to"
"1187","market timing have been consolidated and transferred"
"1188","to a Multidistrict Litigation Panel in the District"
"1189","of Maryland (MDL) (Multidistrict Litigation 1586-In"
"1190","re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation).  The 11"
"1191","Complaints originally filed in the Southern District"
"1192","of New York that were transferred to the MDL were"
"1193","virtually identical and each asserted claims against"
"1194","Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Investment Management"
"1195","Americas Inc. (DIMA) and Deutsche Asset Management,"
"1196","Inc. as well as approximately 85 Funds in the Scudder"
"1197","and Deutsche family of funds and John Doe defendants."
"1198","The three cases that were originally filed in the"
"1199","Eastern District of New York and the one case"
"1200","originally filed in the District of Delaware are"
"1201","derivative actions brought by purported shareholders"
"1202","in certain of the Funds.  These actions are against"
"1203","Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc.,"
"1204","Deutsche Asset Management, Inc., and John Doe"
"1205","defendants."
"1206","On September 29, 2004, two consolidated amended"
"1207","complaints, one a Consolidated Amended Class Action"
"1208","Complaint and the other a Consolidated Amended Fund"
"1209","Derivative Complaint, were filed in the MDL."
"1210","On January 11, 2006, Plaintiffs filed a Second"
"1211","Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint in the"
"1212","MDL.  The officer defendants have been voluntarily"
"1213","dismissed from the class action pursuant to a tolling"
"1214","agreement with Plaintiffs.  Deutsche Bank AG has been"
"1215","dismissed from the derivative action.  On March 16,"
"1216","2007, the Court issued an opinion in the MDL granting"
"1217","in part and denying in part the Deutsche Defendants'"
"1218","motion to dismiss the Second Consolidated Amended"
"1219","Class Action Complaint."
"1220","Plaintiffs filed a Third Consolidated Amended Class"
"1221","Action Complaint (Third Amended Complaint) on"
"1222","December 10, 2007 in the MDL.  In the Third Amended"
"1223","Complaint, the Plaintiffs added the names of Funds"
"1224","that they allegedly purchased or held during the"
"1225","class period.  In addition, as contemplated in the"
"1226","Court's scheduling order, the Third Amended Complaint"
"1227","added a new Plaintiff in an attempt to address"
"1228","standing challenges raised by the Defendants.  On"
"1229","January 16, 2008, the Court granted in part and"
"1230","denied in part the Defendants' motion to dismiss"
"1231","certain claims on standing grounds.  The parties"
"1232","conducted extensive discovery.  The Defendants filed"
"1233","a motion for summary judgment and various related"
"1234","motions, and Class Plaintiffs contemporaneously filed"
"1235","a motion for class certification. The Court heard"
"1236","oral argument on these motions on December 10-11,"
"1237","2008."
"1238","On February 12, 2010, the parties agreed to a"
"1239","stipulation and agreement of settlement.  Plaintiffs"
"1240","filed their motions for preliminary approval of the"
"1241","settlement with the Court on April 21, 2010.  The"
"1242","Court conducted a hearing on May 7, 2010 on those"
"1243","motions and granted preliminary approval of the"
"1244","settlements on May 19, 2010.  Afterward, class"
"1245","notices were distributed to shareholders, and on"
"1246","September 14, 2010, plaintiffs filed their motion for"
"1247","final approval of the settlement, which was"
"1248","supplemented by a reply brief filed on October 6,"
"1249","2010.  On October 21-22, 2010, the Court conducted a"
"1250","hearing on the motion for final approval of the"
"1251","settlement.  The Court granted the motion on October"
"1252","25, 2010 and entered a judgment approving a"
"1253","settlement class, approving the settlements,"
"1254","dismissing the claims against the Defendants in the"
"1255","MDL, and enjoining Plaintiffs and class members from"
"1256","instituting, commencing or prosecuting any claims"
"1257","subject to the settlement against the Defendants."
"1258","State Court Market Timing Litigation:"
"1259","On September 16, 2003, an action was commenced in the"
"1260","Circuit Court for Madison County, Illinois, entitled"
"1261","Potter v. Janus Investment Fund, et al.  Defendants"
"1262","include, among others, DIMA and the Scudder"
"1263","International Fund. On October 23, 2003, Defendants"
"1264","removed the action to the United States District"
"1265","Court for the Southern District of Illinois. On"
"1266","February 9, 2004 the District Court remanded the case"
"1267","back to the Circuit Court for Madison County."
"1268","Defendants appealed this decision.  On April 5, 2005"
"1269","the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the"
"1270","District Court's decision and instructed the District"
"1271","Court to undo the remand order and dismiss the"
"1272","complaint.  On May 27, 2005, the District Court, in"
"1273","accord with the Seventh Circuit's mandate, dismissed"
"1274","the action with prejudice.  On September 29, 2005,"
"1275","Plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari"
"1276","to the Supreme Court of the United States.  On"
"1277","January 6, 2006, the Supreme Court granted the"
"1278","petition to address jurisdictional questions.  On"
"1279","June 15, 2006, the Supreme Court vacated the decision"
"1280","of the Seventh Circuit and held that the Court of"
"1281","Appeals did not have jurisdiction to address the"
"1282","District Court's remand order.  The case was remanded"
"1283","to and reopened in the Circuit Court for Madison"
"1284","County.  On November 13, 2006, Defendants removed the"
"1285","case to Federal District Court for a second time.  On"
"1286","April 6, 2007, the District Court remanded the case"
"1287","back to the Circuit Court for Madison County."
"1288","Defendants appealed this decision to the Seventh"
"1289","Circuit, which dismissed the appeal for lack of"
"1290","jurisdiction on July 13, 2007.  The case is now back"
"1291","in the Circuit Court for Madison County.  Argument on"
"1292","Defendants' motion to dismiss occurred in August"
"1293","2007, and the parties are awaiting the Circuit"
"1294","Court's decision.  The Circuit Court issued an Order"
"1295","dated July 16, 2008 stating that the issues raised by"
"1296","the motion to dismiss are nearly identical to those"
"1297","in a pending appeal in an action involving the Putnam"
"1298","funds, and that the Court would therefore wait for"
"1299","the decision of the Illinois Appellate Court in that"
"1300","case before ruling on the motion to dismiss."
"1301","On January 6, 2010, the Illinois Appellate Court"
"1302","ruled in favor of the Putnam fund defendants and"
"1303","against Plaintiffs in that action, holding that"
"1304","Plaintiffs' claims are precluded by the Securities"
"1305","Litigation Uniform Standards Act.  Plaintiffs filed a"
"1306","motion for rehearing in the Illinois Appellate Court,"
"1307","which was denied on February 16, 2010.  The Illinois"
"1308","Appellate Court issued its mandate on March 30, 2010,"
"1309","and on April 5, 2010, the Circuit Court dismissed the"
"1310","Putnam action with prejudice.  On April 15, 2010,"
"1311","Defendants in the Scudder action filed a supplemental"
"1312","memorandum in support of their pending motion to"
"1313","dismiss.  On April 15, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a"
"1314","motion in the Putnam case to modify the order"
"1315","dismissing that action and for leave to file an"
"1316","amended complaint.  On April 20, 2010, Plaintiffs"
"1317","filed a motion for leave to file a Second Amended"
"1318","Complaint in the Scudder action, which Defendants"
"1319","opposed.  On July 22, 2010, the Court denied"
"1320","Plaintiffs' motion but granted leave for Plaintiffs"
"1321","to file an amended complaint within twenty-one days"
"1322","that does not include any class-action-based"
"1323","allegations or prayers for relief.  Subsequently,"
"1324","Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the"
"1325","Court's July 22, 2010 Order or, in the alternative,"
"1326","for certification of an interlocutory appeal."
"1327","Defendants filed their opposition to that motion on"
"1328","August 25, 2010.  The Court has set a hearing on the"
"1329","motion for November 16, 2010."
"1330","Federal Court Revenue Sharing Litigation:"
"1331","The following purported class actions pertaining to"
"1332","revenue sharing were filed in the Southern District"
"1333","of New York: Walker v. Deutsche Bank AG, et al.,"
"1334","Mazza v. Deutsche Bank AG, et al. and Icardo v."
"1335","Deutsche Bank AG, et al.  These three class actions"
"1336","were consolidated. The consolidated Complaint filed"
"1337","on December 19, 2005 named as defendants Deutsche"
"1338","Bank AG, certain affiliated adviser entities, and"
"1339","Scudder Distributors Inc.  On August 15, 2007, the"
"1340","Court granted the Defendants' motion to dismiss with"
"1341","prejudice and denied Plaintiffs' request for leave to"
"1342","amend the complaint.  The Plaintiffs did not appeal,"
"1343","and the deadline for appealing this decision has now"
"1344","passed."

"1354","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"1355","Firm"
"1356","To the Board of Directors of DWS Global/International Fund, Inc."
"1357","and the Shareholders of DWS Global Thematic Fund:"
"1358","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"1359","DWS Global Thematic Fund (the Fund), as of and for the year"
"1360","ended August 31, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the"
"1361","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1362","considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"1363","including control activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"1364","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"1365","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1366","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1367","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"1368","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"1369","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"1370","financial reporting."
"1371","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1372","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"1373","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1374","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1375","related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"1376","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1377","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1378","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1379","generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control"
"1380","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"1381","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1382","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1383","assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1384","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1385","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"1386","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1387","fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1388","management and directors of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable"
"1389","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1390","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that"
"1391","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1392","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1393","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"1394","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1395","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"1396","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1397","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1398","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1399","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1400","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1401","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A"
"1402","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"1403","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1404","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's"
"1405","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1406","detected on a timely basis."
"1407","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1408","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1409","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1410","internal control over financial reporting that might be significant"
"1411","deficiencies or material weaknesses under standards established by"
"1412","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1413","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control"
"1414","over financial reporting and its operation, including controls for"
"1415","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses"
"1416","as defined above as of August 31, 2010."
