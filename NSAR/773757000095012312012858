"3624","ended August 31, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"3625","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"3626","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"

"3633","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"3634","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"3635","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"

"3752","Columbia Funds Series Trust I as of and for the period ended August 31, 2012, in"
"3753","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"3754","(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over financial"

"3756","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"

"3758","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"3759","Fund's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"3760","such opinion."
"3761","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"3762","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"3763","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"

"3766","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"3767","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"

"3769","policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"3770","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"3771","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3772","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"

"3775","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"3776","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3777","A control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"3778","allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"3779","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A significant"
"3780","deficiency is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that"
"3781","adversely affects the fund's ability to initiate, authorize, record, process or"
"3782","report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted"
"3783","accounting principles such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a"
"3784","misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements that is"
"3785","more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected.  A material"
"3786","weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that"
"3787","results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the"
"3788","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected."
"3789","<PAGE>"
"3790","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"3791","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3792","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"3793","reporting that might be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses under"
"3794","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"3795","States).  However, we noted the following deficiency in the Fund's internal"
"3796","control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over the"
"3797","safeguarding of assets that we consider to be a material weakness as defined"
"3798","above as of August 31, 2012."
"3799","The Fund's controls designed to ensure the proper recording of the fair value of"
"3800","non-U.S. denominated trades not previously held by the Fund or other funds"
"3801","within the Columbia Fund group did not operate effectively as of August 31,"
"3802","2012. As a result of this material weakness, balances of investments at fair"
"3803","value in the statement of assets and liabilities and unrealized"
"3804","appreciation/depreciation from futures contracts resulted in audit adjustments"
"3805","to the Fund's August 31, 2012 financial statements. Prospectively, the Fund has"
"3806","proposed the following enhancements to controls:"
"3807","   .  Comparison of trade and market prices for non-U.S. denominated trades not"
"3808","      previously held by the Fund or other funds within the Columbia Fund"
"3809","      complex be compared and that variances be investigated; and"
"3810","   .  Institute a formal review procedure to compare net asset value calculated"
"3811","      on a trade date +1 and trade basis and that variances, above a defined"
"3812","      threshold, are investigated."
"3813","We have not performed any procedures to assess this corrective action, including"
"3814","the sufficiency in addressing the material weakness described above. This"
"3815","material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent"
"3816","of audit tests applied in our audits of the Fund's financial statements as of"
"3817","and for the period ended August 31, 2012."
"3818","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"

"3857","disclosure in the Principal Investment Strategies section of the Fund's"
"3858","prospectuses as follows:"

"3862","   include, for example, common stock, preferred stock, convertible"

"3872","   companies in emerging market countries. The Fund may invest"
"3873","   directly in foreign securities or indirectly through depositary"

"3882","   The Investment Manager combines fundamental analysis with risk"
"3883","   management in identifying investment opportunities and"
"3884","   constructing the Fund's portfolio. The Investment Manager"
"3885","   considers, among other factors:"
"3886","*       businesses that are believed to be fundamentally sound"
"3887","        and undervalued due to investor indifference, investor"

"3897","        macroeconomic factors."

"3901","        flow sustainability."
"3902","The Investment Manager may sell a security when the security's"

"3955","   where (in Conestoga's opinion) valuations seem reasonable compared to"

"3958","   business model offers a sustainable competitive advantage, and where"
"3959","   management has an important ownership stake in the company. Conestoga"
"3960","   uses a bottom-up approach in selecting securities. Conestoga may sell a"

"3989","Item 77E - Legal Proceedings:"
"3990","In December 2005, without admitting or denying the allegations, American"
"3991","Express Financial Corporation (AEFC, which is now known as Ameriprise"
"3992","Financial, Inc. (Ameriprise Financial)) entered into settlement agreements"
"3993","with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Minnesota Department of"
"3994","Commerce (MDOC) related to market timing activities. As a result, AEFC was"
"3995","censured and ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any"
"3996","violations of certain provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the"
"3997","Investment Company Act of 1940, and various Minnesota laws. AEFC agreed to pay"
"3998","disgorgement of $10 million and civil money penalties of $7 million. AEFC also"
"3999","agreed to retain an independent distribution consultant to assist in"
"4000","developing a plan for distribution of all disgorgement and civil penalties"
"4001","ordered by the SEC in accordance with various undertakings detailed at"
"4002","www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/ia-2451.pdf. Ameriprise Financial and its"
"4003","affiliates have cooperated with the SEC and the MDOC in these legal"
"4004","proceedings, and have made regular reports to the funds' Boards of Trustees."
"4005","Ameriprise Financial and certain of its affiliates have historically been"
"4006","involved in a number of legal, arbitration and regulatory proceedings,"
"4007","including routine litigation, class actions, and governmental actions,"
"4008","concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of their business"
"4009","activities. Ameriprise Financial believes that the Funds are not currently the"
"4010","subject of, and that neither Ameriprise Financial nor any of its affiliates"
"4011","are the subject of, any pending legal, arbitration or regulatory proceedings"
"4012","that are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Funds or the ability"
"4013","of Ameriprise Financial or its affiliates to perform under their contracts"
"4014","with the Funds. Ameriprise Financial is required to make 10-Q, 10-K and, as"
"4015","necessary, 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on legal"
"4016","and regulatory matters that relate to Ameriprise Financial and its affiliates."
"4017","Copies of these filings may be obtained by accessing the SEC website at"
"4018","www.sec.gov."
"4019","There can be no assurance that these matters, or the adverse publicity"
"4020","associated with them, will not result in increased fund redemptions, reduced"
"4021","sale of fund shares or other adverse consequences to the Funds. Further,"
"4022","although we believe proceedings are not likely to have a material adverse"
"4023","effect on the Funds or the ability of Ameriprise Financial or its affiliates"
"4024","to perform under their contracts with the Funds, these proceedings are subject"
"4025","to uncertainties and, as such, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or"
"4026","range of loss that may result. An adverse outcome in one or more of these"
"4027","proceedings could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties"
"4028","or other relief that could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated"
"4029","financial condition or results of operations of Ameriprise Financial."
