"565","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"566","To  the Shareholders of Foundry Partners, LLC Funds and Board of Trustees of 360"
"567","Funds"
"568","In  planning  and  performing  our  audit of the financial statements of Foundry"
"569","Partners,  LLC  Funds  comprising Foundry Micro Cap Value Fund and Foundry Small"
"570","Cap  Value Fund (the Funds), each a series of the 360 Funds as of December 31,"
"571","2014,  and  for the period January 30, 2014 (commencement of operations) through"
"572","December  31,  2014,  in  accordance  with  the  standards of the Public Company"
"573","Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"574","control   over   financial   reporting,  including  controls  over  safeguarding"
"575","securities,  as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"576","expressing  our  opinion  on  the  financial  statements  and to comply with the"
"577","requirements  of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"578","the  effectiveness  of  the  Funds'  internal  control over financial reporting."
"579","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"580","The  management  of  the  Funds  is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"581","effective   internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  In  fulfilling  this"
"582","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"583","expected  benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"584","financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide reasonable assurance"
"585","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"586","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"587","accounting principles (GAAP). A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"588","includes  those  policies  and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"589","records   that,   in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the"
"590","transactions  and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"591","assurance  that  transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"592","financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures"
"593","of  the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"594","and  trustees  of  the  fund;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable assurance regarding"
"595","prevention  or  timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"596","of  a  fund's  assets  that  could  have  a  material  effect  on  the financial"
"597","statements."
"598","Because  of  its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"599","may  not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"600","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"601","inadequate  because  of  changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"602","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"603","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"604","or  operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"605","course   of   performing   their   assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"606","misstatements  on  a  timely  basis.  A  material  weakness  is a deficiency, or"
"607","combination  of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"608","that  there  is  a  reasonable  possibility  that a material misstatement of the"
"609","Funds'  annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"610","on a timely basis."
"611","Our  consideration  of  the Funds1 internal control over financial reporting was"
"612","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in  the  first  paragraph  and  would not"
"613","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"614","weaknesses   under  standards  established  by  the  Public  Company  Accounting"
"615","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"616","internal  control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"617","over  safeguarding  securities,  that  we  consider to be a material weakness as"
"618","defined above as of December 31, 2014."
"619","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"620","Board of Trustees of the Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"621","not  intended  to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"622","parties."
