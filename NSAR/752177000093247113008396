"3235","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"

"3443","Vanguard Target Retirement Funds"
"3444","Supplement to the Prospectus Dated January 28, 2013"
"3445","Changes in Underlying Fund Allocations"
"3446","The Vanguard Target Retirement Funds have implemented the following"
"3447","changes to the fixed income exposure of the Funds, as previously approved by"
"3448","the Funds? board of trustees."
"3449","? Twenty percent of each Fund?s fixed income exposure has been reallocated to"
"3450","foreign bonds through investment in Vanguard Total International Bond Index"
"3451","Fund."
"3452","? The Target Retirement Income, Target Retirement 2010, and Target"
"3453","Retirement 2015 Funds now obtain their exposure to inflation-protected"
"3454","securities by investing in Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities"
"3455","Index Fund rather than Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund."
"3456","? The Target Retirement Income and Target Retirement 2010 Funds no longer"
"3457","invest a portion of their assets in Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund."
"3458","The Funds? target allocations to the underlying fixed income funds are described"
"3459","in the following pages. Although these changes modified the mix of each Fund?s"
"3460","fixed income investments, they did not affect each Fund?s total fixed income"
"3461","exposure, and the Funds? expense ratios have remained unchanged. However,"
"3462","each Fund?s total fixed income exposure (other than that of the Target"
"3463","Retirement Income Fund) will continue to shift in accordance with the Fund?s"
"3464","strategy of becoming more conservative over time."
"3465","Prospectus Text Changes for Vanguard Target Retirement Income Fund"
"3466","The text under ?Primary Investment Strategies? is replaced with the following:"
"3467","The Fund invests in other Vanguard mutual funds according to an asset"
"3468","allocation strategy designed for investors currently in retirement. The targeted"
"3469","percentage of the Fund?s assets allocated to each of the underlying funds is:"
"3470","At any given time, the Fund?s asset allocation may be affected by a variety of"
"3471","factors, such as whether the underlying funds are accepting additional"
"3472","investments."
"3473","The Fund?s indirect bond holdings are a diversified mix of short-,"
"3474","intermediate-, and long-term U.S. government, U.S. agency, and"
"3475","investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds; inflation-protected public"
"3476","obligations issued by the U.S."
"3477","Treasury; mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; and government,"
"3478","agency, corporate, and securitized investment-grade foreign bonds issued in"
"3479","currencies other than the U.S. dollar (but hedged by Vanguard to minimize"
"3480","currency exposures)."
"3481","The Fund?s indirect stock holdings are a diversified mix of U.S. and foreign"
"3482","large-, mid-, and small-capitalization stocks."
"3483","The first bullet under ?Primary Risks? is replaced with the following:"
"3484","? With approximately 70% of its assets allocated to bonds, the Fund is"
"3485","proportionately subject to bond risks: interest rate risk, which is the chance"
"3486"," that"
"3487","bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates; income risk,"
"3488","which is the chance that an underlying fund?s income will decline because of"
"3489","falling interest rates or declining inflation; credit risk, which is the chance"
"3490","that a"
"3491","bond issuer will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner, or that"
"3492","negative perceptions of the issuer?s ability to make such payments will cause"
"3493","the price of that bond to decline, thus reducing the underlying fund?s return;"
"3494","and call risk, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest"
"3495","rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher"
"3496","coupons or interest rates before their maturity dates. An underlying fund"
"3497","would then lose any price"
"3498","appreciation above the bond?s call price and would be forced to reinvest the"
"3499","unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the"
"3500","underlying fund?s income. For mortgage-backed securities, this risk is known as"
"3501","prepayment risk. The Fund is also subject to the following risks associated with"
"3502","investments in currency-hedged foreign bonds: country/regional risk, which is"
"3503","the chance that world events?such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or"
"3504","? Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund 39.2%"
"3505","? Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund 21.0%"
"3506","? Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund 16.8%"
"3507","? Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund 14.0%"
"3508","? Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund 9.0%"
"3509","natural disasters?will adversely affect the value of securities issued by"
"3510","foreign"
"3511","governments, government agencies, or companies; and currency hedging risk,"
"3512","which is the risk that the currency hedging transactions entered into by the"
"3513","underlying international bond fund may not perfectly offset the fund?s foreign"
"3514","currency exposures."
"3515","Prospectus Text Changes for Vanguard Target Retirement 2010 Fund"

"3520","for an investor who plans to withdraw the value of an account in the Fund over a"
"3521","period of many years after the target year. The Fund?s asset allocation will"
"3522","become more conservative over time, meaning that the percentage of assets"
"3523","allocated to stocks will decrease while the percentage of assets allocated to"
"3524","bonds and other fixed income investments will increase. Within seven years"
"3525","after 2010, the Fund?s asset allocation should become similar to that of the"

"4184","issued in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (but hedged by Vanguard to"
"4185","minimize currency exposures)."
"4186","The second bullet under ?Primary Risks? is replaced with the following:"
"4187","? With approximately 10% of its assets allocated to bonds, the Fund is"
"4188","proportionately subject to bond risks: interest rate risk, which is the chance"
"4189","that"
"4190","bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates; income risk,"
"4191","which"
"4192","is the chance that an underlying fund?s income will decline because of falling"
"4193","interest rates; credit risk, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail"
"4194","to pay"
"4195","interest and principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the"
"4196","issuer?s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to"
"4197","decline,"
"4198","thus reducing the underlying fund?s return; and call risk, which is the chance"
"4199","that"
"4200","during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call"
"4201","(redeem)"
"4202","securities with higher coupons or interest rates before their maturity dates."
"4203","An"
"4204","underlying fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond?s call"
"4205","price"
"4206","and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest"
"4207","rates, resulting in a decline in the underlying fund?s income. For"
"4208","mortgage-backed"
"4209","securities, this risk is known as prepayment risk. The Fund is also subject"
"4210","to the"
"4211","following risks associated with investments in currency-hedged foreign bonds:"
"4212","country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events?such as political"
"4213","upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters?will adversely affect the"
"4214","value of"
"4215","securities issued by foreign governments, government agencies, or companies;"
"4216","and currency hedging risk, which is the risk that the currency hedging"
"4217","transactions"
"4218","entered into by the underlying international bond fund may not perfectly"
"4219","offset the"
"4220","fund?s foreign currency exposures."
