"551","of and for the period ended November 30, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"

"560","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"561","A fund&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability"
"562","of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"563","accounting principles. A fund&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"564","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"565","of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"566","of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"567","fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"568","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund&rsquo;s assets that"
"569","could have a material effect on the financial statements.</FONT></P>"

"572","its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"573","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes"
"574","in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</FONT></P>"

"578","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"579","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"580","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund&rsquo;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented"
