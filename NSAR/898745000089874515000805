"22943","allocation of liabilities, expenses, costs, charges"

"22946","foregoing provisions of this Section 5.1(c)(2) shall"

"22969","and for such purposes as the Board of Directors"

"23411","       Section 5.1.  Authorized Shares:  The total number of"

"23415","aggregate par value of all the authorized shares is seven hundred"
"23416","fifty-four million fifty thousand dollars ($754,050,000).  The shares"
"23417","may be issued by the Board of Directors in such separate and distinct"
"23418","series and classes of series as the Board of Directors shall from time"
"23419","to time create and establish.  The Board of Directors shall have full"

"27161","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"27162","The Shareholders and Board of Directors"
"27163","Principal Funds, Inc."
"27164","In planning and performing our audits of"
"27165","the financial statements of each of the"
"27166","Principal Funds, Inc. listed in Exhibit A"
"27167","attached hereto (the Funds) as of and"
"27168","for the period ended October 31, 2015, in"
"27169","accordance with the standards of the"
"27170","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"27171","(United States), we considered"
"27172","the Funds' internal controls over financial"
"27173","reporting, including controls over"
"27174","safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"27175","designing our auditing procedures for the"
"27176","purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"27177","financial statements and to comply"
"27178","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"27179","not for the purpose of expressing an"
"27180","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"27181","internal control over financial"
"27182","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"27183","The management of the Funds is responsible"
"27184","for establishing and maintaining"
"27185","effective internal control over financial"
"27186","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"27187","estimates and judgments by management are"
"27188","required to assess the expected"
"27189","benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"27190","company's internal control over"
"27191","financial reporting is a process designed"
"27192","to provide reasonable assurance"
"27193","regarding the reliability of financial"
"27194","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"27195","statements for external purposes in"
"27196","accordance with generally accepted"
"27197","accounting principles. A company's internal"
"27198","control over financial reporting"
"27199","includes those policies and procedures"
"27200","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"27201","records that, in reasonable detail,"
"27202","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"27203","and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"27204","(2) provide reasonable assurance"
"27205","that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"27206","permit preparation of financial"
"27207","statements in accordance with generally"
"27208","accepted accounting principles, and that"
"27209","receipts and expenditures of the company"
"27210","are being made only in accordance"
"27211","with authorizations of management and"
"27212","directors of the company; and (3)"
"27213","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"27214","or timely detection of"
"27215","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"27216","company's assets that could"
"27217","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"27218","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"27219","control over financial reporting may"
"27220","not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"27221","projections of any evaluation of"
"27222","effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"27223","the risk that controls may become"
"27224","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"27225","that the degree of compliance"
"27226","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"27227","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"27228","reporting exists when the design"
"27229","or operation of a control does not allow"
"27230","management or employees, in the"
"27231","normal course of performing their assigned"
"27232","functions, to prevent or detect"
"27233","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"27234","weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"27235","combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"27236","control over financial reporting, such"
"27237","that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"27238","material misstatement of the"
"27239","company's annual or interim financial statements"
"27240","will not be prevented or"
"27241","detected on a timely basis."
"27242","Our consideration of the Funds' internal"
"27243","control over financial reporting was for"
"27244","the limited purpose described in the first"
"27245","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"27246","disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"27247","that might be material weaknesses"
"27248","under standards established by the Public"
"27249","Company Accounting Oversight"
"27250","Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"27251","deficiencies in the Funds' internal"
"27252","control over financial reporting and its"
"27253","operation, including controls for"
"27254","safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"27255","be a material weakness as defined"

"28787","program of each Series are being observed."
"28788","(g)	Upon request, provide assistance and recommendations for the"
"28789","determination of the fair value of certain securities when reliable"
"28790","market quotations are not readily available for purposes of"
"28791","calculating net asset value in accordance with procedures and"
"28792","methods established by the Fund's Board of Directors."
"28793","(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and"

dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all transactions for"
"28801","each Series, place all necessary orders with broker-dealers or"
"28802","issuers (including affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate"
"28803","commissions, if applicable. To the extent consistent with"
"28804","applicable law, purchase or sell orders for each Series may be"
"28805","aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of"
"28806","other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation of"
"28807","securities or swaps so sold or purchased, as well as the"
"28808","expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the"
"28809","Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the"
"28810","most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to"
"28811","the Fund and to other clients.  The Sub-Advisor will report on"
"28812","such allocations at the request of the Manager, the Fund or the"
"28813","Fund's Board of Directors providing such information as the"
"28814","number of aggregated trades to which each Series was a party,"
"28815","the broker-dealers to whom such trades were directed and the"
"28816","basis for the allocation for the aggregated trades.  The Sub-"
"28817","Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain execution of"
"28818","transactions for each Series at prices which are advantageous"
"28819","to the Series and at commission rates that are reasonable in"
"28820","relation to the benefits received. However, the Sub-Advisor may"
"28821","select brokers or dealers on the basis that they provide"
"28822","brokerage, research or other services or products to the Sub-"
"28823","Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-"
"28824","Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission"
"28825","for effecting a securities or derivatives transaction in excess of"
"28826","the amount of commission or dealer spread another broker or"
"28827","dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the"
"28828","Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that such amount of"
"28829","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"28830","brokerage and research products and/or services provided by"
"28831","such broker or dealer. This determination, with respect to"
"28832","brokerage and research products and/or services, may be"
"28833","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the"
"28834","overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates"
"28835","have with respect to each Series as well as to accounts over"
"28836","which they exercise investment discretion. Not all such services"
"28837","or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the"
"28838","Series.  In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not"
"28839","be utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under"
"28840","any exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that"
"28841","all conditions of such order are complied with."
"28842","(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to each"
"28843","Series as are required of an investment advisor of a registered"

"28845","Advisers Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisers Act), and the"
"28846","rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with"
"28847","such periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager may"
"28848","reasonably request.  In compliance with the requirements of"
"28849","Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees"
"28850","that all records that it maintains for each Series are the property"
"28851","of the Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by"

"28853","the Series and that are required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1"
"28854","under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to surrender promptly to"
"28855","the Fund any records that it maintains for a Series upon request"
"28856","by the Fund or the Manager.  The Sub-Advisor has no"

"28863","acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-Advisor's current Code"
