"1688","Accounting Firm"
"1689","To the Board of Directors of DWS International Fund,"
"1690","Inc. and the Shareholders of International Fund:"
"1691","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1692","statements of DWS International Fund (the Fund), as"
"1693","of and for the year ended August 31, 2011, in accordance"
"1694","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1695","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1696","Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"1697","including control activities for safeguarding securities, as"
"1698","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1699","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1700","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"1701","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"1702","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"1703","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"1704","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"1705","control over financial reporting."
"1706","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"1707","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1708","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1709","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"1710","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"1711","A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1712","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1713","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1714","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1715","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1716","principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"1717","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1718","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1719","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1720","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1721","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1722","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"1723","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1724","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1725","fund are being made only in accordance with"
"1726","authorizations of management and directors of the fund;"
"1727","and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1728","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1729","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that"
"1730","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1731","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1732","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1733","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1734","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1735","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1736","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1737","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1738","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1739","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1740","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1741","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1742","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is"
"1743","a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1744","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1745","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"1746","the Fund's annual or interim financial statements will"
"1747","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1748","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"1749","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"1750","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1751","all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"1752","reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"1753","standards established by the Public Company"
"1754","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"1755","we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control"
"1756","over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"1757","controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"1758","be material weaknesses as defined above as of August 31,"

"1859","Exhibit 77D - DWS International Fund (a series of"
"1860","DWS International Fund, Inc.)"
"1861","Effective on April 15, 2011, the fund's investment"
"1862","strategy and process was changed to reflect the"
"1863","following:"
"1864","Main investments. The fund invests at least 65% of its"
"1865","total assets in foreign equities (equities issued by"
"1866","foreign-based companies and listed on foreign"
"1867","exchanges), and may invest up to 20% of net assets in"
"1868","foreign debt securities, including convertible bonds."
"1869","Although the fund can invest in companies of any size"
"1870","and from any country, it invests mainly in common"
"1871","stocks of established companies in countries with"
"1872","developed economies (other than the United States). The"
"1873","fund's equity investments may also include preferred"
"1874","stocks, depositary receipts and other securities with"
"1875","equity characteristics, such as convertible securities and"
"1876","warrants."
"1877","Management process. Portfolio management aims to"
"1878","add value through stock selection. The investment team"
"1879","utilizes a proprietary investment process designed to"
"1880","identify attractive investment candidates from an"
"1881","extensive pool of fundamental research resources, which"
"1882","identify investments that may offer the potential for"
"1883","price appreciation. The investment process also takes"
"1884","into consideration various factors - including country"
"1885","and sector weightings, style and other risk targets"
"1886","relative to the benchmark - and assists portfolio"
"1887","management in devising allocations among particular"
"1888","securities. Portfolio management may buy a security"
"1889","when its research resources indicate the potential for"
"1890","future upside price appreciation or their investment"
"1891","process identifies an attractive investment opportunity."
"1892","Conversely, portfolio management may sell a security"
"1893","when its research resources indicate limited future"
"1894","upside or their investment process identifies more"
"1895","attractive investment opportunities elsewhere."
"1896","Derivatives. Portfolio management generally may use"
"1897","futures contracts, which are a type of derivative (a"
"1898","contract whose value is based on, for example, indices,"
"1899","currencies or securities) as a substitute for direct"
"1900","investment in a particular asset class or to keep cash on"
"1901","hand to meet shareholder redemptions. In addition,"
"1902","portfolio management generally may use forward"
"1903","currency contracts to hedge the fund's exposure to"
"1904","changes in foreign currency exchange rates on its foreign"
"1905","currency denominated portfolio holdings or to facilitate"
"1906","transactions in foreign currency denominated securities."
"1907","Portfolio management generally may use structured"
"1908","notes to gain exposure to local shares in foreign markets."
"1909","The fund may also use various types of derivatives (i)"
"1910","for hedging purposes; (ii) for risk management; (iii) for"
"1911","non-hedging purposes to seek to enhance potential"
"1912","gains; or (iv) as a substitute for direct investment in a"
"1913","particular asset class or to keep cash on hand to meet"
"1914","shareholder redemptions."
"1915","Securities Lending. The fund may lend securities (up to"
"1916","one-third of total assets) to approved institutions."
