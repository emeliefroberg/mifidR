"3820","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"3821","Accounting Firm"
"3822","To the Trustees and Shareholders of"
"3823","Columbia Funds Series Trust I"
"3824","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"3825","financial statements of Columbia Mid Cap"
"3826","Growth Fund (a series of Columbia Funds"
"3827","Series Trust I and hereafter referred to as the"
"3828","Fund) as of and for the year ended August"
"3829","31, 2010, in accordance with the standards of"
"3830","the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"3831","Board (United States), we considered the"
"3832","Fund's internal control over financial"
"3833","reporting, including controls over"
"3834","safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"3835","designing our auditing procedures for the"
"3836","purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"3837","financial statements and to comply with the"
"3838","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"3839","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"3840","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"3841","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"3842","not express an opinion on the effectiveness"
"3843","of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"3844","reporting."
"3845","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"3846","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"3847","internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"3848","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"3849","judgments by management are required to"
"3850","assess the expected benefits and related"
"3851","costs of controls.  A fund's internal control"
"3852","over financial reporting is a process designed"
"3853","to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"3854","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"3855","preparation of financial statements for"
"3856","external purposes in accordance with"
"3857","generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"3858","fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"3859","includes those policies and procedures that"
"3860","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"3861","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"3862","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"3863","of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"3864","reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"3865","recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"3866","of financial statements in accordance with"
"3867","generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"3868","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"3869","being made only in accordance with"
"3870","authorizations of management and trustees"
"3871","of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable"
"3872","assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"3873","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"3874","disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"3875","a material effect on the financial statements."
"3876","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"3877","control over financial reporting may not"
"3878","prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"3879","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"
"3880","to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"3881","controls may become inadequate because of"
"3882","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"3883","compliance with the policies or procedures"
"3884","may deteriorate."
"3885","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"3886","reporting exists when the design or operation"
"3887","of a control does not allow management or"
"3888","employees, in the normal course of"
"3889","performing their assigned functions, to"
"3890","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
"3891","basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"3892","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"3893","control over financial reporting, such that"
"3894","there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"3895","material misstatement of the Fund's annual"
"3896","or interim financial statements will not be"
"3897","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3898","Our consideration of the Fund's internal"
"3899","control over financial reporting was for the"
"3900","limited purpose described in the first"
"3901","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"3902","all deficiencies in internal control over"
"3903","financial reporting that might be material"
"3904","weaknesses under standards established by"
"3905","the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"3906","Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"3907","no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control"
"3908","over financial reporting and its operation,"
"3909","including controls over safeguarding"
"3910","securities that we consider to be material"
"3911","weaknesses as defined above as of August"
"3912","31, 2010."
"3913","This report is intended solely for the"
"3914","information and use of management and the"

"4621","American Express"
"4622","Financial Advisors Inc. was filed in the"
"4623","United States District"
"4624","Court for the District of Arizona. The"
"4625","plaintiffs allege that"
"4626","they are investors in several American"
"4627","Express Company"
"4628","(now known as legacy RiverSource) mutual"
"4629","funds and they"
"4630","purport to bring the action derivatively on"
"4631","behalf of those"
"4632","funds under the Investment Company Act of"
"4633","1940. The"
"4634","plaintiffs allege that fees allegedly paid to"
"4635","the defendants by"
"4636","the funds for investment advisory and"
"4637","administrative services"
"4638","are excessive. The plaintiffs seek remedies"
"4639","including"
"4640","restitution and rescission of investment"
"4641","advisory and"

"4643","voluntarily agreed to"

"4649","the District"
"4650","Court dismissed one of plaintiffs four claims"
"4651","and granted"
"4652","plaintiffs limited discovery. Defendants"
"4653","moved for summary"
"4654","judgment in April 2007. Summary judgment"
"4655","was granted in"
"4656","the defendants' favor on July 9, 2007. The"
"4657","plaintiffs filed a"
"4658","notice of appeal with the Eighth Circuit"
"4659","Court of Appeals (the"
"4660","Eighth Circuit) on August 8, 2007. On April"
"4661","8, 2009, the Eighth"
"4662","Circuit reversed summary judgment and"
"4663","remanded to the"
"4664","District Court for further proceedings. On"
"4665","August 6, 2009,"
"4666","defendants filed a writ of certiorari with the"
