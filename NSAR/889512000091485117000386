"1818","2017, in accordance with the standards of the"
"1819","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1820","States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"1821","control over financial reporting, including"
"1822","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"1823","for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1824","purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1825","financial statements and to comply with the"
"1826","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1827","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1828","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"1829","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"1830","such opinion."
"1831","Management of the Fund is responsible for"
"1832","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1833","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"1834","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1835","management are required to assess the expected"
"1836","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's"
"1837","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1838","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1839","regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"1840","and the preparation of financial statements for"
"1841","external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1842","accepted accounting principles.  A fund's"
"1843","internal control over financial reporting"
"1844","includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1845","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1846","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"1847","the transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"1848","of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"1849","that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1850","permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1851","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1852","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"1853","the fund are being made only in accordance with"

"1856","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1857","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of"
"1858","the fund's assets that could have a material"
"1859","effect on the financial statements."
"1860","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1861","control over financial reporting may not prevent"
"1862","or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"1863","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1864","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1865","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"1866","that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"1867","or procedures may deteriorate."
"1868","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1869","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"1870","a control does not allow management or employees,"
"1871","in the normal course of performing their assigned"

"1873","a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"1874","deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in"

"1876","that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1877","material misstatement of the Fund's annual or"

"1879","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1880","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control"

"2203","Reserves(the Fund), a series of Legg"

"2206","2017, in accordance with the standards"
"2207","of the Public Company Accounting"
"2208","Oversight Board (United States), we"
"2209","considered the Fund's internal control"
"2210","over financial reporting, including"
"2211","controls over safeguarding securities,"
"2212","as a basis for designing our auditing"
"2213","procedures for the purpose of"
"2214","expressing our opinion on the"
"2215","financial statements and to comply"
"2216","with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"2217","but not for the purpose of expressing"
"2218","an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"2219","Fund's internal control over financial"
"2220","reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"2221","such opinion."
"2222","Management of the Fund is responsible"
"2223","for establishing and maintaining"
"2224","effective internal control over"
"2225","financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"2226","this responsibility, estimates and"
"2227","judgments by management are required"
"2228","to assess the expected benefits and"
"2229","related costs of controls. A fund's"
"2230","internal control over financial"
"2231","reporting is a process designed to"
"2232","provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"2233","the reliability of financial reporting"
"2234","and the preparation of financial"
"2235","statements for external purposes in"
"2236","accordance with generally accepted"
"2237","accounting principles.  A fund's"
"2238","internal control over financial"
"2239","reporting includes those policies and"
"2240","procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2241","maintenance of records that, in"
"2242","reasonable detail, accurately and"
"2243","fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2244","dispositions of the assets of the"
"2245","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"2246","that transactions are recorded as"
"2247","necessary to permit preparation of"
"2248","financial statements in accordance"
"2249","with generally accepted accounting"
"2250","principles, and that receipts and"
"2251","expenditures of the fund are being"
"2252","made only in accordance with"
"2253","authorizations of management and"
"2254","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"2255","reasonable assurance regarding"
"2256","prevention or timely detection of"
"2257","unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"2258","disposition of the fund's assets that"
"2259","could have a material effect on the"
"2260","financial statements."
"2261","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"2262","internal control over financial"
"2263","reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2264","misstatements. Also, projections of"
"2265","any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"2266","future periods are subject to the risk"
"2267","that controls may become inadequate"
"2268","because of changes in conditions, or"
"2269","that the degree of compliance with the"
"2270","policies or procedures may"
"2271","deteriorate."
"2272","A deficiency in internal control over"
