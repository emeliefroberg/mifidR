"606","REGISTERED ACCOUNTING FIRM </P>"
"607","<P align=center>ON INTERNAL CONTROL REQUIRED BY FORM N-SAR </P>"
"608","<P align=center>____ </P>"
"609","<P align=left>To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Fidelity Commonwealth"
"610","Trust II: </P>"
"611","<P align=left></P>"
"612","<P align=left>In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"613","of Fidelity Commonwealth Trust II: Strategic Advisers Value Fund (collectively,"
"614","the Trust) as of and for the year ended May 31, 2010, in accordance with the"
"615","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"616","considered the Trust's internal control over financial reporting, including"
"617","control activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"618","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"619","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"620","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal"
"621","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"622","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting. </P>"
"623","<P align=left>The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"624","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"625","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"626","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal"
"627","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"628","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"629","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"630","accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"631","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"632","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"633","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"634","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"635","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"636","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Trust are being"
"637","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"638","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"639","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a Trust's assets"
"640","that could have a material effect on the financial statements. </P>"
"641","<P align=left>Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"642","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"643","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"644","controls may become inadequate because of changes in </P>"
"645","<P align=left>conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"646","procedures may deteriorate. </P>"
"647","<P align=left></P>"
"648","<P align=left>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"649","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"650","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to"
"651","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"652","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"653","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"654","misstatement of the Trust's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"655","prevented or detected on a timely basis. </P>"
"656","<P id=C__\desktop\q77b_pwcauditletter.html.2 align=left>Our consideration of the"
"657","Trust's internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"658","described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"659","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"660","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"661","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"662","Trust's internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"663","controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material"
"664","weaknesses as defined above as of May 31, 2010. </P>"

"2696","the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market"
"2697","in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the"

"2699","a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those"
"2700","terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as"
"2701","amended (the &quot;1934 Act&quot;)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which"

"2706","to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis"
"2707","of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and"
"2708","research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another"
"2709","broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of"
"2710","the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms"
"2711","of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser"
"2712","to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that"
"2713","the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section"
"2714","11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect"
"2715","portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such"
"2716","transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch"
"2717","orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other"

"3239","<P ID=C__\desktop\SA_Value_77D.html.1 ALIGN=LEFT>1The following principal investment strategy for Strategic Advisers Value Fund"
"3240","took effect April 08, 2010:"
"3241","</P>"
"3242","<P ALIGN=LEFT>The fund employs a multi-manager and a fund of funds investment structure pursuant to which Strategic Advisers allocates the fund's assets among sub-advisers whose investment approaches seek to identify undervalued securities. and"
"3243","underlying funds. Strategic Advisers may allocate the fund's assets among any"
"3244","number of sub-advisers or underlying funds at any time, but does not have minimum or maximum limitations with respect to allocations of the fund's assets at"
"3245","any time."
"3246","</P>"
"3247","<P ALIGN=LEFT>Strategic Advisers invests primarily in securities of companies with large market"
"3248","capitalizations, either through a sub-adviser or through shares of underlying"
"3249","funds that invest primarily in securities of companies with large market capitalizations. Although a universal definition of large market capitalization companies"
"3250","does not exist, for purposes of this fund, the fund generally defines large market"
"3251","capitalization companies as those companies with market capitalizations similar"
"3252","to those of companies included in the Russell 1000 Value Index. A company's"
"3253","market capitalization is based on its current market capitalization or its market"
"3254","capitalization at the time of the fund's investment. The size of the companies in"
"3255","the index changes with market conditions and the composition of the index."
"3256","</P>"
"3257","<P ALIGN=LEFT>Strategic Advisers pursues a disciplined, benchmark-driven approach to portfolio"
"3258","construction, and monitors and adjusts allocations to underlying funds and sub-advisers as necessary to attempt to control overall fund risk and pursue appropriate returns."
"3259","</P>"
"3260","<P ALIGN=LEFT>When determining how to allocate the fund's assets among underlying funds,"
"3261","Strategic Advisers relies on both proprietary fundamental and quantitative fund"
"3262","research in its fund selection process. Factors considered when investing in underlying funds include fund performance, a fund manager's experience and investment style, fund company infrastructure, and fund characteristics such as expense ratio, asset size, and portfolio turnover."
"3263","</P>"
"3264","<P ALIGN=LEFT>The fund may invest in a combination of underlying funds composed of Fidelity"
"3265","equity funds and non-affiliated equity funds that participate in Fidelity's FundsNetwork and non-affiliated ETFs. Underlying funds include both funds managed"
"3266","by Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company (an affiliated company that, together with Strategic Advisers, is part of Fidelity Investments) and funds managed by investment advisers other than Fidelity. The non-affiliated underlying"
"3267","funds pay Fidelity service fees that typically are at an annual rate of up to 0.40%"
"3268","of a fund's average daily net assets attributable to purchases through Fidelity's"
"3269","FundsNetwork, though such fees may be higher or lower, or change on a per"
"3270","position basis, in some cases. In addition, the fund may invest in ETFs in transactions not occurring through Fidelity's FundsNetwork."
"3271","</P>"
"3272","<P ALIGN=LEFT>Like all mutual funds, the underlying funds will incur fund expenses, which may"
"3273","include management fees, 12b-1 fees, and other expenses. The underlying"
"3274","funds may also charge redemption fees, sales loads, exchange fees, administrative fees, or other fees in addition to fund expenses. Any such fees will be payable by the fund, not by Strategic Advisers, although Strategic Advisers or one of"
"3275","its affiliates may choose to reimburse the fees if they are not waived by the underlying funds. The fund itself reserves the right to impose redemption fees in the"
"3276","future."
"3277","</P>"
"3278","<P ID=C__\desktop\SA_Value_77D.html.2 ALIGN=LEFT>When determining how to allocate the fund's assets among sub-advisers, Strategic Advisers considers a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, a sub-adviser's investment approach, portfolio characteristics, total assets of the fund and"
"3279","performance patterns in different market environments. While each sub-adviser's security selection criteria are unique, each sub-adviser to whom an allocation has been made purchases securities of companies deemed by such sub-adviser to have positive characteristics."
"3280","</P>"
"3281","<P ALIGN=LEFT>Each sub-adviser normally invests its portion of the fund's assets primarily in securities of companies with large market capitalizations."
"3282","</P>"
"3283","<P ALIGN=LEFT>Each sub-adviser invests its portion of the fund's assets primarily in common"
"3284","stocks. Each sub-adviser invests in securities of companies with broad value"
"3285","characteristics (stocks of these companies are often called &quot;value&quot; stocks)."
"3286","</P>"
"3287","<P ALIGN=LEFT>Each sub-adviser may invest its portion of the fund's assets in securities of foreign issuers, some of which may be located in emerging market countries, in"
"3288","addition to securities of domestic issuers."
"3289","</P>"
"3290","<P ALIGN=LEFT>Each sub-adviser may invest its portion of the fund's assets in REITs. A REIT is"
"3291","a company that owns and generally operates income producing properties or finances real estate transactions. Sub-advisers may use both quantitative and"
"3292","fundamental analysis to select investments."
"3293","</P>"
"3294","<P ALIGN=LEFT>As an alternative to holding foreign securities directly, each sub-adviser fund"
"3295","may invest in U.S. dollar-denominated securities of foreign companies that trade"
"3296","on U.S. exchanges or in the over-the-counter markets (including depositary receipts, which evidence ownership in underlying foreign stocks.)"
"3297","</P>"
"3298","<P ALIGN=LEFT>Because the fund is considered non-diversified, the fund may invest a significant"
"3299","percentage of the fund's assets in a single issuer or a single fund."
