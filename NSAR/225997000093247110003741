"1460","Vanguard Long-Term Tax-Exempt Fund"
"1461","Vanguard Short-Term Tax-Exempt Fund and"
"1462","Vanguard Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund"
"1463","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"1464","financial statements of Vanguard High-Yield Tax-"
"1465","Exempt Fund, Vanguard Intermediate-Term Tax-"
"1466","Exempt Fund, Vanguard Limited-Term Tax-Exempt"
"1467","Fund, Vanguard Long-Term Tax-Exempt Fund,"
"1468","Vanguard Short-Term Tax-Exempt Fund and"
"1469","Vanguard Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund"
"1470","(constituting Vanguard Municipal Bond Funds,"
"1471","hereafter referred to as the ?Trust?) as of and for the"
"1472","year ended October 31, 2010, in accordance with the"
"1473","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1474","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1475","Trust?s internal control over financial reporting,"
"1476","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"1477","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1478","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1479","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"1480","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"1481","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust?s"
"1482","internal control over financial reporting."
"1483","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"1484","effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over"
"1485","financial reporting."
"1486","The management of the Trust is responsible for"
"1487","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1488","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1489","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1490","management are required to assess the expected"
"1491","benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"1492","company?s internal control over financial reporting is"
"1493","a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1494","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"1495","reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"1496","for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1497","accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"1498","internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1499","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1500","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1501","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1502","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"1503","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1504","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1505","financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1506","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"1507","and expenditures of the company are being made"
"1508","only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1509","management and trustees of the company; and (3)"
"1510","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1511","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"1512","or disposition of a company?s assets that could"
"1513","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1514","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1515","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1516","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1517","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1518","risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"1519","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1520","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1521","deteriorate."
"1522","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1523","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1524","control does not allow management or employees,"
"1525","in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1526","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1527","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"1528","a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"1529","over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1530","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"1531","of the Trust's annual or interim financial statements"
"1532","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1533","Our consideration of the Trust?s internal control over"
"1534","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1535","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1536","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"1537","control over financial reporting that might be material"
"1538","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1539","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1540","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1541","in the Trust?s internal control over financial reporting"
"1542","and its operation, including controls over"
"1543","safeguarding securities that we consider to be"
"1544","material weaknesses as defined above as of"
"1545","October 31, 2010."
"1546","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"1547","use of management and the Board of Trustees of"
"1548","Vanguard Municipal Bond Funds and the Securities"
"1549","and Exchange Commission and is not intended to"

"1566","Important Changes to Vanguard High-Yield Tax-Exempt Fund and"
"1567","Vanguard Long-Term Tax-Exempt Fund"
"1568","Effective immediately, Mathew M. Kiselak, Principal of Vanguard, will assume"
"1569","the role of co-manager, along with Christopher W. Alwine, for Vanguard High-"
"1570","Yield Tax-Exempt Fund and Vanguard Long-Term Tax-Exempt Fund. The Funds?"
"1571","investment objectives, strategies, and policies remain unchanged."
"1572","Under the heading ?Investment Advisor,? the following changes apply to the day-"
"1573","to-day management of the Funds. Add the text for Mathew M. Kiselak and replace"
"1574","similar information for Christopher W. Alwine with the following:"
"1575","Mathew M. Kiselak, Principal of Vanguard. He has worked in investment"
"1576","management since 1987; has been with Vanguard since 2010; and has comanaged"
"1577","Vanguard Long-Term Tax-Exempt Fund and Vanguard High-Yield Tax-"
"1578","Exempt Fund since July 2010. Education: B.S., Pace University."
"1579","Christopher W. Alwine, CFA, Principal of Vanguard. He has been with Vanguard"
"1580","since 1990; has worked in investment management since 1991; has managed"
"1581","investment portfolios since 1996; has managed the High-Yield Tax-Exempt and"
"1582","Long-Term Tax-Exempt Funds since 2009; and has co-managed the High-Yield"
"1583","Tax-Exempt and Long-Term Tax-Exempt Funds since July 2010. Education:"
"1584","B.B.A., Temple University; M.S., Drexel University."
"1585","Important Changes to Vanguard Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund"
"1586","On February 23, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted"
"1587","amendments to Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which"
"1588","governs all money market funds. The following changes to the Prospectus are"
"1589","generally in response to such amendments."

"1592","Prospectus Text Changes"
"1593","Under the heading ?Primary Investment Policies? in the Fund Summary"
"1594","section for Vanguard Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund, the following change is"
"1595","made. The following text replaces similar text:"
"1596","The Fund invests in securities with effective maturities of 397 days or less,"
"1597","maintains a dollar-weighted average maturity of 60 days or less, and maintains"
"1598","a dollar-weighted average life of 120 days or less."
"1599","Under the heading ?Market Exposure? in the More on the Funds section, the"
"1600","following text is added immediately after ?Plain Talk About Bonds and Interest"
"1601","Rates?:"
"1602","Plain Talk About Weighted Average Life"
"1603","A money market fund will maintain a dollar-weighted average maturity (WAM) of"
"1604","60 days or less and a dollar-weighted average life (WAL) of 120 days or less."
"1605","For purposes of calculating a fund?s WAM, the maturity of certain longer-term"
"1606","adjustable rate securities held in the portfolio will generally be the period"
"1607","remaining until the next interest rate adjustment. When calculating its WAL,"
"1608","the maturity for these adjustable rate securities will generally be the final"
"1609","maturity date?the date on which principal is expected to be returned in full."
"1610","Maintaining a WAL of 120 days or less limits a fund?s ability to invest in"
"1611","longer-term adjustable rate securities, which are generally more sensitive to"
"1612","changes in interest rates, particularly in volatile markets."
"1613","Under the heading ?Other Redemption Rules You Should Know? in the"
"1614","Redeeming Shares section, the following text replaces similar text:"
"1615","Potentially disruptive redemptions. Vanguard reserves the right to pay all or"
"1616","part of a redemption in-kind?that is, in the form of securities?if we reasonably"
"1617","believe that a cash redemption would negatively affect the fund?s operation or"
"1618","performance or that the shareholder may be engaged in market-timing or frequent"
"1619","trading. Under these circumstances, Vanguard also reserves the right to delay"
"1620","payment of the redemption proceeds for up to seven calendar days. By calling us"
"1621","before you attempt to redeem a large dollar amount, you may avoid in-kind or"
"1622","delayed payment of your redemption. In connection with a determination by the"
"1623","Board of Trustees under Rule 22e-3 under the 1940 Act, a money market fund"
"1624","may suspend redemptions and postpone payment of redemption proceeds in"
"1625","order to facilitate an orderly liquidation of a fund. Please see ?Frequent-"
"1626","Trading Limits? for information about Vanguard?s policies to limit frequent"
"1627","trading."
