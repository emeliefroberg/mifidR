"7979","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"7980","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"7981","Virtus Opportunities Trust"
"7982","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"7983","statements of the 20 funds constituting Virtus Opportunities"
"7984","Trust,  hereafter referred to as the Trust as of and for the"
"7985","year or period ended September 30, 2010, in accordance with the"
"7986","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"7987","(United States), we considered the Trust's internal control"
"7988","over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"7989","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"7990","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"7991","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"7992","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"7993","effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial"
"7994","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"7995","effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial"
"7996","reporting."
"7997","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"7998","maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"7999","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"8000","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"8001","benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"8002","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"8003","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"8004","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"8005","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"8006","accounting principles.  A company's internal control over"
"8007","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"8008","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"8009","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"8010","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"8011","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"8012","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"8013","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"8014","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"8015","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"8016","trustees of the company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance"
"8017","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"8018","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"8019","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"8020","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"8021","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"8022","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"8023","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"8024","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"8025","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"8026","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"8027","exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"8028","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"8029","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"8030","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"8031","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"8032","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"8033","material misstatement of the Trust's annual or interim"
"8034","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"8035","timely basis."
"8036","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over"
"8037","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"8038","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"8039","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that"
"8040","might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"8041","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"8042","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trust's internal"
"8043","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"8044","controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be"
"8045","material weaknesses as defined above as of September 30, 2010."
"8046","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"8047","management and the Board of Trustees of Virtus Opportunities"
"8048","Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"8049","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"8050","these specified parties."

"8759","London, England W1K 3JU"
"8760","RE:	Subadvisory Agreement"
"8761","Ladies and Gentlemen:"
"8762","Virtus Opportunities Trust (the Fund) is an open-end"
"8763","investment company of the series type registered under the"
"8764","Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Act), and is subject to"
"8765","the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.  The shares of"
"8766","the Fund are offered or may be offered in several series"
"8767","(collectively, sometimes hereafter referred to as the Series)."
"8768","Virtus Investment Advisers, Inc. (the Adviser) evaluates and"
"8769","recommends series advisers for the Series and is responsible for"
"8770","the day-to-day management of the Series."
"8771","1.	Employment as a Subadviser.  The Adviser, being duly"
"8772","authorized, hereby employs Pyrford International Ltd. (the"
"8773","Subadviser) as a discretionary series adviser to invest"
"8774","and reinvest that discrete portion of the assets of the"
"8775","Series designated by the Adviser as set forth on Schedule F"
"8776","attached hereto (the Designated Series) on the terms and"
"8777","conditions set forth herein.  The services of the"
"8778","Subadviser hereunder are not to be deemed exclusive; the"
"8779","Subadviser may render services to others and engage in"
"8780","other activities that do not conflict in any material"
"8781","manner with the Subadviser's performance hereunder."
"8782","2.	Acceptance of Employment; Standard of Performance.  The"
"8783","Subadviser accepts its employment as a discretionary series"
"8784","adviser of the Designated Series and agrees to use its best"
"8785","professional judgment to make investment decisions for the"
"8786","Designated Series in accordance with the provisions of this"
"8787","Agreement and as set forth in Schedule D attached hereto"
"8788","and made a part hereof."
"8789","3.	Services of Subadviser.  In providing management services"
"8790","to the Designated Series, the Subadviser shall be subject"
"8791","to the investment objectives, policies and restrictions of"
"8792","the Fund as they apply to the Designated Series and as set"
"8793","forth in the Fund's then current prospectus (Prospectus)"
"8794","and statement of additional information (Statement of
Additional Information) filed with the Securities and"
"8795","Exchange Commission (the SEC) as part of the Fund's"
"8796","Registration Statement, as may be periodically amended and"
"8797","provided to the Subadviser by the Adviser, and to the"
"8798","investment restrictions set forth in the Act and the Rules"
"8799","thereunder, to the supervision and control of the Trustees"
"8800","of the Fund (the Trustees), and to instructions from the"
"8801","Adviser.  The Subadviser shall not, without the Fund's"
"8802","prior written approval, effect any transactions that would"
"8803","cause the Designated Series at the time of the transaction"
"8804","to be out of compliance with any of such restrictions or"
"8805","policies."
"8806","4.	Transaction Procedures.  All series transactions for the"
"8807","Designated Series shall be consummated by payment to, or"
"8808","delivery by, the Custodian(s) from time to time designated"
"8809","by the Fund (the Custodian), or such depositories or"
"8810","agents as may be designated by the Custodian in writing, of"
"8811","all cash and/or securities due to or from the Series.  The"
"8812","Subadviser shall not have possession or custody of such"
"8813","cash and/or securities or any responsibility or liability"
"8814","with respect to such custody.  The Subadviser shall advise"
"8815","the Custodian and confirm in writing to the Fund all"
"8816","investment orders for the Designated Series placed by it"
"8817","with brokers and dealers at the time and in the manner set"
"8818","forth in Schedule A hereto (as amended from time to time)."
"8819","The Fund shall issue to the Custodian such instructions as"
"8820","may be appropriate in connection with the settlement of any"
"8821","transaction initiated by the Subadviser.  The Fund shall be"
"8822","responsible for all custodial arrangements and the payment"
"8823","of all custodial charges and fees, and, upon giving proper"
"8824","instructions to the Custodian, the Subadviser shall have no"
"8825","responsibility or liability with respect to custodial"
"8826","arrangements or the act, omissions or other conduct of the"
"8827","Custodian."
"8828","5.	Allocation of Brokerage.  The Subadviser shall have"
"8829","authority and discretion to select brokers and dealers to"
"8830","execute Designated Series transactions initiated by the"
"8831","Subadviser, and to select the markets on or in which the"
"8832","transactions will be executed."
"8833","A.	In placing orders for the sale and purchase of"
"8834","Designated Series securities for the Fund, the"
"8835","Subadviser's primary responsibility shall be to seek"
"8836","the best execution of orders at the most favorable"
"8837","prices.  However, this responsibility shall not"
"8838","obligate the Subadviser to solicit competitive bids for"
"8839","each transaction or to seek the lowest available"
"8840","commission cost to the Fund, so long as the Subadviser"
"8841","reasonably believes that the broker or dealer selected"
"8842","by it can be expected to obtain a best execution"
"8843","market price on the particular transaction and"
"8844","determines in good faith that the commission cost is"
"8845","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage"
"8846","and research services (as defined in Section 28(e)(3)"
"8847","of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) provided by"
"8848","such broker or dealer to the Subadviser, viewed in"
"8849","terms of either that particular transaction or of the"
"8850","Subadviser's overall responsibilities with respect to"
"8851","its clients, including the Fund, as to which the"
"8852","Subadviser exercises investment discretion,"
"8853","notwithstanding that the Fund may not be the direct or"
"8854","exclusive beneficiary of any such services or that"
"8855","another broker may be willing to charge the Fund a"
"8856","lower commission on the particular transaction."
"8857","B.	The Subadviser may manage other portfolios and expects"
"8858","that the Fund and other portfolios the Subadviser"
"8859","manages will, from time to time, purchase or sell the"
"8860","same securities.  The Subadviser may aggregate orders"
"8861","for the purchase or sale of securities on behalf of the"
"8862","Designated Series with orders on behalf of other"
"8863","portfolios the Subadviser manages.  Securities"
"8864","purchased or proceeds of securities sold through"
"8865","aggregated orders, as well as expenses incurred in the"
"8866","transaction, shall be allocated to the account of each"
"8867","portfolio managed by the Subadviser that bought or sold"
"8868","such securities in a manner considered by the"
"8869","Subadviser to be equitable and consistent with the"
"8870","Subadviser's fiduciary obligations in respect of the"
"8871","Designated Series and to such other accounts."
"8872","C.	The Subadviser shall not execute any Series"
"8873","transactions for the Designated Series with a broker or"
"8874","dealer that is (i) an affiliated person (as defined"
"8875","in the Act) of the Fund, the Subadviser, any subadviser"
"8876","to any other Series of the Fund, or the Adviser; (ii) a"
"8877","principal underwriter of the Fund's shares; or (iii) an"
"8878","affiliated person of such an affiliated person or"
"8879","principal underwriter; in each case, unless such"
"8880","transactions are permitted by applicable law or"
"8881","regulation and carried out in compliance with any"
"8882","applicable policies and procedures of the Fund.  The"
"8883","Fund shall provide the Subadviser with a list of"
"8884","brokers and dealers that are affiliated persons of"
"8885","the Fund or the Adviser, and applicable policies and"
"8886","procedures."
"8887","D.	Consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund"
"8888","in respect of the Designated Series and the"
"8889","requirements of best price and execution, the"
"8890","Subadviser may, under certain circumstances, arrange to"
"8891","have purchase and sale transactions effected directly"
"8892","between the Designated Series and another account"
"8893","managed by the Subadviser (cross transactions),"
"8894","provided that such transactions are carried out in"
"8895","accordance with applicable law or regulation and any"
"8896","applicable policies and procedures of the Fund.  The"
"8897","Fund shall provide the Subadviser with applicable"
"8898","policies and procedures."
"8899","6.	Proxies."
"8900","A.	Unless the Adviser or the Fund gives the Subadviser"
"8901","written instructions to the contrary, the Subadviser,"
"8902","or a third party designee acting under the authority"
"8903","and supervision of the Subadviser, shall review all"
"8904","proxy solicitation materials and be responsible for"
"8905","voting and handling all proxies in relation to the"
"8906","assets of the Designated Series.  Unless the Adviser or"
"8907","the Fund gives the Subadviser written instructions to"
"8908","the contrary, the Subadviser will, in compliance with"
"8909","the proxy voting procedures of the Designated Series"
"8910","then in effect, vote or abstain from voting, all"
"8911","proxies solicited by or with respect to the issuers of"
"8912","securities in which assets of the Designated Series may"
"8913","be invested.  The Adviser shall cause the Custodian to"
"8914","forward promptly to the Subadviser all proxies upon"
"8915","receipt, so as to afford the Subadviser a reasonable"
"8916","amount of time in which to determine how to vote such"
"8917","proxies. The Subadviser agrees to provide the Adviser"
"8918","in a timely manner with a record of votes cast"
"8919","containing all of the voting information required by"
"8920","Form N-PX in an electronic format to enable the Fund to"
"8921","file Form N-PX as required by Rule 30b1-4 under the"
"8922","Act."
"8923","B.	The Subadviser is authorized to deal with"
"8924","reorganizations, exchange offers and other voluntary"
"8925","corporate actions with respect to securities held in"
"8926","the Series in such manner as the Subadviser deems"
"8927","advisable, unless the Fund or the Adviser otherwise"
"8928","specifically directs in writing.  With the Adviser's"
"8929","approval, the Subadviser shall also have the authority"
"8930","to: (i) identify, evaluate and pursue legal claims,"
"8931","including commencing or defending suits, affecting the"
"8932","securities held at any time in the Series, including"
"8933","claims in bankruptcy, class action securities"
"8934","litigation and other litigation; (ii) participate in"
"8935","such litigation or related proceedings with respect to"
"8936","such securities as the Subadviser deems appropriate to"
"8937","preserve or enhance the value of the Series, including"
"8938","filing proofs of claim and related documents and"
"8939","serving as lead plaintiff in class action lawsuits;"
"8940","(iii) exercise generally any of the powers of an owner"
"8941","with respect to the supervision and management of such"
"8942","rights or claims, including the settlement, compromise"
"8943","or submission to arbitration of any claims, the"
"8944","exercise of which the Subadviser deems to be in the"
"8945","best interest of the Series or required by applicable"
"8946","law, including ERISA, and (iv) employ suitable agents,"
"8947","including legal counsel, and to pay their reasonable"
"8948","fees, expenses and related costs from the Series."
"8949","7.	Prohibited Conduct.  In providing the services described in"
"8950","this Agreement, the Subadviser's responsibility regarding"
"8951","investment advice hereunder is limited to the Designated"
"8952","Series, and the Subadviser will not consult with any other"
"8953","investment advisory firm that provides investment advisory"
"8954","services to the Fund or any other investment company"
"8955","sponsored by Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. regarding"
"8956","transactions for the Fund in securities or other assets."
"8957","The Fund shall provide the Subadviser with a list of"
"8958","investment companies sponsored by Virtus Investment"
"8959","Partners, Inc. and the Subadviser shall be in breach of the"
"8960","foregoing provision only if the investment company is"
"8961","included in such a list provided to the Subadviser prior to"
"8962","such prohibited action.  In addition, the Subadviser shall"
"8963","not, without the prior written consent of the Fund and the"
"8964","Adviser, delegate any obligation assumed pursuant to this"
"8965","Agreement to any affiliated or unaffiliated third party."
"8966","8.	Information and Reports."
"8967","A.	The Subadviser shall keep the Fund and the Adviser"
