"4860","such matters regarding the Fund and the Interim Sub-"
"4861","Advisor as the Trust or the Advisor shall request;"
"4862","provided, however, that in the absence of extraordinary"
"4863","circumstances, the individual primarily responsible for"
"4864","management of Fund Assets for the Interim Sub-Advisor"
"4865","will not be required to attend in-person more than one"
"4866","meeting per year with the Trust's Board.  The Interim"
"4867","Sub-Advisor may utilize the services of a third-party to"

"4875","forward any notices it receives relating to class action"
"4876","claims to the Fund's custodian or other duly designated"
"4877","Fund agent.  The Interim Sub-Advisor shall  assist  the"
"4878","custodian  or  other  duly  designated  Fund  agent  in"
"4879","evaluating  such securities litigation claims, as"
"4880","reasonably requested in writing, but the Interim Sub-"
"4881","Advisor will not be responsible for filing such claims."
"4882","The Advisor acknowledges that the Fund's custodian or"
"4883","other duly designated Fund agent will be responsible for"
"4884","evaluating and making all decisions regarding securities"
"4885","litigation claims involving securities presently or"
"4886","formerly held by the Fund."
"4887","   b.   The Interim Sub-Advisor has full discretion and"
"4888","authority, to the extent required or permitted by"
"4889","applicable law, and further subject to the additional"
"4890","terms, policies, objectives, and restrictions set forth"
"4891","in this Agreement and the applicable Schedules, to do any"
"4892","or all of the following:  (i) to establish brokerage"
"4893","accounts in the Fund's name with the Interim Sub-Advisor"
"4894","or other unaffiliated brokers or counterparties to effect"
"4895","securities transactions in connection with the services"
"4896","hereunder, and to exercise full discretionary authority"
"4897","over such accounts; and (ii) to purchase or sell,"
"4898","securities held in the Fund's investment accounts."
"4899","In connection with these transactions, the Interim Sub-"
"4900","Advisor may (i) negotiate, amend, execute and deliver any"
"4901","agreements or documents the Interim Sub-Advisor considers"
"4902","necessary or desirable for the purpose of entering into"
"4903","these securities transactions; and (ii) deliver to"
"4904","counterparties, on the behalf of the Fund"
"4905","representations, warranties, and covenants, along with"
"4906","such financial information regarding the Fund as such"
"4907","counterparties may reasonably request."
"4908","      c.   All transactions will be conducted in the"
"4909","manner described in the Interim Sub-Advisor's Trading"
"4910","Practices, attached as Schedule B.  In addition, the"
"4911","Interim Sub-Advisor may, to the extent permitted by"
"4912","applicable law and regulations, aggregate purchase and"
"4913","sale orders of securities placed with respect the Fund"
"4914","Assets with similar  orders being made simultaneously for"
"4915","other accounts managed by the Interim Sub-Advisor or its"
"4916","affiliates, if, in the Interim Sub-Advisor's reasonable"
"4917","judgment, such aggregation shall result in an overall"
"4918","economic benefit to the Fund, taking into consideration"
"4919","the selling or purchase price, brokerage commissions, and"
"4920","other expenses.  In the event that a purchase or sale"
"4921","the Fund Assets occurs as part of any aggregate sale or"
"4922","purchase order, the objective of the Interim Sub-Advisor"
"4923","and any of its affiliates involved in such transaction"
"4924","shall be to allocate the securities so purchased or sold,"
"4925","as well as expenses incurred in the transaction, among"
"4926","the Fund and other accounts in a fair and equitable"
"4927","manner.  Whenever the Fund and one or more other"
"4928","investment advisory clients of the Interim Sub-Advisor"
"4929","have available funds for investment, investments suitable"
"4930","and appropriate for each will be allocated in a manner"
"4931","believed by the Interim Sub-Advisor to be equitable to"
"4932","each.  Moreover, it is possible that due to differing"
"4933","investment objectives or for other reasons, the Interim"
"4934","Sub-Advisor and its affiliates may purchase securities of"
"4935","an issuer for one client and at approximately the same"
"4936","time recommend selling or sell the same or similar types"
"4937","of securities for another client, including the Fund."
"4938","      d.   The Interim Sub-Advisor will not arrange"
"4939","purchases or sales of securities between the Fund and"
"4940","other accounts advised by the Interim Sub-Advisor or"
"4941","its affiliates unless (a) such purchases or sales are in"
"4942","accordance with applicable law and  regulation"
"4943","(including Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act) and the"
"4944","Fund's policies and procedures, (b) the Interim Sub-"
"4945","Advisor determines the purchase or sale is in the best"
"4946","interests of the Fund, and (c) the Fund's Board of"
"4947","Trustees has approved these types of transactions."
"4948","      e.   The Interim Sub-Advisor shall promptly notify"
"4949","the Advisor if the Interim Sub-Advisor reasonably"
"4950","believes that the value of any security held by the Fund"
"4951","may not reflect fair value.  The Interim Sub-Advisor"
"4952","agrees to provide any pricing information of which the"
"4953","Interim Sub-Advisor is aware to the Advisor and/or any"
"4954","Fund pricing agent to assist in the determination of the"
"4955","fair value of any Fund holdings for which market"
"4956","quotations are not readily available or as otherwise"
"4957","required in accordance with the 1940 Act or the Fund's"
"4958","valuation procedures for the purpose of calculating the"
"4959","Fund's net asset value in accordance with procedures"
"4960","and methods established by the Board.  The parties"
"4961","hereto recognize that the Interim Sub-Advisor is not an"
"4962","official pricing source."

"4968","respective rules and regulations thereunder, as"
"4969","applicable, as well as with all other applicable federal"
"4970","and state laws, rules, regulations, and case law that"
"4971","relate to the services and relationships described"
"4972","hereunder and to the conduct of its business as a"
"4973","registered investment adviser. In selecting the Fund's"
"4974","portfolio securities and performing the Interim Sub-"
"4975","Advisor's obligations hereunder, the Interim Sub-Advisor"
"4976","shall cause the Fund to comply with the diversification"
"4977","and source of income requirements of Subchapter M of the"
"4978","Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code),"
"4979","for qualification as a regulated investment company.  The"
"4980","Interim Sub-Advisor shall maintain compliance procedures"
"4981","that it reasonably believes are adequate to ensure the"
"4982","compliance with the foregoing.  No supervisory activity"
"4983","undertaken by the Advisor shall limit the Interim Sub-"
"4984","Advisor's full responsibility for any of the foregoing."
"4985","         (ii)   The Interim Sub-Advisor has adopted a"
"4986","written code of ethics that it reasonably believes"
"4987","complies with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the"
"4988","1940 Act, which it will provide to the Advisor and the"

"4990","Access Persons (as defined in the Interim Sub-Advisor's"
"4991","Code of Ethics) comply in all material respects with the"
"4992","Interim Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics, as in effect.  Upon"
"4993","request, the Interim Sub-Advisor shall provide the Fund"
"4994","with (i) a copy of the Interim Sub-Advisor's current Code"
"4995","of Ethics, as in effect, and (ii) a certification that it"
"4996","has adopted procedures reasonably necessary to prevent"
"4997","Access Persons from engaging in any conduct prohibited by"
"4998","the Interim Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics.  No less"
"4999","frequently than annually, the Interim Sub-Advisor shall"
"5000","furnish a written report, which complies with the"
"5001","requirements of Rule 17j-1, concerning the Interim Sub-"
"5002","Advisor's Code of Ethics to the Fund and the Advisor."
"5003","The Interim Sub-Advisor shall respond to requests for"
"5004","information from the Advisor as to violations of the Code"
"5005","by Access Persons and the sanctions imposed by the"
"5006","Interim Sub-Advisor.  The Interim Sub-Advisor shall"
"5007","immediately notify the Advisor of any material violation"

"5009","security held by any Fund."
"5010","         (iii)   The Interim Sub-Advisor shall notify"
"5011","the Trust's Chief Compliance Officer and Advisor"
"5012","immediately upon detection of (i) any material failure to"
"5013","manage any Fund in accordance with its investment"
"5014","objectives and policies or any applicable law; or (ii)"
"5015","any material breach of any of the Fund's or the Advisor's"
"5016","policies, guidelines, or procedures.  In addition, the"
"5017","Interim Sub-Advisor shall provide a quarterly report"
"5018","regarding its compliance with the Fund's investment"
"5019","objectives and policies and applicable law, including,"
"5020","but not limited to the 1940 Act, the Code, and the Fund's"
"5021","and the Advisor's policies, guidelines, or procedures as"
"5022","applicable to the Interim Sub-Advisor's obligations under"
"5023","this Agreement.  The Interim Sub-Advisor acknowledges and"
"5024","agrees that the Advisor may, in its discretion, provide"
"5025","such quarterly compliance certifications to the Board."
"5026","The Interim Sub-Advisor agrees to correct any such"
"5027","failure promptly and to take any action that the Board"
"5028","and/or the Advisor may reasonably request in connection"
"5029","with any such breach.  The Interim Sub-Advisor shall also"
"5030","provide the officers of the Trust with supporting"
"5031","certifications in connection with such certifications of"
"5032","Fund financial statements and disclosure controls"
"5033","pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended."

"5089","may consider a number of factors, including, without"
"5090","limitation, the overall direct net economic result to the"
"5091","Fund (including commissions, which may not be the lowest"
"5092","available but ordinarily should not be higher than the"
"5093","generally prevailing competitive range), the financial"
"5094","strength and stability of the broker, the efficiency with"
"5095","which the transaction will be effected, the ability to"
"5096","effect the transaction at all where a large block is"
"5097","involved and the availability of the broker or dealer to"
"5098","stand ready to execute possibly difficult transactions in"
"5099","the future.  Consistent with the Conduct Rules of the"
"5100","Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and subject to"
"5101","seeking most favorable price and execution and compliance"
"5102","with Rule 12b-1(h) under the 1940 Act, the Interim Sub-"
"5103","Advisor may select brokers and dealers to execute"
"5104","portfolio transactions of the Fund that promote or sell"
"5105","shares of the Fund.  The Interim Sub-Advisor is"
"5106","specifically authorized, to the extent authorized by law"
"5107","(including, without limitation, Section 28(e) of the 1934"
"5108","Act, to pay a broker or dealer who provides research"
"5109","services to the Interim Sub-Advisor an amount of"
"5110","commission for effecting a portfolio transaction in"
"5111","excess of the amount of commission another broker or"
"5112","dealer would have charged for effecting such transaction,"
"5113","in recognition of such additional research services"
"5114","rendered by the broker or dealer, but only if the Interim"
"5115","Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that the excess"
"5116","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"5117","brokerage and research services provided by such broker"
"5118","or dealer viewed in terms of the particular transaction"
"5119","or the Interim Sub-Advisor's overall responsibilities"
"5120","with respect to discretionary accounts that it manages,"
"5121","and that the Fund derives or will derive a reasonable"
"5122","benefit from such research services.  The Interim Sub-"
"5123","Advisor will present a written report to the Board, at"
"5124","least quarterly, indicating total brokerage expenses,"
"5125","actual or imputed, as well as the services obtained in"
"5126","consideration for such expenses, broken down by broker-"
"5127","dealer and containing such information as the Board"
"5128","reasonably shall request."
"5129","      i.   The Interim Sub-Advisor shall maintain errors"
"5130","and omissions insurance coverage in an appropriate amount"
"5131","and shall provide prior written notice to the Trust (i)"
"5132","of any material changes in its insurance policies or"
"5133","insurance coverage; or (ii) if any material claims will"
"5134","be made on its insurance policies related to the services"
"5135","provided to the Trust under this Agreement.  Furthermore,"
"5136","the Interim Sub-Advisor shall, upon reasonable request,"
"5137","provide the Trust with any information it may reasonably"
"5138","require concerning the amount of or scope of such"
"5139","insurance."
"5140","      j.   In the event of any reorganization or other"
"5141","change in the Interim Sub-Advisor, its investment"
"5142","principals, supervisors, or members of its investment (or"
"5143","comparable) committee, the Interim Sub-Advisor shall give"
"5144","the Advisor and the Board written notice of such"
"5145","reorganization or change within a reasonable time (but"
"5146","not later than 30 days) after such reorganization or"
"5147","change."
"5148","      k.   The Interim Sub-Advisor will bear its expenses"
"5149","of providing services to the Fund pursuant to this"
"5150","Agreement except such expenses as are expressly"
"5151","undertaken by the Advisor or the Fund."
"5152","   3.   Compensation of the Interim Sub-Advisor."
"5153","      a.   As compensation for the services to be rendered"
"5154","and duties undertaken hereunder by the Interim Sub-"
"5155","Advisor, the Advisor will pay to the Interim Sub-Advisor"
"5156","a monthly fee equal on an annual basis to XXX% of the"
"5157","average daily net assets of the Fund without regard to"
"5158","any total expense limitation of the Fund or the Advisor."
"5159","Such fee shall be computed and accrued daily.  If the"
"5160","Interim Sub-Advisor serves in such capacity for less than"
"5161","the whole of any period specified in Section 12a, the"
"5162","compensation to the Interim Sub-Advisor shall be"
"5163","prorated.  For purposes of calculating the Interim Sub-"
"5164","Advisor's fee, the daily value of the Fund Assets shall"
"5165","be computed by the same method as the Trust uses to"
"5166","compute the net asset value of the Fund for purposes of"
"5167","purchases and redemptions of shares thereof."
"5168","      b.   The Interim Sub-Advisor reserves the right to"
"5169","waive all or a part of its fees hereunder."
"5170","   4.   Activities of the Interim Sub-Advisor.  The Interim"
"5171","Sub-Advisor will report to the Trust's Board (at regular"
"5172","quarterly meetings and at such other times as such Board"
"5173","reasonably shall request, subject to the limitation on"
"5174","personal attendance at such meetings set forth in Section 2a)"
"5175","(i) information regarding any potential conflicts of interest"
"5176","arising by reason of its continuing provision of advisory"
"5177","services to the Fund and to its other accounts, and (ii) such"
"5178","other information as the Board shall reasonably request"
"5179","regarding the Fund, the Fund's performance, the services"
"5180","provided by the Interim Sub-Advisor to the Fund as compared to"
"5181","its other accounts, and the plans and capability of the"
"5182","Interim Sub-Advisor with respect to providing future services"
"5183","to the Fund and its other accounts.  The Interim Sub-Advisor"
"5184","agrees to submit to the Trust a statement defining its"
"5185","policies with respect to the allocation of business among the"
"5186","Fund and its other clients."
"5187","   The Interim Sub-Advisor has supplied to the Advisor and"
"5188","the Trust copies of its Form ADV with all exhibits and"
"5189","attachments thereto (including the Interim Sub-Advisor's"
"5190","statement of financial condition) and will hereafter supply to"
"5191","the Advisor, promptly upon the preparation thereof, copies of"
"5192","all amendments or restatements of such document."
"5193","   5.   Representations of the Advisor and the Trust.  The"
"5194","Advisor represents that: (a) the Advisor has been duly"
"5195","appointed by the Board to provide investment services to the"
"5196","Fund Assets as contemplated in this Agreement; (b) the Advisor"

"5201","agreement binding on the Trust or its property; (c) the Trust"
"5202","has the full power and authority to enter into all"

"5207","Advisor's decision to appoint the Interim Sub-Advisor was made"
"5208","in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties under"

"5210","other material agreements or instruments governing the Fund's"
"5211","investment or trading activities; (e) the Advisor will deliver"
"5212","to the Interim Sub-Advisor a true and complete copy of the"

"5218","the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the"

"5229","evaluations, advice or recommendations to use Russell"
"5230","Investments products or services.  If the Trust has or will"

"5233","advice as the primary basis for selecting the Interim"

"5255","the Advisor or the Trust in any material relating to the"
"5256","Interim Sub-Advisor in any manner not approved in advance by"
"5257","the Advisor or the Trust, as the case may be; provided,"
"5258","however, that the Advisor and the Trust will each approve all"
"5259","uses of their respective names which merely refer in accurate"

"5461","INVESTMENT GUIDELINES"
"5462","INTERIM MANAGEMENT SERVICES PROGRAM"
"5463","This Schedule describes the Interim Management Services"
"5464","program (the Program) to be provided under the Agreement."
"5465","The Program includes a combination of administrative"
"5466","coordination, cash and transaction management, and overlay"
"5467","investment advisory services using securities and other"
"5468","instruments designed to keep the Fund's assets aligned with"
"5469","investment policy or an otherwise specified target for a"
"5470","specified period."
"5471","INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE"
"5472","Russell will manage the Fund to achieve returns similar to the"
"5473","Fund's benchmark index based on ex ante tracking error while"
"5474","controlling transaction-related expenses through reduced"
"5475","trading.  The goal will be to manage the Fund's risk relative"
"5476","to the Fund's benchmark index, as measured by the annualized"
"5477","ex ante tracking error, to the FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed"
"5478","Index (The Target); targeting 1.0% tracking error and"
"5479","rebalancing the Fund if tracking error exceeds 1.25%.  The"
"5480","Target is determined through various risk optimization models"
"5481","to target the 1.0% tracking error and is also designed to"
"5482","mitigate and reduce other risk, but not all associated risk"
"5483","factors.  Russell does not conduct specific research,"
"5484","fundamental analysis, or have an opinion as to the quality of"
"5485","any specific security or investment instrument.  Should the"
"5486","Fund's tracking error exceed 1.25% as measured, at a minimum,"
"5487","on a weekly basis, Russell will re-optimize the Fund back to"
"5488","the 1.0% annualized target under the limitation that any"
"5489","securities purchased are within the FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed"
"5490","Index's universe.  The minimum number of names to be held will"
"5491","be 100."
"5492","TIMEFRAME"
"5493","The expected timeframe of the interim assignment is"
"5494","approximately four months.  The Interim Sub-Advisor reserves"
"5495","the right to resign from the interim assignment by providing"
"5496","30 days advanced written notice."
"5497","FEES"
"5498","There will be a monthly investment management fee of XX basis"
"5499","points (XX%) based on the actual number of days"
"5500","(actual/actual) which begins on February 22, 2013.  This fee"
"5501","will be assessed monthly."
"5502","It is understood that the above pricing is based on our"
"5503","agreement that the Interim Sub-Advisor will conduct the"
"5504","transition at the conclusion of the interim portfolio"
"5505","management assignment."
"5506","INTERIM MANAGEMENT SERVICES"
"5507","The Interim Sub-Advisor will monitor the tracking error"
"5508"," __[X] weekly ___[ ] monthly."
"5509","The Interim Sub-Advisor will rebalance, if necessary,"
"5510","___[X] weekly __[ ] monthly when the measured portfolio"
"5511","tracking error exceeds 25 basis points (0.25%) from the target"
"5512","portfolio level tracking error outlined above."
"5513","The Interim Sub-Advisor's interim portfolio management process"
"5514","utilizes various risk models and optimization techniques with"
"5515","the primary goal of reducing portfolio level tracking error as"
"5516","measured versus the specified published benchmark index.  This"
"5517","process further attempts to mitigate and reduce other but not"
"5518","all associated risk factors.  While providing interim"
"5519","portfolio management services, the Interim Sub-Advisor does"
"5520","not conduct specific research, fundamental analysis, or have"
"5521","an opinion as to the investment quality of any specific"
"5522","security or investment instrument.   While the optimization"
"5523","process seeks to reduce portfolio level tracking error, it"
"5524","does not eliminate the risk associated with security specific"
"5525","events."
"5526","During the interim portfolio management timeframe, the Interim"
"5527","Sub-Advisor will be responsible for corporate actions"
"5528","including proxy materials.  Unless otherwise instructed, the"

"5559","TRADING PRACTICES"
"5560","Russell Implementation Services Inc. (Russell) is a"
"5561","registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers"
"5562","act of 1940, as amended, and a registered broker dealer under"
"5563","the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  The"
"5564","following describes the terms, conditions and trading"
"5565","practices that apply when Russell has been engaged by a client"
"5566","(the Client) to effect transactions in securities, futures,"
"5567","currency, swaps and related instruments."
"5568","BEST EXECUTION.  Russell seeks best execution in performing"
"5569","all of its trading services.  Best execution is a term of art"
"5570","that does not have a single industry accepted definition."
"5571","Russell defines best execution as:"
"5572","The process that is most likely, in Russell's good faith"
"5573","judgment, to preserve the value of investment decisions within"
"5574","the Client's stated investment objectives and constraints."
"5575","Best execution requires evaluation and management of"
"5576","probabilistic factors that cannot be predicted or controlled"
"5577","effectively on a trade-by-trade basis.  As such, Russell's"
"5578","process is designed to minimize total expected costs and risks"
"5579","across the distribution of events in an investment cycle."
"5580","ORDER AGGREGATION AND ALLOCATION.  Russell may in some cases"
"5581","aggregate sales and purchase orders of securities and other"
"5582","investments for Clients with concurrent trades managed by"
"5583","Russell or its affiliates.  Russell is not obligated to"
"5584","aggregate orders, and will only do so if Russell reasonably"
"5585","believes such aggregation will result in an overall benefit to"
"5586","its Clients, taking into consideration the objective of best"
"5587","execution as defined above.  Aggregated orders are allocated"
"5588","among Russell Clients such that Clients are treated on a fair"
"5589","and equitable basis, and that the interests of some Clients"
"5590","are not placed over those of others."
"5591","SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS.  Russell effects transactions in"
"5592","securities including stocks and bonds as follows:"
"5593","Agency Basis.  Russell acts as agent for its Clients for all"
"5594","transactions.  Russell may consider trades with independent"
"5595","broker-dealers or counterparties who are themselves acting as"
"5596","principal or agent, but Russell will always act in an agency"
"5597","capacity.  Russell may arrange agency cross-transactions where"
"5598","permitted and where such transactions are consistent with the"
"5599","overall implementation strategy.  An arranged agency cross-"
"5600","trade is a trade where Russell presents both sides of the"
"5601","trade, as agent, to an external crossing network, exchange or"
"5602","market place where the price is determined independently."
"5603","Broker-Dealers.  Russell has arrangements with a wide network"
"5604","of non-affiliated correspondent broker-dealers and"
"5605","counterparties (collectively, Broker-Dealers) and may use"
"5606","any one or more of such Broker-Dealers to perform execution,"
"5607","clearing or other services in relation to trades executed"
"5608","under its Client agreements.  Russell selects and evaluates"
"5609","Broker-Dealers for trading services based on processes"
"5610","designed to achieve best execution as defined above.  These"
"5611","due diligence processes include evaluation of several factors,"
"5612","including quality of execution (measured in terms of net price"
"5613","versus stated benchmarks), market access, technology, and"
"5614","ability to accommodate special transaction needs and Client"
"5615","service."
"5616","FUTURES TRANSACTIONS.  Russell manages futures transactions"
"5617","for Clients in several contexts, including Overlay Services,"
"5618","Transition Services and various interim portfolio management"
"5619","and other assignments.  The terms and strategies applied will"
"5620","vary depending on the type of service and the contract,"
"5621","investment guidelines and special restrictions established"
"5622","with the Client, but the following general practices apply:"
"5623","Designated Brokers.  As an agent, Russell effects all futures"
"5624","transactions in accounts established with a clearing broker"
"5625","selected by agreement of Russell and the Client (the"
"5626","Designated Broker).  To establish these account(s), Russell"
"5627","will provide the Client with materials developed by the"
"5628","Designated Broker, including certain disclosure materials"
"5629","related to the risks of futures.  Accounts may be established"
"5630","either directly by the Client, or by Russell on behalf of the"
"5631","Client if the Client executes a Power of Attorney (in the form"
"5632","prescribed by the Designated Broker) authorizing Russell to"
"5633","execute customer agreements and establish such accounts."
"5634","Russell may also use execution-only brokers for futures"
"5635","transactions.  Russell manages and maintains the required"
"5636","give-up agreements between clearing and execution-only firms"
"5637","necessary to effect such transactions."
"5638","The Designated Broker is responsible for the timely payment of"
"5639","amounts owed to Clients and for the payment of any penalties"
"5640","and interest due to any default by the Designated Broker.  The"
"5641","Client is responsible for ensuring the timely payment of any"
"5642","amounts owed by the Client to the Designated Broker upon"
"5643","instruction from Russell and for payment of any penalties and"
"5644","interest due to any such default on the part of the Client."
"5645","Collateral.  The Designated Broker may require initial,"
"5646","variation, maintenance and other required margin in the form"
"5647","of monies, securities or otherwise (Collateral) in"
"5648","connection with the Client account.  As provided in the Client"
"5649","agreement, Russell will from time to time execute Collateral"
"5650","transactions and provide (or direct the Client to provide) the"
"5651","Designated Broker with the necessary Collateral.  The"
"5652","collateral will be held in an account at the Designated Broker"
"5653","in the name of the Client.  All interest and earnings on the"
"5654","Collateral belong to the Client and will be delivered to the"
"5655","Client on a periodic basis."
"5656","CURRENCY AND SWAP TRANSACTIONS.  Russell effects transactions"
"5657","in currency and swaps as follows:"
"5658","Counterparty Banks and Prime Brokers.  Russell has"
"5659","arrangements with a wide network of non-affiliated"
"5660","counterparty banks and prime brokers (collectively"
"5661","Counterparties) and may use any one or more of such"
"5662","Counterparties to perform execution, clearing or other"
"5663","services in relation to trades executed under Client"
"5664","agreements.  Russell selects and evaluates Counterparties for"
"5665","trading services based on processes designed to achieve best"
"5666","execution.  These due diligence processes include evaluation"
"5667","of several factors, including creditworthiness, quality of"
"5668","execution (measured in terms of proximity to the"
"5669","contemporaneous market price), Client service, market access,"
"5670","technology and ability to accommodate special transaction"
"5671","needs."
"5672","Alternative Execution Outlets.  Russell may employ a variety"
"5673","of alternative execution outlets in pursuit of best execution"
"5674","and individual counterparty trade execution systems."
"5675","Currency and Swap Collateral.  The Counterparties may require"
"5676","margin in the form of monies, securities or otherwise (OTC
Collateral) in connection with the Client account.  As"
"5677","provided in the Client agreement, Russell will from time to"
"5678","time execute OTC Collateral transactions and provide (or"
"5679","direct the Client to provide) the Counterparties with the"
"5680","necessary OTC Collateral.  All interest and earnings on the"
"5681","OTC Collateral belong to the Client and will be delivered to"
"5682","the Client on a periodic basis."
"5683","FEES AND OTHER CHARGES.  Russell fees related to securities,"
"5684","futures, currency, swap or other transactions, will be on"
"5685","terms separately agreed with the Client for the assignment and"
"5686","may be collected by brokers, counterparties or charged"
"5687","directly.  For securities transactions, brokerage fees include"
"5688","charges for execution, clearing or other services, if any,"
"5689","imposed by the Broker-Dealers, exchanges, ECN's or other"
"5690","execution venues.  For futures transactions, brokerage fees"
"5691","include charges imposed by the Designated Broker and, if"
"5692","applicable, the execution-only broker, for execution, clearing"
"5693","and other services.  For currency transactions, trading costs"
"5694","and fees are generally reflected in the currency exchange"
"5695","rate.  For swap transactions, fees and charges are generally"
"5696","included in the price of the swap.  For all transactions, fees"
"5697","for taxes, exchange fees, settlement, prime brokerage, transfer, custodial"
"5698","fees and other similar items are borne by the Client."
"5699","                                                      Schedule C"

"5775","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"5776","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"5777","of Touchstone Funds Group Trust"
"5778","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"5779","statements of Touchstone Funds Group Trust (the Trust)"
"5780","as of and for the year ended September 30, 2013, in"
"5781","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"5782","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"5783","the company's internal control over financial reporting,"
"5784","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"5785","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"5786","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"5787","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"5788","SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"5789","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over"
"5790","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"5791","opinion."
"5792","The management of the Trust is responsible for"
"5793","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"5794","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"5795","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"5796","required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"5797","costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"5798","financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"5799","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"5800","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"5801","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"5802","generally accepted accounting principles. A company's"
"5803","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"5804","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"5805","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"5806","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"5807","dispositions of the assets of the trust; (2) provide"
"5808","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"5809","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"5810","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"5811","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"5812","company are being made only in accordance with"
"5813","authorizations of management and trustees of the trust;"
"5814","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"5815","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"5816","disposition of the company's assets that could have a"
"5817","material effect on the financial statements."
"5818","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"5819","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"5820","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"5821","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"5822","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"5823","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"5824","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"5825","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"5826","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"5827","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"5828","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"5829","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"5830","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"5831","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"5832","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"5833","the company's annual or interim financial statements will"
"5834","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"5835","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over"
"5836","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"5837","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"5838","all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"5839","material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"5840","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"5841","States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"5842","company's internal control over financial reporting and"
"5843","its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"5844","securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as"
"5845","defined above as of September 30, 2013."
"5846","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"5847","use of management and the Board of Trustees of the Trust"
"5848","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"5849","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"5850","than these specified parties."
