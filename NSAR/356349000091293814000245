"1602","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of MFS"
"1603","Government Securities Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year ended February"
"1604","28, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1605","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"1606","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"1607","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"1608","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1609","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1610","Fund's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no"
"1611","such opinion."
"1612","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1613","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1614","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1615","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"1616","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1617","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1618","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1619","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"1620","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1621","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1622","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"1623","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"

"1628","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"1629","a material effect on the financial statements."
"1630","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1631","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1632","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1633","inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance"
"1634","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1635","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"1636","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"1637","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1638","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1639","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1640","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1641","fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"

"1796","             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1797","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1798","MFS New Discovery Value Fund"
"1799","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of MFS New"
"1800","Discovery Value Fund (the Fund)  as of and for the year ended February 28,"
"1801","2014, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1802","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"1803","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"1804","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"1805","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1806","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1807","Fund's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"1808","such opinion."
"1809","The  management  of  the  Fund  is  responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1810","effective  internal  control  over  financial   reporting.  In  fulfilling  this"
"1811","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1812","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A  company's  internal control"
"1813","over  financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance"
"1814","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"1815","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1816","accounting  principles.  A  company's  internal control over financial reporting"
"1817","includes those policies and procedures that  (1)  pertain  to the maintenance of"
"1818","records   that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect   the"
"1819","transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2) provide"
"1820","reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as necessary to permit"
"1821","preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with generally  accepted"
"1822","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures  of  the  company  are"
"1823","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"1824","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1825","detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"1826","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1827","Because of its  inherent  limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1828","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1829","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1830","inadequate because of changes in conditions,  or  that  the degree of compliance"
"1831","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1832","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"1833","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,  in the normal"
"1834","course   of   performing   their   assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"1835","misstatements on a timely basis. A material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or  a"
"1836","combination  of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1837","that there is  a  reasonable  possibility  that  a  material misstatement of the"
"1838","company's  annual  or  interim financial statements will  not  be  prevented  or"
"1839","detected on a timely basis."
"1840","Our consideration of the  Fund's  internal  control over financial reporting was"
"1841","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in  the first  paragraph  and  would  not"
"1842","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1843","weaknesses  under  standards  established  by  the   Public  Company  Accounting"
"1844","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"

"1944","time by a majority of the Trustees. Meetings of the Shareholders for the purpose"
"1945","of considering the removal of a person serving as Trustee shall be called by the"

"1957","date  of such adjourned meeting is more than 90 days after  the  notice  of  the"
"1958","meeting  was  mailed  or  sent.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if either the"
"1959","President  or  Clerk  of the Trust, or in the absence or unavailability  of  the"
"1960","President and the Clerk,  any  officer of the Trust, determines that as a result"
"1961","of force majeure or an act of God or war, the date, time or place designated for"
"1962","a meeting or adjourned meeting of  Shareholders is not reasonably practicable or"
"1963","available, such officer may, without  further  notice to Shareholders, designate"
"1964","such other date, time or place for such meeting  or  adjourned  meeting  as such"
"1965","officer shall, in his or her sole discretion, determine. No notice need be given"

"1967","address or if a written waiver of notice,  executed  before or after the meeting"
"1968","by  the  Shareholder or his attorney thereunto authorized,  is  filed  with  the"
"1969","records of the meeting."
"1970","      SECTION  3.  RECORD  DATE FOR MEETINGS. For the purpose of determining the"
"1971","Shareholders who are entitled  to  notice  of  and to vote at any meeting, or to"
"1972","participate in any distribution, or for the purpose  of  any  other  action, the"
"1973","Trustees  may  from  time to time close the transfer books for such period,  not"
"1974","exceeding thirty (30)  days,  as  the Trustees may determine; or without closing"
"1975","the transfer books the Trustees may  fix  a  date not more than ninety (90) days"
"1976","prior to the date of any meeting of Shareholders or distribution or other action"
"1977","as  a  record  date  for  the determination of the  persons  to  be  treated  as"
"1978","Shareholders of record for  such  purpose. The Trustees also may select the time"
"1979","of  day  as  of which the calculations  for  determining  how  many  votes  each"
"1980","Shareholder is entitled to pursuant to the Declaration shall be performed."
"1981","      SECTION  4.  PROXIES. At any meeting of Shareholders, any holder of Shares"
"1982","entitled to vote thereat  may  vote  by  proxy,  provided that no proxy shall be"
"1983","voted at any meeting unless it shall have been placed on file with the Clerk, or"
"1984","with  such  other officer or agent of the Trust as the  Clerk  may  direct,  for"
"1985","verification  prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken. Pursuant to a"
"1986","vote of a majority  of the Trustees, proxies may be solicited in the name of one"
"1987","or more Trustees or one  or more of the officers of the Trust. When any Share is"
"1988","held jointly by several persons,  any  one  of  them  may vote at any meeting in"
"1989","person  or  by proxy in respect of such Share (and a proxy  shall  be  valid  if"
"1990","executed by any  one  of them), but if more than one of them shall be present at"
"1991","such meeting in person  or  by  proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so"
"1992","present disagree as to any vote to  be  cast, such vote shall not be received in"
"1993","respect of such Share. A proxy purporting  to  be  executed by or on behalf of a"
"1994","Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise,"
"1995","and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the  challenger.  The placing"
"1996","of  a  Shareholder's  name  on  a proxy pursuant to telephonic or electronically"
"1997","transmitted instructions obtained  pursuant to procedures reasonably designed to"
"1998","verify that such instructions have been  authorized  by  such  Shareholder shall"
"1999","constitute execution of such proxy by or on behalf of such Shareholder.  If  the"
"2000","holder  of any such Share is a minor or a person of unsound mind, and subject to"
"2001","guardianship  or  to the legal control of any other person as regards the charge"
"2002","or management of such  Share,  he  may vote by his guardian or such other person"
"2003","appointed or having such control, and  such  vote  may  be given in person or by"
"2004","proxy. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of a"
"2005","proxy may be substituted for or used in lieu of the original  proxy  for any and"
"2006","all  purposes  for  which  the original proxy could be used, provided that  such"
"2007","copy, facsimile telecommunication  or  other  reproduction  shall  be a complete"
"2008","reproduction of the entire original proxy or the portion thereof to  be returned"
"2009","by the Shareholder."
"2010","      SECTION  5.  QUORUM  AND  ADJOURNMENT.   Except  when  a larger quorum  is"
"2011","required by any provision of law, Shares representing a majority  of  the voting"
"2012","power  of  the outstanding Shares entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum  at"
"2013","any meeting  of  Shareholders,  except  that  where  any  provision  of law, the"
"2014","Declaration or these By-laws requires that holders of any series or class  shall"
"2015","vote  as a series or class, then Shares representing a majority (unless a larger"
"2016","quorum  is  required  as  specified  above) of the voting power of the aggregate"
"2017","number of Shares of that series or class  entitled to vote shall be necessary to"
"2018","constitute a quorum for the transaction of  business by that series or class. In"
"2019","the absence of a quorum, Shareholders entitled  to  cast  votes  representing  a"
"2020","majority  of the voting power of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote present"
"2021","in person or  by proxy, or, where any provision of law, the Declaration or these"
"2022","By-laws requires  that  holders of any series or class shall vote as a series or"
"2023","class, Shareholders entitled to cast votes representing a majority of the voting"
"2024","power of the outstanding Shares of that series or class entitled to vote present"
"2025","in person or by proxy, may  adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum"
"2026","shall be present. Only Shareholders  of  record shall be entitled to vote on any"
"2027","matter."
"2028","      SECTION 6. INSPECTION OF RECORDS. The  records  of the Trust shall be open"
"2029","to inspection by Shareholders to the same extent as is permitted shareholders of"
"2030","a StateplaceMassachusetts business corporation."
"2031","      SECTION  7.  ACTION  WITHOUT MEETING. Any action which  may  be  taken  by"
"2032","Shareholders may be taken without  a  meeting  if  Shareholders  holding  Shares"
"2033","representing  a  majority of the voting power of the Shares entitled to vote  on"
"2034","the matter (or such  larger  proportion thereof as shall be required by law, the"
"2035","Declaration or these By-Laws for  approval of such matter) consent to the action"
"2036","in writing and the written consents  are  filed with the records of the meetings"
"2037","of Shareholders. Such consent shall be treated  for all purposes as a vote taken"
"2038","at a meeting of Shareholders."
"2039","                                   ARTICLE IV"
"2040","                                    TRUSTEES"
"2041","      SECTION 1. MEETINGS OF THE TRUSTEES. The Trustees  may in their discretion"
"2042","provide  for regular or stated meetings of the Trustees. Notice  of  regular  or"
"2043","stated meetings  need  not be given. Meetings of the Trustees other than regular"
"2044","or stated meetings shall be held whenever called by the Chair of the Trustees or"
"2045","by any one of the Trustees  at  the time being in office. Notice of the time and"
"2046","place of each meeting other than  regular  or  stated meetings shall be given by"
"2047","the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the  Clerk  or an Assistant Clerk or"
"2048","by the officer, Chair of the Trustees or other Trustee calling  the  meeting and"
"2049","shall be mailed to each Trustee at least two days before the meeting,  or  shall"
"2050","be  telegraphed,  cabled, or wirelessed or sent by facsimile or other electronic"
"2051","means to each Trustee  at his usual or last known business or residence address,"
"2052","or personally delivered  to him at least one day before the meeting. Such notice"
"2053","may, however, be waived by any Trustee. Notice of a meeting need not be given to"
"2054","any Trustee if a written waiver  of  notice, executed by him before or after the"
"2055","meeting, is filed with the records of the meeting, or to any Trustee who attends"
"2056","the meeting without protesting prior thereto  or at its commencement the lack of"
"2057","notice to him. A notice or waiver of notice need  not specify the purpose of any"
"2058","meeting. Except as provided by law the Trustees may meet by means of a telephone"
"2059","conference circuit or similar communications equipment  by  means  of  which all"
"2060","persons  participating  in  the  meeting  can  hear  each other, which telephone"
"2061","conference meeting shall be deemed to have been held at  a  place  designated by"

"2375","Section  1 of this Article XII, at any time or from time to time to declare  and"

"2388","express his election before a given time shall be deemed to have elected to take"
"2389","Shares rather than cash, or to take cash rather then Shares,  or  to take Shares"
"2390","with cash adjustment of fractions."
"2391","      The  Trustees,  in  their sole discretion, may cause the Trust to  require"
"2392","that all distributions payable to a shareholder in amounts less than such amount"

"2394","additional  shares  of  the Trust rather than paid in cash, unless a shareholder"

"2396","shares  in  accordance  with  the  preceding  phrase,  elects  to  receive  such"
"2397","distributions in cash. Where a shareholder  has elected to receive distributions"
"2398","in cash and the postal or other delivery service  is unable to deliver checks to"
