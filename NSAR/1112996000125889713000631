"3703","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"3704","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM Counselor Series Trust"
"3705","(Invesco Counselor Series Trust):"
"3706","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Invesco"
"3707","American Franchise Fund, Invesco Pennsylvania Tax Free Income Fund, Invesco"
"3708","California Tax-Free Income Fund, Invesco Growth and Income Fund, Invesco Low"
"3709","Volatility Equity Yield Fund (formerly known as Invesco U.S. Quantitative Core"
"3710","Fund), Invesco Equally-Weighted S&P 500 Fund, Invesco S&P 500 Index Fund,"
"3711","Invesco Global Real Estate Income Fund, Invesco Equity and Income Fund and"
"3712","Invesco Core Plus Bond Fund (hereafter referred to as the Funds) as of and"
"3713","for the year ended August 31, 2013 in accordance with the standards of the"
"3714","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"3715","Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"3716","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"3717","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"3718","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"3719","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3720","reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"3721","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"3722","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"3723","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"3724","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"3725","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"3726","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"3727","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"3728","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"3729","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"3730","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"3731","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"3732","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"3733","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"3734","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"3735","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"3736","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"3737","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"3738","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"3739","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3740","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"3741","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"3742","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"3743","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"3744","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3745","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"3746","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"

"3771","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"3772","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM Counselor Series Trust"
"3773","(Invesco Counselor Series Trust):"
"3774","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Invesco"
"3775","Small Cap Discovery Fund and Invesco Floating Rate Fund (hereafter referred to"
"3776","as the Funds) as of and for the year ended August 31, 2013 in accordance with"
"3777","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"3778","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including"
"3779","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"3780","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"3781","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"3782","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"3783","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"3784","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"3785","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"3786","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"3787","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"3788","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"3789","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"3790","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"3791","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"3792","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"3793","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"3794","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"3795","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"3796","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"3797","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"3798","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"3799","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"3800","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"3801","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"3802","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3803","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"3804","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"3805","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"3806","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"3807","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3808","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"3809","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"3810","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3811","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"3812","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"3813","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"3814","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"3815","on a timely basis."
"3816","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"3817","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3818","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"3819","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"

"3845","          AIM COUNSELOR SERIES TRUST (INVESCO CONSELOR SERIES TRUST)"
"3846","On September 24, 2012, AIM Counselor Series Trust (Invesco Counselor Series"
"3847","Trust) (the Trust) commenced operations of Class R6 shares for the Invesco"
"3848","American Franchise Fund, Invesco Core Plus Bond Fund, Invesco Equally-Weighted"
"3849","S&P 500 Fund, Invesco Equity and Income Fund, Invesco Floating Rate Fund,"
"3850","Invesco Global Real Estate Income Fund, Invesco Growth and Income Fund, and"
"3851","Invesco Small Cap Discovery Fund (the Funds). Class R6 shares are sold at net"
"3852","asset value, and are not subject to an initial sales charge or to a CDSC."
"3853","Shares of beneficial interest of the Trust are redeemable at their net asset"
"3854","value at the option of the shareholder or at the option of the Trust in certain"
"3855","circumstances, subject in certain circumstances to a contingent deferred sales"
"3856","charge. Each share of a Fund generally has the same voting, dividend,"
"3857","liquidation and other rights; however, each class of shares of a Fund is"
"3858","subject to different sales loads, conversion features, exchange privileges and"
"3859","class-specific expenses. Only shareholders of a specific class may vote on"
"3860","matters relating to that class's distribution plan. Shareholders of each Fund"
"3861","are entitled to one vote per share (with proportionate voting for fractional"
"3862","shares), irrespective of the relative net asset value of the shares of a Fund."
"3863","However, on matters affecting an individual Fund or class of shares, a separate"
"3864","vote of shareholders of that Fund or class is required. Shareholders of a Fund"
"3865","or class are not entitled to vote on any matter which does not affect that Fund"
"3866","or class but that requires a separate vote of another Fund or class. An example"
"3867","of a matter that would be voted on separately by shareholders of each Fund is"
"3868","the approval of the advisory agreement with Invesco Advisers, Inc. (the"
"3869","Adviser or Invesco). When issued, shares of each Fund are fully paid and"
"3870","nonassessable, have no preemptive or subscription rights, and are freely"
"3871","transferable. Class R6 shares do not have cumulative voting rights, which means"
"3872","that in situations in which shareholders elect trustees, holders of more than"
"3873","50% of the shares voting for the election of trustees can elect all of the"
"3874","trustees of the Trust, and the holders of fewer than 50% of the shares voting"
"3875","for the election of trustees will not be able to elect any trustees. Upon any"
"3876","liquidation of the Trust, shareholders of each class are entitled to share pro"
"3877","rata in the net assets belonging to the applicable Fund allocable to such class"
"3878","available for distribution after satisfaction of outstanding liabilities of the"
"3879","Fund allocable to such class."
"3880","Under Delaware law, shareholders of a Delaware statutory trust shall be"
"3881","entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to shareholders"
"3882","of private for-profit corporations organized under Delaware law. There is a"
"3883","remote possibility, however, that shareholders could, under certain"
"3884","circumstances, be held liable for the obligations of the Trust to the extent"
"3885","the courts of another state, which does not recognize such limited liability,"
"3886","were to apply the laws of such state to a controversy involving such"
"3887","obligations. The Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the Trust Agreement)"
"3888","disclaims shareholder liability for acts or obligations of the Trust and"
"3889","requires that notice of such disclaimer be given in each agreement, obligation"
"3890","or instrument entered into or executed by the Trust or the trustees to all"
"3891","parties. The Trust Agreement provides for indemnification out of the property"
"3892","of a Fund for all losses and expenses of any shareholder of such Fund held"
"3893","liable on account of being or having been a shareholder. Thus, the risk of a"
"3894","shareholder incurring financial loss due to shareholder liability is limited to"
"3895","circumstances in which a Fund is unable to meet its obligations and the"
"3896","complaining party is not held to be bound by the disclaimer."

"3927","total value of shares of the corresponding class of the Target Fund that"
"3928","shareholders held immediately prior to the Reorganization. No sales charges"
"3929","were imposed in connection with the Reorganization. Shareholders of the Target"

"4449","Expiration Date) that Invesco will waive its fees or reimburse expenses to"
"4450","the extent that expenses of a class of a Fund (excluding (i) interest;"
"4451","(ii) taxes; (iii) dividend expense on short sales; (iv) extraordinary or"
"4452","non-routine items, including litigation expenses; and (v) expenses that each"
"4453","Fund has incurred but did not actually pay because of an expense offset"
"4454","arrangement, if applicable) exceed the rate, on an annualized basis, set forth"
"4455","on the Exhibits of the average daily net assets allocable to such class."
"4456","Acquired fund fees and expenses are not fees or expenses incurred by a fund"
"4457","directly but are expenses of the investment companies in which a fund invests."
"4458","These fees and expenses are incurred indirectly through the valuation of a"
"4459","fund's investment in these investment companies. Acquired fund fees and"
"4460","expenses are required to be disclosed and included in the total annual fund"
"4461","operating expenses in the prospectus fee table. As a result, the net total"
"4462","annual fund operating expenses shown in the prospectus fee table may exceed the"
"4463","expense limits reflected in Exhibits A - D. With regard to the Contractual"
"4464","Limits, the Board of Trustees of the Trust and Invesco may terminate or modify"
"4465","this Memorandum of Agreement prior to the Expiration Date only by mutual"
"4466","written consent. Invesco will not have any right to reimbursement of any amount"
"4467","so waived or reimbursed."
"4468","   For the Contractual Limits, Invesco agrees to review the then-current"
"4469","expense limitations for each class of each Fund listed on the Exhibits on a"
"4470","date prior to the Expiration Date to determine whether such limitations should"
"4471","be amended, continued or terminated. The expense limitations will expire upon"
"4472","the Expiration Date unless the Trusts and Invesco have agreed to continue them."
"4473","The Exhibits will be amended to reflect any such agreement."
"4474","   For the Voluntary Limits (listed in Exhibits A - D), Invesco agrees that"
"4475","these are not contractual in nature and that Invesco may establish, amend"
"4476","and/or terminate such expense limitations at any time in its sole discretion"
"4477","after consultation with the Funds' Boards of Trustees. Any delay or failure by"
"4478","Invesco to update this Memorandum of Agreement with regards to the"
"4479","terminations, extensions, or expirations of the Voluntary Limits shall have no"

"4483","not be binding upon any of the Trustees, shareholders, nominees, officers,"

"5860","1. DESCRIPTION OF THE REORGANIZATIONS"
"5861","   1.1. It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Reorganization"
"5862","described herein shall be conducted separately from the others, and a party"
"5863","that is not a party to a Reorganization shall incur no obligations, duties or"
"5864","liabilities with respect to such Reorganization by reason of being a party to"
"5865","this Agreement. If any one or more Reorganizations should fail to be"
"5866","consummated, such failure shall not affect the other Reorganizations in any way."
"5867","   1.2. Provided that all conditions precedent to a Reorganization set forth"
"5868","herein have been satisfied as of the Closing Date (as defined in Section 3.1),"
"5869","and based on the representations and warranties each party provides to the"
"5870","others, each Target Entity and its corresponding Acquiring Entity agree to take"
"5871","the following steps with respect to their Reorganization(s), the parties to"
"5872","which and classes of shares to be issued in connection with which are set forth"
"5873","in Exhibit A:"
"5874","<PAGE>"
"5875","      (a) The Target Fund shall transfer all of its Assets, as defined and set"
"5876","   forth in Section 1.2(b), to the Acquiring Fund, and the Acquiring Fund in"
"5877","   exchange therefor shall assume the Liabilities, as defined and set forth in"
"5878","   Section 1.2(c), and deliver to the Target Fund the number of full and"
"5879","   fractional Acquiring Fund shares determined in the manner set forth in"
"5880","   Section 2."
"5881","      (b) The assets of the Target Fund to be transferred to the Acquiring Fund"
"5882","   shall consist of all assets, property, and goodwill including, without"
"5883","   limitation, all cash, securities, commodities and futures interests, claims"
"5884","   (whether absolute or contingent, known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued and"
"5885","   including, without limitation, any interest in pending or future legal"
"5886","   claims in connection with past or present portfolio holdings, whether in the"
"5887","   form of class action claims, opt-out or other direct litigation claims, or"
"5888","   regulator or government-established investor recovery fund claims, and any"
"5889","   and all resulting recoveries) and dividends or interest receivable that are"
"5890","   owned by the Target Fund and any deferred or prepaid expenses shown as an"
"5891","   asset on the books of the Target Fund on the Closing Date, except for cash,"
"5892","   bank deposits or cash equivalent securities in an amount necessary to pay"
"5893","   the estimated costs of extinguishing any Excluded Liabilities (as defined in"
"5894","   Section 1.2(c)) and cash in an amount necessary to pay any distributions"
"5895","   pursuant to Section 7.1(f) (collectively, with respect to each Target Fund"
"5896","   separately, Assets)."
"5897","      (c) The Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the liabilities of the Target"
"5898","   Fund, whether accrued or contingent, known or unknown, existing at the"
"5899","   Closing Date, except for the Target Fund's Excluded Liabilities (as defined"
"5900","   below), if any, pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, with respect to"
"5901","   each Target Fund separately, Liabilities). If prior to the Closing Date"
"5902","   the Acquiring Entity identifies a liability that the Acquiring Entity and"
"5903","   the Target Entity mutually agree should not be assumed by the Acquiring"
"5904","   Fund, such liability shall be excluded from the definition of Liabilities"
"5905","   hereunder and shall be listed on a Schedule of Excluded Liabilities to be"
"5906","   signed by the Acquiring Entity and the Target Entity at Closing and attached"
"5907","   to this Agreement as Schedule 1.2(c) (the Excluded Liabilities). The"
"5908","   Assets minus the Liabilities of a Target Fund shall be referred to herein as"
"5909","   the Target Fund's Net Assets."
"5910","      (d) As soon as is reasonably practicable after the Closing, the Target"
"5911","   Fund will distribute to its shareholders of record (Target Fund
   Shareholders) the shares of the Acquiring Fund of the corresponding class"
"5912","   received by the Target Fund pursuant to Section 1.2(a), as set forth in"
"5913","   Exhibit A, on a pro rata basis within that class, and the Target Fund will"
"5914","   as promptly as practicable completely liquidate and dissolve. Such"
"5915","   distribution and liquidation will be accomplished, with respect to each"
"5916","   class of the Target Fund's shares, by the transfer of the Acquiring Fund"
"5917","   shares of the corresponding class then credited to the account of the Target"
"5918","   Fund on the books of the Acquiring Fund to open accounts on the share"
"5919","   records of the Acquiring Fund in the names of the Target Fund Shareholders"
"5920","   of the class. The aggregate net asset value of the Acquiring Fund shares to"
"5921","   be so credited to the corresponding Target Fund Shareholders shall be equal"
"5922","   to the aggregate net asset value of the corresponding Target Fund's shares"
"5923","   owned by the Target Fund Shareholders on the Valuation Date. At the Closing,"
"5924","   any outstanding certificates representing shares of a Target Fund will be"
"5925","   cancelled. The Acquiring Fund"
"5926","<PAGE>"
"5927","   shall not issue certificates representing shares in connection with such"
"5928","   exchange, irrespective of whether Target Fund shareholders hold their Target"
"5929","   Fund shares in certificated form."
"5930","      (e) Ownership of Acquiring Fund shares will be shown on its books, as"
"5931","   such are maintained by the Acquiring Fund's transfer agent."
"5932","2. VALUATION"
"5933","   2.1. With respect to each Reorganization:"
"5934","      (a) The value of the Target Fund's Assets shall be the value of such"
"5935","   Assets computed as of immediately after the close of regular trading on the"
"5936","   New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which shall reflect the declaration of any"
"5937","   dividends, on the business day next preceding the Closing Date (the"
"5938","   Valuation Date), using the Target Fund's valuation procedures established"
"5939","   by the Target Entity's Board of Trustees."
"5940","      (b) The net asset value per share of each class of the Acquiring Fund"
"5941","   shares issued in connection with the Reorganization shall be the net asset"
"5942","   value per share of the corresponding class of each class computed on the"
"5943","   Valuation Date using the Acquiring Fund's valuation procedures established"
"5944","   by the Acquiring Entity's Board of Trustees, which are the same as the"
"5945","   Target Fund's valuation procedures."
"5946","      (c) The number of shares issued of each class of the Acquiring Fund"
"5947","   (including fractional shares, if any, rounded to the nearest thousandth) in"
"5948","   exchange for the Target Fund's Net Assets shall be determined by dividing"
"5949","   the value of the Net Assets of the Target Fund attributable to each class of"
"5950","   Target Fund shares by the net asset value per share of the corresponding"
"5951","   share class of the Acquiring Fund."
"5952","      (d) All computations of value shall be made by the Target Fund's and the"
"5953","   Acquiring Fund's designated recordkeeping agent using the valuation"
"5954","   procedures described in this Section 2."
"5955","3. CLOSING AND CLOSING DATE"
"5956","   3.1. Each Reorganization shall close on the date identified on Exhibit A or"
"5957","such other date as the parties may agree with respect to any or all"
"5958","Reorganizations (the Closing Date). All acts taking place at the closing of a"
"5959","Reorganization (the Closing) shall be deemed to take place simultaneously as"
"5960","of immediately prior to the opening of regular trading on the NYSE on the"
"5961","Closing Date of that Reorganization unless otherwise agreed to by the parties"
"5962","(the Closing Time)."

"5969","<PAGE>"
"5970","   condition as to constitute good delivery thereof. The Target Fund shall"
"5971","   direct the Target Fund's custodian (the Target Custodian) to deliver to"

"5977","   The cash to be transferred by a Target Fund shall be delivered to the"
"5978","   Acquiring Fund's Custodian by wire transfer of federal funds or other"

"5980","      (b) The Target Entity shall direct the Target Custodian for each Target"
"5981","   Fund to deliver, at the Closing or promptly thereafter, a certificate of an"
"5982","   authorized officer stating that except as permitted by Section 3.2(a), the"
"5983","   Assets have been delivered in proper form to the Acquiring Fund no later"
"5984","   than the Closing Time on the Closing Date. The Acquiring Entity shall be"
"5985","   responsible for paying all necessary taxes in connection with the delivery"

"5987","   transfer stamps, if any, and shall deliver, at the Closing or promptly"
"5988","   thereafter, a certificate of an authorized officer or the Acquiring Entity"
"5989","   stating that all such taxes have been paid or provision for payment has been"
"5990","   made."
"5991","      (c) At such time prior to the Closing Date as the parties mutually agree,"

"6001","   as the Acquiring Fund may reasonably request. The Acquiring Fund and its"
"6002","   transfer agent shall have no obligation to inquire as to the validity,"
"6003","   propriety or correctness of any such instruction, information or"
"6004","   documentation, but shall, in each case, assume that such instruction,"
"6005","   information or documentation is valid, proper, correct and complete."
"6006","      (d) The Target Entity shall direct each applicable transfer agent for a"
"6007","   Target Fund (the Target Transfer Agent) to deliver to the Acquiring Fund"
"6008","   at the Closing a certificate of an authorized officer stating that its"
"6009","   records, as provided to the Acquiring Entity, contain the names and"
"6010","   addresses of the Target Fund Shareholders and the number of outstanding"
"6011","   shares of each class owned by each such shareholder immediately prior to the"
"6012","   Closing. The Acquiring Fund shall issue and deliver to the Secretary of the"
"6013","   Target Fund a confirmation evidencing the Acquiring Fund shares to be"

"6020","<PAGE>"
"6021","      (e) In the event that on the Valuation Date or the Closing Date (a) the"
"6022","   NYSE or another primary trading market for portfolio securities of the"
"6023","   Target Fund (each, an Exchange) shall be closed to trading or trading"
"6024","   thereupon shall be restricted, or (b) trading or the reporting of trading on"
"6025","   such Exchange or elsewhere shall be disrupted so that, in the judgment of"
"6026","   the Board of Trustees of the Acquiring Entity or the Target Entity or the"

"6095","   disclosed therein;"
"6096","      (h) Since the last day of the Target Fund's most recently completed"
"6097","   fiscal year, there has not been any material adverse change in the Target"
"6098","   Fund's financial condition, assets, liabilities or business, other than"
"6099","   changes occurring in the ordinary course of business;"
"6100","      (i) On the Closing Date, all material Returns (as defined below) of the"
"6101","   Target Fund required by law to have been filed by such date (including any"
"6102","   extensions) shall have been filed and are or will be true, correct and"
"6103","   complete in all material respects, and all Taxes (as defined below) shown as"
"6104","   due or claimed to be due by any government entity shall have been paid or"

"6117","   like assessment or charge of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited"
"6118","   to, withholding on amounts paid to or by any person), together with any"
"6119","   interest, penalty, addition to tax or additional amount imposed by any"
"6120","   governmental authority (domestic or foreign) responsible for the imposition"
"6121","   of any such tax. Return means reports, returns, information returns,"
"6122","   elections, agreements, declarations, or other documents of any nature or"
"6123","   kind (including any attached schedules, supplements and additional or"
"6124","   supporting material) filed or required to be filed with respect to Taxes,"

"6127","      (j) The Target Fund has elected to be a regulated investment company"
"6128","   under Subchapter M of the Code and is a fund that is treated as a separate"
"6129","   corporation under Section 851(g) of the Code. The Target Fund has qualified"
"6130","   for treatment as a regulated investment company for each taxable year since"
"6131","   inception that has ended prior to the Closing Date and will have satisfied"
"6132","   the requirements of Part I of Subchapter M of the Code to maintain such"
"6133","   qualification for the period beginning on the first day of its current"
"6134","   taxable year and ending on the Closing Date. The Target Fund has no earnings"
"6135","   or profits accumulated in any taxable year in which the provisions of"
"6136","   Subchapter M of the Code did not apply to it. If Target Fund serves as a"
"6137","   funding vehicle for variable contracts (life insurance or annuity), Target"
"6138","   Fund, with respect to each of its taxable years that has ended prior to the"
"6139","   Closing Date during which it has served as such a funding vehicle, has"
"6140","   satisfied the diversification requirements of Section 817(h) of the Code and"
"6141","   will continue to satisfy the requirements of Section 817(h) of the Code for"
"6142","   the period beginning on the first day of its current taxable year and ending"
"6143","   on the Closing Date. In order to (i) ensure continued qualification of the"
"6144","   Target Fund for treatment as a regulated investment company for tax"
"6145","   purposes and (ii) eliminate any tax liability of the Target Fund arising by"
"6146","   reason of undistributed investment company taxable income or net capital"
"6147","   gain, the Target Fund, before the Closing Date will declare on or prior to"
"6148","   the Valuation Date to the shareholders of Target Fund a dividend or"
"6149","   dividends that, together with all previous such dividends, shall have the"
"6150","   effect of distributing (i) substantially all of its investment company"
"6151","   taxable income (determined without regard to any deductions for dividends"
"6152","   paid) and substantially all of its net capital gains (after reduction for"
"6153","   any capital loss carryover), if any, for the period from the close of its"
"6154","   last fiscal year to the Closing Time on the Closing Date; (ii) all of its"
"6155","   investment company taxable income and net capital gains for its taxable year"
"6156","   ended prior to the Closing Date to the extent not otherwise already"
"6157","   distributed; and (iii) at least 90 percent of the excess, if any, of the"
"6158","   Target Fund's interest income excludible from gross income under"
"6159","   Section 103(a) of the Code over its deductions disallowed under Sections 265"
"6160","   and 171(a)(2) of the Code for its taxable year ended prior to the Closing"
"6161","   Date and at least 90 percent of such net tax-exempt income for the period"
"6162","   from the close of its last fiscal year to the Closing Time on the Closing"
"6163","   Date;"
"6164","      (k) All issued and outstanding shares of the Target Fund are, and on the"
"6165","   Closing Date will be, duly and validly issued and outstanding, fully paid"
"6166","   and non-assessable by the Target Entity and, in every state where offered or"
"6167","   sold, such offers and sales have been in compliance in all material respects"
"6168","   with applicable registration and/or notice requirements of the 1933 Act and"
"6169","   state and District of Columbia securities laws;"
