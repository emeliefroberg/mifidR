"833","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"834","To the Shareholders and"
"835","Board of Trustees of"
"836","Federated Total Return Series, Inc"
"837","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"838","financial statements of Federated Mortgage Fund"
"839","and Federated Ultrashort Bond Fund, each a portfolio"
"840","of Federated Total Return Series, Inc"
"841","(collectively, the Funds) as of and for the year ended"
"842","September 30, 2011, in accordance with the"
"843","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"844","Board (United States), we considered the"
"845","Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"846","including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"847","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"848","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"849","financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"850","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"851","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"852","Funds' internal control over financial"
"853","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"854","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"855","and maintaining effective internal"
"856","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"857","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"858","management are required to assess the expected benefits"
"859","and related costs of controls. A"
"860","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"861","is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"862","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"863","and the preparation of financial"
"864","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"865","generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"866","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"867","includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"868","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"869","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"870","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"871","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"872","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"873","preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"874","with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"875","receipts and expenditures of the company"
"876","are being made in accordance with authorizations of"
"877","management and directors of the company;"
"878","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"879","or timely detection of the unauthorized"
"880","acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets"
"881","that could have a material effect on the"
"882","financial statements."
"883","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"884","over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"885","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"886","of effectiveness to future periods are"
"887","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"888","because of changes in conditions, or that"
"889","the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"890","procedures may deteriorate."
"891","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"892","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"893","control does not allow management or employees,"
"894","in the normal course of performing their"
"895","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"896","on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"897","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"898","internal control over financial reporting, such that"
"899","there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"900","misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim"
"901","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"902","detected on a timely basis."
"903","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control"
"904","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"905","purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"906","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"907","internal control that might be material weaknesses"
"908","under standards established by the Public"
"909","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"910","However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"911","Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"912","and its operation, including controls over"
"913","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"914","material weakness as defined above as of"
"915","September 30, 2011."
"916","This report is intended solely for the information"
"917","and use of management and the Board of"
"918","Trustees of Federated Total Return Series, Inc and"
"919","the Securities and Exchange Commission and"
"920","is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"921","anyone other than those specified parties."
