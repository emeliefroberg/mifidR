"16217","of a Basic Fee and a Performance Adjustment.  Except as otherwise provided in sub-paragraph (e) of this paragraph 3, the Performance Adjustment is added to or subtracted from the Basic Fee depending on whether the Portfolio experienced better or worse performance than an appropriate index (the &quot;Index&quot;).  The Performance Adjustment is not cumulative.  An increased fee will result even"
"16218","though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been behind that of the"
"16219","Index, and, conversely, a reduction in the fee will be made for a month even though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been ahead of that of the Index.  The Basic Fee and the Performance Adjustment"

"16229","with Fidelity SelectCo, LLC are included.  The Group Fee Rate shall be determined on a cumulative basis pursuant to the following"

"17013","paragraph 3, the Performance Adjustment is added to or subtracted from the Basic Fee depending on whether the Portfolio"
"17014","experienced better or worse performance than an appropriate index (the &quot;Index&quot;).  The Performance Adjustment is not cumulative.  An increased fee will result even though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the"
"17015","performance period has been behind that of the Index, and, conversely, a reduction in the fee will be made for a month even"
"17016","though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been ahead of that"
"17017","of the Index.  The Basic Fee and the Performance Adjustment will be computed as follows:"

"17026","Service or Management Contracts with Fidelity SelectCo, LLC are included.  The Group Fee Rate shall be determined on a"

"18504","are &quot;interested persons&quot; of the Fund or of the Adviser and of all personnel of the Fund or the Adviser performing services"
"18505","relating to research, statistical and investment activities.  The Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with the Portfolio, to buy, sell, lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment"
"18506","instruments on behalf of the Portfolio.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times"
"18507","be subject to the control and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."

"18509","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(b)	Management Services.  The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for the performance by its affiliates of) the"

The Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees, perform various services for the Portfolio, including but not limited to: (i) providing the Portfolio with office space, equipment and facilities (which may be its own) for maintaining its organization; (ii) on behalf of the"

"18521","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(c)	The Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's account with brokers or dealers selected by the Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the Adviser.  The"
"18522","Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Portfolio and"
"18523","at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to"

"18525","those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts"
"18526","over which the Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer"

"18529","Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"18530","research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular"
"18531","transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they"
"18532","exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to"

"18538","the Adviser as directors, officers or otherwise and that directors, officers and stockholders of the Adviser are or may be or"
"18539","become similarly interested in the Fund, and that the Adviser may be or become interested in the Fund as a shareholder or"
"18540","otherwise."
"18541","</P>"
"18542","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	3.	The Adviser will be compensated on the following basis for the services and facilities to be furnished hereunder.  The Adviser shall receive a monthly management fee, payable monthly as soon as practicable after the last day of each"
"18543","month, composed of a Basic Fee and a Performance Adjustment.  Except as otherwise provided in sub-paragraph (e) of this"
"18544","paragraph 3, the Performance Adjustment is added to or subtracted from the Basic Fee depending on whether the Portfolio"
"18545","experienced better or worse performance than an appropriate index (the &quot;Index&quot;).  The Performance Adjustment is not cumulative.  An increased fee will result even though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the"
"18546","performance period has been behind that of the Index, and, conversely, a reduction in the fee will be made for a month even"
"18547","though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been ahead of that"
"18548","of the Index.  The Basic Fee and the Performance Adjustment will be computed as follows:"
"18549","</P>"
"18550","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(a)	Basic Fee Rate:  The annual Basic Fee Rate shall be the sum of the Group Fee Rate and the Individual Fund"
"18551","Fee Rate calculated to the nearest millionth decimal place as follows:"
"18552","</P>"
"18553","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(i) Group Fee Rate.  The Group Fee Rate shall be based upon the monthly average of the net assets of the"
"18554","registered investment companies having Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser (computed in the"
"18555","manner set forth in the fund's Declaration of Trust or other organizational document) determined as of the close of business"
"18556","on each business day throughout the month.  For this purpose, the monthly average net assets of registered investment companies that previously had Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser and currently have Advisory and"
"18557","Service or Management Contracts with Fidelity SelectCo, LLC are included.  The Group Fee Rate shall be determined on a"
"18558","cumulative basis pursuant to the following schedule:"

"19290","instruments on behalf of the Portfolio.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times"
"19291","be subject to the control and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."

"19293","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(b)	Management Services.  The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for the performance by its affiliates of) the"

The Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees, perform various services for the Portfolio, including but not limited to: (i) providing the Portfolio with office space, equipment and facilities (which may be its own) for maintaining its organization; (ii) on behalf of the"

"19305","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(c)	The Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's account with brokers or dealers selected by the Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the Adviser.  The"
"19306","Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Portfolio and"
"19307","at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to"

"19309","those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts"
"19310","over which the Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer"

"19315","transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they"
"19316","exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to"

"19327","month, composed of a Basic Fee and a Performance Adjustment.  Except as otherwise provided in sub-paragraph (e) of this"
"19328","paragraph 3, the Performance Adjustment is added to or subtracted from the Basic Fee depending on whether the Portfolio"
"19329","experienced better or worse performance than an appropriate index (the &quot;Index&quot;).  The Performance Adjustment is not cumulative.  An increased fee will result even though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the"
"19330","performance period has been behind that of the Index, and, conversely, a reduction in the fee will be made for a month even"
"19331","though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been ahead of that"
"19332","of the Index.  The Basic Fee and the Performance Adjustment will be computed as follows:"
"19333","</P>"
"19334","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(a)	Basic Fee Rate:  The annual Basic Fee Rate shall be the sum of the Group Fee Rate and the Individual Fund"
"19335","Fee Rate calculated to the nearest millionth decimal place as follows:"
"19336","</P>"
"19337","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(i) Group Fee Rate.  The Group Fee Rate shall be based upon the monthly average of the net assets of the"
"19338","registered investment companies having Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser (computed in the"
"19339","manner set forth in the fund's Declaration of Trust or other organizational document) determined as of the close of business"
"19340","on each business day throughout the month.  For this purpose, the monthly average net assets of registered investment companies that previously had Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser and currently have Advisory and"
"19341","Service or Management Contracts with Fidelity SelectCo, LLC are included.  The Group Fee Rate shall be determined on a"
"19342","cumulative basis pursuant to the following schedule:"

"20088","relating to research, statistical and investment activities.  The Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with the Portfolio, to buy, sell, lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment"
"20089","instruments on behalf of the Portfolio.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times"
"20090","be subject to the control and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."

"20092","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(b)	Management Services.  The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for the performance by its affiliates of) the"

"20104","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(c)	The Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's account with brokers or dealers selected by the Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the Adviser.  The"
"20105","Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Portfolio and"
"20106","at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to"

"20108","those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts"
"20109","over which the Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer"

"20112","Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"20113","research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular"
"20114","transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they"
"20115","exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to"

"20126","Adviser shall receive a monthly management fee, payable monthly as soon as practicable after the last day of each month, composed"
"20127","of a Basic Fee and a Performance Adjustment.  Except as otherwise provided in sub-paragraph (e) of this paragraph 3, the Performance Adjustment is added to or subtracted from the Basic Fee depending on whether the Portfolio experienced better or worse performance than an appropriate index (the &quot;Index&quot;).  The Performance Adjustment is not cumulative.  An increased fee will result even"
"20128","though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been behind that of the"
"20129","Index, and, conversely, a reduction in the fee will be made for a month even though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been ahead of that of the Index.  The Basic Fee and the Performance Adjustment"
"20130","will be computed as follows:"
"20131","</P>"
"20132","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(a)	Basic Fee Rate:  The annual Basic Fee Rate shall be the sum of the Group Fee Rate and the Individual Fund Fee Rate"
"20133","calculated to the nearest millionth decimal place as follows:"
"20134","</P>"
"20135","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(i) Group Fee Rate.  The Group Fee Rate shall be based upon the monthly average of the net assets of the registered"
"20136","investment companies having Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser (computed in the manner set forth in"
"20137","the fund's Declaration of Trust or other organizational document) determined as of the close of business on each business day"
"20138","throughout the month.  For this purpose, the monthly average net assets of registered investment companies that previously had Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser and currently have Advisory and Service or Management Contracts"
"20139","with Fidelity SelectCo, LLC are included.  The Group Fee Rate shall be determined on a cumulative basis pursuant to the following"

"21115","Advisor Series Stock Selector Large Cap Value Fund as of and for the year ended January 31, 2014, in accordance"
"21116","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust's"

"21127","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"21128","company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"21129","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"21130","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"

"21142","allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
