"2022","things necessary or incidental to the furtherance or conduct of such purchases,"
"2023","sales or other transactions."

"2089","     SECTION 4. DELEGATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES. The Adviser may carry out any of"
"2090","its obligations under this Agreement by employing, subject to supervision by the"
"2091","Adviser, one or more Sub-Adviser(s) who are registered as investment advisers"
"2092","pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Sub-Advisers). Each"
"2093","Sub-Adviser's employment will be evidenced by a separate written agreement"
"2094","approved by the Board and, if required under the 1940 Act, by the shareholders"
"2095","of the Fund (unless the Commission or its staff has given authorization or"
"2096","issued an interpretation dispensing with the requirement of shareholder"
"2097","approval). The Adviser shall not be liable hereunder for any act or omission of"
"2098","any Sub-Adviser, except for failure to exercise good faith in the employment of"
"2099","the Sub-Adviser and for failure to exercise appropriate supervision of such"
"2100","Sub-Adviser, and as may otherwise be agreed in writing. The Adviser shall be"
"2101","solely responsible for compensating any Sub-Adviser for services rendered under"
"2102","any Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Adviser may, from time to time and at any time,"
"2103","terminate any Sub-Adviser and reassume the responsibilities assigned to such"
"2104","Sub-Adviser with respect to any Fund without obtaining the approval of the"
"2105","shareholders of the Fund."

"2108","     SECTION 5. CONTROL BY BOARD. Any investment activities undertaken by the"
"2109","Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any other activities undertaken"
"2110","by the Adviser on behalf of the Funds, shall at all times be subject to the"
"2111","direction and control of the Board."
"2112","     SECTION 6. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS. In carrying out its"
"2113","obligations under this Agreement, the Adviser shall at all times comply with:"
"2114","     (a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"2115","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"2116","     (b) the Registration Statement of the Trust, as it may be amended from time"
"2117","to time, filed with the Commission under the Securities Act and the 1940 Act;"
"2118","     (c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it may be"
"2119","amended from time to time;"
"2120","     (d) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,"
"2121","applicable to the Trust or the Funds, and any rules and regulations adopted"
"2122","thereunder; and"
"2123","     (e)any other applicable provisions of state or federal law, and any rules"
"2124","and regulations adopted thereunder."
"2125","     SECTION 7. PROXIES. The Adviser shall have responsibility to vote proxies"
"2126","solicited with respect to issuers of securities in which assets of the Funds are"
"2127","invested in accordance with the Trust's policies on proxy voting."
"2128","     SECTION 8. BROKER-DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. In connection with the purchase and"
"2129","sale of securities for the Funds, the Adviser is responsible for broker-dealer"
"2130","selection and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Adviser's primary"
"2131","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain the best"
"2132","price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular"
"2133","transaction for a Fund, the Adviser will consider among other things: the best"
"2134","net price available, the reliability, integrity and financial condition of the"
"2135","broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value"
"2136","of the expected contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing"
"2137","basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any transaction may be less"
"2138","favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the difference is"
"2139","reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio execution services"
"2140","offered. Subject to such policies as the Board may from time to time determine,"
"2141","the Adviser shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any"
"2142","duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a"
"2143","Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and research services to"
"2144","the Adviser an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"2145","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would"
"2146","have charged for effecting that transaction, if the Adviser determines in good"
"2147","faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of"
"2148","the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in"
"2149","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of"
"2150","the Adviser with respect to the Fund and to other clients of the"
"2151","                                       4"
"2152","<PAGE>"
"2153","Adviser. The Adviser is further authorized to allocate the orders placed by it"
"2154","on behalf of the Funds to brokers and dealers who also provide brokerage and"
"2155","research services within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange"
"2156","Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith. Such allocation shall be in such"
"2157","amounts and proportions as the Adviser shall determine and the Adviser will"
"2158","report on said allocations regularly to the Board, indicating the brokers to"
"2159","whom such allocations have been made and the basis therefore."
"2160","     SECTION 9. EXPENSES. All of the ordinary business expenses incurred in the"
"2161","operations of the Funds and the offering of their shares shall be borne by the"
"2162","Funds unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement. The expenses"
"2163","borne by the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage commissions,"

"2172","the Funds' shareholders."
"2173","     The Adviser shall pay its own expenses in connection with the services to"
"2174","be provided by it pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, the Adviser shall be"
"2175","responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the"
"2176","Trust: (a) to amend the Trust's registration statement or supplement the Fund's"
"2177","prospectus, and circulate the same, to reflect a change in the personnel of the"
"2178","Adviser responsible for making investment decisions in relation to a Fund; (b)"
"2179","to obtain shareholder approval of a new sub-advisory agreement as a result of a"

"2187","Agreement, the Trust shall pay the Adviser fees, payable monthly, at the annual"
"2188","rates indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such Schedule may be amended or"
"2189","supplemented from time to time;"
"2190","     (b) Except as provided in the following paragraph, no fee shall be payable"

"2193","management investment company, or separate series thereof, in accordance with"
"2194","Section 12(d)(1)(E) under the 1940 Act (a Master-Feeder Fund structure);"
"2195","     (c) The adviser shall receive a fee of 0.25% (0.35% in the case of the"
"2196","WealthBuilder Funds) for asset allocation services if a Fund invests some of its"
"2197","investment assets in two or more registered, open-end management investment"
"2198","companies, or separate series thereof, in each case, in accordance with Section"
"2199","12(d)(1)(G) under the Act, the rules thereunder or an exemptive order"

"2212","connected with, rendering services hereunder or for any losses that may be"
"2213","sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security."
"2214","     SECTION 12. NON-EXCLUSIVITY. The services of the Adviser to the Funds are"
"2215","not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Adviser shall be free to render"
"2216","investment advisory or other services to others (including other investment"
"2217","companies) and to engage in other activities. It is understood and agreed that"
"2218","officers or directors of the Adviser may serve as officers and directors of the"
"2219","Trust, and that officers or directors of the Trust may serve as officers or"
"2220","directors of the Adviser, to the extent that such services may be permitted by"
"2221","law, and that the officers and directors of the Adviser are not prohibited from"

"2336","performance of the Funds or any specific level of performance, the success of"

"2338","the Adviser's overall management of the Funds. The Trust understands that"
"2339","investment decisions made for the Funds by the Adviser are subject to various"
"2340","market, currency, economic and business risks, and that those investment"
"2341","decisions will not always be profitable. The Adviser will manage only the"

"2954","Target 2055 Fund (collectively the Funds), eleven of the funds"
"2955","comprising the Wells Fargo Funds Trust, for the period ended"
"2956","February 29, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"2957","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"2958","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"2959","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"2960","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"2961","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"2962","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"2963","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"2964","express no such opinion."
"2965","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"2966","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"2967","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"2968","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"2969","controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"2970","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"2971","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"2972","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"2973","accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over"
"2974","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"2975","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"2976","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"2977","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"2978","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"2979","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2980","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"2981","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"2982","and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"2983","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"2984","use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material"
"2985","effect on the financial statements."
"2986","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2987","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"2988","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"2989","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2990","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or"
"2991","procedures may deteriorate."
"2992","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"2993","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"2994","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"2995","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"2996","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"2997","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"2998","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim"
"2999","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3000","Our consideration of Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"3001","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"3002","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might"
"3003","be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"3004","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we"
"3005","noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3006","reporting and its operations, including controls over safeguarding"
"3007","securities that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above"
"3008","as of February 29, 2012."

"3010","management and the Board of Trustees of Wells Fargo Funds Trust"
