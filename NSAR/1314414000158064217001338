"513","Shareholders and Board"
"514","of Trustees"
"515","Northern Lights Fund"
"516","Trust"
"517","Hauppauge, NY 11788"
"518","In planning and performing"
"519","our audit of the financial"
"520","statements of Beech Hill"
"521","Total Return Fund (the"
"522","Fund), a series of"
"523","Northern Lights Fund Trust"
"524","as of and for the year ended"
"525","December 31, 2016, in"
"526","accordance with the"
"527","standards of the Public"
"528","Company Accounting"
"529","Oversight Board (United"
"530","States), we considered the"
"531","Fund's internal control"
"532","over financial reporting,"
"533","including controls over"
"534","safeguarding securities, as"
"535","a basis for designing our"
"536","auditing procedures for the"
"537","purpose of expressing our"
"538","opinion on the financial"
"539","statements and to comply"
"540","with the requirements of"
"541","Form N-SAR, but not for"
"542","the purpose of expressing"
"543","an opinion on the"
"544","effectiveness of the Fund's"
"545","internal control over"
"546","financial reporting."
"547","Accordingly, we express"
"548","no such opinion."
"549","The management of the"
"550","Fund is responsible for"
"551","establishing and"
"552","maintaining effective"
"553","internal control over"
"554","financial reporting.   In"
"555","fulfilling this"
"556","responsibility, estimates"
"557","and judgments by"
"558","management are required"
"559","to assess the expected"
"560","benefits and related costs"
"561","of controls.   A company's"
"562","internal control over"
"563","financial reporting is a"
"564","process designed to"
"565","provide reasonable"
"566","assurance regarding the"
"567","reliability of financial"
"568","reporting and the"
"569","preparation of financial"
"570","statements for external"
"571","purposes in accordance"
"572","with generally accepted"
"573","accounting principles.   A"
"574","company's internal control"
"575","over financial reporting"
"576","includes those policies and"
"577","procedures that (1) pertain"
"578","to the maintenance of"
"579","records that, in reasonable"
"580","detail, accurately and fairly"
"581","reflect the transactions and"
"582","dispositions of the assets of"
"583","the company; (2) provide"
"584","reasonable assurance that"
"585","transactions are recorded as"
"586","necessary to permit"
"587","preparation of financial"
"588","statements in accordance"
"589","with generally accepted"
"590","accounting principles, and"
"591","that receipts and"
"592","expenditures of the"
"593","company are being made"
"594","only in accordance with"
"595","authorizations of"
"596","management and directors"
"597","of the company; and (3)"
"598","provide reasonable"
"599","assurance regarding"
"600","prevention or timely"
"601","detection of unauthorized"
"602","acquisition, use or"
"603","disposition of a company's"
"604","assets that could have a"
"605","material effect on the"
"606","financial statements."
"607","Because of inherent"
"608","limitations, internal control"
"609","over financial reporting"
"610","may not prevent or detect"
"611","misstatements.   Also,"
"612","projections of any"
"613","evaluation of effectiveness"
"614","to future periods are"
"615","subject to the risk that"
"616","controls may become"
"617","inadequate because of"
"618","changes in conditions, or"
"619","that the degree of"
"620","compliance with the"
"621","policies or procedures may"
"622","deteriorate."
"623","A deficiency in internal"
"624","control over financial"
"625","reporting exists when the"
"626","design or operation of a"
"627","control does not allow"
"628","management or employees,"
"629","in the normal course of"
"630","performing their assigned"
"631","functions, to prevent or"
"632","detect misstatements on a"
"633","timely basis.   A material"
"634","weakness is a deficiency,"
"635","or combination of"
"636","deficiencies, in internal"
"637","control over financial"
"638","reporting, such that there is"
"639","a reasonable possibility"
"640","that a material"
"641","misstatement of the Fund's"
"642","annual or interim financial"
"643","statements will not be"
"644","prevented or detected on a"
"645","timely basis."

"651","Our consideration of the"
"652","Fund's internal control"
"653","over financial reporting"
"654","was for the limited purpose"
"655","described in the first"
"656","paragraph and would not"
"657","necessarily disclose all"
"658","deficiencies in internal"
"659","control that might be"
"660","material weaknesses under"
"661","standards established by"
"662","the Public Company"
"663","Accounting Oversight"
"664","Board (United States)."
"665","However, we noted no"
"666","deficiencies in the Fund's"
"667","internal control over"
"668","financial reporting and its"
"669","operation, including"
"670","controls over safeguarding"
"671","securities that we consider"
"672","to be material weaknesses"
"673","as defined above as of"
"674","December 31, 2016."
