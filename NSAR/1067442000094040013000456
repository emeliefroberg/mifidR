      Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Trustees and Shareholders
Prudential Investment Portfolio 16 - Prudential Defensive
Equity Fund

In planning and performing our audit of the financial
statements of Prudential Defensive Equity Fund, (formerly
Target Moderate Allocation Fund), (hereafter referred to as
the Fund), a portfolio of the Prudential Investment
Portfolio 16 (formerly Target Asset Allocation Funds), as and
for the year ended July 31, 2013, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control
over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding
securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures
for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial
statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and
maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and
judgments by management are required to assess the expected
benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.


A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting
exists when the design or operation of a control does not
allow management or employees, in the normal course of
performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the
Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in
the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all
deficiencies in internal control that might be material
weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted
no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting and its operation, including controls over
safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material
weakness as defined above as of July 31, 2013.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of
management and the Board of Trustees of the Fund and the
Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be
and should not be used by anyone other than these specified
parties.

      Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Trustees and Shareholders
Prudential Investment Portfolio 16 - Target Conservative
Allocation Fund:

In planning and performing our audit of the financial
statements of Target Conservative Allocation Fund. (hereafter
referred to as the Fund), a portfolio of the Prudential
Investment Portfolio 16 (formerly Target Asset Allocation
Funds), as and for the year ended July 31, 2013, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal
control over financial reporting, including controls over
safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing
procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the
financial statements and to comply with the requirements of
Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and
maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and
judgments by management are required to assess the expected
benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may

A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting
exists when the design or operation of a control does not
allow management or employees, in the normal course of
performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the
Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in
the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all
deficiencies in internal control that might be material
weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted
no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting and its operation, including controls over
safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material
weakness as defined above as of July 31, 2013.
