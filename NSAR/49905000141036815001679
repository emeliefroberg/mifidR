"1687","<TEXT>"
"1688","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"1689","Accounting Firm"
"1690","To the Shareholders and"
"1691","Board of Directors of The Hartford Mutual Funds,"
"1692","Inc."
"1693","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1694","statements of The Hartford Mutual Funds, Inc. (the"
"1695","Company) as of and for the year ended October 31,"
"1696","2015, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1697","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1698","States), we considered the Company's internal"
"1699","control over financial reporting, including controls"
"1700","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"1701","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"1702","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"1703","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"1704","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1705","effectiveness of the Company's internal control over"
"1706","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"1707","opinion."
"1708","The management of the Company is responsible for"
"1709","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1710","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1711","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1712","management are required to assess the expected"
"1713","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"1714","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"1715","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1716","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1717","preparation of financial statements for external"
"1718","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1719","accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"1720","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1721","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1722","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1723","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1724","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1725","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"1726","to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1727","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1728","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1729","company are being made only in accordance with"
"1730","authorizations of management and directors of the"
"1731","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1732","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1733","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"1734","company's assets that could have a material effect on"
"1735","the financial statements."
"1736","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1737","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1738","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1739","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"1740","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"1741","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1742","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1743","deteriorate."
"1744","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1745","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1746","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1747","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1748","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1749","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"1750","a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"1751","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1752","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1753","company's annual or interim financial statements will"
"1754","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1755","Our consideration of the Company's internal control"
"1756","over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1757","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1758","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"1759","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1760","standards established by the Public Company"
"1761","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1762","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Company's"
"1763","internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1764","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1765","securities, that we consider to be a material weakness"
"1766","as defined above as of October 31, 2015."
"1767","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"1768","use of management and the Board of Directors of The"
"1769","Hartford Mutual Funds, Inc. and the Securities and"
"1770","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"1771","should not be used by anyone other than these"
"1772","specified parties."

"1788","On February 25, 2011, Jennifer L. Kasilag, Louis"
"1789","Mellinger, Judith M. Menendez, Jacqueline M."
"1790","Robinson, and Linda A. Russell filed a derivative"
"1791","lawsuit against Hartford Investment Financial"
"1792","Services, LLC (HIFSCO) (now known as"
"1793","Hartford Funds Distributors, LLC) on behalf of six"
"1794","Hartford retail mutual funds in the United States"
"1795","District Court for the District of New Jersey,"
"1796","alleging that HIFSCO received excessive advisory"
"1797","and distribution fees in violation of its statutory"
"1798","fiduciary duty under Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act"
"1799","when serving as investment manager and principal"
"1800","underwriter, respectively, to the Hartford retail"
"1801","mutual funds. Although this action was purportedly"
"1802","filed on behalf of certain of the Hartford Funds,"
"1803","none of the Hartford Funds is itself a defendant to"
"1804","the suit. HIFSCO moved to dismiss and, in"
"1805","September 2011, the motion was granted in part and"
"1806","denied in part, with leave to amend the complaint."
"1807","In November 2011, plaintiffs filed an amended"
"1808","complaint on behalf of certain Hartford retail"
"1809","mutual funds, The Hartford Global Health Fund"
"1810","(now known as The Hartford Healthcare Fund), The"
"1811","Hartford Conservative Allocation Fund, The"
"1812","Hartford Growth Opportunities Fund, The Hartford"
"1813","Inflation Plus Fund, The Hartford Advisers Fund"
"1814","(now known as The Hartford Balanced Fund), and"
"1815","The Hartford Capital Appreciation Fund. Plaintiffs"
"1816","seek to rescind the investment management"
"1817","agreements and distribution plans between HIFSCO"
"1818","and these funds and to recover the total fees charged"
"1819","thereunder or, in the alternative, to recover any"
"1820","improper compensation HIFSCO received, in"
"1821","addition to lost earnings. HIFSCO filed a partial"
"1822","motion to dismiss the amended complaint and, in"
"1823","December 2012, the court dismissed without"
"1824","prejudice the claims regarding distribution fees and"
"1825","denied the motion with respect to the advisory fees"
