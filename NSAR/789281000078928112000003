"1098","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1099","To the Shareholders and"
"1100","Board of Trustees of"
"1101","Federated Income Securities Trust:"
"1102","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1103","statements of Federated Floating Rate Strategic"
"1104","Income Fund (the Fund), a series of the Federated"
"1105","Income Securities Trust, as of and for the year"
"1106","ended March 31, 2012, in accordance with the standards"
"1107"," of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1108","Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"1109","control over financial reporting, including"
"1110","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1111","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"1112","of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"1113","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"1114","SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"1115","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"1116","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express"
"1117","no such opinion."
"1118","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"1119","and maintaining effective internal control over"
"1120","financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1121","estimates and judgments by management are"
"1122","required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"1123","costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"1124","over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1125","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability"
"1126","of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1127","statements for external purposes in accordance"
"1128","with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"1129","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"1130","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"1131","to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1132","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"1133","and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"1134","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1135","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1136","financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1137","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1138","expenditures of the company are being made in"
"1139","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1140","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1141","assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1142","detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"1143","disposition of the company's assets that could have a"
"1144","material effect on the financial statements."
"1145","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1146","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1147","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1148","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1149","risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"1150","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1151","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1152","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1153"," reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1154","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1155","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1156","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1157","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"1158","a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"1159","over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1160","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"1161","of the Fund's annual or interim financial statements"
"1162","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1163","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"1164","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1165","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1166","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"1167","that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"1168","established by the Public Company Accounting"
"1169","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"1170","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control"
"1171","over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"1172","controls over safeguarding securities that we"
"1173","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as"
"1174","of March 31, 2012."
"1175","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"1176","use of management and the Board of Trustees of"
"1177","Federated Income Securities Trust and the Securities"
