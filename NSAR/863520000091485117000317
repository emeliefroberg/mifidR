"1457","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1458","To the Board of Directors of Western Asset Funds, Inc. and"
"1459","Shareholders of Western Asset High Yield Fund, Western Asset"
"1460","Total Return Unconstrained Fund and Western Asset Intermediate"
"1461","Bond Fund:"
"1462","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1463","statements of  Western Asset High Yield Fund, Western Asset"
"1464","Total Return Unconstrained Fund and Western Asset Intermediate"
"1465","Bond Fund (three of the funds comprising Western Asset Funds,"
"1466","Inc., the Company) as of and for the year ended May 31, 2017,"
"1467","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1468","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1469","Company's internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1470","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"1471","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1472","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1473","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1474","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's"
"1475","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"1476","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's"
"1477","internal control over financial reporting."
"1478","The management of the Company is responsible for establishing"
"1479","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1480","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1481","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"1482","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal"
"1483","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1484","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1485","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"1486","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1487","accounting principles. A company's internal control over"
"1488","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"1489","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1490","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1491","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"1492","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"1493","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"1494","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1495","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"1496","with authorizations of management and directors of the company;"
"1497","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"1498","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1499","of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1500","financial statements."
"1501","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1502","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1503","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1504","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1505","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"1506","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1507","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1508","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1509","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1510","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"1511","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1512","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1513","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1514","material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim"
"1515","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"1516","timely basis."
"1517","Our consideration of the Company's internal control over"
"1518","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the"
"1519","first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"1520","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that"
"1521","might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1522","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1523","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Company's internal"
"1524","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"1525","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be"
"1526","material weaknesses as defined above as of May 31, 2017."
"1527","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1528","management and the Board of Directors of Western Asset Funds,"
"1529","Inc. and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"1530","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"1531","specified parties."

"1653","      3.	  Investment Advisory Services.  (a)  Subject to the"
"1654","supervision of the Directors and the Manager, WAML shall as"
"1655","requested by the Manager regularly provide the Fund with"
"1656","investment research, advice, management and supervision and"
"1657","shall furnish a continuous investment program for the Fund"
"1658","consistent with the Fund's investment objectives, policies, and"
"1659","restrictions as stated in the Fund's current Prospectus and"
"1660","Statement of Additional Information.  WAML shall as requested by"
"1661","the Manager determine from time to time what securities or other"
"1662","property will be purchased, retained or sold by the Fund, and"
"1663","shall implement those decisions, all subject to the provisions"
"1664","of the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws, the"
"1665","1940 Act, the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities"
"1666","and Exchange Commission, and other applicable federal and state"
"1667","law, as well as the investment objectives, policies, and"
"1668","restrictions of the Fund, as each of the foregoing may be"
"1669","amended from time to time.  WAML will as requested by the"
"1670","Manager place orders pursuant to its investment determinations"
"1671","for the Fund either directly with the issuer or with any broker,"
"1672","dealer or futures commission merchant (collectively, a"
"1673","broker). In the selection of brokers and the placing of orders"
"1674","for the purchase and sale of portfolio investments for the Fund,"
"1675","WAML shall seek to obtain for the Fund the most favorable price"
"1676","and execution available, except to the extent it may be"
"1677","permitted to pay higher brokerage commissions for brokerage and"
"1678","research services as described below.  In using its best efforts"
"1679","to obtain for the Fund the most favorable price and execution"
"1680","available, WAML, bearing in mind the Fund's best interests at"
"1681","all times, shall consider all factors it deems relevant,"
"1682","including, by way of illustration, price, the size of the"
"1683","transaction, the nature of the market for the security, the"
"1684","amount of the commission, the timing of the transaction taking"
"1685","into consideration market prices and trends, the reputation,"
"1686","experience and financial stability of the broker involved and"
"1687","the quality of service rendered by the broker in other"
"1688","transactions.  Subject to such policies as the Directors may"
"1689","determine and communicate to WAML in writing, WAML shall not be"
"1690","deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty"
"1691","created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of its"
"1692","having caused the Fund to pay a broker that provides brokerage"
"1693","and research services to WAML or any affiliated person of WAML"
"1694","an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"1695","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker"
"1696","would have charged for effecting that transaction, if WAML"
"1697","determines in good faith that such amount of commission was"
"1698","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"1699","research services provided by such broker, viewed in terms of"
"1700","either that particular transaction or WAML's overall"
"1701","responsibilities with respect to the Fund and to other clients"
"1702","of WAML and any affiliated person of WAML as to which WAML or"
"1703","any affiliated person of WAML exercises investment discretion."
"1704","WAML shall also perform such other functions of management and"
"1705","supervision as may be requested by the Manager and agreed to by"
"1706","WAML."
"1707","      (b)  WAML will as requested by the Manager oversee the"
"1708","maintenance of all books and records with respect to the"
"1709","investment transactions of the Fund in accordance with all"
"1710","applicable federal and state laws and regulations, and will"
"1711","furnish the Directors with such periodic and special reports as"
"1712","the Directors or the Manager reasonably may request."
"1713","      (c)  The Corporation hereby agrees that any entity or"
"1714","person associated with WAML (or with any affiliated person of"
"1715","WAML) which is a member of a national securities exchange is"
"1716","authorized to effect any transaction on such exchange for the"
"1717","account of the Fund which is permitted by Section 11(a) of the"
"1718","Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 11a2-2(T)"
"1719","thereunder, and the Corporation hereby consents to the retention"
"1720","of compensation for such transactions in accordance with Rule"
"1721","11a2-2(T)(a)(2)(iv) or otherwise."
"1722","      4.	  Services Not Exclusive.  WAML's services hereunder"
"1723","are not deemed to be exclusive, and WAML shall be free to render"
"1724","similar services to others.  It is understood that persons"
"1725","employed by WAML to assist in the performance of its duties"
"1726","hereunder might not devote their full time to such service."
"1727","Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to limit or restrict"
"1728","the right of WAML or any affiliate of WAML to engage in and"
"1729","devote time and attention to other businesses or to render"
"1730","services of whatever kind or nature."
"1731","      5.	  Books and Records.  In compliance with the"
"1732","requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, WAML hereby"
"1733","agrees that all books and records which it maintains for the"
"1734","Fund are property of the Fund and further agrees to surrender"
"1735","promptly to the Fund or its agents any of such records upon the"
"1736","Fund's request.  WAML further agrees to preserve for the periods"
"1737","prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act any such records"
"1738","required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act."
"1739","      6.	  Expenses.  During the term of this Agreement, WAML"
"1740","will pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its"
"1741","activities under this Agreement other than the cost of"
"1742","securities and other property (including brokerage commissions,"
"1743","if any) purchased for the Fund."
"1744","      7.	  Compensation.  For the services which WAML will"
"1745","render to the Manager and the Fund under this Agreement, the"
"1746","Manager will pay WAML a fee, computed monthly and paid monthly,"
"1747","equal to the product of the Baseline Amount for the relevant"
"1748","calendar month and the Subadviser Fraction for such calendar"
"1749","month.  The Baseline Amount for a given calendar month shall be"
"1750","the total amount paid to the Manager by the Corporation pursuant"
"1751","to the Management Agreement in respect of such calendar month."
"1752","The Subadviser Fraction for a given calendar month shall be a"
"1753","fraction, the numerator of which is the net assets of the Fund"
"1754","managed by WAML, and the denominator of which is the net assets"
"1755","of the Fund, in each case computed as of the time of the regular"
"1756","close of business of the New York Stock Exchange on the last"
"1757","Business Day of such calendar month, or such other time as may"
"1758","be determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.  A"
"1759","Business Day shall be any day on which the New York Stock"
"1760","Exchange is open.  Fees due to WAML hereunder shall be paid"
"1761","promptly to WAML by the Manager following its receipt of fees"
"1762","from the Fund.  If this Agreement is terminated as of any date"
"1763","not the last day of a calendar month, a final fee shall be paid"
"1764","promptly after the date of termination and shall be based on the"
"1765","Baseline Amount for that portion of the month during which the"
"1766","contract was still in effect and the Subadviser Fraction as of"
"1767","the time of the regular close of business of the New York Stock"
"1768","Exchange on the date of termination (or, if the date of"
"1769","termination is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately"
"1770","preceding the date of termination)."
"1771","      8.	  Limitation of Liability.  In the absence of willful"
"1772","misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of WAML,"
"1773","or reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder,"
"1774","WAML shall not be subject to any liability to the Manager, the"
"1775","Fund or any shareholder of the Fund, for any act or omission in"
"1776","the course of, or connected with, rendering services hereunder."
"1777","      9.	  Definitions.  As used in this Agreement, the terms"
"1778","assignment, interested person, affiliated person, and"
"1779","majority of the outstanding voting securities shall have the"
"1780","meanings given to them by Section 2(a) of the 1940 Act, subject"
"1781","to such exemptions and interpretations as may be granted by the"
"1782","Securities and Exchange Commission by any rule, regulation or"
"1783","order; the term specifically approve at least annually shall"
"1784","be construed in a manner consistent with the 1940 Act and the"

research services shall have the meaning given in the"
"1786","Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and"

"1788","      10.	  Term.  This Agreement shall become effective upon"
"1789","its execution, and shall remain in full force and effect"
"1790","continuously thereafter (unless terminated automatically as set"
"1791","forth in Section 12) until terminated as follows:"
"1792","      a.	The Corporation may at any time terminate this"
"1793","Agreement by 60 days' written notice delivered or mailed by"
"1794","registered mail, postage prepaid, to the Manager and WAML,"
"1795","or"
"1796","      b.	If (i) the Directors or the shareholders of the"

"1798","securities of the Fund, and (ii) a majority of the"
"1799","Directors who are not interested persons of the"
