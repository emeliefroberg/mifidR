"1313","(the Funds) as of and for the year ended September 30, 2015, in accordance"
"1314","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"

"1316","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"

"1318","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1319","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"

"1321","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1322","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1323","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"

"1326","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1327","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1328","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting"

"1331","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"

"1345","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"

"1348","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1349","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a fund's"
