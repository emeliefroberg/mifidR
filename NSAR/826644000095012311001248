"5809","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Invesco Van Kampen Global Tactical"
"5810","Asset Allocation Fund:"
"5811","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Invesco Van"
"5812","Kampen Global Tactical Asset Allocation Fund (formerly known as Van Kampen Trust"
"5813","II, hereafter referred to as the Fund) as of and for the year ended October"
"5814","31, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"5815","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"5816","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"5817","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"5818","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"5819","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"5820","Fund's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express"
"5821","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"5822","reporting."
"5823","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"5824","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"5825","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"5826","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A Fund's internal control over"
"5827","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"5828","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"5829","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"5830","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"5831","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"5832","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"5833","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"5834","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"5835","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"5836","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"5837","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of"
"5838","the Fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"5839","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"5840","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"5841","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"5842","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"5843","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"5844","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"5845","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"5846","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"5847","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"5848","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"5849","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"5850","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"5851","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"5852","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"5853","on a timely basis."
"5854","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"5855","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"5856","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"5857","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"5858","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"5859","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"5860","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to"
"5861","be material weaknesses as defined above as of October 31, 2010."

"6045","SETTLED ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO MARKET TIMING"
"6046","     On October 8, 2004, Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco), successor by merger"
"6047","to Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc. and INVESCO Funds Group, Inc. (IFG), both former"
"6048","investment advisers, along with Invesco Aim Distributors, n/k/a Invesco"
"6049","Distributors, Inc. (Invesco Distributors) reached final settlements with certain"
"6050","regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York"
"6051","Attorney General and the Colorado Attorney General, to resolve civil enforcement"
"6052","actions and/or investigations related to market timing and related activity in"
"6053","the AIM Funds (n/k/a the Invesco Funds), including those formerly advised by"
"6054","IFG. As part of the settlements, a $325 million fair fund ($110 million of which"
"6055","is civil penalties) was created to compensate shareholders harmed by market"
"6056","timing and related activity in funds formerly advised by IFG. Additionally,"
"6057","Invesco and Invesco Distributors created a $50 million fair fund ($30 million of"
"6058","which is civil penalties) to compensate shareholders harmed by market timing and"
"6059","related activity in funds advised by Invesco, which was done pursuant to the"
"6060","terms of the settlement. The methodology of the fair funds distributions was"
"6061","determined by Invesco's independent distribution consultant (IDC Plan), in"
"6062","consultation with Invesco and the independent trustees of the Invesco Funds, and"
"6063","approved by the SEC on May 23, 2008."
"6064","     The IDC Plan provides for distribution to all eligible investors, for the"
"6065","periods spanning January 1, 2000 through July 31, 2003 (for the IFG Fair Fund)"
"6066","and January 1, 2001 through September 30, 2003 (for the AIM Fair Fund), their"
"6067","proportionate share of the applicable Fair Fund to compensate such investors for"
"6068","injury they may have suffered as a result of market timing in the affected"
"6069","funds. The IDC Plan includes a provision for any residual amounts in the Fair"
"6070","Funds to be distributed in the future to the affected funds. Further details"
"6071","regarding the IDC Plan and distributions thereunder are available on Invesco's"
"6072","Web site, available at http://www.invesco.com/us."
"6073","     At the present time, management of Invesco and the Invesco Funds are unable"
"6074","to estimate the impact, if any, that the outcome of the Pending Litigation and"
"6075","Regulatory Inquiries described herein may have on Invesco, Invesco Distributors"
"6076","or the Invesco Funds."
"6077","Pending Regulatory Action Alleging Market Timing"
"6078","     On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Office of the State Auditor -"
"6079","Securities Commission (WVASC) issued a Summary Order to Cease and Desist and"
"6080","Notice of Right to Hearing to Invesco and Invesco Distributors (Order No."
"6081","05-1318). The WVASC makes findings of fact that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"6082","entered into certain arrangements permitting market timing of the Invesco Funds"
"6083","and failed to disclose these arrangements in the prospectuses for such Funds,"
"6084","and conclusions of law to the effect that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"6085","violated the West Virginia securities laws. The WVASC orders Invesco and Invesco"
"6086","Distributors to cease any further violations and seeks to impose monetary"
"6087","sanctions, including restitution to affected investors, disgorgement of fees,"
"6088","reimbursement of investigatory, administrative and legal costs and an"
"6089","administrative assessment, to be determined by the Commissioner. Initial"
"6090","research indicates that these damages could be limited or capped by statute. By"
"6091","agreement with the Commissioner of Securities, Invesco's time to respond to that"
"6092","Order has been indefinitely suspended."
"6093","Private Civil Actions Alleging Market Timing"
"6094","     Multiple civil lawsuits, including purported class action and shareholder"
"6095","derivative suits, have been filed against various parties (including, depending"
"6096","on the lawsuit, certain Invesco Funds, IFG, Invesco, Invesco Aim Management"
"6097","Group, Inc., n/k/a Invesco Management Group, Inc. and certain related entities,"

"6102","allegations of improper market timing and related activity in the Invesco Funds."
"6103","These lawsuits allege a variety of theories of recovery, including but not"
"6104","limited to: (i) violation of various provisions of the Federal and state"
"6105","securities laws; (ii) violation of various provisions of Employee Retirement"
"6106","Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA); (iii) breach of fiduciary duty;"
"6107","and/or (iv) breach of contract. These lawsuits were initiated in both Federal"
"6108","and state courts and seek such remedies as compensatory damages; restitution;"
"6109","injunctive relief; disgorgement of management fees; imposition of a constructive"
"6110","trust; removal of certain directors and/or employees; various corrective"
"6111","measures under ERISA; rescission of certain Funds' advisory agreements;"
"6112","interest; and attorneys' and experts' fees. All lawsuits based on allegations of"
"6113","market timing, late trading, and related issues have been transferred to the"
"6114","United States District Court for the District of Maryland (the MDL Court) for"
"6115","consolidated or coordinated pre-trial proceedings."
"6116","     Pursuant to an Order of the MDL Court, plaintiffs in these lawsuits"
"6117","consolidated their claims for pre-trial purposes into three amended complaints"
"6118","against various Invesco - and IFG-related parties. The parties in the amended"
"6119","complaints have agreed in principle to settle the actions. A list identifying"
"6120","the amended complaints in the MDL Court and details of the settlements are"
"6121","discussed below."

"6134","          1:04-MD-15864-FPS), filed on September 29, 2004."
"6135","     On March 1, 2006, the MDL Court dismissed all derivative causes of action"
"6136","in the Essenmacher lawsuit but two: (i) the excessive fee claim under Section"
"6137","36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act); and (ii) the"
"6138","control person liability claim under Section 48 of the 1940 Act, and all"
"6139","claims asserted in the Lepera class action lawsuit but three: (i) the securities"
"6140","fraud claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (ii)"
"6141","the excessive fee claim under Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act (which survived only"
"6142","insofar as plaintiffs seek recovery of fees associated with the assets involved"
"6143","in market timing); and (iii) the control person liability claim under Section"
"6144","48 of the 1940 Act. On June 14, 2006, the MDL Court entered an order dismissing"
"6145","the Section 48 claim in the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuit. Based on the MDL"
"6146","Court's March 1, 2006 and June 14, 2006 orders, all claims asserted against the"
"6147","Funds that were transferred to the MDL Court were dismissed, although certain"
"6148","Funds remain nominal defendants in the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuit. On"
"6149","January 5, 2008, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle both"
"6150","the class action (Lepera) and the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuits, subject to"
"6151","the MDL Court approval. Individual class members have the right to object."
"6152","     On September 15, 2006, Judge Motz for the MDL Court granted the Defendants'"
"6153","motion to dismiss the ERISA (Calderon) lawsuit and dismissed such lawsuit. The"
"6154","Plaintiff appealed this decision. On June 16, 2008, the Fourth Circuit Court of"
"6155","Appeals reversed the dismissal and remanded this lawsuit back to the MDL Court"
"6156","for further proceedings. On December 15, 2008, the parties reached an agreement"
"6157","in principle to settle this lawsuit, subject to the MDL Court approval."
"6158","Individual class members have the right to object. No payments are required"
"6159","under the settlement; however, the parties agreed that certain limited changes"
"6160","to benefit plans and participants' accounts would be made."
