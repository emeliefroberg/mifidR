"1130","<P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Ivy Accumulative Fund and Ivy Wilshire Global Allocation Fund (the &#147;Funds&#148;),"
"1131","two of the series constituting Ivy Funds, as of and for the year ended June&nbsp;30, 2018, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Funds&#146; internal control over"
"1132","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form <FONT"
"1133","STYLE=white-space:nowrap>N-SAR,</FONT> but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting.&nbsp;Accordingly, we express no such opinion. </P>"
"1134","<P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1135","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1136","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1137","policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that"
"1138","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"1139","of management and trustees of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1140","financial statements. </P> <P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"1141","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>"
"1142","<P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"1143","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1144","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company&#146;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. </P>"
"1145","<P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>Our consideration of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1146","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB. However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1147","including controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as of June&nbsp;30, 2018. </P> <P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>This report is"

"1204","including any accrued interest thereon. Under the present Guidelines, the collateral must consist of cash or U.S. government securities or bank letters of credit, at least equal in value to the market value of the securities loaned on each day that"
"1205","the loan is outstanding. Such collateral will be <FONT STYLE=white-space:nowrap><FONT STYLE=white-space:nowrap>marked-to-market</FONT></FONT> daily, and if the market value of the lent securities exceeds the value of the collateral, the borrower"

"1208","This method is available for all three types of collateral. The second method, which is not available when letters of credit are used as collateral, is for a Fund to receive interest on the investment of the cash collateral or to receive interest on"
"1209","the U.S. government securities used as collateral. Part of the interest received in either case may be shared with the borrower. </P> <P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>The letters of credit"
"1210","that a Fund may accept as collateral are agreements by banks (other than the borrowers of the Fund&#146;s securities), entered into at the request of the borrower and for its account and risk, under which the banks are obligated to pay to the Fund,"
"1211","while the letter is in effect, amounts demanded by the Fund if the demand meets the terms of the letter. The Fund&#146;s right to make this demand secures the borrower&#146;s obligations to it. The terms of any such letters and the creditworthiness"
"1212","of the banks providing them (which might include the Fund&#146;s custodian bank) must be satisfactory to the Investment Manager. The Fund will make loans only under rules of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which presently require the borrower to"
"1213","give the securities back to the Fund within five business days after the Fund gives notice to do so. If the Fund loses its voting rights on securities loaned, it will not be able to have the securities returned to it in time to vote them if a"

"1218","borrower defaults on its obligation to return the securities loaned because of insolvency or other reasons, a Fund could experience delays and costs in recovering the securities loaned or in gaining access to the collateral. These delays and costs"
"1219","could be greater for foreign securities. If a Fund is not able to recover the securities loaned, the Fund may sell the collateral and purchase a replacement investment in the market. Additional transaction costs would result, and the value of the"
"1220","collateral could decrease below the value of the replacement investment by the time the replacement investment is purchased. Until the replacement can be purchased, the Fund will not have the desired level of exposure to the security which the"
"1221","borrower failed to return. Cash received as collateral through loan transactions may be invested in other eligible securities, including shares of a money market fund. Investing this cash subjects the Fund to greater market risk including losses on"
"1222","the collateral and, should the Fund need to look to the collateral in the event of the borrower&#146;s default, losses on the loan secured by that collateral. </P>"
