"500"," PROCEEDINGS"
"501","Since February 2004,"
"502","Federated and related"
"503","entities (collectively, Federated)"
"504"," have been named as"
"505","defendants in several"
"506","lawsuits that are now pending"
"507","in the United States District"
"508","Court for the Western"
"509","District of Pennsylvania."
"510","These lawsuits have been"
"511","consolidated into a single"
"512","action alleging excessive"
"513","advisory fees involving"
"514","one of the Federated-sponsored"
"515"," mutual funds (Funds)."
"516","       Federated and its"
"517"," counsel have been defending"
"518","this litigation. Additional"
"519","lawsuits based upon"
"520","similar allegations may be"
"521","filed in the future. The"
"522","potential impact of these"
"523","lawsuits, all of which seek"
"524","monetary damages, attorneys'"
"525","fees and expenses, and future"
"526","potential similar suits is"
"527"," uncertain. Although"
"528","we do not believe that these"
"529","lawsuits will have a material"
"530","adverse effect on the Funds,"
"531","there can be no"
"532","assurance that these suits,"
"533","ongoing adverse publicity"
"534","and/or other developments"
"535","resulting from the"
"536","allegations in these matters"
"537","will not result in increased"

"549","Report of Independent Registered"
"550","Public Accounting Firm"
"551","To the Shareholders and"
"552","Board of Trustees of"
"553","Federated Managed Allocation Portfolios"
"554","In planning and performing"
"555"," our audit of the financial"
"556","statements of Federated Balanced"
"557","Allocation Fund, (the Fund),"
"558","a portfolio of Federated Managed"
"559","Allocation Portfolios, as of and"
"560","for the year ended November 30,"
"561","2010, in accordance with the"
"562","standards of the Public Company"
"563","Accounting Oversight Board"
"564","(United States), we considered"
"565","the Fund's internal control over"
"566","financial reporting, including"
"567","controls over safeguarding"
"568","securities, as a basis for designing"
"569","our"
"570","auditing procedures for the"
"571","purpose of expressing our opinion"
"572"," on the financial statements and to"
"573","comply with the requirements"
"574","of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"575","the purpose of expressing an"
"576","opinion"
"577","on the effectiveness of the"
"578"," Fund's internal control over"
"579","financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"580","express no such opinion."
"581","Management of the Fund is"
"582"," responsible for establishing"
"583","and maintaining effective internal"
"584","control"
"585","over financial reporting."
"586","In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"587","estimates and judgments by management"
"588","are required to assess the"
"589","expected benefits and related"
"590","costs of controls. A company's"
"591"," internal"
"592","control over financial"
"593","reporting is a process designed"
"594","to provide reasonable assurance"
"595","regarding"
"596","the reliability of financial"
"597","reporting and the preparation of"
"598","financial statements for external"
"599","purposes in accordance with"
"600","generally accepted accounting"
"601","principles. A company's internal"
"602","control over financial reporting"
"603","includes those policies and"
"604","procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"605","maintenance of records that, in"
"606","reasonable detail, accurately"
"607","and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"608","dispositions of the assets of"
"609","the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"610","assurance that transactions are"
"611","recorded as necessary to permit"
"612","preparation of financial statements"
"613","in accordance with generally"
"614","accepted accounting principles,"
"615","and that receipts and expenditures"
"616","of the company are being made"
"617","in accordance with authorizations"
"618","of management and directors of the"
"619","company; and (3) provide"
"620","reasonable assurance regarding"
"621","prevention or timely detection"
"622","of the unauthorized acquisition,"
"623","use, or disposition of the"
"624","company's assets that could"
"625","have a material affect on the"
"626","financial"
"627","statements."
"628","Because of its inherent"
"629","limitations, internal control"
"630","over financial reporting may"
"631","not prevent or"
"632","detect misstatements. Also,"
"633","projections of any evaluation"
"634","of effectiveness to future periods"
"635","are"
"636","subject to the risk that"
"637","controls may become inadequate"
"638"," because of changes in conditions,"
"639","or that"
"640","the degree of compliance with"
"641","the policies or procedures may"
"642","deteriorate."
"643","A deficiency in internal control"
"644","over financial reporting exists"
"645"," when the design or operation of a"
"646","control does not allow management"
"647","or employees, in the normal course"
"648","of performing their"
"649","assigned functions, to prevent or"
"650"," detect misstatements on a timely"
"651","basis. A material weakness is a"
"652","deficiency, or a combination of"
"653","deficiencies, in internal control"
"654","over financial reporting, such that"
"655","there is a reasonable possibility"
"656","that a material misstatement of"
"657","the Fund's annual or interim"
"658","financial statements will not be"
"659"," prevented or detected on a timely"
"660"," basis."
"661","Our consideration of the Fund's"
"662","internal control over financial"
"663","reporting was for the limited"
"664","purpose described in the first"
"665","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"666","disclose all deficiencies in"
"667","internal control that might be"
"668","material weaknesses under"
"669","standards established by the"
"670","Public"
"671","Company Accounting Oversight"
"672","Board (United States). However,"
"673","we noted no deficiencies in the"
"674","Fund's internal control over"
"675","financial reporting and its"
"676","operation, including controls over"
"677","safeguarding securities that we"
"678","consider to be a material weakness"
"679"," as defined above as of"
"680","November 30, 2010."
"681","This report is intended solely"
"682","for"
"683","the information and use of management"
"684","and the Board of"
"685","Trustees of Federated Managed"
"686","Allocation Portfolios and the"
"687","Securities and Exchange"
"688","Commission and is not intended"
