"4040","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"4041","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM Counselor Series Trust (Invesco"
"4042","Counselor Series Trust):"
"4043","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Invesco"
"4044","Equity and Income Fund, Invesco Global Real Estate Income Fund, Invesco Core"
"4045","Plus Bond Fund, Invesco Strategic Real Return Fund, Invesco California Tax-Free"
"4046","Income Fund, Invesco Pennsylvania Tax Free Income Fund, Invesco American"
"4047","Franchise Fund, Invesco Equally-Weighted S&P 500 Fund, Invesco Growth and Income"
"4048","Fund, Invesco Low Volatility Equity Yield Fund, Invesco S&P 500 Index Fund, and"
"4049","Invesco Small Cap Discovery Fund (twelve of the portfolios constituting AIM"
"4050","Counselor Series Trust (Invesco Counselor Series Trust), hereafter referred to"
"4051","as the Company) as of and for the year ended August 31, 2014 in accordance"
"4052","with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"4053","we considered the Company's internal control over financial reporting, including"
"4054","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"4055","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"4056","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"4057","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control"
"4058","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"4059","effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting."
"4060","Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"4061","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"4062","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"4063","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A Company's internal control"
"4064","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"4065","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"4066","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"4067","accounting principles. A Company's internal control over financial reporting"
"4068","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"4069","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"4070","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide"
"4071","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"4072","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"4073","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are"
"4074","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of"
"4075","the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"4076","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a Company's"
"4077","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"4078","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"4079","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"4080","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"4081","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"4082","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"4083","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"4084","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"4085","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"4086","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"4087","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"4088","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"4089","Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"4090","detected on a timely basis."
"4091","<PAGE>"
"4092","Our consideration of the Company's internal control over financial reporting was"
"4093","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"4094","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"4095","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"4096","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"4097","deficiencies in the Company's internal control over financial reporting and its"

"4109","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"4110","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM Counselor Series Trust"
"4111","(Invesco Counselor Series Trust):"
"4112","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Invesco"
"4113","Floating Rate Fund (one of the portfolios constituting AIM Counselor Series"
"4114","Trust (Invesco Counselor Series Trust), hereafter referred to as the Company)"
"4115","as of and for the year ended August 31, 2014 in accordance with standards of"
"4116","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"4117","the Company's internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"4118","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"4119","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"4120","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"4121","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control"
"4122","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"4123","effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting."
"4124","Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"4125","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"4126","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"4127","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A Company's internal"
"4128","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"4129","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"4130","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"4131","accepted accounting principles. A Company's internal control over financial"
"4132","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"4133","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"4134","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;"
"4135","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"4136","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"4137","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"4138","Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"4139","trustees of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"4140","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"4141","of a Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"4142","statements."
"4143","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"4144","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"4145","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"4146","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"4147","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"4148","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"4149","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"4150","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"4151","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"4152","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"4153","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"4154","Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"4155","detected on a timely basis."
"4156","Our consideration of the Company's internal control over financial reporting"
"4157","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"4158","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"4159","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"4160","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"4161","deficiencies in the Company's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"4162","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"4163","be material weaknesses as defined above as of August 31, 2014."
"4164","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"4165","the Board of Trustees of AIM Counselor Series Trust (Invesco Counselor Series"
"4166","Trust) and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"4167","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

                            MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
                            (ADVISORY FEE WAIVERS)

   This Memorandum of Agreement is entered into as of the effective date on the
attached Exhibit A and B (each an Exhibit or, collectively the Exhibits),
between AIM Counselor Series Trust (Invesco Counselor Series Trust), AIM Equity
Funds (Invesco Equity Funds), AIM Funds Group (Invesco Funds Group), AIM Growth
Series (Invesco Growth Series), AIM International Mutual Funds (Invesco
International Mutual Funds), AIM Investment Funds (Invesco Investment Funds),

funds listed on the Exhibits to this Memorandum of Agreement (the Funds), and
Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco). Invesco shall and hereby agrees to waive
fees of the Funds, on behalf of their respective classes as applicable,
severally and not jointly, as indicated in the Exhibits.

   For and in consideration of the mutual terms and agreements set forth herein
and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
is hereby acknowledged, Invesco agrees that until at least the expiration date
set forth on Exhibit A (the Expiration Date) and with respect to those Funds
listed on the Exhibit, Invesco will waive its advisory fees at the rate set
forth on the Exhibit.

   For and in consideration of the mutual terms and agreements set forth herein
and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
is hereby acknowledged, the Trusts and Invesco agree as follows:

    1. Invesco agrees that until the expiration date, if any, of the commitment
       set forth on the attached Exhibit B occurs, as such Exhibit B is amended
       from time to time, Invesco will waive advisory fees payable by an
       Investing Fund (defined below) in an amount equal to 100% of the net
       advisory fee Invesco receives on the Uninvested Cash (defined below)
       from the Affiliated Money Market Fund (defined below) in which the
       Investing Fund invests (the Waiver).

       i. Invesco's Fund Accounting Group will calculate, and apply, the Waiver
          monthly, based upon the average investment of Uninvested Cash made by
          the Investing Fund during the previous month in an Affiliated Money
          Market Fund.

       ii.The Waiver will not apply to those Investing Funds that do not charge
          an advisory fee, either due to the terms of their advisory agreement,
          or as a result of contractual or voluntary fee waivers.

      iii.The Waiver will not apply to cash collateral for securities lending.

       For purposes of the paragraph above, the following terms shall have the
       following meanings:

       (a)Affiliated Money Market Fund - any existing or future Trust that
          holds itself out as a money market fund and complies with Rule 2a-7
          under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;

       (b)Investing Fund - any Fund investing Cash Balances and/or Cash
          Collateral in an Affiliated Money Market Fund; and

       (c)Uninvested Cash - cash available and uninvested by a Trust that may
          result from a variety of sources, including dividends or interest
          received on portfolio securities, unsettled securities transactions,
          strategic reserves, matured investments, proceeds from liquidation of
          investment securities, dividend payments, or new investor capital.

    2. Neither a Trust nor Invesco may remove or amend the Waiver to a Trust's
       detriment prior to the Expiration Date without requesting and receiving
       the approval of the Board of

<PAGE>

       Trustee of the applicable Fund's Trust to remove or amend such Waiver.
       Invesco will not have any right to reimbursement of any amount so waived.

   The Boards of Trustees and Invesco may terminate or modify this Memorandum
of Agreement prior to the Expiration Date only by mutual written consent.
Invesco will not have any right to reimbursement of any amount so waived or
reimbursed.

   Subject to the foregoing paragraphs, Invesco agrees to review the
then-current waivers for each class of the Funds listed on the Exhibits on a
date prior to the Expiration Date to determine whether such waivers should be
amended, continued or terminated. The waivers will expire upon the Expiration
Date unless Invesco has agreed to continue them. The Exhibits will be amended
to reflect any such agreement.

   It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the Trusts hereunder shall
not be binding upon any of the Trustees, shareholders, nominees, officers,
agents or employees of the Trusts personally, but shall only bind the assets
and property of the Funds, as provided in each Trust's Agreement and
Declaration of Trust. The execution and delivery of this Memorandum of
Agreement have been authorized by the Trustees of each Trust, and this
Memorandum of Agreement has been executed and delivered by an authorized
officer of each Trust acting as such; neither such authorization by such
Trustees nor such execution and delivery by such officer shall be deemed to
have been made by any of them individually or to impose any liability on any of
them personally, but shall bind only the assets and property of the Funds, as
provided in each Trust's Agreement and Declaration of Trust.

   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Trusts, on behalf of itself and its Funds
listed in Exhibit A and B to this Memorandum of Agreement, and Invesco have
entered into this Memorandum of Agreement as of the Effective Date on the
attached Exhibits.

                            MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
                             (EXPENSE LIMITATIONS)

   This Memorandum of Agreement is entered into as of the Effective Date on the
attached exhibits (the Exhibits), between AIM Counselor Series Trust (Invesco
Counselor Series Trust), AIM Equity Funds (Invesco Equity Funds), AIM Funds
Group (Invesco Funds Group), AIM Growth Series (Invesco Growth Series), AIM
International Mutual Funds (Invesco International Mutual Funds), AIM Investment
Funds (Invesco Investment Funds), AIM Investment Securities Funds (Invesco

Tax-Exempt Funds (Invesco Tax-Exempt Funds), AIM Variable Insurance Funds
(Invesco Variable Insurance Funds), Invesco Management Trust, Invesco Municipal
Income Opportunities Trust, Invesco Quality Municipal Income Trust, Invesco
Securities Trust, Invesco Value Municipal Income Trust and Short-Term
Investments Trust (each a Trust or, collectively, the Trusts), on behalf of
the funds listed on the Exhibits to this Memorandum of Agreement (the Funds),
and Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco). Invesco shall and hereby agrees to
waive fees or reimburse expenses of each Fund, on behalf of its respective
classes as applicable, severally and not jointly, as indicated in the attached
Exhibits.

   For and in consideration of the mutual terms and agreements set forth herein
and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
is hereby acknowledged, the Trusts and Invesco agree as follows:

   For the Contractual Limits (listed in Exhibits A - D), Invesco agrees until
at least the expiration date set forth on the attached Exhibits A - D (the
Expiration Date) that Invesco will waive its fees or reimburse expenses to
the extent that expenses of a class of a Fund (excluding (i) interest;
(ii) taxes; (iii) dividend expense on short sales; (iv) extraordinary or
non-routine items, including litigation expenses; and (v) expenses that each
Fund has incurred but did not actually pay because of an expense offset
arrangement, if applicable) exceed the rate, on an annualized basis, set forth
on the Exhibits of the average daily net assets allocable to such class.
Acquired fund fees and expenses are not fees or expenses incurred by a fund
directly but are expenses of the investment companies in which a fund invests.
These fees and expenses are incurred indirectly through the valuation of a
fund's investment in these investment companies. Acquired fund fees and
expenses are required to be disclosed and included in the total annual fund
operating expenses in the prospectus fee table. As a result, the net total
annual fund operating expenses shown in the prospectus fee table may exceed the
expense limits reflected in Exhibits A - D. With regard to the Contractual
Limits, the Board of Trustees of the Trust and Invesco may terminate or modify
this Memorandum of Agreement prior to the Expiration Date only by mutual
written consent. Invesco will not have any right to reimbursement of any amount
so waived or reimbursed.

   For the Contractual Limits, Invesco agrees to review the then-current
expense limitations for each class of each Fund listed on the Exhibits on a
date prior to the Expiration Date to determine whether such limitations should
be amended, continued or terminated. The expense limitations will expire upon
the Expiration Date unless Invesco has agreed to continue them. The Exhibits
will be amended to reflect any such agreement.

   For the Voluntary Limits (listed in Exhibits A - D), Invesco agrees that
these are not contractual in nature and that Invesco may establish, amend
and/or terminate such expense limitations at any time in its sole discretion.
Any delay or failure by Invesco to update this Memorandum of Agreement with
regards to the terminations, extensions, or expirations of the Voluntary Limits
shall have no effect on the term of such Voluntary Limitations; the Voluntary
Limitations are listed herein for informational purposes only.

   It is expressly agreed that the obligations of each Trust hereunder shall
not be binding upon any of the Trustees, shareholders, nominees, officers,
agents or employees of the Trusts personally, but shall only bind the assets
and property of each Fund, as provided in each Trust's Agreement and
Declaration of Trust. The execution and delivery of this Memorandum of
Agreement have been authorized by the Trustees of the Trusts, and this
Memorandum of Agreement has been executed and delivered by an authorized
officer of the Trusts acting as such; neither such authorization by such
Trustees nor such execution and delivery by such officer shall be deemed to
have been made by any of them individually or

<PAGE>

to impose any liability on any of them personally, but shall bind only the
assets and property of the Funds, as provided in each Trust's Agreement and
Declaration of Trust.

   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Trusts and Invesco have entered into this
Memorandum of Agreement as of the Effective Dates on the attached Exhibits.

                          EIGHTH AMENDED AND RESTATED
                            MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
                (SECURITIES LENDING ADMINISTRATIVE FEE WAIVER)

   This Eighth Amended and Restated Memorandum of Agreement is entered into as
of the dates indicated on Exhibit A between AIM Counselor Series Trust
(Invesco Counselor Series Trust), AIM Equity Funds (Invesco Equity Funds),
AIM Funds Group (Invesco Funds Group), AIM Growth Series (Invesco Growth
Series), AIM International Mutual Funds (Invesco International Mutual Funds),
AIM Investment Funds (Invesco Investment Funds), AIM Investment Securities
Funds (Invesco Investment Securities Funds), AIM Sector Funds (Invesco Sector
Funds), AIM Tax-Exempt Funds (Invesco Tax-Exempt Funds), AIM Treasurer's Series
Trust (Invesco Treasurer's Series Trust), AIM Variable Insurance Funds (Invesco
Variable Insurance Funds), Invesco Management Trust, Invesco Securities Trust
and Short-Term Investments Trust (each a Fund and collectively, the Funds),
on behalf of the portfolios listed on Exhibit A to this Memorandum of
Agreement (the Portfolios), and Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco).

   For and in consideration of the mutual terms and agreements set forth herein
and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
is hereby acknowledged, the Funds and Invesco agree as follows:

    1. Invesco agrees that until the expiration date, if any, of the commitment
       set forth on the attached Exhibit A occurs, as such Exhibit A is
       amended from time to time, Invesco will not charge any administrative
       fee under each Portfolio's advisory agreement in connection with
       securities lending activities without prior approval from the
       Portfolio's Board (such agreement is referred to as the Waiver).

    2. Neither a Fund nor Invesco may remove or amend the Waiver to a Fund's
       detriment prior to requesting and receiving the approval of the
       Portfolio's Board to remove or amend the Waiver. Invesco will not have
       any right to reimbursement of any amount so waived.

   Unless a Fund, by vote of its Board of Trustees terminates the Waiver, or a
Fund and Invesco are unable to reach an agreement on the amount of the Waiver
to which the Fund and Invesco desire to be bound, the Waiver will continue
indefinitely with respect to such Fund. Exhibit A will be amended to reflect
the new date through which a Fund and Invesco agree to be bound.

   It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the Trusts hereunder shall
not be binding upon any of the Trustees, shareholders, nominees, officers,
agents or employees of the Trusts personally, but shall only bind the assets
and property of the Funds, as provided in each Trust's Agreement and
Declaration of Trust. The execution and delivery of this Memorandum of
Agreement have been authorized by the Trustees of each Trust, and this
Memorandum of Agreement has been executed and delivered by an authorized
officer of each Trust acting as such; neither such authorization by such
Trustees nor such execution and delivery by such officer shall be deemed to
have been made by any of them individually or to impose any liability on any of
them personally, but shall bind only the assets and property of the Funds, as
provided in each Trust's Agreement and Declaration of Trust.

   Nothing in this Memorandum of Agreement is intended to affect any other
memorandum of agreement executed by any Fund or Invesco with respect to any
other fee waivers, expense reimbursements and/or expense limitations.

<PAGE>

   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each Fund, on behalf of itself and its Portfolios listed
in Exhibit A to this Memorandum of Agreement, and Invesco have entered into
this Memorandum of Agreement as of the dates indicated on Exhibit A.

                             SUB-ADVISORY CONTRACT

   This contract is made as of December 14, 2011, by and among Invesco
Advisers, Inc. (the Advisor) and Invesco PowerShares Capital Management LLC
(the Sub-Advisor).

   WHEREAS:

    A) The Advisor has entered into an investment advisory agreement with AIM
       Investment Funds (Invesco Investment Funds) (the Trust), an open-end
       management investment company registered under the Investment Company
       Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), with respect to, among others,
       the Invesco Premium Income Fund (the Fund);

    B) The Advisor is authorized to delegate any or all of its rights, duties
       and obligations under investment advisory agreements to sub-advisors,
       including sub-advisors that are affiliated with the Advisor;

    C) The Sub-Advisor represents that it is registered with the U.S.
       Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as an investment advisor
       under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act), or will be
       so registered prior to providing any services to the Fund under this
       Contract, and engages in the business of acting as an investment
       advisor; and

    D) The Sub-Advisor has been formed in part for the purpose of researching
       and compiling information and recommendations on various types of
       investments and investment techniques, and providing investment advisory
       services in connection therewith.

   NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the mutual covenants
herein contained, it is agreed between the parties hereto as follows:

1. APPOINTMENT. The Advisor hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor as a sub-advisor of
the Fund for the period and on the terms set forth herein. The Sub-Advisor
accepts such appointment and agrees to render the services herein set forth,
for the compensation herein provided.

2. DUTIES AS SUB-ADVISOR. Subject to paragraph 7 below, the Advisor may, in its
discretion, appoint the Sub-Advisor to perform one or more of the following
services with respect to all or a portion of the investments of the Fund. The
services and the portion of the investments of the Fund to be advised or
managed by the Sub-Advisor shall be as agreed upon from time to time by the
Advisor and the Sub-Advisor. The Sub-Advisor shall pay the salaries and fees of
all its personnel performing services for the Fund related to research,
statistical and investment activities.

   (a) Investment Advice. If and to the extent requested by the Advisor, the
Sub-Advisor shall provide investment advice to the Fund and the Advisor with
respect to all or a portion of the investments of the Fund or with respect to
various investment techniques, and in connection with such advice shall furnish
the Fund and the Advisor with such factual information, research reports and
investment recommendations as the Advisor may reasonably require.

   (b) Order Execution. If and to the extent requested by the Advisor, the
Sub-Advisor shall place orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio
securities or other investments for the Fund. In so doing, the Sub-Advisor
agrees that it shall comply with paragraph 3 below.

   (c) Discretionary Investment Management. If and to the extent requested by
the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor shall, subject to the supervision of the Trust's
Board of Trustees (the Board) and the Advisor, manage all or a portion of the
investments of the Fund in accordance with the investment objectives, policies
and limitations provided in the Trust's Registration Statement and such other
limitations as the Trust or the Advisor may impose with respect to the Fund by
notice to the Sub-Advisor and otherwise in accordance with paragraph 5 below.
With respect to the portion of the investments of the Fund, the Sub-Advisor is
authorized to: (i) make investment decisions on behalf of the Fund with

                                      J-1

<PAGE>

regard to any stock, bond, other security or investment instrument, including
but not limited to foreign currencies, futures, options and other derivatives,
and with regard to borrowing money; (ii) place orders for the purchase and sale
of securities or other investment instruments with such brokers and dealers as
the Sub-Advisor may select; and (iii) upon the request of the Advisor, provide
additional investment management services to the Fund, including but not
limited to managing the Fund's cash and cash equivalents and lending securities
on behalf of the Fund. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute trades for
the Fund, the Sub-Advisor will comply with its written policies and procedures
regarding brokerage and trading, which policies and procedures shall have been
approved by the Board. All discretionary investment management and any other
activities of the Sub-Advisor shall at all times be subject to the control and
direction of the Advisor and the Board.

3. BROKER-DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. The Sub-Advisor agrees that, in placing orders
with brokers and dealers, it will attempt to obtain the best net result in
terms of price and execution under the circumstances. Consistent with this
obligation, the Sub-Advisor may, in its discretion, purchase and sell portfolio
securities from and to brokers and dealers who sell shares of the Fund or
provide the Fund, the Advisor's other clients, or the Sub-Advisor's other
clients with research, analysis, advice and similar services. The Sub-Advisor
may pay to brokers and dealers, in return for such research and analysis, a
higher commission or spread than may be charged by other brokers and dealers,
subject to the Sub-Advisor determining in good faith that such commission or
spread is reasonable in terms either of the particular transaction or of the
overall responsibility of the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor to the Fund and their
other clients and that the total commissions or spreads paid by the Fund will
be reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Fund over the long term. In no
instance will portfolio securities be purchased from or sold to a Sub-Advisor,
or any affiliated person thereof, except in accordance with the applicable
securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and any exemptive
orders currently in effect. Whenever a Sub-Advisor simultaneously places orders
to purchase or sell the same security on behalf of the Fund and one or more
other accounts advised by the Sub-Advisor, such orders will be allocated as to
price and amount among all such accounts in a manner believed to be equitable
to each account.

4. BOOKS AND RECORDS. The Sub-Advisor will maintain all required books and
records with respect to the securities transactions of the Fund, and will
furnish the Board and the Advisor with such periodic and special reports as the
Board or the Advisor reasonably may request. The Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that
all records which it maintains for the Advisor are the property of the Advisor,
and agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by applicable law any records
which it maintains for the Advisor and which are required to be maintained, and
further agrees to surrender promptly to the Advisor any records which it
maintains for the Advisor upon request by the Advisor.

5. FURTHER DUTIES.

   (a) In all matters relating to the performance of this Contract, the
Sub-Advisor will act in conformity with the Agreement and Declaration of Trust,
By-Laws and Registration Statement of the Trust and with the instructions and
directions of the Advisor and the Board and will comply with the requirements
of the 1940 Act, the rules, regulations, exemptive orders and no-action
positions thereunder, and all other applicable laws and regulations.

   (b) The Sub-Advisor shall maintain compliance procedures for the Fund that
it and the Advisor reasonably believe are adequate to ensure compliance with
the federal securities laws (as defined in Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act) and
the investment objective(s) and policies as stated in the Fund's prospectus and
statement of additional information. The Sub-Advisor at its expense will
provide the Advisor or the Trust's Chief Compliance Officer with such
compliance reports relating to its duties under this Contract as may be
requested from time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sub-Advisor
will promptly report to the Advisor any material violations of the federal
securities laws (as defined in Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act) that it is or
should be aware of or of any material violation of the Sub-Advisor's compliance
policies and procedures that pertain to the Fund.

   (c) The Sub-Advisor at its expense will make available to the Board and the
Advisor at reasonable times its portfolio managers and other appropriate
personnel, either in person or, at the

                                       2

<PAGE>

mutual convenience of the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor, by telephone, in order
to review the investment policies, performance and other investment related
information regarding the Fund and to consult with the Board and the Advisor
regarding the Fund's investment affairs, including economic, statistical and
investment matters related to the Sub-Advisor's duties hereunder, and will
provide periodic reports to the Advisor relating to the investment strategies
it employs. The Sub-Advisor and its personnel shall also cooperate fully with
counsel and auditors for, and the Chief Compliance Officer of, the Advisor and
the Trust.

   (d) The Sub-Advisor will assist in the fair valuation of portfolio
securities held by the Fund. The Sub-Advisor will use its reasonable efforts to
provide, based upon its own expertise, and to arrange with parties independent
of the Sub-Advisor such as broker-dealers for the provision of, valuation
information or prices for securities for which prices are deemed by the Advisor
or the Trust's administrator not to be readily available in the ordinary course
of business from an automated pricing service. In addition, the Sub-Advisor
will assist the Fund and its agents in determining whether prices obtained for
valuation purposes accurately reflect market price information relating to the
assets of the Fund at such times as the Advisor shall reasonably request,
including but not limited to, the hours after the close of a securities market
and prior to the daily determination of the Fund's net asset value per share.

   (e) The Sub-Advisor represents and warrants that it has adopted a code of
ethics meeting the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the
requirements of Rule 204A-1 under the Advisors Act and has provided the Advisor
and the Board a copy of such code of ethics, together with evidence of its
adoption, and will promptly provide copies of any changes thereto, together
with evidence of their adoption. Upon request of the Advisor, but in any event
no less frequently than annually, the Sub-Advisor will supply the Advisor a
written report that (A) describes any issues arising under the code of ethics
or procedures since the Sub-Advisor's last report, including but not limited to
material violations of the code of ethics or procedures and sanctions imposed
in response to the material violations; and (B) certifies that the procedures
contained in the Sub-Advisor's code of ethics are reasonably designed to
prevent access persons from violating the code of ethics.

   (f) Upon request of the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor will review draft reports
to shareholders and other documents provided or available to it and provide
comments on a timely basis. In addition, the Sub-Advisor and each officer and
portfolio manager thereof designated by the Advisor will provide on a timely
basis such certifications or sub-certifications as the Advisor may reasonably
request in order to support and facilitate certifications required to be
provided by the Trust's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer and will adopt such disclosure controls and procedures in support of
the disclosure controls and procedures adopted by the Trust as the Advisor, on
behalf of the Trust, deems are reasonably necessary.

   (g) Unless otherwise directed by the Advisor or the Board, the Sub-Advisor
will vote all proxies received in accordance with the Advisor's proxy voting
policy or, if the Sub-Advisor has a proxy voting policy approved by the Board,
the Sub-Advisor's proxy voting policy. The Sub-Advisor shall maintain and shall
forward to the Fund or its designated agent such proxy voting information as is
necessary for the Fund to timely file proxy voting results in accordance with
Rule 30b1-4 of the 1940 Act.

   (h) The Sub-Advisor shall provide the Fund's custodian on each business day
with information relating to all transactions concerning the assets of the Fund
and shall provide the Advisor with such information upon request of the Advisor.

6. SERVICES NOT EXCLUSIVE. The services furnished by the Sub-Advisor hereunder
are not to be deemed exclusive and the Sub-Advisor shall be free to furnish
similar services to others so long as its services under this Contract are not
impaired thereby. Nothing in this Contract shall limit or restrict the right of
any director, officer or employee of the Sub-Advisor, who may also be a
Trustee, officer or employee of the Trust, to engage in any other business or
to devote his or her time and attention in part to the management or other
aspects of any other business, whether of a similar nature or a dissimilar
nature.

7. USE OF SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES. The Sub-Advisor may perform any or all
of the services contemplated hereunder, including but not limited to providing
investment advice to the Fund pursuant to paragraph 2(a) above and placing
orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities or other investments
for the Fund pursuant to paragraph 2(b) above, directly or through such of its
subsidiaries or other affiliates, as the Sub-Advisor shall determine; provided,
however, that performance of such services through such subsidiaries or other
affiliates shall have been approved, when required by the 1940 Act, by (i) a
vote of a majority of the independent Trustees who are not parties to this
Contract or interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of a party to
this Contract, other than as Board members (Independent Trustees), cast in
person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval, and/or
(ii) a vote of a majority of the Fund's outstanding voting securities.

8. COMPENSATION.

   (a) The only fees payable to the Sub-Advisors under this Contract are for
providing discretionary investment management services pursuant to paragraph
2(c) above. For such services, the Advisor will pay the Sub-Advisor a fee,
computed daily and paid monthly, equal to (i) 40% of the monthly compensation
that the Advisor receives from the Trust pursuant to its advisory agreement
with the Trust, multiplied by (ii) the fraction equal to the net assets of the
Fund as to which the Sub-Advisor shall have provided discretionary investment
management services pursuant to paragraph 2(c) above for that month divided by
the net assets of the Fund for that month. This fee shall be payable on or
before the last business day of the next succeeding calendar month. This fee
shall be reduced to reflect contractual or voluntary fee waivers or expense
limitations by the Advisor, if any, in effect from time to time as set forth in
paragraph 9 below. In no event shall the aggregate monthly fees paid to the
Sub-Advisor under this Contract exceed 40% of the monthly compensation that the
Advisor receives from the Trust pursuant to its advisory agreement with the
Trust, as reduced to reflect contractual or voluntary fee waivers or expense
limitations by the Advisor, if any.

   (b) If this Contract becomes effective or terminates before the end of any
month, the fees for the period from the effective date to the end of the month
or from the beginning of such month to the date of termination, as the case may
be, shall be prorated according to the proportion which such period bears to
the full month in which such effectiveness or termination occurs.

   (c) If the Sub-Advisor provides the services under paragraph 2(c) above to
the Fund for a period that is less than a full month, the fees for such period
shall be prorated according to the proportion which such period bears to the
applicable full month.

9. FEE WAIVERS AND EXPENSE LIMITATIONS. If, for any fiscal year of the Fund,
the amount of the advisory fee which the Fund would otherwise be obligated to
pay to the Advisor is reduced because of contractual or voluntary fee waivers
or expense limitations by the Advisor, the fee payable to the Sub-Advisor
pursuant to paragraph 8 above shall be reduced proportionately; and to the
extent that the Advisor reimburses the Fund as a result of such expense
limitations, the Sub-Advisor shall reimburse the Advisor that proportion of
such reimbursement payments which the fee payable to the Sub-Advisor pursuant
to paragraph 8 above bears to the advisory fee under this Contract.

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF SUB-ADVISOR AND INDEMNIFICATION. The Sub-Advisor
shall not be liable for any costs or liabilities arising from any error of
judgment or mistake of law or any loss suffered by the Fund or the Trust in
connection with the matters to which this Contract relates except a loss
resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part
of the Sub-Advisor in the performance of its duties or from reckless disregard
by the Sub-Advisor of its obligations and duties under this Contract. Any
person, even though also an officer, partner, employee, or agent of the
Sub-Advisor, who may be or become a Trustee, officer, employee or agent of the
Trust, shall be deemed, when rendering services to a Fund or the Trust or
acting with respect to any business of a Fund or the Trust, to be rendering
such service to or acting solely for the Fund or the Trust and not as an
officer, partner, employee, or agent or one under the control or direction of
the Sub-Advisor even though paid by it.

11. Duration and Termination.

   (a) This Contract shall become effective with respect to the Sub-Advisor
upon the later of the date hereabove written and the date that the Sub-Advisor
is registered with the SEC as an investment advisor under the Advisors Act, if
the Sub-Advisor is not so registered as of the date hereabove written;
provided, however, that this Contract shall not take effect with respect to the
Fund unless it has first been approved (i) by a vote of a majority of the
Independent Trustees, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of
voting on such approval, and (ii) by vote of a majority of the Fund's
outstanding voting securities, when required by the 1940 Act.

   (b) Unless sooner terminated as provided herein, this Contract shall
continue in force and effect until [June 30, 2012]. Thereafter, if not
terminated, this Contract shall continue automatically for successive periods
not to exceed twelve months each, provided that such continuance is
specifically approved at least annually (i) by a vote of a majority of the
Independent Trustees, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of
voting on such approval, and (ii) by the Board or by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund.

   (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Contract may be terminated at any
time, without the payment of any penalty, (i) by vote of the Board or by a vote
of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund on sixty days'
written notice to the Sub-Advisor; or (ii) by the Advisor on sixty days'
written notice to the Sub-Advisor; or (iii) by the Sub-Advisor on sixty days'
written notice to the Trust. Should this Contract be terminated with respect to
the Sub-Advisor, the Advisor shall assume the duties and responsibilities of
the Sub-Advisor unless and until the Advisor appoints another Sub-Advisor to
perform such duties and responsibilities. This Contract will automatically
terminate in the event of its assignment.

12. AMENDMENT. No provision of this Contract may be changed, waived, discharged
or terminated orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party
against which enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is
sought, and, when required by the 1940 Act, no amendment of this Contract shall
be effective until approved by vote of a majority of the Fund's outstanding
voting securities.

13. NOTICES. Any notices under this Contract shall be in writing, addressed and
delivered, telecopied or mailed postage paid, to the other party entitled to
receipt thereof at such address as such party may designate for the receipt of
such notice. Until further notice to the other party, it is agreed that the
address of the Trust and the Advisor shall be 11 Greenway Plaza, Suite 100,
Houston, Texas 77046-1173. Until further notice to the other party, it is
agreed that the address the Sub-Advisor shall be 301 West Roosevelt Road,
Wheaton, Illinois 60187.

14. GOVERNING LAW. This Contract shall be construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Texas and the 1940 Act. To the extent that the applicable laws
of the State of Texas conflict with the applicable provisions of the 1940 Act,
the latter shall control.

15. MISCELLANEOUS. The captions in this Contract are included for convenience
of reference only and in no way define or delimit any of the provisions hereof
or otherwise affect their construction or effect. If any provision of this
Contract shall be held or made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or
otherwise, the remainder of this Contract shall not be affected thereby. This
Contract shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors. Any question of interpretation of any
term or provision of this Contract having a counterpart in or otherwise derived
from a term or provision of the 1940 Act or the Advisors Act shall be resolved
by reference to such term or provision of the 1940 Act or the Advisors Act and
to interpretations thereof, if any, by the United States Courts or in the
absence of any controlling decision of any such court, by rules, regulations or
orders of the SEC issued pursuant to said Acts. In addition, where the effect
of a requirement of the 1940 Act or the Advisors Act reflected in any provision
of the Contract is revised by rule, regulation or order of the SEC, such
provision shall be deemed to incorporate the effect of such rule, regulation or
order.
