"419","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"420","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"

"425","<p style=margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;><font face=eyinterstate light lang=EN-US style=font-size:9.0pt;>The management of the Company is responsible"
"426","for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"427","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"428","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"429","controls. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed"
"430","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"431","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"432","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal"
"433","control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"434","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"435","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"436","of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"437","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"438","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"439","the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"440","and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"441","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"442","of a company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"443","statements.</font></p>"

"456","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"457","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
