"5612","</P>"
"5613","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	AGREEMENT made this 18th day of July, 2013, by and between FMR Co., Inc., a Massachusetts corporation with principal offices at 245 Summer Street, Boston, Massachusetts  (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Sub-Adviser&quot;) and"
"5614","Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, a Massachusetts corporation with principal offices at 245 Summer"
"5615","Street, Boston, Massachusetts (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Adviser&quot;)."
"5616","</P>"
"5617","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Adviser has entered into a Management Contract with Fidelity Salem Street Trust, a Massachusetts business trust which may issue one or more series of shares of beneficial interest (hereinafter called the"
"5618","&acute;&acute;Trust&quot;), on behalf of Fidelity Series 1000 Value Index Fund (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Fund&quot;), pursuant to which the"
"5619","Adviser is to act as investment manager and adviser to the Fund, and"
"5620","</P>"
"5621","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Sub-Adviser was formed for the purpose of providing investment management of equity and"
"5622","high income funds and advising generally with respect to equity and high income instruments<B>.</B>"
"5623","</P>"
"5624","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises hereinafter set forth, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser agree as follows:"
"5625","</P>"
"5626","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	1.	(a)  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Adviser, direct the investments of all or"
"5627","such portion of the Fund's assets as the Adviser shall designate in accordance with the investment objective, policies"
"5628","and limitations as provided in the Fund's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as amended from time to time,"
"5629","the Investment Company Act of 1940 and rules thereunder, as amended from time to time (the &acute;&acute;1940 Act&quot;), and"
"5630","such other limitations as the Fund may impose by notice in writing to the Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser"
"5631","shall also furnish for the use of the Fund office space and all necessary office facilities, equipment and personnel for"
"5632","servicing the investments of the Fund; and shall pay the salaries and fees of all personnel of the Sub-Adviser performing services for the Fund relating to research, statistical and investment activities.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with the Fund or the Adviser, to buy, sell, lend and otherwise"
"5633","trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment instruments on behalf of the Fund.  The investment"
"5634","policies and all other actions of the Fund are and shall at all times be subject to the control and direction of the"
"5635","Trust's Board of Trustees."
"5636","</P>"
"5637","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(b)  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations, information or analyses to the Trust and the"
"5638","Adviser as the Trust's Board of Trustees or the Adviser may request from time to time or as the Sub-Adviser may"
"5639","deem to be desirable.  The Sub-Adviser shall make recommendations to the Trust's Board of Trustees with respect to"
"5640","Fund policies, and shall carry out such policies as are adopted by the Trustees.  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to"
"5641","review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other services as the Sub-Adviser shall from time to time determine to"
"5642","be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under this Agreement and which are not otherwise furnished by the"
"5643","Adviser."
"5644","</P>"
"5645","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(c)  The Sub-Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Fund's account with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the"
"5646","Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices"
"5647","which are advantageous to the Fund and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"5648","Exchange Act of 1934) to the Fund and/or the other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser, Adviser or their affiliates"
"5649","exercise investment discretion.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Fund which is in excess of the"
"5650","amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Adviser"
"5651","determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"5652","research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts"
"5653","over which they exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Trust shall periodically review the commissions"
"5654","paid by the Fund to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Fund."

"5656","<P ID=C__\desktop\FMRFM813.html.2 ALIGN=LEFT>	2.	As compensation for the services to be furnished by the Sub-Adviser hereunder, the Adviser agrees"
"5657","to pay the Sub-Adviser a monthly fee equal to 50% of the management fee (including performance adjustments, if"
"5658","any) that the Fund is obligated to pay the Adviser under the Fund's Management Contract with the Adviser in respect of that portion of the Fund's assets managed by the Sub-Adviser during such month.  Such fee shall not be reduced to reflect expense reimbursements or fee waivers by the Adviser, if any, in effect from time to time."

"5660","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	3.	It is understood that Trustees, officers, and shareholders of the Trust are or may be or become interested in the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser as directors, officers or otherwise and that directors, officers and stockholders of the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser are or may be or become similarly interested in the Trust, and that the Adviser"
"5661","or the Sub-Adviser may be or become interested in the Trust as a shareholder or otherwise."
"5662","</P>"
"5663","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	4.	It is understood that the Fund will pay all its expenses other than those expressly stated to be payable"
"5664","by the Sub-Adviser hereunder or by the Adviser under the Management Contract with the Fund."

"5666","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	5.	The Services of the Sub-Adviser to the Adviser are not to be deemed to be exclusive, the Sub-Adviser being free to render services to others and engage in other activities, provided, however, that such other services"
"5667","and activities do not, during the term of this Agreement, interfere, in a material manner, with the Sub-Adviser's ability to meet all of its obligations with respect to rendering investment advice hereunder.  The Sub-Adviser shall for all"
"5668","purposes be an independent contractor and not an agent or employee of the Adviser or the Trust."
"5669","</P>"
"5670","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	6.	In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of obligations"
"5671","or duties hereunder on the part of the Sub-Adviser, the Sub-Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Advisor,"
"5672","the Trust or to any shareholder of the Fund for any act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering"
"5673","services hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security."
"5674","</P>"
"5675","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	7.	(a)	Subject to prior termination as provided in sub-paragraph (d) of this paragraph 7, this Agreement shall continue in force until September 30, 2014<B> </B>and indefinitely thereafter, but only so"

"5906","</P>"
"5907","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	1.2  <U>Scope of Investment Authority</U>.  (a)  The Subadviser is hereby authorized, on a discretionary basis,"

"5947","Subadviser will:"
"5948","</P>"
"5949","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(i)  formulate and implement a continuous investment program for the Fund;"

"5951","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(ii)  take whatever steps are necessary to implement these investment programs by the purchase and sale of securities and other investments, including the selection of brokers or dealers, the"
"5952","placing of orders for such purchases and sales in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) below"
"5953","and assuring that such purchases and sales are properly settled and cleared;"

"5967","and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Fund which is in excess of the"
"5968","amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if Subadviser"
"5969","determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage"
"5970","and research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either"

"6009","and appropriate exercise of its jurisdiction over a party, any auditor of the parties hereto, by judicial or administrative process or otherwise by applicable law or regulation."

"6014","nor any of its directors, officers or employees, shall be liable to Manager or the Trust for any loss resulting from"
"6015","Subadviser's acts or omissions as Subadviser to the Fund, except to the extent any such losses result from bad"
