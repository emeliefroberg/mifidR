"2529","management and directors of the"
"2530","company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"2531","assurance regarding prevention or"
"2532","timely detection of unauthorized"
"2533","acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"2534","companys assets that could have a"
"2535","material effect on the financial"
"2536","statements."
"2537","Because of inherent limitations,"
"2538","internal control over financial"
"2539","reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2540","misstatements.   Also, projections of"
"2541","any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"2542","future periods are subject to the risk"
"2543","that controls may become inadequate"
"2544","because of changes in conditions, or"
"2545","that the degree of compliance with the"
"2546","policies or procedures may"
"2547","deteriorate."
"2548","A deficiency in internal control over"
"2549","financial reporting exists when the"
"2550","design or operation of a control does"
"2551","not allow management or employees,"
"2552","in the normal course of performing"
"2553","their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"2554","detect misstatements on a timely"
"2555","basis.   A material weakness is a"
"2556","deficiency, or combination of"
"2557","deficiencies, in internal control over"
"2558","financial reporting, such that there is a"
"2559","reasonable possibility that a material"
"2560","misstatement of the companys annual"
"2561","or interim financial statements will not"
"2562","be prevented or detected on a timely"
"2563","basis."
"2564","Our consideration of the Funds"
"2565","internal control over financial"
"2566","reporting was for the limited purpose"
"2567","described in the first paragraph and"
"2568","would not necessarily disclose all"
"2569","deficiencies in internal control that"
"2570","might be material weaknesses under"
"2571","standards established by the Public"
"2572","Company Accounting Oversight"
"2573","Board (United States).   However, we"
"2574","noted no deficiencies in the Funds"
"2575","internal control over financial"
"2576","reporting and its operation, including"
"2577","controls for safeguarding securities,"
"2578","which we consider to be material"
"2579","weaknesses, as defined above, as of"
"2580","May 31, 2015."
