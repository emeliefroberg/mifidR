"8313","U.S. Real Estate Portfolio (the Portfolios) (twenty-six"
"8314","of the portfolios constituting Morgan Stanley"
"8315","Institutional Fund, Inc.) as of and for the period ended"
"8316","December 31, 2015, in accordance with the standards of"
"8317","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"8318","(United States), we considered their internal control over"
"8319","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"8320","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"8321","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"8322","the financial statements and to comply with the"
"8323","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"8324","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"8325","Portfolios' internal control over financial reporting."
"8326","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"8327","The management of the Portfolios is responsible for"
"8328","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"8329","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"8330","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"8331","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"8332","A company's internal control over financial reporting is"
"8333","a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"8334","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"8335","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"8336","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"8337","principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"8338","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"8339","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"8340","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"8341","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"8342","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"8343","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"8344","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"8345","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"8346","company are being made only in accordance with"
"8347","authorizations of management and directors of the"
"8348","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"8349","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"8350","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"8351","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"8352","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"8353","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"8354","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"8355","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"8356","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"8357","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"8358","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"8359","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"8360","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"8361","allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"8362","of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"8363","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"8364","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"8365","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"8366","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"8367","misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"8368","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on"
"8369","a timely basis."
"8370","Our consideration of the Portfolios' internal control over"
"8371","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"8372","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"8373","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"8374","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"8375","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"8376","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Portfolios'"
"8377","internal control over financial reporting and its"
"8378","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"8379","securities that we consider to be a material weakness as"
"8380","defined above as of December 31, 2015."
"8381","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"8382","of management and the Board of Directors of Morgan"
"8383","Stanley Institutional Fund, Inc., and the Securities and"
"8384","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"

"9814","majority of those members of the Board of Directors"
"9815","of the Fund who are not parties to this Agreement or"

"9822","Portfolio fail to approve the Agreement as provided"
"9823","herein, the Adviser may continue to serve in such"
"9824","capacity in the manner and to the extent permitted"
"9825","by the 1940 Act and Rules thereunder.  This"

"9828","penalty, by vote of a majority of the entire Board of"
"9829","Directors of the Fund or by vote of a majority of the"

"9839","subsidiary of such corporate successor which does"
"9840","not result in a change of actual control of the"
"9841","Adviser's business shall not be deemed to be an"
"9842","assignment for the purposes of this Agreement.  Any"
"9843","notice under this Agreement shall be given in"
"9844","writing, addressed and delivered or mailed postpaid,"
"9845","to the other party at any office of such party and"
"9846","shall be deemed given when received by the"
"9847","addressee."
"9848","       As used in this Section 9, the terms"
"9849","assignment, interested persons, and a vote of a
majority of the outstanding voting securities shall"
"9850","have the respective meanings set forth in"
"9851","Section 2(a)(4), Section 2(a)(19) and"
"9852","Section 2(a)(42) of the 1940 Act."
"9853","       10.	Amendment of Agreement.  This"
"9854","Agreement may be amended by mutual consent, but"
"9855","the consent of the Fund must be approved (a) by"
"9856","vote of a majority of those members of the Board of"
"9857","Directors of the Fund who are not parties to this"
"9858","Agreement or interested persons of any such party,"
"9859","cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of"

"9861","majority of the outstanding voting securities of each"
"9862","Portfolio of the Fund."
"9863","       11.	Use of Name.  The Fund agrees that"

"9865","no longer be the adviser to the Fund, the Fund will,"
"9866","within a reasonable period of time, change its name"
"9867","to delete reference to Morgan Stanley."
"9868","       12.	Severability.  If any provisions of"
"9869","this Agreement shall be held or made invalid by a"
"9870","court decision, statute, rule or otherwise, the"
"9871","remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected"
"9872","thereby."
"9873","       13.	Applicable Law.  This Agreement"
"9874","shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the"
"9875","State of New York, provided, however, that nothing"
"9876","herein shall be construed as being inconsistent with"
"9877","the 1940 Act."
"9878","       14.	Counterparts.  This Agreement"
"9879","may be executed in one or more counterparts, each"
"9880","of which shall be deemed to be an original."
"9881","	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties"
