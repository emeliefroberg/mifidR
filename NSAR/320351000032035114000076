"11550","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	This Multiple Class of Shares Plan (the &quot;Plan&quot;), when effective in accordance"
"11551","with its provisions, shall be the written plan contemplated by Rule 18f-3 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &quot;1940 Act&quot;) for the portfolios (each, a &quot;Fund&quot;) of"
"11552","the respective Fidelity Trusts (each, a &quot;Trust&quot;) as listed on Schedule I to this Plan. For"
"11553","purposes of the Plan, the term Fidelity Advisor Fund includes any Fidelity fund that offers Advisor classes of shares."

"11557","</P>"
"11558","<P ALIGN=LEFT>2. <U>Distribution and Shareholder Service Fees</U>. Distribution fees and/or shareholder service"
"11559","fees shall be calculated and paid in accordance with the terms of the then-effective plan"
"11560","pursuant to Rule 12b-l under the 1940 Act for the applicable class. Distribution and"
"11561","shareholder service fees currently authorized are as set forth in Schedule I to this Plan."

"11565","Fund. Simultaneously, a portion of the Class B shares purchased through the reinvestment of Class B dividends or capital gains distributions (&quot;Dividend Shares&quot;) will also"

"11578","shares, Class Z shares may be converted into another class of shares of the same Fund"
"11579","offered as an investment option under the Retirement Plan. Any conversion from Class Z"
"11580","shares to another class of shares of the same Fund will be preceded by written notice to"
"11581","the investor."

"11583","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	All conversions pursuant to this section 3 shall be made on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or"

"14291","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	AGREEMENT made this 1<SUP>st</SUP> day of August, 2013, by and between FMR Co., Inc., a Massachusetts corporation with principal offices at 245 Summer Street, Boston, Massachusetts (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Sub-Adviser&quot;) and"
"14292","Fidelity SelectCo, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with principal offices at 1225 17th Street, Denver,"
"14293","Colorado (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Adviser&quot;)."
"14294","</P>"
"14295","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Adviser has entered into a Management Contract with Fidelity Select Portfolios, a Massachusetts business trust which may issue one or more series of shares of beneficial interest (hereinafter called the"
"14296","&acute;&acute;Fund&quot;), on behalf of Biotechnology Portfolio (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Portfolio&quot;), pursuant to which the Adviser is"
"14297","to act as investment manager and adviser to the Portfolio, and"
"14298","</P>"
"14299","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Sub-Adviser was formed for the purpose of providing investment management of equity and"

"14301","</P>"
"14302","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises hereinafter set forth, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser agree as follows:"
"14303","</P>"
"14304","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	1.	(a)  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Adviser, direct the investments of all or"
"14305","such portion of the Portfolio's assets as the Adviser shall designate in accordance with the investment objective, policies and limitations as provided in the Portfolio's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as amended from time"
"14306","to time, the Investment Company Act of l940 and rules thereunder, as amended from time to time (the &acute;&acute;l940 Act&quot;),"
"14307","and such other limitations as the Portfolio may impose by notice in writing to the Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish for the use of the Portfolio office space and all necessary office facilities, equipment and"
"14308","personnel for servicing the investments of the Portfolio; and shall pay the salaries and fees of all personnel of the"
"14309","Sub-Adviser performing services for the Portfolio relating to research, statistical and investment activities.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with the Portfolio or the Adviser, to buy, sell,"
"14310","lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment instruments on behalf of the Portfolio.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times be subject to the control"
"14311","and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."
"14312","</P>"
"14313","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(b)  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations, information or analyses to the Fund and the"
"14314","Adviser as the Fund's Board of Trustees or the Adviser may request from time to time or as the Sub-Adviser may"
"14315","deem to be desirable.  The Sub-Adviser shall make recommendations to the Fund's Board of Trustees with respect to"
"14316","Portfolio policies, and shall carry out such policies as are adopted by the Trustees.  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to"
"14317","review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other services as the Sub-Adviser shall from time to time determine to"
"14318","be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under this Agreement and which are not otherwise furnished by the"
"14319","Adviser."
"14320","</P>"
"14321","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(c)  The Sub-Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's"
"14322","account with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the"
"14323","Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices"
"14324","which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"14325","Exchange Act of l934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser, Adviser or their affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess"
"14326","of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either"
"14327","that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to"
"14328","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the"
"14329","commissions paid by the Portfolio to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were"
"14330","reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio."

"14332","<P ID=C__\desktop\q77q1_subadvisory4.html.2 ALIGN=LEFT>	2.	As compensation for the services to be furnished by the Sub-Adviser hereunder, the Adviser agrees"
"14333","to pay the Sub-Adviser a monthly fee equal to 50% of the management fee (including performance adjustments, if"
"14334","any) that the Portfolio is obligated to pay the Adviser under the Portfolio's Management Contract with the Adviser in"
"14335","respect of that portion of the Portfolio's assets managed by the Sub-Adviser during such month.  Such fee shall not"
"14336","be reduced to reflect expense reimbursements or fee waivers by the Adviser, if any, in effect from time to time."

"14338","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	3.	It is understood that Trustees, officers, and shareholders of the Fund are or may be or become interested in the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser as directors, officers or otherwise and that directors, officers and stockholders of the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser are or may be or become similarly interested in the Fund, and that the Adviser"
"14339","or the Sub-Adviser may be or become interested in the Fund as a shareholder or otherwise."
"14340","</P>"
"14341","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	4.	It is understood that the Portfolio will pay all its expenses other than those expressly stated to be"
"14342","payable by the Sub-Adviser hereunder or by the Adviser under the Management Contract with the Portfolio, which"
"14343","expenses payable by the Portfolio shall include, without limitation, (i) interest and taxes; (ii) brokerage commissions"
"14344","and other costs in connection with the purchase or sale of securities and other investment instruments; (iii) fees and"

"14347","expenses related to the registration and qualification of the Fund and the Portfolio's shares for distribution under"
"14348","state and federal securities laws; (vii) expenses of printing and mailing reports and notices and proxy material to"
"14349","shareholders of the Portfolio; (viii) all other expenses incidental to holding meetings of the Portfolio's shareholders,"
"14350","including proxy solicitations therefor; (ix) a pro rata share, based on relative net assets of the Portfolio and other registered investment companies having Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser, of 50% of"
"14351","insurance premiums for fidelity and other coverage; (x) its proportionate share of association membership dues; (xi)"
"14352","expenses of typesetting for printing Prospectuses and Statements of Additional Information and supplements thereto;"

"14354","thereto sent to existing shareholders; and (xiii) such non-recurring or extraordinary expenses as may arise, including"
"14355","those relating to actions, suits or proceedings to which the Portfolio is a party and the legal obligation which the"

"14357","</P>"
"14358","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	5.	The Services of the Sub-Adviser to the Adviser are not to be deemed to be exclusive, the Sub-Adviser being free to render services to others and engage in other activities, provided, however, that such other services"
"14359","and activities do not, during the term of this Agreement, interfere, in a material manner, with the Sub-Adviser's ability to meet all of its obligations with respect to rendering investment advice hereunder.  The Sub-Adviser shall for all"
"14360","purposes be an independent contractor and not an agent or employee of the Adviser or the Fund."
"14361","</P>"
"14362","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	6.	In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of obligations"

"14364","the Trust or to any shareholder of the Portfolio for any act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering"

"14570","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	AGREEMENT made this 1<SUP>st</SUP> day of August, 2013, by and between FMR Co., Inc., a Massachusetts corporation with principal offices at 245 Summer Street, Boston, Massachusetts (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Sub-Adviser&quot;) and"
"14571","Fidelity SelectCo, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with principal offices at 1225 17th Street, Denver,"
"14572","Colorado (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Adviser&quot;)."
"14573","</P>"
"14574","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Adviser has entered into a Management Contract with Fidelity Select Portfolios, a Massachusetts business trust which may issue one or more series of shares of beneficial interest (hereinafter called the"
"14575","&acute;&acute;Fund&quot;), on behalf of Brokerage and Investment Management Portfolio (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Portfolio&quot;), pursuant to which the Adviser is to act as investment manager and adviser to the Portfolio, and"
"14576","</P>"
"14577","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Sub-Adviser was formed for the purpose of providing investment management of equity and"
"14578","high income funds and advising generally with respect to equity and high income instruments<B>.</B>"
"14579","</P>"
"14580","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises hereinafter set forth, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser agree as follows:"
"14581","</P>"
"14582","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	1.	(a)  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Adviser, direct the investments of all or"
"14583","such portion of the Portfolio's assets as the Adviser shall designate in accordance with the investment objective, policies and limitations as provided in the Portfolio's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as amended from time"
"14584","to time, the Investment Company Act of l940 and rules thereunder, as amended from time to time (the &acute;&acute;l940 Act&quot;),"
"14585","and such other limitations as the Portfolio may impose by notice in writing to the Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish for the use of the Portfolio office space and all necessary office facilities, equipment and"
"14586","personnel for servicing the investments of the Portfolio; and shall pay the salaries and fees of all personnel of the"
"14587","Sub-Adviser performing services for the Portfolio relating to research, statistical and investment activities.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with the Portfolio or the Adviser, to buy, sell,"
"14588","lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment instruments on behalf of the Portfolio.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times be subject to the control"
"14589","and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."
"14590","</P>"
"14591","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(b)  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations, information or analyses to the Fund and the"
"14592","Adviser as the Fund's Board of Trustees or the Adviser may request from time to time or as the Sub-Adviser may"
"14593","deem to be desirable.  The Sub-Adviser shall make recommendations to the Fund's Board of Trustees with respect to"
"14594","Portfolio policies, and shall carry out such policies as are adopted by the Trustees.  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to"
"14595","review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other services as the Sub-Adviser shall from time to time determine to"
"14596","be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under this Agreement and which are not otherwise furnished by the"
"14597","Adviser."
"14598","</P>"
"14599","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(c)  The Sub-Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's"
"14600","account with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the"
"14601","Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices"
"14602","which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"14603","Exchange Act of l934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser, Adviser or their affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess"
"14604","of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either"
"14605","that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to"
"14606","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the"
"14607","commissions paid by the Portfolio to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were"
"14608","reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio."
"14609","</P>"
"14610","<P ID=C__\desktop\q77q1_subadvisory5.html.2 ALIGN=LEFT>	2.	As compensation for the services to be furnished by the Sub-Adviser hereunder, the Adviser agrees"
"14611","to pay the Sub-Adviser a monthly fee equal to 50% of the management fee (including performance adjustments, if"
"14612","any) that the Portfolio is obligated to pay the Adviser under the Portfolio's Management Contract with the Adviser in"
"14613","respect of that portion of the Portfolio's assets managed by the Sub-Adviser during such month.  Such fee shall not"
"14614","be reduced to reflect expense reimbursements or fee waivers by the Adviser, if any, in effect from time to time."
"14615","</P>"
"14616","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	3.	It is understood that Trustees, officers, and shareholders of the Fund are or may be or become interested in the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser as directors, officers or otherwise and that directors, officers and stockholders of the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser are or may be or become similarly interested in the Fund, and that the Adviser"
"14617","or the Sub-Adviser may be or become interested in the Fund as a shareholder or otherwise."
"14618","</P>"
"14619","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	4.	It is understood that the Portfolio will pay all its expenses other than those expressly stated to be"
"14620","payable by the Sub-Adviser hereunder or by the Adviser under the Management Contract with the Portfolio, which"
"14621","expenses payable by the Portfolio shall include, without limitation, (i) interest and taxes; (ii) brokerage commissions"
"14622","and other costs in connection with the purchase or sale of securities and other investment instruments; (iii) fees and"
"14623","expenses of the Fund's Trustees other than those who are &acute;&acute;interested persons&quot; of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser or the"
"14624","Adviser; (iv) legal and audit expenses; (v) custodian, registrar and transfer agent fees and expenses; (vi) fees and"
"14625","expenses related to the registration and qualification of the Fund and the Portfolio's shares for distribution under"
"14626","state and federal securities laws; (vii) expenses of printing and mailing reports and notices and proxy material to"
"14627","shareholders of the Portfolio; (viii) all other expenses incidental to holding meetings of the Portfolio's shareholders,"
"14628","including proxy solicitations therefor; (ix) a pro rata share, based on relative net assets of the Portfolio and other registered investment companies having Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser, of 50% of"
"14629","insurance premiums for fidelity and other coverage; (x) its proportionate share of association membership dues; (xi)"
"14630","expenses of typesetting for printing Prospectuses and Statements of Additional Information and supplements thereto;"
"14631","(xii) expenses of printing and mailing Prospectuses and Statements of Additional Information and supplements"
"14632","thereto sent to existing shareholders; and (xiii) such non-recurring or extraordinary expenses as may arise, including"
"14633","those relating to actions, suits or proceedings to which the Portfolio is a party and the legal obligation which the"
"14634","Portfolio may have to indemnify the Fund's Trustees and officers with respect thereto."
"14635","</P>"
"14636","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	5.	The Services of the Sub-Adviser to the Adviser are not to be deemed to be exclusive, the Sub-Adviser being free to render services to others and engage in other activities, provided, however, that such other services"
"14637","and activities do not, during the term of this Agreement, interfere, in a material manner, with the Sub-Adviser's ability to meet all of its obligations with respect to rendering investment advice hereunder.  The Sub-Adviser shall for all"
"14638","purposes be an independent contractor and not an agent or employee of the Adviser or the Fund."
"14639","</P>"
"14640","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	6.	In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of obligations"
"14641","or duties hereunder on the part of the Sub-Adviser, the Sub-Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Advisor,"
"14642","the Trust or to any shareholder of the Portfolio for any act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering"
"14643","services hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security."
"14644","</P>"
"14645","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	7.	(a)	Subject to prior termination as provided in sub-paragraph (d) of this paragraph 7, this Agreement shall continue in force until July 31, 2015, and indefinitely thereafter, but only so long as"
"14646","the continuance after such period shall be specifically approved at least annually by vote of the"
"14647","Fund's Board of Trustees or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Portfolio."
"14648","</P>"
"14649","<P ALIGN=LEFT>(b)	This Agreement may be modified by mutual consent subject to the provisions of Section 15 of the"
"14650","1940 Act, as modified by or interpreted by any applicable order or orders of the Securities and"
"14651","Exchange Commission (the &quot;Commission&quot;) or any rules or regulations adopted by, or interpretive"

"14653","</P>"
"14654","<P ID=C__\desktop\q77q1_subadvisory5.html.3 ALIGN=LEFT>(c)	In addition to the requirements of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph 7, the terms of any"

"14656","of those Trustees of the Fund who are not parties to such Agreement or interested persons of any"
"14657","such party, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval."
"14658","</P>"
"14659","<P ALIGN=LEFT>(d)	Either the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser or the Portfolio may, at any time on sixty (60) days' prior"
"14660","written notice to the other parties, terminate this Agreement, without payment of any penalty, by"
"14661","action of its Board of Trustees or Directors, or by vote of a majority of its outstanding voting securities.  This Agreement shall terminate automatically upon the termination of the Management"
"14662","Contract between the Fund, on behalf of the Portfolio, and the Adviser.  This Agreement shall"
"14663","terminate automatically in the event of its assignment."
"14664","</P>"
"14665","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	8.	The Sub-Adviser is hereby expressly put on notice of the limitation of shareholder liability as set"
"14666","forth in the Declaration of Trust or other organizational document of the Fund and agrees that any obligations of the"
"14667","Fund or the Portfolio arising in connection with this Agreement shall be limited in all cases to the Portfolio and its"
"14668","assets, and the Sub-Adviser shall not seek satisfaction of any such obligation from the shareholders or any shareholder of the Portfolio.  Nor shall the Sub-Adviser seek satisfaction of any such obligation from the Trustees or any"

"15685","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	AGREEMENT made this 1<SUP>st</SUP> day of August, 2013, by and between FMR Co., Inc., a Massachusetts corporation with principal offices at 245 Summer Street, Boston, Massachusetts (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Sub-Adviser&quot;) and"
"15686","Fidelity SelectCo, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with principal offices at 1225 17th Street, Denver,"

"15689","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Adviser has entered into a Management Contract with Fidelity Select Portfolios, a Massachusetts business trust which may issue one or more series of shares of beneficial interest (hereinafter called the"

"15692","</P>"
"15693","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Sub-Adviser was formed for the purpose of providing investment management of equity and"

"15695","</P>"
"15696","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises hereinafter set forth, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser agree as follows:"
"15697","</P>"
"15698","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	1.	(a)  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Adviser, direct the investments of all or"
"15699","such portion of the Portfolio's assets as the Adviser shall designate in accordance with the investment objective, policies and limitations as provided in the Portfolio's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as amended from time"
"15700","to time, the Investment Company Act of l940 and rules thereunder, as amended from time to time (the &acute;&acute;l940 Act&quot;),"
"15701","and such other limitations as the Portfolio may impose by notice in writing to the Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish for the use of the Portfolio office space and all necessary office facilities, equipment and"
"15702","personnel for servicing the investments of the Portfolio; and shall pay the salaries and fees of all personnel of the"
"15703","Sub-Adviser performing services for the Portfolio relating to research, statistical and investment activities.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with the Portfolio or the Adviser, to buy, sell,"
"15704","lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment instruments on behalf of the Portfolio.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times be subject to the control"
"15705","and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."
"15706","</P>"
"15707","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(b)  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations, information or analyses to the Fund and the"
"15708","Adviser as the Fund's Board of Trustees or the Adviser may request from time to time or as the Sub-Adviser may"
"15709","deem to be desirable.  The Sub-Adviser shall make recommendations to the Fund's Board of Trustees with respect to"
"15710","Portfolio policies, and shall carry out such policies as are adopted by the Trustees.  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to"
"15711","review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other services as the Sub-Adviser shall from time to time determine to"
"15712","be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under this Agreement and which are not otherwise furnished by the"
"15713","Adviser."
"15714","</P>"
"15715","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(c)  The Sub-Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's"
"15716","account with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the"
"15717","Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices"
"15718","which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"15719","Exchange Act of l934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser, Adviser or their affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess"
"15720","of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either"
"15721","that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to"
"15722","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the"
"15723","commissions paid by the Portfolio to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were"
"15724","reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio."

"15727","to pay the Sub-Adviser a monthly fee equal to 50% of the management fee (including performance adjustments, if"
"15728","any) that the Portfolio is obligated to pay the Adviser under the Portfolio's Management Contract with the Adviser in"
"15729","respect of that portion of the Portfolio's assets managed by the Sub-Adviser during such month.  Such fee shall not"

"15743","shareholders of the Portfolio; (viii) all other expenses incidental to holding meetings of the Portfolio's shareholders,"
"15744","including proxy solicitations therefor; (ix) a pro rata share, based on relative net assets of the Portfolio and other registered investment companies having Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser, of 50% of"
"15745","insurance premiums for fidelity and other coverage; (x) its proportionate share of association membership dues; (xi)"
"15746","expenses of typesetting for printing Prospectuses and Statements of Additional Information and supplements thereto;"

"15752","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	5.	The Services of the Sub-Adviser to the Adviser are not to be deemed to be exclusive, the Sub-Adviser being free to render services to others and engage in other activities, provided, however, that such other services"
"15753","and activities do not, during the term of this Agreement, interfere, in a material manner, with the Sub-Adviser's ability to meet all of its obligations with respect to rendering investment advice hereunder.  The Sub-Adviser shall for all"

"15964","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	AGREEMENT made this 1<SUP>st</SUP> day of August, 2013, by and between FMR Co., Inc., a Massachusetts corporation with principal offices at 245 Summer Street, Boston, Massachusetts (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Sub-Adviser&quot;) and"
"15965","Fidelity SelectCo, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with principal offices at 1225 17th Street, Denver,"
"15966","Colorado (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Adviser&quot;)."
"15967","</P>"
"15968","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Adviser has entered into a Management Contract with Fidelity Select Portfolios, a Massachusetts business trust which may issue one or more series of shares of beneficial interest (hereinafter called the"
"15969","&acute;&acute;Fund&quot;), on behalf of Consumer Discretionary Portfolio (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Portfolio&quot;), pursuant to which the"
"15970","Adviser is to act as investment manager and adviser to the Portfolio, and"
"15971","</P>"
"15972","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Sub-Adviser was formed for the purpose of providing investment management of equity and"
"15973","high income funds and advising generally with respect to equity and high income instruments<B>.</B>"
"15974","</P>"
"15975","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises hereinafter set forth, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser agree as follows:"
"15976","</P>"
"15977","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	1.	(a)  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Adviser, direct the investments of all or"
"15978","such portion of the Portfolio's assets as the Adviser shall designate in accordance with the investment objective, policies and limitations as provided in the Portfolio's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as amended from time"
"15979","to time, the Investment Company Act of l940 and rules thereunder, as amended from time to time (the &acute;&acute;l940 Act&quot;),"
"15980","and such other limitations as the Portfolio may impose by notice in writing to the Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish for the use of the Portfolio office space and all necessary office facilities, equipment and"
"15981","personnel for servicing the investments of the Portfolio; and shall pay the salaries and fees of all personnel of the"
"15982","Sub-Adviser performing services for the Portfolio relating to research, statistical and investment activities.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with the Portfolio or the Adviser, to buy, sell,"
"15983","lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment instruments on behalf of the Portfolio.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times be subject to the control"
"15984","and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."
"15985","</P>"
"15986","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(b)  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations, information or analyses to the Fund and the"
"15987","Adviser as the Fund's Board of Trustees or the Adviser may request from time to time or as the Sub-Adviser may"
"15988","deem to be desirable.  The Sub-Adviser shall make recommendations to the Fund's Board of Trustees with respect to"
"15989","Portfolio policies, and shall carry out such policies as are adopted by the Trustees.  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to"
"15990","review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other services as the Sub-Adviser shall from time to time determine to"
"15991","be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under this Agreement and which are not otherwise furnished by the"
"15992","Adviser."
"15993","</P>"
"15994","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(c)  The Sub-Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's"
"15995","account with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the"
"15996","Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices"
"15997","which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"15998","Exchange Act of l934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser, Adviser or their affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess"
"15999","of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either"
"16000","that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to"
"16001","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the"
"16002","commissions paid by the Portfolio to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were"
"16003","reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio."
"16004","</P>"
"16005","<P ID=C__\desktop\q77q1_subadvisory10.html.2 ALIGN=LEFT>	2.	As compensation for the services to be furnished by the Sub-Adviser hereunder, the Adviser agrees"
"16006","to pay the Sub-Adviser a monthly fee equal to 50% of the management fee (including performance adjustments, if"
"16007","any) that the Portfolio is obligated to pay the Adviser under the Portfolio's Management Contract with the Adviser in"
"16008","respect of that portion of the Portfolio's assets managed by the Sub-Adviser during such month.  Such fee shall not"
"16009","be reduced to reflect expense reimbursements or fee waivers by the Adviser, if any, in effect from time to time."
"16010","</P>"
"16011","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	3.	It is understood that Trustees, officers, and shareholders of the Fund are or may be or become interested in the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser as directors, officers or otherwise and that directors, officers and stockholders of the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser are or may be or become similarly interested in the Fund, and that the Adviser"
"16012","or the Sub-Adviser may be or become interested in the Fund as a shareholder or otherwise."
"16013","</P>"
"16014","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	4.	It is understood that the Portfolio will pay all its expenses other than those expressly stated to be"
"16015","payable by the Sub-Adviser hereunder or by the Adviser under the Management Contract with the Portfolio, which"
"16016","expenses payable by the Portfolio shall include, without limitation, (i) interest and taxes; (ii) brokerage commissions"
"16017","and other costs in connection with the purchase or sale of securities and other investment instruments; (iii) fees and"
"16018","expenses of the Fund's Trustees other than those who are &acute;&acute;interested persons&quot; of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser or the"
"16019","Adviser; (iv) legal and audit expenses; (v) custodian, registrar and transfer agent fees and expenses; (vi) fees and"
"16020","expenses related to the registration and qualification of the Fund and the Portfolio's shares for distribution under"
"16021","state and federal securities laws; (vii) expenses of printing and mailing reports and notices and proxy material to"
"16022","shareholders of the Portfolio; (viii) all other expenses incidental to holding meetings of the Portfolio's shareholders,"
"16023","including proxy solicitations therefor; (ix) a pro rata share, based on relative net assets of the Portfolio and other registered investment companies having Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser, of 50% of"
"16024","insurance premiums for fidelity and other coverage; (x) its proportionate share of association membership dues; (xi)"
"16025","expenses of typesetting for printing Prospectuses and Statements of Additional Information and supplements thereto;"
"16026","(xii) expenses of printing and mailing Prospectuses and Statements of Additional Information and supplements"
"16027","thereto sent to existing shareholders; and (xiii) such non-recurring or extraordinary expenses as may arise, including"
"16028","those relating to actions, suits or proceedings to which the Portfolio is a party and the legal obligation which the"
"16029","Portfolio may have to indemnify the Fund's Trustees and officers with respect thereto."
"16030","</P>"
"16031","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	5.	The Services of the Sub-Adviser to the Adviser are not to be deemed to be exclusive, the Sub-Adviser being free to render services to others and engage in other activities, provided, however, that such other services"
"16032","and activities do not, during the term of this Agreement, interfere, in a material manner, with the Sub-Adviser's ability to meet all of its obligations with respect to rendering investment advice hereunder.  The Sub-Adviser shall for all"
"16033","purposes be an independent contractor and not an agent or employee of the Adviser or the Fund."
"16034","</P>"
"16035","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	6.	In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of obligations"
"16036","or duties hereunder on the part of the Sub-Adviser, the Sub-Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Advisor,"
"16037","the Trust or to any shareholder of the Portfolio for any act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering"
"16038","services hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security."
"16039","</P>"
"16040","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	7.	(a)	Subject to prior termination as provided in sub-paragraph (d) of this paragraph 7, this Agreement shall continue in force until July 31, 2015, and indefinitely thereafter, but only so long as"
"16041","the continuance after such period shall be specifically approved at least annually by vote of the"
"16042","Fund's Board of Trustees or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Portfolio."
"16043","</P>"
"16044","<P ALIGN=LEFT>(b)	This Agreement may be modified by mutual consent subject to the provisions of Section 15 of the"
"16045","1940 Act, as modified by or interpreted by any applicable order or orders of the Securities and"

"16048","</P>"
"16049","<P ID=C__\desktop\q77q1_subadvisory10.html.3 ALIGN=LEFT>(c)	In addition to the requirements of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph 7, the terms of any"

"16052","such party, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval."
"16053","</P>"
"16054","<P ALIGN=LEFT>(d)	Either the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser or the Portfolio may, at any time on sixty (60) days' prior"
"16055","written notice to the other parties, terminate this Agreement, without payment of any penalty, by"
"16056","action of its Board of Trustees or Directors, or by vote of a majority of its outstanding voting securities.  This Agreement shall terminate automatically upon the termination of the Management"
"16057","Contract between the Fund, on behalf of the Portfolio, and the Adviser.  This Agreement shall"
"16058","terminate automatically in the event of its assignment."
"16059","</P>"
"16060","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	8.	The Sub-Adviser is hereby expressly put on notice of the limitation of shareholder liability as set"

"16062","Fund or the Portfolio arising in connection with this Agreement shall be limited in all cases to the Portfolio and its"
"16063","assets, and the Sub-Adviser shall not seek satisfaction of any such obligation from the shareholders or any shareholder of the Portfolio.  Nor shall the Sub-Adviser seek satisfaction of any such obligation from the Trustees or any"

"21097","research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor has with respect to accounts over which it"
"21098","exercises investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Trust shall periodically review the commissions paid by the"

"21119","pursuant to its management contract with respect to the Portfolio) (the minimum fee described in this proviso"
"21120","being referred to herein as the &quot;Minimum Investment Management Fee&quot;).  If in any fiscal year the aggregate"
"21121","expenses of the Portfolio exceed any applicable expense limitation imposed by any state or federal securities"
"21122","laws or regulations, and the Advisor waives all or a portion of its management fee or reimburses the Portfolio"

"21344","</P>"
"21345","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(b) <I><U>Investment Management</U>:</I>  If and to the extent requested by the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor shall, subject to"
"21346","the supervision of the Advisor, manage all or a portion of the investments of the Portfolio in accordance with"
"21347","the investment objective, policies and limitations provided in the Portfolio's Prospectus or other governing"
"21348","instruments, as amended from time to time, the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &quot;1940 Act&quot;) and rules"
"21349","thereunder, as amended from time to time, and such other limitations as the Trust or Advisor may impose"
"21350","with respect to the Portfolio by notice to the Sub-Advisor.  With respect to the portion of the investments of"
"21351","the Portfolio under its management, the Sub-Advisor is authorized to make investment decisions on behalf of"
"21352","the Portfolio with regard to any stock, bond, other security or investment instrument, and to place orders for"
"21353","the purchase and sale of such securities through such broker-dealers as the Sub-Advisor may select.  The Sub-Advisor may also be authorized, but only to the extent such duties are delegated in writing by the Advisor, to"
"21354","provide additional investment management services to the Portfolio, including but not limited to services"
"21355","such as managing foreign currency investments, purchasing and selling or writing futures and options contracts, borrowing money or lending securities on behalf of the Portfolio.  All investment management and any"

"21369","Advisor or Sub-Advisor.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices"
"21370","which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"21371","Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or to the other accounts over which the Sub-Advisor or Advisor exercise"

"21375","determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"21376","research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor has with respect to accounts over which it"
"21377","exercises investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Trust shall periodically review the commissions paid by the"
"21378","Portfolio to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the"

"21385","the Advisor agrees to pay the Sub-Advisor a monthly Sub-Advisory Fee.  The Sub-Advisory Fee shall be"
"21386","equal to 110% of the Sub-Advisor's costs incurred in connection with rendering the services referred to in"
"21387","subparagraph (a) of paragraph 1 of this Agreement.  The Sub-Advisory Fee shall not be reduced to reflect"

"21390","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(b) <I><U>Investment Management Fee</U>:</I>  For services provided under subparagraph (b) of paragraph 1 of this Agreement, the Advisor agrees to pay the Sub-Advisor a monthly Investment Management Fee.  The Investment"
"21391","Management Fee shall be equal to: (i) 50% of the monthly management fee rate (including performance adjustments, if any) that the Portfolio is obligated to pay the Advisor under its Management Contract with the"
"21392","Advisor, multiplied by: (ii) the fraction equal to the net assets of the Portfolio as to which the Sub-Advisor"
"21393","shall have provided investment management services divided by the net assets of the Portfolio for that month;"
"21394","provided, however, that the Investment Management Fee paid to the Sub-Advisor for any period hereunder"
"21395","shall in all circumstances be an amount not less than 110% of the Sub-Advisor's costs incurred in connection"
"21396","with rendering the services referred to in subparagraph (b) of paragraph 1 of this Agreement (but in no event"
"21397","will the Investment Management Fee paid to the Sub-Advisor exceed the management fee paid to the Advisor"
"21398","pursuant to its management contract with respect to the Portfolio) (the minimum fee described in this proviso"
"21399","being referred to herein as the &quot;Minimum Investment Management Fee&quot;).  If in any fiscal year the aggregate"
"21400","expenses of the Portfolio exceed any applicable expense limitation imposed by any state or federal securities"
"21401","laws or regulations, and the Advisor waives all or a portion of its management fee or reimburses the Portfolio"
"21402","for expenses to the extent required to satisfy such limitation, the Investment Management Fee paid to the"
"21403","Sub-Advisor will be reduced by 50% of the amount of such waivers or reimbursements multiplied by the fraction determined in (ii), subject to the Minimum Investment Management Fee.  If the Sub-Advisor reduces its"
"21404","fees to reflect such waivers or reimbursements and the Advisor subsequently recovers all or any portion of"
"21405","such waivers or reimbursements, then the Sub-Advisor shall be entitled to receive from the Advisor a proportionate share of the amount recovered."

"21407","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(c)<I> <U>Provision of Multiple Services</U>:</I>  If the Sub-Advisor shall have provided both investment advisory services"
"21408","under subparagraph (a) and investment management services under subparagraph (b) of paragraph (1) for the"

"21412","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	5.  <U>Expenses</U>: It is understood that the Portfolio will pay all of its expenses other than those expressly stated to"

"21417","and stockholders of the Advisor or the Sub-Advisor are or may be or become similarly interested in the Trust, and"
"21418","that the Advisor or the Sub-Advisor may be or become interested in the Trust as a shareholder or otherwise."
"21419","</P>"
"21420","<P ID=C__\desktop\q77q1_subadvisory42.html.3 ALIGN=LEFT>	7.  <U>Services to Other Companies or Accounts</U>:  The services of the Sub-Advisor to the Advisor are not to be"

The Sub-Advisor shall for all"
"21422","purposes be an independent contractor and not an agent or employee of the Advisor or the Trust."

"21426","the Advisor, the Trust or to any shareholder of the Portfolio for any act or omission in the course of, or connected"

"21902","</P>"
"21903","<P ALIGN=LEFT>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Fidelity Select Portfolios: Chemicals Portfolio,"
"21904","Gold Portfolio, Materials Portfolio, Consumer Staples Portfolio, Air Transportation Portfolio, Defense and"
"21905","Aerospace Portfolio, Industrial Equipment Portfolio, Transportation Portfolio, Industrials Portfolio, Environment"
"21906","and Alternative Energy Portfolio, Telecommunications Portfolio and Wireless Portfolio as of and for the year ended"
"21907","February 28, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"21908","States), we considered the Trust's internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"21909","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"21910","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,  but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"21911","on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"21912","opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"21913","</P>"
"21914","<P ALIGN=LEFT>The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"21915","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"21916","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"21917","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"21918","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"21919","company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"21920","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"21921","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"21922","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"21923","and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"21924","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"21925","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"21926","</P>"
"21927","<P ALIGN=LEFT>Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"21928","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"21929","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"21930","deteriorate."
"21931","</P>"
"21932","<P ALIGN=LEFT>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"21933","allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"21934","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"21935","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Trust's"
"21936","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
