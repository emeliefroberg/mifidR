"513","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"514","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"515","Federated Total Return Government Bond Fund:"
"516","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"517","financial statements of Federated Total"
"518","Return Government Bond Fund (the Fund) as of"
"519","and for the year ended February 29,"
"520","2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"521","Company Accounting Oversight"
"522","Board (United States), we considered the Fund's"
"523","internal control over financial reporting,"
"524","including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"525","as a basis for designing our auditing"
"526","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"527","on the financial statements and to"
"528","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"529","for the purpose of expressing an"
"530","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"531","control over financial reporting."
"532","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"533","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"534","establishing and maintaining effective"
"535","internal control over financial reporting."
"536","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"537","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"538","expected benefits and related costs"
"539","of controls. A company's internal control over financial"
"540","reporting is a process designed to"
"541","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability"
"542","of financial reporting and the"
"543","preparation of financial statements for external"
"544","purposes in accordance with generally"
"545","accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal"
"546","control over financial reporting"
"547","includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"548","pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"549","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"550","the transactions and dispositions of the"
"551","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"552","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"553","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"554","statements in accordance with generally"
"555","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"556","and expenditures of the company are"
"557","being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"558","of management and directors of the"
"559","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"560","regarding prevention or timely detection"
"561","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"562","of a company's assets that could have a"
"563","material effect on the financial statements."
"564","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"565","control over financial reporting may not"
"566","prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"567","of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"568","future periods are subject to the risk that controls"
"569","may become inadequate because of"
"570","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"571","compliance with the policies or procedures"
"572","may deteriorate."
"573","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"574","reporting exists when the design or"
"575","operation of a control does not allow management"
"576","or employees, in the normal course of"
"577","performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"578","or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"579","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"580","combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"581","over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"582","reasonable possibility that a material"
"583","misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"584","financial statements will not be"
"585","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"586","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control"
"587","over financial reporting was for the"
"588","limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"589","and would not necessarily disclose all"
"590","deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"591","material weaknesses under standards"
"592","established by the Public Company Accounting"
"593","Oversight Board (United States)."
"594","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"595","internal control over financial reporting"
"596","and its operation, including controls over"
"597","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"598","material weakness as defined above"
"599","as of February 29, 2012."
"600","This report is intended solely for the"
"601","information and use of management and the Board"
"602","of Trustees of the Fund and the Securities"
"603","and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"604","to be, and should not be, used by anyone"
"605","other than these specified parties."

"617","LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"618","Since February 2004, Federated and related"
"619","entities (collectively, Federated) have"
"620","been named as defendants in several lawsuits,"
"621","that were consolidated into a single"
"622","action in the United States District Court for"
"623","the Western District of Pennsylvania,"
"624","alleging excessive advisory fees involving one"
"625","of the Federated-sponsored mutual"

"628","with the Plaintiffs in these cases in April 2011."
