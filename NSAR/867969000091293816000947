"792","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"793","To the Board of Trustees of MFS Institutional Trust and the Shareholders of MFS"
"794","Institutional International Equity Fund and MFS Institutional Large Cap Value"
"795","Fund:"
"796","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of MFS"
"797","Institutional International Equity Fund and MFS Institutional Large Cap Value"
"798","Fund (the Funds) (each a series of MFS Institutional Trust) as of and for the"
"799","year ended June 30, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"800","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"801","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"802","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"803","expressing our opinions on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"804","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"805","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"806","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"807","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"808","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"809","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"810","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"811","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"812","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"813","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"814","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"815","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"816","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"817","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"818","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"819","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"820","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"821","in accordance with authorizations of management of the fund and trustees of the"
"822","trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"823","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets"
"824","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"825","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"826","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"827","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"828","inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance"
"829","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"830","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"831","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"832","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"833","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"834","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"835","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a fund's"
"836","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"837","timely basis."
"838","<PAGE>"
"839","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"840","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"841","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"842","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"843","Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"844","Funds' internal control over financial reporting and their operation, including"
"845","controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material"
"846","weakness, as defined above, as of June 30, 2016."
"847","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management, the"
"848","Board of Trustees of MFS Institutional Trust and the Securities and Exchange"
"849","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"850","these specified parties."

"880","                           TO THE DECLARATION OF TRUST"
"881","      Pursuant  to  Section 9.3 of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust"
"882","dated December 16, 2004,  as  amended  (the Declaration), of MFS Institutional"
"883","Trust,  a  business  trust organized under  the  laws  of  The  Commonwealth  of"
"884","Massachusetts (the Trust),  the  undersigned,  constituting  a majority of the"
"885","Trustees of the Trust, do hereby amend the following Sections of the Declaration"
"886","to be effective on May 2, 2016."
"887","      Pursuant  to Section 9.3 of the Declaration, the undersigned  Trustees  of"
"888","the Trust, being a majority of the Trustees of the Trust, hereby replace Article"
"889","V, Section 5.7 of the Declaration to read in its entirety as follows:"
"890","      Section 5.7.   Claims. As used herein, a direct Shareholder claim shall
      refer to (i) a claim  based  upon  alleged  violations  of a Shareholder's
      individual  rights  independent  of  any  harm  to the Trust, including  a
      Shareholder's voting rights under Section 6.8 hereof,  rights to receive a
      dividend payment as may be declared from time to time, rights  to  inspect
      books and records, or other similar rights personal to the Shareholder and
      independent  of any harm to the Trust; and (ii) a claim for which a direct
      shareholder action is expressly provided under the U.S. federal securities
      laws. Any claim asserted by a Shareholder that is not a direct Shareholder
      claim, including without limitation any claims purporting to be brought on
      behalf of the  Trust  or involving any alleged harm to the Trust, shall be
      considered a derivative claim as used herein.

            a. Derivative Claims.  No  Shareholder shall have the right to bring
            or  maintain  any  court action  or  other  proceeding  asserting  a
            derivative claim or  any  claim  asserted  on behalf of the Trust or
            involving any alleged harm to the Trust without  first making demand
            on  the Trustees requesting the Trustees to bring or  maintain  such
            action,  proceeding or claim. Such demand shall be excused only when
            the plaintiff  makes a specific showing that irreparable nonmonetary
            injury to the Trust  or  any series or class thereof would otherwise
            result, or if a majority of  the Board of Trustees, or a majority of
            any committee established to consider the merits of such action, has
            a material personal financial  interest  in  the  action at issue. A
            Trustee shall not be deemed to have a personal financial interest in
            an action or otherwise be disqualified from ruling  on a Shareholder
            demand by virtue of the fact that such Trustee receives remuneration
            from his or her service on the Board of Trustees of the  Trust or on
            the boards of one or more investment companies with the same  or  an
            affiliated  investment adviser or underwriter, or the amount of such
            remuneration.  Such  demand  shall be mailed to the Secretary of the
            Trust at the Trust's principal  office  and  shall  set  forth  with
            particularity the nature of the proposed court action, proceeding or
            claim  and  the  essential  facts  relied upon by the shareholder to
            support  the  allegations made in the  demand.  The  Trustees  shall
            consider such demand  within 90 days of its receipt by the Trust. In
            their sole discretion,  the Trustees may submit the matter to a vote
            of shareholders of the Trust  or  series  or  class  of  Shares,  as
            appropriate.  Any  decision  by  the  Trustees to bring, maintain or
            settle  (or  not to bring, maintain or settle)  such  court  action,
            proceeding  or  claim,  or  to  submit  the  matter  to  a  vote  of
            Shareholders, shall be binding upon the Shareholders."
"891","      Pursuant to Section  9.3  of  the Declaration, the undersigned Trustees of"
"892","the Trust, being a majority of the Trustees  of  the Trust, hereby amend Article"
"893","VI, Section 6.2 of the Declaration to add the following language before the last"
"894","sentence of Section 6.2:"
"895","      The  Trust  may enter into contractual arrangements  with  an  Investment
      Adviser, Distributor,  Transfer  Agent, and other parties who each provide
      services to the Trust. Unless expressly stated otherwise, shareholders are
      not   parties  to,  or  intended  beneficiaries   of   these   contractual
      arrangements,  and  these  contractual  arrangements  are  not intended to
      create any shareholder right to enforce them against the service providers
      or  to  seek  any remedy under them against the service providers,  either
      directly or on  behalf of any series of the Trust. The summary prospectus,
      prospectus and the  Statement  of  Additional  Information  describing any
      series  of  the  Trust  are  not  contracts  between  the  Trust  and  the
      shareholders  of  any  series  of  the  Trust  and do not give rise to any
      shareholder rights other than any rights conferred  explicitly  by federal
      or state securities laws that may not be waived."
"896","      Pursuant  to  Section 9.3 of the Declaration, the undersigned Trustees  of"
"897","the Trust, being a majority  of  the  Trustees  of the Trust, hereby add Section"
"898","10.7 to Article X of the Declaration to read in its entirety as follows:"
"899","      Section  10.7.   Forum for Adjudication of Disputes.   Unless  the  Trust
      consents in writing  to  the  selection  of  an alternative forum, (i) any
      action or proceeding brought by or on behalf of  the  Trust  or any of the
      Trust's  Shareholders, (ii) any action asserting a claim against  any  the
      Trust (or  any  series  thereof), or against any trustee, officer or other
      employee of the Trust, whether  arising  under federal law, the law of any
      state, or the law of a non-U.S. jurisdiction, (iii) any action asserting a
      claim  arising  pursuant to any provision of  the  Massachusetts  Business
      Corporation Act,  the  statutory  or  common  law  of  the Commonwealth of
      Massachusetts,  the  Declaration  or  these  By-Laws, (iv) any  action  to
      interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity  of  this Declaration,
      the  Trust's  by-laws, or any agreement on behalf of the Trust  authorized
      thereunder, or  (v)  any action asserting a claim governed by the internal
      affairs doctrine (each,  a Covered Action) shall be brought in the state
      or federal courts located  within  the  Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Any
      person purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares
      of beneficial interest of the Trust shall  be (i) deemed to have notice of
      and consented to the provisions of this Section,  and  (ii) deemed to have
      waived any argument relating to the inconvenience of the forums referenced
      above  in  connection  with  any  action or proceeding described  in  this
      Section.

      If any Covered Action is filed in a  court other than the state or federal
      courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  (a  Foreign  Action) in the
      name  of  any  shareholder,  such  shareholder  shall  be  deemed to  have
      consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts
      located  within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in connection  with  any
      action brought  in  any such courts to enforce the first paragraph of this
      Section (an Enforcement  Action) and (ii) having service of process made
      upon such shareholder in any  such Enforcement Action by service upon such
      shareholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such shareholder.

      If any provision or provisions  of  this  Section  shall  be  held  to  be
      invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or circumstance
      for  any  reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
      the validity,  legality  and  enforceability  of  such provision(s) in any
      other  circumstance  and  of  the  remaining provisions  of  this  Section
      (including, without limitation, each  portion  of  any  sentence  of  this
      Section  containing  any  such  provision  held  to be invalid, illegal or
      unenforceable  that  is  not  itself  held  to  be  invalid,   illegal  or
      unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other persons  and
      circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby."
"900","      Pursuant  to  Section  9.3 of the Declaration, the undersigned Trustees of"
"901","the Trust, being a majority of  the  Trustees of the Trust, hereby amend Section"
"902","10.3 of the Declaration to read in its entirety as follows:"
"903","            Section 10.3.  Principal Office.  The principal office of the Trust
            is  111  Huntington  Avenue,   Boston,   Massachusetts  02199.   The
            Trustees, without a vote of Shareholders,  may  change the principal
            office of the Trust."
"904","<PAGE>"
"905","      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, a majority of the Trustees of the Trust  have executed"
"906","this  amendment,  in  one  or  more  counterparts,  all  constituting  a  single"
"907","instrument, as an instrument under seal in The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as"
"908","of  May  2,  2016  and further certify, as provided by the provisions of Section"
