"2521","Litigation Update"
"2522","Federal Court Market Timing Litigation:"
"2523","A number of private lawsuits have been filed"
"2524","including purported class and derivative lawsuits,"
"2525","making various allegations and naming as defendants"
"2526","various persons, including certain Scudder and"
"2527","Deutsche (now DWS) funds (singularly, a Fund and"
"2528","collectively, the Funds), the Funds' investment"
"2529","advisors and their affiliates, certain individuals"
"2530","(including in some cases Fund Trustees/Directors,"
"2531","officers), and other parties.  Each Fund's"
"2532","investment advisor has agreed to indemnify the"
"2533","applicable Funds in connection with these lawsuits,"
"2534","or other lawsuits or regulatory actions that may be"
"2535","filed making allegations similar to these lawsuits"
"2536","regarding market timing, revenue sharing, fund"
"2537","valuation or other subjects related to"
"2538","investigations of the foregoing matters.  Based on"
"2539","currently available information, the Funds'"
"2540","investment advisors believe the likelihood that the"
"2541","pending lawsuits will have a material adverse"
"2542","financial impact on a Fund is remote and such"
"2543","actions are not likely to materially affect their"
"2544","ability to perform under their investment"
"2545","management agreements with the Funds."
"2546","Fifteen (15) class and derivative actions"
"2547","pertaining to market timing have been consolidated"
"2548","and transferred to a Multidistrict Litigation Panel"
"2549","in the District of Maryland (MDL) (Multidistrict"
"2550","Litigation 1586-In re Mutual Funds Investment"
"2551","Litigation).  The 11 Complaints originally filed in"
"2552","the Southern District of New York that were"
"2553","transferred to the MDL were virtually identical and"
"2554","each asserted claims against Deutsche Bank AG,"
"2555","Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc."
"2556","(DIMA) and Deutsche Asset Management, Inc. as"
"2557","well as approximately 85 Funds in the Scudder and"
"2558","Deutsche family of funds and John Doe defendants."
"2559","The three cases that were originally filed in the"
"2560","Eastern District of New York and the one case"
"2561","originally filed in the District of Delaware are"
"2562","derivative actions brought by purported"
"2563","shareholders in certain of the Funds.  These"
"2564","actions are against Deutsche Investment Management"
"2565","Americas Inc., Deutsche Asset Management, Inc., and"
"2566","John Doe defendants."
"2567","On September 29, 2004, two consolidated amended"
"2568","complaints, one a Consolidated Amended Class Action"
"2569","Complaint and the other a Consolidated Amended Fund"
"2570","Derivative Complaint, were filed in the MDL."
"2571","On January 11, 2006, Plaintiffs filed a Second"
"2572","Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint in the"
"2573","MDL.  The officer defendants have been voluntarily"
"2574","dismissed from the class action pursuant to a"
"2575","tolling agreement with Plaintiffs.  Deutsche Bank"
"2576","AG has been dismissed from the derivative action."
"2577","On March 16, 2007, the Court issued an opinion in"
"2578","the MDL granting in part and denying in part the"
"2579","Deutsche Defendants' motion to dismiss the Second"
"2580","Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint."
"2581","Plaintiffs filed a Third Consolidated Amended Class"
"2582","Action Complaint (Third Amended Complaint) on"
"2583","December 10, 2007 in the MDL.  In the Third Amended"
"2584","Complaint, the Plaintiffs added the names of Funds"
"2585","that they allegedly purchased or held during the"
"2586","class period.  In addition, as contemplated in the"
"2587","Court's scheduling order, the Third Amended"
"2588","Complaint added a new Plaintiff in an attempt to"
"2589","address standing challenges raised by the"
"2590","Defendants.  On January 16, 2008, the Court granted"
"2591","in part and denied in part the Defendants' motion"
"2592","to dismiss certain claims on standing grounds."
"2593","Extensive discovery has been undertaken.  The"
"2594","Defendants have filed a motion for summary judgment"
"2595","and various related motions, and Class Plaintiffs"
"2596","contemporaneously filed a motion for class"
"2597","certification. Briefing on these motions is now"
"2598","closed, and the Court heard oral argument on"
"2599","December 10-11, 2008."
"2600","State Court Market Timing Litigation:"
"2601","On September 16, 2003, an action was commenced in"
"2602","the Circuit Court for Madison County, Illinois,"
"2603","entitled Potter v. Janus Investment Fund, et al."
"2604","Defendants include, among others, DIMA and the"
"2605","Scudder International Fund. On October 23, 2003,"
"2606","Defendants removed the action to the United States"
"2607","District Court for the Southern District of"
"2608","Illinois. On February 9, 2004 the District Court"
"2609","remanded the case back to the Circuit Court for"
"2610","Madison County.  Defendants appealed this decision."
"2611","On April 5, 2005 the Seventh Circuit Court of"
"2612","Appeals reversed the District Court's decision and"
"2613","instructed the District Court to undo the remand"
"2614","order and dismiss the complaint.  On May 27, 2005,"
"2615","the District Court, in accord with the Seventh"
"2616","Circuit's mandate, dismissed the action with"
"2617","prejudice.  On September 29, 2005, Plaintiffs filed"
"2618","a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme"
"2619","Court of the United States.  On January 6, 2006,"
"2620","the Supreme Court granted the petition to address"
"2621","jurisdictional questions.  On June 15, 2006, the"
"2622","Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Seventh"
"2623","Circuit and held that the Court of Appeals did not"
"2624","have jurisdiction to address the District Court's"
"2625","remand order.  The case was remanded to and"
"2626","reopened in the Circuit Court for Madison County."
"2627","On November 13, 2006, Defendants removed the case"
"2628","to Federal District Court for a second time.  On"
"2629","April 6, 2007, the District Court remanded the case"
"2630","back to the Circuit Court for Madison County."
"2631","Defendants appealed this decision to the Seventh"
"2632","Circuit, which dismissed the appeal for lack of"
"2633","jurisdiction on July 13, 2007.  The case is now"
"2634","back in the Circuit Court for Madison County."
"2635","Argument on Defendants' motion to dismiss occurred"
"2636","in August 2007, and the parties are awaiting the"
"2637","Circuit Court's decision.  The Circuit Court issued"
"2638","an Order dated July 16, 2008 stating that the"
"2639","issues raised by the motion to dismiss are nearly"
"2640","identical to those in a pending appeal in an action"
"2641","involving the Putnam funds, and that the Court"
"2642","would therefore wait for the decision of the"
"2643","Illinois Appellate Court in that case before ruling"
"2644","on the motion to dismiss.  On January 6, 2010, the"
"2645","Illinois Appellate Court ruled in favor of the"
"2646","Putnam fund defendants and against the plaintiffs"
"2647","in that action, holding that the plaintiffs' claims"
"2648","are precluded by the Securities Litigation Uniform"
"2649","Standards Act.  The plaintiffs may file a motion"
"2650","for rehearing in the Illinois Appellate Court or"
"2651","may petition the Illinois Supreme Court for leave"
"2652","to appeal the decision of the Illinois Appellate"
"2653","Court."
"2654","Federal Court Revenue Sharing Litigation:"
"2655","The following purported class actions pertaining to"
"2656","revenue sharing were filed in the Southern District"
"2657","of New York: Walker v. Deutsche Bank AG, et al.,"
"2658","Mazza v. Deutsche Bank AG, et al. and Icardo v."
"2659","Deutsche Bank AG, et al.  These three class actions"
"2660","were consolidated. The consolidated Complaint filed"
"2661","on December 19, 2005 named as defendants Deutsche"
"2662","Bank AG, certain affiliated adviser entities, and"
"2663","Scudder Distributors Inc.  On August 15, 2007, the"
"2664","Court granted the Defendants' motion to dismiss"
"2665","with prejudice and denied Plaintiffs' request for"
"2666","leave to amend the complaint.  The Plaintiffs did"
"2667","not appeal, and the deadline for appealing this"
"2668","decision has now passed."

"2678","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"2679","Accounting Firm"
"2680","To the Shareholders and"
"2681","Board of Directors of DWS Value Series, Inc."
"2682","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"2683","financial statements of DWS Strategic Value"
"2684","Fund (formerly DWS Dreman High Return"
"2685","Equity Fund), DWS Dreman Small Cap Value"
"2686","Fund, DWS Dreman Mid Cap Value Fund and"

"2689","(collectively, the Company) as of and for the"
"2690","year ended November 30, 2009, in accordance"
"2691","with the standards of the Public Company"
"2692","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"2693","considered the Company's internal control over"
"2694","financial reporting, including controls over"
"2695","safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"2696","designing our auditing procedures for the"
"2697","purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"2698","financial statements and to comply with the"
"2699","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"2700","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"2701","effectiveness of the Company's internal control"
"2702","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"2703","express no such opinion."
"2704","The management of the Company is"
"2705","responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"2706","effective internal control over financial reporting."
"2707","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"2708","judgments by management are required to"
"2709","assess the expected benefits and related costs"
"2710","of controls. A company's internal control over"
"2711","financial reporting is a process designed to"
"2712","provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"2713","reliability of financial reporting and the"
"2714","preparation of financial statements for external"
"2715","purposes in accordance with generally"
"2716","accepted accounting principles. A company's"
"2717","internal control over financial reporting includes"
"2718","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"2719","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"2720","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"2721","transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"2722","the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"2723","that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"2724","permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2725","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2726","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"2727","the company are being made only in"
"2728","accordance with authorizations of management"
"2729","and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"2730","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"2731","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"2732","use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"2733","could have a material effect on the financial"
"2734","statements."
"2735","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"2736","control over financial reporting may not prevent"
"2737","or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"2738","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"2739","are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2740","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"2741","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"2742","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2743","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"2744","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"2745","a control does not allow management or"
"2746","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"2747","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2748","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"2749","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"2750","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"2751","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"2752","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2753","company's annual or interim financial"
"2754","statements will not be prevented or detected on"
"2755","a timely basis."
"2756","Our consideration of the Company's internal"
"2757","control over financial reporting was for the"
"2758","limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"2759","and would not necessarily disclose all"
"2760","deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"2761","material weaknesses under standards"
"2762","established by the Public Company Accounting"
"2763","Oversight Board (United States). However, we"
"2764","noted no deficiencies in the Company's internal"
"2765","control over financial reporting and its"
