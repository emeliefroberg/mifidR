"739","perform any payment or delivery obligations required"
"740","under any Trading Agreement or transaction, including"
"741","without limitation, collateral or margin payments),"
"742","provided that (i) the Sub-Adviser's actions in executing"

"744","with applicable federal laws, the regulations thereunder,"
"745","the Sub-Adviser's duties and obligations under this"
"746","Agreement and the Trust's Governing Documents (as defined"
"747","below) and (ii) the Sub-Adviser shall not execute any"
"748","documentation pursuant to the foregoing relating to the"
"749","tax status or investor status of the Fund without"
"750","verifying such status with the Adviser."
"751","(c) The Sub-Adviser is hereby appointed the Fund's agent"
"752","and attorney-in-fact, and shall have a duty hereunder, to"
"753","exercise in its discretion all rights and perform all"
"754","duties which may be exercisable in relation to the"
"755","Managed Portion, including without limitation the right"
"756","to tender, exchange, endorse, transfer, or deliver any"
"757","securities on behalf of the Fund, to participate in or"
"758","consent to any class action, distribution, bankruptcy"
"759","proceeding, plan of reorganization, creditors committee,"
"760","merger, combination, consolidation, liquidation,"
"761","underwriting, or similar plan with reference to such"
"762","securities; and to execute and bind the Fund in waivers,"
"763","consents and covenants related thereto. The Sub-Adviser"
"764","shall provide the Fund's custodian and accounting agent"
"765","information regarding the foregoing promptly following"
"766","the Sub-Adviser's receipt thereof."
"767","(d) The Adviser is responsible for acting upon, or"
"768","refraining from acting upon, all proxies solicited by or"
"769","with respect to the issuers of securities in which the"
"770","assets of the Managed Portion are invested from time to"
"771","time in accordance with the Trust's policies on proxy"
"772","voting. The Sub-Adviser will provide, when reasonably"
"773","requested by the Adviser, information it has on a"
"774","particular issuer held in the Managed Portion to assist"
"775","the Adviser in the voting of a proxy."
"776","(e) The Sub-Adviser shall discharge its responsibilities"
"777","hereunder subject to the supervision of the Adviser, the"
"778","Board and the officers of the Trust and in compliance"
"779","with (i) except as set forth in the Investment"
"780","Guidelines, the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act"
"781","of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act) and the rules"
"782","and regulations adopted under each from time to time;"
"783","(ii) the requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal"
"784","Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal  Revenue
Code) applicable to regulated investment companies (as"

"788","time; (iv) all other applicable federal and state laws"

"790","of any self-regulatory organization; (v) any 1940 Act"
"791","exemptive order applicable to the Fund and the Managed"
"792","Portion and provided to the Sub-Adviser in writing; (vi)"
"793","the Trust's Declaration of Trust and By-Laws, as each may"
"794","be amended from time to time (the Governing Documents);"
"795","(vii) the objectives, policies and limitations for the"
"796","Fund set forth in the Registration Statement; and (viii)"
"797","the Investment Guidelines and such other guidelines,"
"798","policies and procedures implemented by the Adviser with"
"799","respect to the Fund or to the Sub-Adviser's activities"
"800","under this Agreement and provided to the Sub-Adviser in"
"801","writing (Adviser Procedures). The Sub-Adviser shall"
"802","maintain compliance procedures and operational processes"
"803","for the Fund to ensure the Fund's compliance with the"
"804","foregoing and that the Sub-Adviser reasonably believes"
"805","are adequate to ensure its compliance with applicable"
"806","law. No supervisory activity undertaken by the Adviser"
"807","shall limit the Sub-Adviser's full responsibility for any"
"808","of the foregoing. For the avoidance of doubt, the"
"809","compliance obligations of the Sub-Adviser under this"
"810","Agreement shall apply only to the Managed Portion, and"
"811","the Sub-Adviser shall have no responsibility for any"
"812","compliance obligations that would require the Sub-Adviser"
"813","to be informed of any other assets of the Fund."
"814","(f) The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not consult with"
"815","any other sub-investment adviser for the Fund or the"
"816","Trust or any other fund under common control with the"
"817","Trust, concerning transactions for the Managed Portion in"
"818","securities or other assets, except that such"
"819","consultations are permitted between the current and"
"820","successor sub-investment advisers of the Fund in order to"
"821","effect an orderly transition of sub-advisory duties so"
"822","long as such consultations are not transactions"
"823","prohibited by Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act."
"824","(g) On behalf of the Fund, the Adviser hereby authorizes"
"825","any entity or person associated with the Sub-Adviser"
"826","which is a member of a national securities exchange to"
"827","effect any transaction on the exchange for the account of"
"828","the Fund which is permitted by Section 11(a) of the"
"829","Exchange Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder, and on behalf"
"830","of the Fund, the Adviser hereby consents to the retention"
"831","of compensation for such transactions in accordance with"
"832","Rule 11a2-2(T)(a)(2)(iv). Notwithstanding the foregoing,"
"833","the Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not deal with itself,"
"834","or with members of the Board or any principal underwriter"
"835","of the Fund, as principals or agents in making purchases"
"836","or sales of securities or other property for the account"
"837","of the Fund, nor will the Sub-Adviser purchase any"
"838","securities from an underwriting or selling group in which"
"839","the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates is participating, or"
"840","arrange for purchases and sales of securities between the"
"841","Fund and another account advised by the Sub-Adviser or"
"842","its affiliates, except in each case as permitted by the"
"843","1940 Act and in accordance with such policies and"
"844","procedures as may be adopted by the Fund from time to"
"845","time and disclosed to the Sub-Adviser, and will comply"
"846","with all other provisions of the Governing Documents and"
"847","the Fund's then-current Registration Statement relative"
"848","to the Sub-Adviser and its directors, officers and"
"849","employees."
"850","3.	Fund Transactions."
"851","(a) In connection with purchases and sales of portfolio"
"852","securities and other instruments for the account of the"
"853","Fund, neither the Sub-Adviser nor its affiliated persons"
"854","(as defined in the 1940 Act) or any of their respective"
"855","partners, officers or employees shall act as principal,"
"856","except as otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act. The Sub-"
"857","Adviser or its agents shall arrange for the placing of"
"858","orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities"
"859","and other financial instruments for the Fund's account"
"860","either directly with the issuer or with any Counterparty,"
"861","provided that the Sub-Adviser complies with Section 2(b)"
"862","with respect to each such Counterparty."
"863","(b) In the selection of such brokers or dealers and the"
"864","placing of such orders, the Sub-Adviser is directed at"
"865","all times to seek best execution on behalf of the Managed"
"866","Portion. In selecting brokers or dealers, the Sub-Adviser"
"867","may give consideration to factors other than price,"
"868","including, but not limited to, size of order,"
"869","competitiveness of total execution costs, ease/efficiency"
"870","of order entry and execution, access to securities"
"871","(including new issues), timeliness and accuracy of"
"872","recaps, difficulty of execution and operational"
"873","facilities of the broker or dealer, and the broker or"
"874","dealer's skill in positioning blocks of securities. It is"
"875","also understood that it may be desirable for the Managed"
"876","Portion that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental"
"877","investment and market research and security and economic"
"878","analyses that are consistent with Section 28(e) of the"
"879","Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934
Act), and are provided by brokers who may execute"
"880","brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Managed"
"881","Portion than may result when allocating brokerage to"
"882","other brokers on the basis of seeking best execution."
"883","Therefore, subject to compliance with the safe harbor"
"884","provided by Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act and such other"
"885","conditions and limitations as may be established by the"
"886","Adviser from time to time, if any, the Sub-Adviser is"
"887","authorized to consider such services provided to the"
"888","Managed Portion and other accounts over which the Sub-"
"889","Adviser or any of its affiliates exercises investment"
"890","discretion and to place orders for the purchase and sale"
"891","of securities for the Managed Portion with such brokers,"
"892","if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that the"
"893","amount of commissions for executing such portfolio"
"894","transactions is reasonable in relation to the value of"
"895","the brokerage and research services provided by such"
"896","brokers, subject to review by the Adviser and the Board"
"897","from time to time with respect to the extent and"
"898","continuation of this practice. It is understood that the"
"899","services provided by such brokers may be useful to the"
"900","Sub-Adviser in connection with its services to other"
"901","clients. The Sub-Adviser may, on occasions when it deems"
"902","the purchase or sale of a security to be in the best"
"903","interests of the Managed Portion as well as its other"
"904","clients, aggregate, to the extent permitted by applicable"
"905","laws, rules and regulations, the securities to be sold or"
"906","purchased in order to obtain best execution. In such"
"907","event, allocation of the securities so purchased or sold,"
"908","as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction,"
"909","shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in the manner it"
"910","considers to be fair and equitable and consistent with"
"911","its obligations to the Managed Portion and to such other"
"912","clients. The Board may from time to time adopt policies"
"913","and procedures that modify and/or restrict the Sub-"
"914","Adviser's authority regarding the execution of the"
"915","Managed Portion's portfolio transactions provided herein."
"916","(c) The Sub-Adviser shall not acquire on behalf of the"
"917","Managed Portion any equity securities registered under"
"918","Section 12 of the 1934 Act with the purpose or effect, at"
"919","the time of such acquisition, of changing or influencing"
"920","control of the issuer of the securities or in connection"
"921","with or as a participant in any transaction having such"
"922","purpose or effect, including any transaction subject to"
"923","Rule 13d-3(b) promulgated under the 1934 Act. For"
"924","purposes of all applicable filing requirements under the"
"925","1934 Act, including without limitation Sections 13(d) and"
"926","(g), and other laws, the Sub-Adviser shall be deemed to"
"927","have sole investment discretion with respect to all"
"928","securities held in the Managed Portion. If any"
"929","investments made by the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the"
"930","Managed Portion are required to be disclosed in any other"
"931","reports to be filed by the Sub-Adviser with any"
"932","governmental or self-regulatory agency or organization or"
"933","exchange, the Sub-Adviser shall provide the Adviser with"
"934","prompt written notice thereof, setting forth in"
"935","reasonable detail the nature of the report and the"
"936","investments of the Managed Portion to be reported."
"937","(d) The Fund may establish one or more wholly-owned"
"938","subsidiaries of the Fund through which it may conduct a"
"939","significant portion of its commodities investing"
"940","activities or for other investment purposes."
"941","4.	Compensation of the Sub-Adviser."
"942","(a) For the services provided and the expenses assumed by"
"943","the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, Adviser, not"
"944","the Fund, shall pay to the Sub-Adviser a fee, computed"
"945","daily and payable monthly, in arrears, at an annual rate"
"946","of the average daily net assets of the Managed Portion"
"947","that the Sub-Adviser manages (computed in the manner"
"948","specified in the Investment Advisory Agreement), in"
"949","accordance with the schedule attached hereto as Exhibit"
"950","A."
"951","(b) If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates"
"952","before the end of any month, the fee for the period from"
"953","the effective date to the end of the month or from the"
"954","beginning of such month to the date of termination, as"
"955","the case may be, shall be prorated according to the"
"956","proportion that such period bears to the full month in"
"957","which such effectiveness or termination occurs."
"958","5.	Expenses. The Sub-Adviser agrees, at its own expense, to"
"959","render the services set forth herein and to provide the"
"960","office space, furnishings, equipment and personnel"
"961","required by it to perform such services on the terms and"
"962","for the compensation provided in this Agreement. The Fund"
"963","shall be responsible for payment of brokerage"
"964","commissions, transfer fees, registration costs,"
"965","transaction-related taxes and other similar costs and"
"966","transaction-related expenses and fees arising out of"
"967","transactions effected on behalf of the Fund, which shall"
"968","be deducted from the Managed Portion. Subject to the"
"969","foregoing, the Sub-Adviser will pay all expenses incurred"
"970","by it in connection with its activities under this"
"971","Agreement, including without limitation, all costs"
"972","associated with attending or otherwise participating in"
"973","regular or special meetings of the Board or shareholders,"
"974","or with the Adviser, as reasonably requested, and"
"975","additions or modifications to the Sub-Adviser's"
"976","operations necessary to perform its services hereunder in"
"977","compliance with this Agreement, the Investment"
"978","Guidelines, any other Board/Adviser Procedures and"
"979","applicable law. The Sub-Adviser shall be responsible for"
"980","all costs associated with any information statements"
"981","and/or other disclosure materials that are for the"
"982","primary benefit of the Sub-Adviser (including, but not"
"983","limited to, the legal fees associated with preparation,"
"984","printing, filing and mailing thereof, as well as any"
"985","shareholder meeting and/or solicitation costs, if"
"986","applicable; provided, this shall not include the expenses"
"987","associated with the Sub-Adviser's initial appointment"
"988","hereunder)."
"989","6.	Delivery of Information, Reports and Certain"
"990","Notifications."
"991","(a) The Adviser agrees to use its best efforts to furnish"
"992","to the Sub-Adviser (i) current prospectuses, statements"
"993","of additional information, proxy statements, reports to"
"994","shareholders, financial statements, Declaration of Trust"
"995","and By-Laws, any amendments or supplements to any of the"
"996","foregoing not later than their implementation (if"
"997","practicable) or as soon as reasonably practicable"
"998","thereafter and (ii) promptly such other information with"
"999","regard to the affairs of the Fund as the Sub-Adviser may"
"1000","reasonably request."
"1001","(b) The Sub-Adviser shall periodically report on a timely"
"1002","basis to the Adviser and to the Board and shall make"
"1003","appropriate persons, including portfolio managers,"
"1004","available for the purpose of reviewing with"
"1005","representatives of the Adviser and the Board on the"
"1006","management of the Managed Portion, the performance of the"
"1007","Managed Portion in relation to standard industry indices"
"1008","and the Fund's own performance benchmark, and general"
"1009","conditions affecting the marketplace as reasonably"
"1010","requested by the Adviser; provided, however, that"
"1011","representatives of the Sub-Adviser shall not be required"
"1012","to attend more than two in-person meetings outside of New"
"1013","York City in any 12-month period (but shall make"
"1014","themselves available by video conference upon reasonable"
"1015","request of the Board). The Sub-Adviser agrees to render"
"1016","to the Adviser such other periodic and special reports on"
"1017","a timely basis regarding its activities under this"
"1018","Agreement as the Adviser may reasonably request."
"1019","(c) The Sub-Adviser shall provide the Adviser, the Fund or"
"1020","the Board with such information and assurances (including"
"1021","certifications and sub-certifications in such form as the"
"1022","Sub-Adviser may reasonably agree) and with such"
"1023","assistance as the Adviser, the Fund or the Board may"
"1024","reasonably request from time to time in order to assist"
"1025","it in complying with applicable laws, rules, regulations"
"1026","and exemptive orders, including requirements in"
"1027","connection with the Adviser's, the Sub-Adviser's or the"
"1028","Board's fulfillment of its responsibilities under Section"
"1029","15(c) of the 1940 Act and the preparation and/or filing"
"1030","of periodic and other reports and filings required to"
"1031","maintain the registration and qualification of the Fund,"
"1032","or to meet other regulatory or tax requirements"
"1033","applicable to the Fund, under federal and state"
"1034","securities, commodities and tax laws and other applicable"
"1035","laws. Upon reasonable request by the Adviser, the Sub-"
"1036","Adviser shall review draft reports to shareholders,"
"1037","registration statements, marketing materials or"
"1038","amendments or supplements thereto or portions thereof"
"1039","that relate to the Managed Portion or the Sub-Adviser and"
"1040","other documents provided to the Sub-Adviser, provide"
"1041","comments on such drafts on a timely basis, and provide"
"1042","certifications or sub-certifications (in such form as the"

"1044","the accuracy of the information provided by the Sub-"
"1045","Adviser and/or contained in such reports or other"
"1046","documents."
"1047","(d) The Sub-Adviser agrees to provide and update promptly"
"1048","but no less frequently than quarterly a list of all the"
"1049","affiliates of the Sub-Adviser, and to promptly notify the"
"1050","Adviser and the Fund of any change of control of those"
"1051","affiliates."
"1052","(e) If required by the CEA or the rules and regulations"
"1053","thereunder promulgated by the Commodity Futures Trading"
"1054","Commission (CFTC), the Sub-Adviser will provide the"
"1055","Fund with a copy of its most recent CFTC disclosure"
"1056","document or a written explanation of the reason why it is"
"1057","not required to deliver such a disclosure document."
"1058","7.	Cooperation with the Fund, the Adviser and Other Service"
"1059","Providers."
"1060","(a) The Sub-Adviser agrees to provide reasonable"
"1061","cooperation and assistance to the Adviser, the Fund, the"
"1062","Fund's custodian, accounting agent, administrator,"
"1063","pricing agents, independent auditors and all other"
"1064","agents, representatives and service providers of the Fund"
"1065","and the Adviser, and to provide the foregoing persons"
"1066","such information with respect to the Managed Portion as"
"1067","they may reasonably request from time to time in the"
"1068","performance of their obligations; provide prompt"
"1069","responses to reasonable requests made by such persons;"
"1070","and establish and maintain appropriate operational"
"1071","programs, procedures and interfaces with such persons so"
"1072","as to promote the efficient exchange of information and"
"1073","compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations,"
"1074","and the guidelines, policies and procedures adopted or"
"1075","implemented with respect to the Fund and/or the Sub-"
"1076","Adviser."
"1077","Similarly, the Adviser agrees to provide reasonable"
"1078","cooperation and assistance to the Sub-Adviser, and agrees"
"1079","to instruct the Fund's custodian, accounting agent, and"
"1080","administrator, to: (i) provide reasonably cooperation and"
"1081","assistance to the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Managed"
"1082","Portion as it may reasonably request from time to time in"
"1083","the performance of the Sub-Adviser's obligations and (ii)"
"1084","provide responses as soon as practicable to reasonable"
"1085","requests made by the Sub-Adviser."
"1086","(b) The Fund's assets (including the Managed Portion)"
"1087","shall be held by a custodian appointed by the Fund"
"1088","pursuant to a separate custody agreement; the Sub-Adviser"
"1089","and its affiliates shall at no time have custody or"
"1090","physical control of any assets or cash of the Fund. The"
"1091","Sub-Adviser shall timely provide the Fund's custodian and"
"1092","accounting agent a daily trade file (which shall be in a"
"1093","mutually agreeable format) containing each purchase and"

"1095","instrument specifying the name of the issuer or"
"1096","Counterparty, the description, terms and amount of shares"
"1097","or principal amount of the security or other financial"
"1098","instrument purchased or sold, the market price,"
"1099","commission and gross or net price, trade date, settlement"
"1100","date and identity of the effecting broker or dealer and"
"1101","such other information as may reasonably be required."
"1102","(c) The Sub-Adviser shall reconcile all trades with each"
"1103","executing broker and Counterparty daily to ensure"
"1104","accurate trade settlement and verify open positions"
"1105","(including cash). The Fund or its designee may also"

"1107","executing brokers and Counterparties and the Sub-Adviser"
"1108","shall cooperate with the Fund or such designee in order"
"1109","to effect such reconciliation, including without"
"1110","limitation by arranging for access by the Fund or such"
"1111","designee to the files and websites of the executing"
"1112","brokers and Counterparties. In addition, the Sub-Adviser"
"1113","shall promptly review each holdings reconciliation report"
"1114","that it receives from the Fund's custodian and accounting"
"1115","agent and/or the Adviser, as appropriate, and shall work"
"1116","to resolve all open reconciliation items, including trade"
"1117","breaks, contained in such report as soon as reasonably"
"1118","practicable."
"1119","(d) To the extent any of the positions in the Managed"
"1120","Portion do not have readily ascertainable market prices,"
"1121","the Sub-Adviser shall provide reasonable assistance to"
"1122","the Board, the Adviser, the custodian or administrator"
"1123","for the Fund in determining or confirming, consistent"
"1124","with the Adviser Procedures and the Registration"
"1125","Statement, the value of any portfolio securities or other"
"1126","assets or liabilities of the Managed Portion for which"
"1127","the Adviser, custodian or administrator seeks assistance"
"1128","from the Sub-Adviser or identifies for review by the Sub-"
"1129","Adviser. This assistance includes (but is not limited"
"1130","to): (i) designating and providing access to one or more"
"1131","employees of the Sub-Adviser who are knowledgeable about"
"1132","the security or other asset or liability, its issuer or"
"1133","counterparty (as applicable), its financial condition,"
"1134","trading and/or other relevant factors for valuation,"
"1135","which employees shall be available for consultation when"
"1136","the Board or a designated committee thereof convenes;"
"1137","(ii) assisting the Board, Adviser, the custodian or the"
"1138","administrator in obtaining bids and offers or quotes from"
"1139","broker-dealers or market-makers with respect to"
"1140","investments held in the Managed Portion, upon the"
"1141","reasonable request of the Adviser, custodian or"
"1142","administrator; (iii) upon the reasonable request of the"
"1143","Board, Adviser, the custodian or the administrator,"
"1144","providing recommendations for pricing and fair valuations"
"1145","(including the methodology and rationale used in making"
"1146","such recommendation and such other relevant information"
"1147","as may be requested); and (iv) maintaining adequate"
"1148","records and written backup information with respect to"
"1149","the investments valuation assistance provided hereunder,"
"1150","and providing such information to the Board, Adviser or"
"1151","the Fund upon request, with such records being deemed"
"1152","Fund records. The Sub-Adviser shall promptly notify the"
"1153","Adviser if, in any material respect, the Sub-Adviser"
"1154","believes that the price of any security or other"
"1155","investment in the Managed Portion may not accurately"
"1156","reflect the value thereof. Additionally, the Sub-Adviser"
"1157","shall provide reasonable cooperation regarding the"
"1158","provision of derivative instrument valuations directly"
"1159","from the Counterparties to the Adviser, Fund,"
"1160","administrator and/or custodian and for providing any"
"1161","valuation determinations made by the Sub-Adviser to the"
"1162","Adviser for its consideration. Notwithstanding the"
"1163","foregoing, the Adviser understands and agrees that it,"
"1164","and not the Sub-Adviser or any of its affiliates, shall"
"1165","be ultimately responsible for the valuation of the assets"

"2092","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"2093","To the Shareholders of BlackRock Multi-Manager Alternative"
"2094","Strategies Fund and Board of Trustees of BlackRock Funds:"
"2095","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"2096","of BlackRock Multi-Manager Alternative Strategies Fund (the"
"2097","Fund), a series of BlackRock Funds, as of and for the year"
"2098","ended August 31, 2015, in accordance with the standards of the"
"2099","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"2100","considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"2101","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"2102","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"2103","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"2104","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2105","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"2106","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"2107","express no such opinion."
"2108","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"2109","maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"2110","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"2111","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"2112","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal"
"2113","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"2114","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"2115","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"2116","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2117","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"2118","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"2119","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"2120","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2121","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"2122","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2123","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"2124","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"2125","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"2126","authorizations of management and directors of the fund; and (3)"
"2127","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"2128","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a"
"2129","fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2130","statements."
"2131","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2132","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2133","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2134","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"2135","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"2136","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures"
"2137","may deteriorate."
"2138","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2139","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"2140","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"2141","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"2142","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2143","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"2144","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"2145","material misstatement of the fund's annual or interim financial"
"2146","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2147","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"2148","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2149","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"2150","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"2151","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"2152","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"2153","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"2154","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities that"
"2155","we consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as of"
"2156","August 31, 2015."
"2157","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"2158","management of BlackRock Multi-Manager Alternative Strategies"
"2159","Fund, and the Board of Trustees of BlackRock Funds, and the"
