"640","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"641","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"642","Putnam Convertible Securities Fund:"
"643","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"644","of Putnam Convertible Securities Fund (the Fund) as of and for"
"645","the year ended October 31, 2014, in accordance with the"
"646","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"647","(United States), we considered the Funds internal control over"
"648","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"649","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"650","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"651","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N SAR,"
"652","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"653","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"654","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"655","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"656","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"657","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"658","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"659","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"660","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"661","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"662","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"663","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"664","A companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"665","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"666","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"667","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"668","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"669","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"670","financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"671","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"672","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"673","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"674","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"675","or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material"
"676","effect on the financial statements."
"677","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"678","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"679","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"680","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"681","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"682","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"683","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"684","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"685","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"686","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"687","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"688","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"689","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"690","material misstatement of a funds annual or interim financial"
"691","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"692","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"693","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"694","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"695","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"696","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"697","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"698","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"699","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"700","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"701","October 31, 2014."
"702","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"703","management and the Board of Trustees of Putnam Convertible"
"704","Securities Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and"
"705","is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"706","than these specified parties."

"770","ARTICLE 2"
"771","Meetings of Trustees"
"772","       2.1  Regular Meetings.  Regular meetings of the Trustees may be"
"773","held without call or notice at such places and at such times as the"
"774","Trustees may from time to time determine, provided that notice of the"
"775","first regular meeting following any such determination shall be given"
"776","to absent Trustees."
"777","       2.2  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Trustees may be"
"778","held at any time and at any place designated in the call of the"
"779","meeting when called by the Chair of the Trustees, the President, the"

"781","sufficient notice thereof being given to each Trustee by the Clerk or"
"782","an Assistant Clerk or by the officer or the Trustees calling the"
"783","meeting."
"784","       2.3  Notice of Special Meetings.  It shall be sufficient notice"
"785","to a Trustee of a special meeting: (a) to send notice (i) by mail at"
"786","least forty eight hours before the meeting, (ii) by courier at least"
"787","forty eight hours before the meeting, (iii) by electronic mail (e"

"791","address, facsimile number or other appropriate address); or (b) to"
"792","give notice to him or her in person or by telephone at least twenty"
"793","four hours before the meeting.  Notice of a special meeting need not"

"795","or her before or after the meeting, is filed with the records of the"
"796","meeting, or to any Trustee who attends the meeting without protesting"
"797","before or at its commencement the lack of notice to him or her.  Any"
"798","written waiver of notice may be provided and delivered to the Trust by"
"799","mail, courier, e mail, facsimile or other electronic means. Neither"
"800","notice of a meeting nor a waiver of a notice need specify the purposes"
"801","of the meeting.  All notices shall be deemed to be given when sent."
"802","       2.4  Quorum.  At any meeting of the Trustees a majority of the"
"803","Trustees then in office shall constitute a quorum.  Once a quorum has"
"804","been validly established for a meeting, it cannot be broken by"
"805","Trustees withdrawing from the meeting.  Any meeting may be adjourned"
"806","from time to time by a majority of the votes cast upon the question,"

"812","Trustees present at the meeting of the Trustees (a quorum being"
"813","present), including any meeting held by means of a conference"
"814","telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all"
"815","persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same"
"816","time and participation by such means shall constitute presence in"
"817","person at a meeting. Any action to be taken by the Trustees may also"
"818","be taken without a meeting if one or more written consents thereto are"
"819","signed by a majority of the Trustees.  Any written consent may be"
"820","given by mail, courier, e mail, facsimile or other electronic means."
"821","Copies of such written consents shall be filed with the minutes of the"
"822","proceedings of the Trustees.  Such consents shall be treated for all"
"823","purposes as a vote taken at a meeting of the Trustees.  If in"
"824","accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Trust and these"
"825","Bylaws any action is taken by the Trustees by written consents of less"
"826","than all of the Trustees, then prompt notice of any such action shall"
"827","be furnished to each Trustee who did not execute such written consent,"
"828","provided that the effectiveness of such action shall not be impaired"

"833","be a President, a Treasurer, a Clerk and such other officers"
"834","(including Vice President, which shall include the office of Executive"
"835","Vice President), if any, as the Trustees from time to time may in"
"836","their discretion elect.  The Trust may also have such agents as the"
"837","Trustees from time to time may in their discretion appoint.  In"
"838","addition, there shall be a Chair of the Trustees, who will be"
"839","considered an officer of the Trustees and not of the Trust.  The Chair"
"840","of the Trustees shall be a Trustee and may but need not be a"
"841","Shareholder; and any other officer may but need not be a Trustee or a"
"842","Shareholder.  Any two or more offices may be held by the same person."
"843","       3.2  Election.  The Chair of the Trustees, the President, the"

"862","as if the Trust were organized as a Massachusetts business corporation"
"863","and such other duties and powers as the Trustees may from time to time"
"864","designate."
"865","       3.5  Chair.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide, the Chair of"

"870","as an officer of the Trust.  The Trustees, including a majority of the"
"871","Trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust, as that term is"
"872","defined in the 1940 Act, may appoint one or more persons to perform"
"873","the duties of the Chair of the Trustees in the event of his or her"
"874","absence at any meeting or in the event of his or her disability.  The"
"875","Chair of the Trustees shall also have the power to appoint one or more"
"876","persons to perform the duties of the Chair of the Trustees in the"
"877","event of his or her absence at any meeting."
"878","       3.6  President.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide by vote or"
"879","otherwise, the President shall be the principal executive officer of"
"880","the Trust."
"881","       3.7  Treasurer.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide by vote or"
"882","otherwise, the Treasurer shall be the principal financial and"
"883","accounting officer of the Trust, and shall, subject to the provisions"

"886","or transfer, Shareholder servicing or similar agent, be in charge of"
"887","the valuable papers, books of account and accounting records of the"
"888","Trust, and shall have such other duties and powers as may be"
"889","designated from time to time by the Trustees or by the principal"
"890","executive officer of the Trust."
"891","       3.8  Clerk.  The Clerk shall record all proceedings of the"
"892","Shareholders and the Trustees in books to be kept therefor, which"
"893","books or a copy thereof shall be kept at the principal office of the"
"894","Trust.  In the absence of the Clerk from any meeting of the"
"895","Shareholders or Trustees (or a Committee thereof), an Assistant Clerk,"
"896","or if there be none or if he or she is absent, a temporary Clerk"
"897","chosen at such meeting by the chair of such meeting, shall record the"
"898","proceedings thereof in the aforesaid books."
"899","       3.9  Resignations and Removals.  Any Trustee or officer may"
"900","resign at any time by written instrument signed by him or her and"
"901","delivered to the Chair of the Trustees, the President or the Clerk or"

"903","upon receipt unless specified to be effective at some other time.  The"
"904","Trustees may remove any officer elected or appointed by them with or"
"905","without cause.  Except to the extent expressly provided in a written"
"906","agreement with the Trust, no Trustee or officer resigning and no"
"907","officer removed shall have any right to any compensation for any"
"908","period following his or her resignation or removal, or any right to"
"909","damages on account of such removal."

"916","constitute a quorum for the transaction of business (which quorum once"
"917","validly established cannot be broken by Trustees withdrawing from the"
"918","meeting), and any action of such a Committee may be taken by a vote of"
"919","a majority of the members of such Committee (a) present at a meeting"
"920","of such Committee (a quorum being present), including any meeting held"

"927","such written consents shall be filed with the minutes of the"
"928","proceedings of such Committee.  Such consents shall be treated for all"
"929","purposes as a vote taken at a meeting of such Committee.  If in"
"930","accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Trust and these"
"931","Bylaws any action is taken by written consents of less than all of the"
"932","Committees members, then prompt notice of any such action shall be"
"933","furnished to each member who did not execute such written consent,"
"934","provided that the effectiveness of such action shall not be impaired"
"935","by any delay or failure to furnish such notice.  In the absence of any"
"936","member of any such Committee, the members thereof present at any"
"937","properly called meeting, whether or not they constitute a quorum, may"
"938","appoint a member of the Trustees to act at that meeting only in the"
"939","place of any absent member."
"940","	Except as specifically provided in the votes constituting a"
"941","Committee of the Trustees and providing for the conduct of its"

"949","       5.1  General.  The Trustees and officers shall render reports at"
"950","the time and in the manner required by the Declaration of Trust or any"

"960","such date in subsequent years."
"961","ARTICLE 7"
"962","Seal"
"963","       7.1  General.  The seal of the Trust, if any, shall consist of a"
"964","flat faced die with the word Massachusetts, together with the name of"
"965","the Trust and the year of its organization cut or engraved thereon"
"966","but, unless otherwise required by the Trustees, the seal need not be"
"967","placed on, and its absence shall not impair the validity of, any"
"968","document, instrument or other paper executed and delivered by or on"

"971","Execution of Papers"
"972","       8.1  General.  Except as the Trustees may generally or in"

"987","price.  In the case of Shares sold for securities, such securities"
"988","shall be valued in accordance with procedures approved by the Trustees"
"989","for determining the value of the assets of the Trust.  The officers of"
"990","the Trust are severally authorized to take all such actions as may be"
"991","necessary or desirable to carry out this Section 9.1."
"992","       9.2  Share Certificates.  In lieu of issuing certificates for"
"993","Shares, the Trustees or the transfer agent may either issue receipts"
"994","therefor or may keep accounts upon the books of the Trust for the"
"995","record holders of such Shares, who shall in either case be deemed, for"
"996","all purposes hereunder, to be the holders of certificates for such"
"997","Shares as if they had accepted such certificates and shall be held to"
"998","have expressly assented and agreed to the terms hereof."
"999","       The Trustees may at any time authorize the issuance of Share"

"1015","affidavit or affidavits of loss or non receipt and of an indemnity"
"1016","agreement executed by the registered holder or his or her legal"
"1017","representative and supported by an open penalty surety bond, said"

"1020","(ii) receipt of such other documents as may be approved by the"
"1021","Trustees."
"1022","       9.4  Issuance of New Certificate to Pledgee.  A pledgee of Shares"
"1023","transferred as collateral security shall be entitled to a new"
"1024","certificate if the instrument of transfer substantially describes the"
"1025","debt or duty that is intended to be secured thereby.  Such new"
"1026","certificate shall express on its face that it is held as collateral"
"1027","security, and the name of the pledgor shall be stated thereon, who"
"1028","alone shall be liable as a Shareholder and entitled to vote thereon."
"1029","       9.5  Discontinuance of Issuance of Certificates.  The Trustees"
"1030","may at any time discontinue the issuance of Share certificates and"
"1031","may, by written notice to each Shareholder whom the Trust believes to"
"1032","hold a Share certificate, require the surrender of Share certificates"
"1033","to the Trust for cancellation.  Such surrender and cancellation shall"

"1038","meeting of the Shareholders whenever ordered by the Trustees or"
"1039","requested in writing by the holder or holders of at least one tenth of"
"1040","the outstanding Shares entitled to vote at such meeting.  If the"
"1041","Clerk, when so ordered or requested, refuses or neglects for more than"
"1042","30 days to provide such notice, the Trustees or the Shareholders so"
"1043","requesting may, in the name of the Clerk, call the meeting by giving"
"1044","notice thereof in the manner required when notice is given by the"
"1045","Clerk.  Any previously scheduled meeting of Shareholders may be"
"1046","postponed or cancelled by the Trustees upon public notice given prior"
"1047","to the time previously scheduled for such meeting."
"1048","       10.2  Adjournment.  Any meeting of Shareholders may, by action of"

"1052","meeting to a designated date which may be more than 120 days after the"
"1053","date initially set for the meeting, time and place, whether or not a"
"1054","quorum is present with respect to such matter.  Upon motion of the"
"1055","chair of the meeting, the question of adjournment may be (but is not"
"1056","required by these Bylaws to be) submitted to a vote of the"
"1057","Shareholders, and in that case, any adjournment with respect to one or"
"1058","more matters must be approved by the vote of holders of a majority of"

"1060","matters adjourned and, if approved, such adjournment shall take place"
"1061","without further notice other than announcement at the meeting at which"
"1062","the adjournment is taken.  Unless a proxy is otherwise limited in this"
"1063","regard, any Shares present and entitled to vote at a meeting,"
"1064","including any Shares that are represented by broker non votes, may, at"
"1065","the discretion of the proxies named therein, be voted in favor of such"
"1066","an adjournment.  Any proposal for which sufficient favorable votes"
"1067","have been received may (but need not) be acted upon and considered"
"1068","final and effective regardless of whether the meeting is adjourned to"
"1069","permit additional solicitation with respect to any other proposal that"
"1070","is properly before the meeting."
"1071","       10.3  Conduct of Meetings. Meetings of the Shareholders shall be"
"1072","presided over by the Chair of the Trustees, or, if the Chair is not"
"1073","present at the meeting, then by a Trustee or officer designated by the"
"1074","Chair or authorized by the Trustees, or if there is no such person"
"1075","present at the meeting, then by any officer of the Trust present at"
"1076","the meeting, and such person shall be deemed for all purposes the"
"1077","chair of the meeting.  The chair of the meeting shall have the right"
"1078","and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and"
"1079","to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chair, are necessary,"
"1080","appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting,"
"1081","including, without limitation, establishing: an agenda or order of"
"1082","business for the meeting; rules and procedures for maintaining order"
"1083","at the meeting and the safety of those present; conditions on the"

"1090","Shareholder or any other person who refuses to comply with meeting"
"1091","procedures, rules or guidelines as set forth by the chair of the"
"1092","meeting; and regulations for the opening and closing of the polls for"
"1093","balloting on matters which are to be voted on by ballot.  For any"
"1094","matter to be properly before any meeting of Shareholders, the matter"
"1095","must be a proper matter for Shareholder action under the Declaration"
"1096","of Trust, these Bylaws and applicable law and must be specifically"
"1097","identified in the notice of meeting given by or at the direction of a"
"1098","majority of the Trustees then in office or otherwise brought before"
"1099","the meeting by or at the direction of the chair of the meeting, in the"
"1100","chairs sole discretion.  With the exception of Shareholder proposals"
"1101","submitted in accordance with, and otherwise meeting the requirements"
"1102","of, Rule 14a 8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,"
"1103","or any successor provisions, only matters proposed by the Trustees may"
"1104","be included in the Trusts proxy materials.  At all meetings of"
"1105","Shareholders, unless voting is conducted by inspectors, all questions"
"1106","relating to the qualification of voters and the validity of proxies"
"1107","and the acceptance or rejection of votes shall be decided by the chair"
"1108","of the meeting.  The chair of the meeting shall determine, in the"
"1109","chairs sole discretion, whether to appoint an inspector for any"
"1110","meeting.  Unless otherwise determined by the chair of the meeting,"
"1111","meetings shall not be required to be held in accordance with any rules"
"1112","of parliamentary procedure."
"1113","       10.4  Access to Shareholder List.  Shareholders of record may"
"1114","apply in writing to the Trustees for assistance in communicating with"
"1115","other Shareholders for the purpose of calling a meeting in order to"
"1116","vote upon the question of removal of a Trustee.  With respect to any"
"1117","Fund as to which the Trust has given such an undertaking in its"
"1118","registration statement, and only such a Fund, or for any other Fund as"
"1119","the Trustees may determine in their sole discretion, when ten or more"
"1120","Shareholders of record who have been such for at least six months"

"1123","shall within five business days either:"
"1124","       (i) afford to such applicants access to a list of"
"1125","names and addresses of all Shareholders as recorded on the"
"1126","books of the Trust; or"
"1127","       (ii)  inform such applicants of the approximate number"
"1128","of Shareholders of record and the approximate cost of"
"1129","mailing material to them, and, within a reasonable time"
"1130","thereafter, mail, at the applicants expense, materials"
"1131","submitted by the applicants, to all such Shareholders of"
"1132","record.  The Trustees shall not be obligated to mail"
"1133","materials which they believe to be misleading or in"
"1134","violation of applicable law."

"1290","SUB MANAGEMENT CONTRACT"
"1291","       This Sub Management Contract is dated as of February 27, 2014"
"1292","between PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, LLC, a Delaware limited liability"
"1293","company (the Manager) and PUTNAM INVESTMENTS LIMITED, a company organized"
"1294","under the laws of England and Wales (the Sub Manager)."
"1295","       WHEREAS, the Manager is the investment manager of each of the"
"1296","investment companies registered under the United States Investment"
"1297","Company Act of 1940, as amended, that are identified on Schedule A"
"1298","hereto, as it may from time to time be amended by the Manager (the"
"1299","Funds), and a registered investment adviser under the United States"
"1300","Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended;"
"1301","       WHEREAS, the Sub Manager is licensed as an investment manager by"
"1302","the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom (the FCA); and"
"1303","       WHEREAS, the Manager desires to engage the Sub Manager from time to"
"1304","time to manage a portion of certain of the Funds:"
"1305","       NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein"
"1306","contained, it is agreed as follows:"
"1307","1.	SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BY SUB MANAGER."
"1308","       (a)	The Sub Manager, at its expense, will furnish continuously an"
"1309","investment program for that portion of any Fund the management of which"
"1310","is allocated from time to time by the Manager to the Sub Manager (an"
"1311","Allocated Sleeve). The Manager shall, in its sole discretion, determine"
"1312","which Funds will have an Allocated Sleeve and the amount of assets"
"1313","allocated from time to time to each such Allocated Sleeve; provided that,"
"1314","with respect to any Fund, the Trustees of such Fund must have approved"
"1315","the use of the Sub Manager prior to the creation of an Allocated Sleeve"
"1316","for such Fund. The Sub Manager will determine what investments shall be"
"1317","purchased, held, sold or exchanged by any Allocated Sleeve and what"
"1318","portion, if any, of the assets of the Allocated Sleeve shall be held"
"1319","uninvested and shall, on behalf of the Fund, make changes in the Funds"
"1320","investments held in such Allocated Sleeve."
"1321","       (b)	The Manager may also, at its discretion, request the Sub"
"1322","Manager to provide assistance with purchasing and selling securities for"
"1323","any Fund, including the placement of orders with broker dealers selected"
"1324","in accordance with Section 1(d), even if the Manager has not established"
"1325","an Allocated Sleeve for such Fund."
"1326","       (c)	The Sub Manager at its expense will furnish all necessary"
"1327","investment and management facilities, including salaries of personnel,"
"1328","required for it to execute its duties faithfully."
"1329","       (d)	The Sub Manager shall place all orders for the purchase and"
"1330","sale of portfolio investments for any Allocated Sleeve with brokers or"
"1331","dealers selected by the Sub Manager. In the selection of such brokers or"
"1332","dealers and the placing of such orders, the Sub Manager shall use its"
"1333","best efforts to obtain for the related Fund the most favorable price and"
"1334","execution available, except to the extent it may be permitted to pay"
"1335","higher brokerage commissions for brokerage and research services as"
"1336","described below. In using its best efforts to obtain for the Fund the"
"1337","most favorable price and execution available, the Sub Manager, bearing in"
"1338","mind the Funds best interests at all times, shall consider all factors it"
"1339","deems relevant, including by way of illustration, price, the size of the"
"1340","transaction, the nature of the market for the security, the amount of the"
"1341","commission, the timing of the transaction taking into account market"
"1342","prices and trends, the reputation, experience and financial stability of"
"1343","the broker or dealer involved and the quality of service rendered by the"
"1344","broker or dealer in other transactions. Subject to such policies as the"
"1345","Trustees of the Funds may determine, the Sub Manager shall not be deemed"
"1346","to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this"
"1347","Contract or otherwise solely by reason of its having caused a Fund to pay"
"1348","a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and research services to the"
"1349","Manager or the Sub Manager an amount of commission for effecting a"
"1350","portfolio investment transaction in excess of the amount of commission"
"1351","another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that"
"1352","transaction, if the Sub Manager determines in good faith that such amount"
"1353","of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage"
"1354","and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in terms"
"1355","of either that particular transaction or its overall responsibilities"
"1356","with respect to the Fund and to other clients of the Manager or the Sub"
"1357","Manager as to which the Manager or the Sub Manager exercises investment"
"1358","discretion. The Sub Manager agrees that in connection with purchases or"
"1359","sales of portfolio investments for any Fund, neither the Sub Manager nor"
"1360","any officer, director, employee or agent of the Sub Manager shall act as"
"1361","a principal or receive any commission other than as provided in Section"
"1362","3."
"1363","       (e)	The Sub Manager shall not be obligated to pay any expenses of"
"1364","or for the Manager or any Fund not expressly assumed by the Sub Manager"
"1365","pursuant to this Section 1."
"1366","       (f)	In the performance of its duties, the Sub Manager will comply"
"1367","with the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust and By Laws"
"1368","of each applicable Fund and such Funds stated investment objectives,"
"1369","policies and restrictions, and will use its best efforts to safeguard and"
"1370","promote the welfare of such Fund and to comply with other policies which"
"1371","the Manager or the Trustees may from time to time determine and shall"
"1372","exercise the same care and diligence expected of the Manager."
"1373","2.	OTHER AGREEMENTS, ETC."
"1374","       It is understood that any of the shareholders, Trustees, officers"
"1375","and employees of a Fund may be a shareholder, director, officer or"
"1376","employee of, or be otherwise interested in, the Sub Manager, and in any"
"1377","person controlled by or under common control with the Sub Manager, and"
"1378","that the Sub Manager and any person controlled by or under common control"
"1379","with the Sub Manager may have an interest in such Fund. It is also"
"1380","understood that the Sub Manager and any person controlled by or under"
"1381","common control with the Sub Manager have and may have advisory,"
"1382","management, service or other contracts with other organizations and"
"1383","persons, and may have other interests and business."
"1384","3.	COMPENSATION."
"1385","       Except as provided below, the Manager will pay to the Sub Manager"
"1386","as compensation for the Sub Managers services rendered, a fee, computed"
"1387","and paid quarterly at the annual rate of 0.35% per annum of average"
"1388","aggregate net asset value of the assets in equity and asset allocation"
"1389","Allocated Sleeves and 0.40% per annum of average aggregate net asset"
"1390","value of the assets in fixed income Allocated Sleeves, except for fixed"
"1391","income Allocated Sleeves in certain fixed income Funds enumerated as"
"1392","follows (with the per annum fee provided in parentheses): Putnam Money"
"1393","Market Liquidity Fund (0.20%), Putnam Short Term Investment Fund (0.20%),"
"1394","Putnam Money Market Fund (0.25%), Putnam Tax Exempt Money Market Fund"
"1395","(0.25%), Putnam VT Money Market Fund (0.25%), Putnam Short Duration"
"1396","Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam Short Term Municipal Income Fund (0.25%),"
"1397","Putnam American Government Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam Income Fund"
"1398","(0.25%), Putnam U.S. Government Income Trust (0.25%), Putnam VT American"
"1399","Government Income Fund (0.25%), and Putnam VT Income Fund (0.25%)."
"1400","       Such average net asset value shall be determined by taking an"
"1401","average of all of the determinations of such net asset value during a"
"1402","quarter at the close of business on each business day during such quarter"
"1403","while this Contract is in effect. Such fee shall be payable for each"
"1404","quarter within 30 days after the close of such quarter. The Sub Manager"
"1405","shall look only to the Manager for payment of its fees. No Fund shall"
"1406","have any responsibility for paying any fees due the Sub Manager."
"1407","       With respect to each of Putnam High Income Securities Fund, Putnam"
"1408","Master Intermediate Income Trust and Putnam Premier Income Trust, the"
"1409","Manager will pay to the Sub Manager as compensation for the Sub Managers"
"1410","services rendered, a fee, computed and paid quarterly at the annual rate"
"1411","of 0.40% of Average Weekly Assets in Allocated Sleeves. Average Weekly"
"1412","Assets means the average of the weekly determinations of the difference"
"1413","between the total assets of the Fund (including any assets attributable"
"1414","to leverage for investment purposes) attributable to an Allocated Sleeve"
"1415","and the total liabilities of the Fund (excluding liabilities incurred in"
"1416","connection with leverage for investment purposes) attributable to such"
"1417","Allocated Sleeve, determined at the close of the last business day of"
"1418","each week, for each week which ends during the quarter. Such fee shall be"
"1419","payable for each quarter within 30 days after the close of such quarter."
"1420","As used in this Section 3, leverage for investment purposes means any"
"1421","incurrence of indebtedness the proceeds of which are to be invested in"
"1422","accordance with the Funds investment objective. For purposes of"
"1423","calculating Average Weekly Assets, liabilities associated with any"
"1424","instruments or transactions used to leverage the Funds portfolio for"
"1425","investment purposes (whether or not such instruments or transactions are"
"1426","covered within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the"
"1427","rules and regulations thereunder, giving effect to any interpretations of"
"1428","the Securities and Exchange Commission and its staff) are not considered"
"1429","liabilities. For purposes of calculating Average Weekly Assets, the total"
"1430","assets of the Fund will be deemed to include (a) any proceeds from the"
"1431","sale or transfer of an asset (the Underlying Asset) of the Fund to a"
"1432","counterparty in a reverse repurchase or dollar roll transaction and (b)"
"1433","the value of such Underlying Asset as of the relevant measuring date."
"1434","       In the event that the Managers management fee from any of Putnam"
"1435","High Income Securities Fund, Putnam Master Intermediate Income Trust or"
"1436","Putnam Premier Income Trust is reduced pursuant to the investment"
"1437","management contract between such Fund and the Manager because during any"
"1438","Measurement Period (as defined below) the amount of interest payments and"
"1439","fees with respect to indebtedness or other obligation of the Fund"
"1440","incurred for investment leverage purposes, plus additional expenses"
"1441","attributable to any such leverage for investment purposes, exceeds the"
"1442","portion of the Funds net income and net short term capital gains (but not"
"1443","long term capital gains) accruing during such Measurement Period as a"
"1444","result of the fact that such indebtedness or other obligation was"
"1445","outstanding during the Measurement Period, the fee payable to  the Sub"
"1446","Manager with respect to such Fund shall be reduced in the same proportion"
"1447","as the fee paid to the Manager with respect to such Fund is so reduced."
"1448","Measurement Period shall be any period for which payments of interest or"
"1449","fees (whether designated as such or implied) are payable in connection"
"1450","with any indebtedness or other obligation of the Fund incurred for"
"1451","investment purposes."
"1452","       If the Sub Manager shall serve for less than the whole of a"
"1453","quarter, the foregoing compensation shall be prorated."
"1454","4.	ASSIGNMENT TERMINATES THIS CONTRACT; AMENDMENTS OF THIS CONTRACT."
"1455","       This Contract shall automatically terminate without the payment of"
"1456","any penalty, in the event of its assignment; and this Contract shall not"
"1457","be amended with respect to any Allocated Sleeve unless such amendment be"
"1458","approved at a meeting by the vote, cast in person at a meeting called for"
"1459","the purpose of voting on such approval, of a majority of the Trustees of"
"1460","the related Fund who are not interested persons of such Fund or of the"
"1461","Manager."
"1462","5.	EFFECTIVE PERIOD AND TERMINATION OF THIS CONTRACT."
"1463","       This Contract shall become effective upon its execution, and shall"
"1464","remain in full force and effect continuously thereafter (unless"
"1465","terminated automatically as set forth in Section 4) until terminated as"
"1466","follows:"

"1468","the related Fund may at any time terminate this Contract by not more than"
"1469","sixty days nor less than thirty days written notice delivered or mailed"
"1470","by registered mail, postage prepaid, to the other party, or"
"1471","       (b)	With respect to any Allocated Sleeve, if (i) the Trustees of"

"1473","majority of the outstanding shares of such Fund, and (ii) a majority of"
"1474","the Trustees of such Fund who are not interested persons of such Fund or"

"1479","its execution, or upon the expiration of one year from the effective date"
"1480","of the last such continuance, whichever is later, or"
"1481","       (c)	With respect to any Allocated Sleeve, automatically upon"

"1483","related Fund."
"1484","       Action by a Fund under (a) above may be taken either (i) by vote of"
"1485","a majority of its Trustees, or (ii) by the affirmative vote of a majority"
"1486","of the outstanding shares of such Fund."
"1487","       Termination of this Contract pursuant to this Section 5 will be"
"1488","without the payment of any penalty."
"1489","6.	CERTAIN DEFINITIONS."
"1490","       For the purposes of this Contract, the affirmative vote of a"

"1492","at a duly called and held meeting of shareholders of such Fund, (a) of"
"1493","the holders of 67% or more of the shares of such Fund present (in person"
"1494","or by proxy) and entitled to vote at such meeting, if the holders of more"
"1495","than 50% of the outstanding shares of such Fund entitled to vote at such"
"1496","meeting are present in person or by proxy, or (b) of the holders of more"
"1497","than 50% of the outstanding shares of such Fund entitled to vote at such"
"1498","meeting, whichever is less."
"1499","       For the purposes of this Contract, the terms affiliated person,"
"1500","control, interested person and assignment shall have their respective"
"1501","meanings defined in the United States Investment Company Act of 1940 and"
"1502","the Rules and Regulations thereunder (the 1940 Act), subject, however, to"
"1503","such exemptions as may be granted by the Securities and Exchange"

"1884","alternatively in their sole discretion, may submit the matter to a"
"1885","vote of the Shareholders of the Trust. Any such determination made by"
"1886","the Trustees in good faith shall be binding on all Shareholders."

"2095","Shares as set forth elsewhere in this Declaration of Trust or in the"
"2096","Bylaws, the Shareholders shall have power to vote only (i) for the"
"2097","election of Trustees as provided in Article IV, Section 1, (ii) for"

"2103","IX, Section 8, and (vi) with respect to such additional matters"
"2104","relating to the Trust as may be required by this Declaration of Trust,"
"2105","the Bylaws or any registration of the Trust with the Securities and"
"2106","Exchange Commission (or any successor agency) or any state, or as the"
"2107","Trustees may consider necessary or desirable.  Each whole Share shall"
"2108","be entitled to one vote as to any matter on which it is entitled to"

"2110","fractional vote.  On any matter submitted to a vote of Shareholders,"

"2115","determined that the matter affects one or more series or classes of"
"2116","Shares materially differently, Shares shall be voted by individual"
"2117","series or class; and (2) when the Trustees have determined that the"
"2118","matter affects only the interests of one or more series or classes,"
"2119","only Shareholders of such series or classes shall be entitled to vote"
"2120","thereon.  There shall be no cumulative voting in the election of"

"2123","valid if executed by any one of them unless at or prior to exercise of"
"2124","the proxy the Trust receives a specific written notice to the contrary"

"2127","prior to its exercise and, in the case of a challenge by any person"
"2128","other than the Trust, the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on"

"2130","Trustees may exercise all rights of Shareholders and may take any"
"2131","action required by law, this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws to be"
"2132","taken by Shareholders as to such series or class."

"2143","meeting at the Shareholders address as it appears on the records of"
"2144","the Trust.  If the Trustees shall fail to call or give notice of any"
"2145","meeting of Shareholders for a period of 30 days after written"
"2146","application by Shareholders holding at least 10% of the then"
"2147","outstanding shares of all series and classes entitled to vote at such"
"2148","meeting requesting a meeting to be called for a purpose requiring"
"2149","action by the Shareholders as provided herein or in the Bylaws, then"
"2150","Shareholders holding at least 10% of the then outstanding Shares of"

"2154","Trustees.  Notice of a meeting need not be given to any Shareholder if"
"2155","a written waiver of notice, executed by him or her before or after the"

"2160","       Section 3.	Thirty percent of Shares entitled to vote on a particular"
"2161","matter shall be a quorum for the transaction of business on that"
"2162","matter at a Shareholders meeting, except that where any provision of"
"2163","law or of this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws requires that"
"2164","holders of any series or class shall vote as an individual series or"
"2165","class, then thirty percent of the aggregate number of Shares of that"
"2166","series or class entitled to vote shall be necessary to constitute a"
"2167","quorum for the transaction of business by that series or class.  Any"
"2168","lesser number shall be sufficient for adjournments.  Any adjourned"
"2169","session or sessions may be held, within a reasonable time after the"
"2170","date set for the original meeting, without the necessity of further"
"2171","notice.  Except when a larger vote is required by any provision of law"
"2172","or of this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws, a majority of the"
"2173","Shares voted shall decide any questions and a plurality shall elect a"
"2174","Trustee, provided that where any provision of law or of this"
"2175","Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws requires that the holders of any"
"2176","series or class shall vote as an individual series or class then a"
"2177","majority of the Shares of that series or class voted on the matter (or"
"2178","a plurality with respect to the election of a Trustee) shall decide"
"2179","that matter insofar as that series or class is concerned."
"2180","Action by Written Consent"
"2181","       Section 4.	Any action taken by Shareholders may be taken without a"
"2182","meeting if a majority of Shareholders entitled to vote on the matter"
"2183","(or such larger proportion thereof as shall be required by any express"
"2184","provision of this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws) consent to the"
"2185","action in writing and such written consents are filed with the records"
"2186","of the meetings of Shareholders.  Such consent shall be treated for"
"2187","all purposes as a vote taken at a meeting of Shareholders."
"2188","Additional Provisions"
"2189","       Section 5.	The Bylaws may include further provisions, not"
"2190","inconsistent with this Declaration of Trust, regarding Shareholders"
"2191","voting powers, the conduct of meetings and related matters."

"2194","Distributions"
"2195","       Section 1.	The Trustees may each year, or more frequently if they so"
"2196","determine, distribute to the Shareholders of each series out of the"
"2197","assets of such series such amounts as the Trustees may determine.  Any"
"2198","such distribution to the Shareholders of a particular series shall be"
"2199","made to said Shareholders pro rata in proportion to the number of"
"2200","Shares of such series held by each of them, except to the extent"
"2201","otherwise required or permitted by the preferences and special or"
"2202","relative rights and privileges of any classes of Shares of that"
"2203","Series, and any distribution to the Shareholders of a particular class"
"2204","of Shares shall be made to such Shareholders pro rata in proportion to"
"2205","the number of Shares of such class held by each of them.  Such"
"2206","distributions shall be made in cash, Shares or other property, or a"
"2207","combination thereof, as determined by the Trustees.  Any such"
"2208","distribution paid in Shares will be paid at the net asset value"
"2209","thereof as determined in accordance with the Bylaws."
"2210","Redemptions and Repurchases"
"2211","       Section 2.	The Trust shall purchase such Shares as are offered by"
"2212","any Shareholder for redemption, upon the presentation of any"
"2213","certificate for the Shares to be purchased, a proper instrument of"
"2214","transfer and a request directed to the Trust or a person designated by"
"2215","the Trust that the Trust purchase such Shares, or in accordance with"
"2216","such other procedures for redemption as the Trustees may from time to"
"2217","time authorize; and the Trust will pay therefor the net asset value"
"2218","thereof, as next determined in accordance with the Bylaws, less any"
"2219","redemption charge fixed by the Trustees.  Payment for said Shares"
"2220","shall be made by the Trust to the Shareholder within seven days after"
"2221","the date on which the request is made.  The obligation set forth in"
"2222","this Section 2 is subject to the provision that in the event that at"
"2223","any time the New York Stock Exchange is closed for other than"
"2224","customary weekends or holidays, or, if permitted by rules of the"
"2225","Securities and Exchange Commission, during periods when trading on the"
"2226","Exchange is restricted or during any emergency which makes it"
"2227","impractical for the Trust to dispose of its investments or to"
"2228","determine fairly the value of its net assets, or during any other"
"2229","period permitted by order of the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"2230","for the protection of investors, such obligation may be suspended or"
"2231","postponed by the Trustees.  The Trust may also purchase or repurchase"
"2232","Shares at a price not exceeding the net asset value of such Shares in"
"2233","effect when the purchase or repurchase or any contract to purchase or"
"2234","repurchase is made.  Payment for any redemption, purchase or"
"2235","repurchase may be made in cash or, except to the extent prohibited by"
"2236","the laws of any jurisdiction in which Shares are registered for sale,"
"2237","in other property, or any combination thereof.  The composition of any"
"2238","such payment shall be determined by the Trust in its sole discretion,"
"2239","and the Trust shall have no obligation to effect a pro rata division"
"2240","of cash or other property in making any such payment.  In no event"
"2241","shall the Trust be liable for any delay of any other person in"
"2242","transferring securities or other property selected for delivery as all"
"2243","or part of any such payment."
"2244","Redemption at the Option of the Trust"
"2245","       Section 3.	The Trust shall have the right at its option and at any"
"2246","time to redeem Shares of any Shareholder at the net asset value"
"2247","thereof as determined in accordance with the Bylaws: (i) if at such"
"2248","time such Shareholder owns fewer Shares than, or Shares having an"
"2249","aggregate net asset value of less than, an amount determined from time"
"2250","to time by the Trustees, in which case the Trust may redeem all Shares"
"2251","owned by such Shareholder or only so many of such Shares as may be"
"2252","required to compensate the Trust for any fee fixed from time to time"
"2253","by the Trustees for the maintenance of small accounts; (ii) to the"
"2254","extent that such Shareholder owns Shares of a particular series of"
"2255","Shares equal to or in excess of a percentage of the outstanding Shares"
"2256","of that series determined from time to time by the Trustees; (iii) to"
"2257","the extent that such Shareholder owns Shares of the Trust representing"
"2258","a percentage equal to or in excess of such percentage of the aggregate"
"2259","number of outstanding Shares of the Trust or the aggregate net asset"
"2260","value of the Trust determined from time to time by the Trustees; (iv)"
"2261","if such Shareholder fails to supply appropriate personal and tax"
"2262","identification information requested by the Trust; (v) if such"
"2263","Shareholder fails to meet or maintain the qualifications for ownership"
"2264","of a particular series or class; or (vi) if the Trustees determine for"
"2265","any other reason, in their sole discretion, that the ownership of"
"2266","Shares by a Shareholder is not in the best interests of the remaining"
"2267","Shareholders of the Trust or of the applicable series or class."

"2316","body, in which such Covered Person may be or may have been involved as"
"2317","a party or otherwise or with which such Covered Person may be or may"
"2318","have been threatened, while in office or thereafter, by reason of"
"2319","being or having been such a Covered Person except with respect to any"
"2320","matter as to which such Covered Person shall have been finally"
"2321","adjudicated in any such action, suit or other proceeding (a) not to"

"2323","belief that such Covered Persons action was in the best interests of"
"2324","the Trust or at least was not opposed to the best interests of the"
"2325","Trust, (c) in the case of a criminal proceeding, to have had"
"2326","reasonable cause to believe his or her action was unlawful or (d) to"
"2327","be liable to the Trust or its Shareholders by reason of willful"
"2328","misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the"
"2329","duties involved in the conduct of such Covered Persons office (each of"
"2330","such exceptions being referred to hereinafter as Disabling Conduct)."
"2331","Expenses, including counsel fees so incurred by any such Covered"
"2332","Person (but excluding amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in"
"2333","compromise or as fines or penalties), shall be paid from time to time"
"2334","by the Trust in advance of the final disposition of any such action,"
"2335","suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of"
"2336","such Covered Person to repay amounts so paid to the Trust if it is"
"2337","ultimately determined that indemnification of such expenses is not"
"2338","authorized under this Article, provided, however, that either (a) such"
"2339","Covered Person shall have provided appropriate security for such"
"2340","undertaking, (b) the Trust shall be insured against losses arising"
"2341","from any such advance payments or (c) either a majority of the"
"2342","disinterested Trustees acting on the matter (provided that a majority"
"2343","of the disinterested Trustees then in office act on the matter), or"
"2344","independent legal counsel in a written opinion, shall have determined,"
"2345","based upon a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full"
"2346","trial type inquiry) that there is reason to believe that such Covered"
"2347","Person will be found entitled to indemnification under this Article."
"2348","In making any such determination, the disinterested Trustees or such"
"2349","counsel, as the case may be, shall afford the Covered Person a"
"2350","rebuttable presumption that the Covered Person did not engage in"

"2352","Compromise Payment"
"2353","       Section 2.	As to any matter disposed of (whether by a compromise"
"2354","payment, pursuant to a consent decree or otherwise) without an"
"2355","adjudication by a court, or by any other body before which the action,"
"2356","suit, or proceeding was brought, that such Covered Person engaged in"
"2357","Disabling Conduct, indemnification shall be provided if (a) approved"
"2358","as in the best interests of the Trust, after notice that it involves"
"2359","such indemnification, by at least a majority of the disinterested"
"2360","Trustees acting on the matter (provided that a majority of the"
"2361","disinterested Trustees then in office act on the matter) upon a"
"2362","determination, based upon a review of readily available facts (as"
"2363","opposed to a full trial type inquiry) that such Covered Person did not"
"2364","engage in Disabling Conduct, or (b) there has been obtained an opinion"
"2365","in writing of independent legal counsel, based upon a review of"
"2366","readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial type inquiry) to"
"2367","the effect that such Covered Person did not engage in Disabling"
"2368","Conduct.  Any approval pursuant to this Section shall not prevent the"
"2369","recovery from any Covered Person of any amount paid to such Covered"
"2370","Person in accordance with this Section as indemnification if such"
"2371","Covered Person is subsequently adjudicated by a court of competent"
"2372","jurisdiction not to have engaged in Disabling Conduct."

"2376","may be entitled.  As used in this Article VIII, the term Covered"
"2377","Person shall include such persons heirs, executors and administrators"
"2378","and a disinterested Trustee is a Trustee who is not an interested"
"2379","person of the Trust as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (or"
"2380","who has been exempted from being an interested person by any rule,"

"2382","against whom none of such actions, suits or other proceedings or"
"2383","another action, suit or other proceeding on the same or similar"

"2385","Article shall affect any rights to indemnification to which personnel"
"2386","of the Trust, other than Trustees or officers, and other persons may"
"2387","be entitled by contract or otherwise under law, nor the power of the"
"2388","Trust to purchase and maintain liability insurance on behalf of any"
"2389","such person."
"2390","Shareholders"
"2391","       Section 4.	In case any Shareholder or former Shareholder shall be"

"2394","omissions or for some other reason, the Shareholder or former"
"2395","Shareholder (or his or her heirs, executors, administrators or other"

"2578","PUTNAM CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES FUND"
"2579","MANAGEMENT CONTRACT"
"2580","       This Management Contract is dated as of February 27, 2014 between"
"2581","PUTNAM CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES FUND, a Massachusetts business trust"
"2582","(the Fund), and PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, LLC, a Delaware limited"
"2583","liability company (the Manager)."
"2584","       In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, it is"
"2585","agreed as follows:"
"2586","1. 	SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BY MANAGER TO FUND."
"2587","       (a) 	The Manager, at its expense, will furnish continuously an"
"2588","investment program for the Fund or, in the case of a Fund that has"
"2589","divided its shares into two or more series under Section 18(f)(2) of"
"2590","the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), each"
"2591","series of the Fund identified from time to time on Schedule A to this"
"2592","Contract (each reference in this Contract to a Fund or to the Fund is"
"2593","also deemed to be a reference to any existing series of the Fund, as"
"2594","appropriate in the particular context), will determine what"
"2595","investments will be purchased, held, sold or exchanged by the Fund and"
"2596","what portion, if any, of the assets of the Fund will be held"
"2597","uninvested and will, on behalf of the Fund, make changes in such"
"2598","investments. Subject always to the control of the Trustees of the Fund"
"2599","and except for the functions carried out by the officers and personnel"
"2600","referred to in Section 1(d), the Manager will also manage, supervise"
"2601","and conduct the other affairs and business of the Fund and matters"
"2602","incidental thereto. In the performance of its duties, the Manager will"
"2603","comply with the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust"
"2604","and By Laws of the Fund and the stated investment objectives, policies"
"2605","and restrictions of the Fund, will use its best efforts to safeguard"
"2606","and promote the welfare of the Fund and to comply with other policies"
"2607","which the Trustees may from time to time determine and will exercise"
"2608","the same care and diligence expected of the Trustees."
"2609","       (b) 	The Manager, at its expense, except as such expense is paid"
"2610","by the Fund as provided in Section 1(d), will furnish (1) all"
"2611","necessary investment and management facilities, including salaries of"
"2612","personnel, required for it to execute its duties faithfully; (2)"
"2613","suitable office space for the Fund; and (3) administrative facilities,"
"2614","including bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment necessary for"
"2615","the efficient conduct of the affairs of the Fund, including"
"2616","determination of the net asset value of the Fund, but excluding"
"2617","shareholder accounting services. Except as otherwise provided in"
"2618","Section 1(d), the Manager will pay the compensation, if any, of the"
"2619","officers of the Fund."
"2620","       (c)	The Manager, at its expense, will place all orders for the"
"2621","purchase and sale of portfolio investments for the Funds account with"
"2622","brokers or dealers selected by the Manager. In the selection of such"
"2623","brokers or dealers and the placing of such orders, the Manager will"
"2624","use its best efforts to obtain for the Fund the most favorable price"
"2625","and execution available, except to the extent it may be permitted to"
"2626","pay higher brokerage commissions for brokerage and research services"
"2627","as described below. In using its best efforts to obtain for the Fund"
"2628","the most favorable price and execution available, the Manager, bearing"
"2629","in mind the Funds best interests at all times, will consider all"
"2630","factors it deems relevant, including by way of illustration, price,"
"2631","the size of the transaction, the nature of the market for the security,"
"2632","the amount of the commission, the timing of the transaction taking"
"2633","into account market prices and trends, the reputation, experience and"
"2634","financial stability of the broker or dealer involved and the quality"
"2635","of service rendered by the broker or dealer in other transactions."
"2636","Subject to such policies as the Trustees of the Fund may determine,"
"2637","the Manager will not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have"
"2638","breached any duty created by this Contract or otherwise solely by"
"2639","reason of its having caused the Fund to pay a broker or dealer that"
"2640","provides brokerage and research services to the Manager an amount of"
"2641","commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in excess"
"2642","of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have"
"2643","charged for effecting that transaction, if the Manager determines in"
"2644","good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation"
"2645","to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such"
"2646","broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular"
"2647","transaction or the Managers overall responsibilities with respect to"
"2648","the Fund and to other clients of the Manager as to which the Manager"
"2649","exercises investment discretion. The Manager agrees that in connection"
"2650","with purchases or sales of portfolio investments for the Funds account,"
"2651","neither the Manager nor any officer, director, employee or agent of"
"2652","the Manager shall act as a principal or receive any commission other"
"2653","than as provided in Section 3."
"2654","       (d) 	The Fund will pay or reimburse the Manager for the"
"2655","compensation in whole or in part of such officers of the Fund and"
"2656","persons assisting them as may be determined from time to time by the"
"2657","Trustees of the Fund. The Fund will also pay or reimburse the Manager"
"2658","for all or part of the cost of suitable office space, utilities,"
"2659","support services and equipment attributable to such officers and"
"2660","persons as may be determined in each case by the Trustees of the Fund."
"2661","The Fund will pay the fees, if any, of the Trustees of the Fund."
"2662","       (e) 	The Manager will not be obligated to pay any expenses of or"
"2663","for the Fund not expressly assumed by the Manager pursuant to this"
"2664","Section 1 other than as provided in Section 3."
"2665","       (f) 	Subject to the prior approval of a majority of the Trustees,"
"2666","including a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons"
"2667","and, to the extent required by the 1940 Act and the rules and"
"2668","regulations under the 1940 Act, subject to any applicable guidance or"
"2669","interpretation of the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff,"
"2670","by the shareholders of the Fund, the Manager may, from time to time,"
"2671","delegate to a sub adviser or sub administrator any of the Managers"
"2672","duties under this Contract, including the management of all or a"
"2673","portion of the assets being managed. In all instances, however, the"
"2674","Manager must oversee the provision of delegated services, the Manager"
"2675","must bear the separate costs of employing any sub adviser or sub"
"2676","administrator, and no delegation will relieve the Manager of any of"
"2677","its obligations under this Contract."
"2678","2. 	OTHER AGREEMENTS, ETC."
"2679","       It is understood that any of the shareholders, Trustees, officers"
"2680","and employees of the Fund may be a shareholder, director, officer or"
"2681","employee of, or be otherwise interested in, the Manager, and in any"
"2682","person controlled by or under common control with the Manager, and"
"2683","that the Manager and any person controlled by or under common control"
"2684","with the Manager may have an interest in the Fund. It is also"
"2685","understood that the Manager and any person controlled by or under"
