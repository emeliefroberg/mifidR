"399","Report of Independent Registered"
"400","Public Accounting Firm"
"401","The Shareholders and Board of"
"402","Trustees HSBC Advisor Funds Trust:"
"403","In planning and performing our"
"404","audit of the financial statements"
"405","of HSBC Opportunity Fund (Advisor)"
"406","(the Fund) as of and for the year"
"407","ended October 31, 2014, in"
"408","accordance with the standards of"
"409","the Public Company Accounting 	Oversight"
"410","Board (United States), we considered the"
"411","Funds internal control over financial"
"412","reporting, including control activities"
"413","for safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"414","for designing our auditing procedures"
"415","for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"416","on the financial statements and to comply"
"417","with the requirements of Form N SAR, but"
"418","not for the purpose of expressing an"
"419","opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"420","Funds internal control over financial"
"421","reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"422","such opinion."
"423","Management of the Fund is responsible"
"424","for establishing and maintaining"
"425","effective internal control over"
"426","financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"427","responsibility, estimates and judgments"
"428","by management are required to assess the"
"429","expected benefits and related costs of"
"430","controls. A funds internal control over"
"431","financial reporting is a process designed"
"432","to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"433","the reliability of financial reporting"
"434","and the preparation of financial"
"435","statements for external purposes in"
"436","accordance with generally accepted"
"437","accounting principles. A funds internal"
"438","control over financial reporting includes"
"439","those policies and procedures that"
"440","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"441","that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"442","and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"443","dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"444","(2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"445","transactions are recorded as necessary"
"446","to permit preparation of financial"
"447","statements in accordance with generally"
"448","accepted accounting principles, and that"
"449","receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"450","being made only in accordance with"
"451","authorizations of management and directors"
"452","of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"453","assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"454","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,"
"455","or disposition of the funds assets that"
"456","could have a material effect on the"
"457","financial statements."
"458","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"459","internal control over financial reporting"
"460","may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"461","Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"462","effectiveness to future periods are subject"
"463","to the risk that controls may become"
"464","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"465","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"466","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"467","A deficiency in internal control over"
"468","financial reporting exists when the design"
"469","or operation of a control does not allow"
"470","management or employees, in the normal"
"471","course of performing their assigned"
"472","functions, to prevent or detect"
"473","misstatements on a timely basis."
"474","A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"475","or a combination of deficiencies,"
"476","in internal control over financial"
"477","reporting, such that there is a"
"478","reasonable possibility that a material"
"479","misstatement of the Funds annual or"
"480","interim financial statements will not"
"481","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."

"489","On December 16, 2014,"
"490","the Board of Trustees of HSBC Advisor Funds"
"491","Trust (the Funds or Registrant), upon the"
"492","recommendation of the Audit Committee"
"493","of the Board of Trustees"
"494","(the Audit Committee), determined not"
"495","to retain KPMG LLP (KPMG) and approved"
"496","a change of the Funds independent"
"497","registered public accounting firm to"
"498","PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC)"
"499","for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2015."
"500","For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2014"
"501","and October 31, 2013, KPMGs audit reports"
"502","concerning the Funds contained no adverse"
"503","opinion or disclaimer of opinion; nor were"
"504","its reports qualified or modified as to"
"505","uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting"
"506","principles.  Further, in connection with"
"507","its audits for the fiscal years ended October"
"508","31, 2014 and October 31, 2013, and through"
"509","December 23, 2014, there were no disagreements"

"511","accounting principles or practices,"
"512","financial statement disclosure or auditing"
"513","scope or procedure which, if not resolved to"
"514","the satisfaction of KPMG, would have caused"
"515","it to make reference to the disagreements in"
"516","its reports on the financial statements for"
"517","such periods.  In addition, there were no"
"518","reportable events of the kind described in"
"519","Item 304(a) (1) (v) of Regulation S-K under"
"520","the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as"

"523","and the interim period ended December 23, 2014,"
"524","neither the Registrant nor anyone on its behalf"
"525","consulted PwC concerning (i) the application of"
"526","accounting principles to a specified"
"527","transaction, either completed or proposed, or"
"528","the type of audit opinion that might be"
"529","rendered on the Registrants financial"
"530","statements or (ii) the subject of a disagreement"
"531","(as defined in paragraph (a) (1) (iv) of Item"

"533","described in paragraph (a) (1) (v) of"
"534","said Item 304)."
"535","The Registrant has requested KPMG to furnish it"
"536","with a letter addressed to the Securities and"
"537","Exchange Commission stating whether KPMG agrees"
"538","with the statements contained above. A copy of"
"539","the letter from KPMG to the Securities and"
"540","Exchange Commission is filed as an exhibit"
