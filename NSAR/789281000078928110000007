"593","<TEXT>"
"594","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"595","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"596","Federated Income Securities Trust:"
"597","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"598","Federated Muni and Stock Advantage Fund (the Fund) (one of the"
"599","portfolios constituting Federated Income Securities Trust) as of and"
"600","for the year ended October 31, 2009, in accordance with the standards"
"601","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"602","considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"603","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"604","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"605","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"606","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"607","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"608","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"609","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"610","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"611","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"612","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"613","controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"614","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"615","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"616","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"617","accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial"
"618","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"619","the maintenance of records that,  in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"620","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"621","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"622","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"623","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"624","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"625","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"626","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"627","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"628","company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"629","statements."
"630","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"631","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"632","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"633","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"634","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"635","procedures may deteriorate."
"636","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"637","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"638","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"639","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.   A material"
"640","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"641","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"642","possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or"
"643","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"644","timely basis."
"645","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"646","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"647","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"648","that might be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses under"
"649","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"650","(United States)."
"651","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over"
"652","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"653","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material weakness as"
"654","defined above as of October 31, 2009."
"655","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"656","management and the Board of Trustees of Federated Income Securities"
"657","Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to"

"670","LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"671","Since October 2003, Federated and related entities (collectively,"
"672","Federated), and various Federated funds (Funds), have been named as"
"673","defendants in several class action lawsuits now pending in the United States"
"674","District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuits were purportedly"
"675","filed on behalf of people who purchased, owned and/or redeemed shares of"
"676","Federated-sponsored mutual funds during specified periods beginning November"
"677","1, 1998. The suits are generally similar in alleging that Federated engaged"
"678","in illegal and improper trading practices including market timing and late"
"679","trading in concert with certain institutional traders, which allegedly caused"
"680","financial injury to the mutual fund shareholders. These lawsuits began to be"
"681","filed shortly after Federated's first public announcement that it had"
"682","received requests for information on shareholder trading activities in the"
"683","Funds from the SEC, the Office of the New York State Attorney General"
"684","(NYAG), and other authorities. In that regard, on November 28, 2005,"
"685","Federated announced that it had reached final settlements with the SEC and"
"686","the NYAG with respect to those matters. Specifically, the SEC and NYAG"
"687","settled proceedings against three Federated subsidiaries involving"
"688","undisclosed market timing arrangements and late trading. The SEC made"
"689","findings: that Federated Investment Management Company (FIMC), an SEC-"
"690","registered investment adviser to various Funds, and Federated Securities"
"691","Corp., an SEC-registered broker-dealer and distributor for the Funds,"
"692","violated provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and Investment Company Act"
"693","by approving, but not disclosing, three market timing arrangements, or the"
"694","associated conflict of interest between FIMC and the funds involved in the"
"695","arrangements, either to other fund shareholders or to the funds' board; and"
"696","that Federated Shareholder Services Company, formerly an SEC-registered"
"697","transfer agent, failed to prevent a customer and a Federated employee from"
"698","late trading in violation of provisions of the Investment Company Act. The"
"699","NYAG found that such conduct violated provisions of New York State law."
"700","Federated entered into the settlements without admitting or denying the"
"701","regulators' findings. As Federated previously reported in 2004, it has"
"702","already paid approximately $8.0 million to certain funds as determined by an"
"703","independent consultant. As part of these settlements, Federated agreed to pay"
"704","disgorgement and a civil money penalty in the aggregate amount of an"
"705","additional $72 million and, among other things, agreed that it would not"
"706","serve as investment adviser to any registered investment company unless"
"707","(i) at least 75% of the fund's directors are independent of Federated,"
"708","(ii) the chairman of each such fund is independent of Federated, (iii) no"
"709","action may be taken by the fund's board or any committee thereof unless"
"710","approved by a majority of the independent trustees of the fund or committee,"
"711","respectively, and (iv) the fund appoints a senior officer who reports to"
"712","the independent trustees and is responsible for monitoring compliance by the"
"713","fund with applicable laws and fiduciary duties and for managing the process"
"714","by which management fees charged to a fund are approved. The settlements are"
"715","described in Federated's announcement which, along with previous press"
"716","releases and related communications on those matters, is available in the"
"717","About Us section of Federated's website at FederatedInvestors.com."
"718","Federated entities have also been named as defendants in several additional"
"719","lawsuits that are now pending in the United States District Court for the"
"720","Western District of Pennsylvania, alleging, among other things, excessive"
"721","advisory and Rule 12b-1 fees."
"722","The Board of the Funds retained the law firm of Dickstein Shapiro LLP to"
"723","represent the Funds in each of the lawsuits described in the preceding two"
"724","paragraphs. Federated and the Funds, and their respective counsel, have been"
"725","defending this litigation, and none of the Funds remains a defendant in any"
"726","of the lawsuits (though some could potentially receive any recoveries as"
"727","nominal defendants). Additional lawsuits based upon similar allegations may"
"728","be filed in the future. The potential impact of these lawsuits, all of which"
"729","seek unquantified damages, attorneys' fees, and expenses, and future"
"730","potential similar suits is uncertain. Although we do not believe that these"
"731","lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Funds, there can be no"
"732","assurance that these suits, ongoing adverse publicity and/or other"
"733","developments resulting from the regulatory investigations will not result in"
"734","increased Fund redemptions, reduced sales of Fund shares, or other adverse"
"735","consequences for the Funds."
