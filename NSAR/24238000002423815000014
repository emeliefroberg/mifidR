"1345","<P ALIGN=LEFT>To the Board of Trustees of Fidelity Contrafund and Shareholders of Fidelity Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights"
"1346","Fund and Fidelity Series Opportunistic Insights Fund:"
"1347","</P>"
"1348","<P ALIGN=LEFT>In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Fidelity Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights"
"1349","Fund and Fidelity Series Opportunistic Insights Fund (funds of Fidelity Contrafund) (the &quot;Funds&quot;) as of and for the"
"1350","year ended December 31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1351","Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1352","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1353","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,  but not for the purpose of expressing"
"1354","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"1355","</P>"
"1356","<P ALIGN=LEFT>The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1357","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed"
"1358","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control"
"1359","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1360","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1361","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"1362","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1363","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets"
"1364","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1365","</P>"
"1366","<P ALIGN=LEFT>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1367","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1368","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1369","deteriorate."
"1370","</P>"
"1371","<P ALIGN=LEFT>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the fund's"
"1372","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1373","</P>"
"1374","<P ID=c:\desktop\Contrafund_-_F2465_and_F2459.html.2 ALIGN=LEFT>Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the"
"1375","first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that"
"1376","might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1377","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1378","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"1379","above as of December 31, 2014."

"3317","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Sub-Advisor and its subsidiaries and other affiliated persons have personnel in various locations throughout the world and have been formed in part for the purpose of researching and compiling information"
"3318","and recommendations with respect to the economies of various countries, and securities of issuers located in such"

"3321","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises hereinafter set forth, the"

"3324","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	1.  <U>Duties</U>:  The Advisor may, in its discretion, appoint the Sub-Advisor to perform one or more of the following services with respect to all or a portion of the investments of the Portfolio.  The services and the portion of the"
"3325","investments of the Portfolio to be advised or managed by the Sub-Advisor shall be as agreed upon from time to time"

"3327","</P>"
"3328","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(a)<I> <U>Investment Advice</U>:</I>  If and to the extent requested by the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor shall provide investment advice to the Portfolio and the Advisor with respect to all or a portion of the investments of the Portfolio, and in connection with such advice shall furnish the Portfolio and the Advisor such factual information,"
"3329","research reports and investment recommendations as the Advisor may reasonably require.  Such information"
"3330","may include written and oral reports and analyses."
"3331","</P>"
"3332","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(b) <I><U>Investment Management</U>:</I>  If and to the extent requested by the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor shall, subject to"
"3333","the supervision of the Advisor, manage all or a portion of the investments of the Portfolio in accordance with"
"3334","the investment objective, policies and limitations provided in the Portfolio's Prospectus or other governing"
"3335","instruments, as amended from time to time, the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &quot;1940 Act&quot;) and rules"
"3336","thereunder, as amended from time to time, and such other limitations as the Trust or Advisor may impose"
"3337","with respect to the Portfolio by notice to the Sub-Advisor.  With respect to the portion of the investments of"
"3338","the Portfolio under its management, the Sub-Advisor is authorized to make investment decisions on behalf of"
"3339","the Portfolio with regard to any stock, bond, other security or investment instrument, and to place orders for"
"3340","the purchase and sale of such securities through such broker-dealers as the Sub-Advisor may select.  The Sub-Advisor may also be authorized, but only to the extent such duties are delegated in writing by the Advisor, to"
"3341","provide additional investment management services to the Portfolio, including but not limited to services"
"3342","such as managing foreign currency investments, purchasing and selling or writing futures and options contracts, borrowing money or lending securities on behalf of the Portfolio.  All investment management and any"
"3343","other activities of the Sub-Advisor shall at all times be subject to the control and direction of the Advisor and"
"3344","the Trust's Board of Trustees."
"3345","</P>"
"3346","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(c) <I><U>Subsidiaries and Affiliates</U></I>:  The Sub-Advisor may perform any or all of the services contemplated by this"
"3347","Agreement directly or through such of its subsidiaries or other affiliated persons as the Sub-Advisor shall determine; provided, however, that performance of such services through such subsidiaries or other affiliated"
"3348","persons shall have been approved by the Trust to the extent required pursuant to the 1940 Act and rules thereunder."
"3349","</P>"
"3350","<P ID=C__\desktop\q77q1_subadvisory_eq.html.2 ALIGN=LEFT>"
"3351","</P>"
"3352","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	2.  <U>Information to be Provided to the Trust and the Advisor</U>:  The Sub-Advisor shall furnish such reports, evaluations, information or analyses to the Trust and the Advisor as the Trust's Board of Trustees or the Advisor may"
"3353","reasonably request from time to time, or as the Sub-Advisor may deem to be desirable."
"3354","</P>"
"3355","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	3.  <U>Brokerage</U>:  In connection with the services provided under subparagraph (b) of paragraph 1 of this Agreement, the Sub-Advisor shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's account with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Advisor, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the"
"3356","Advisor or Sub-Advisor.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices"
"3357","which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"3358","Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or to the other accounts over which the Sub-Advisor or Advisor exercise"
"3359","investment discretion.  The Sub-Advisor is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and"
"3360","research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess of the"
"3361","amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor"
"3362","determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"3363","research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor has with respect to accounts over which it"
"3364","exercises investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Trust shall periodically review the commissions paid by the"
"3365","Portfolio to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the"
"3366","benefits to the Portfolio."
"3367","</P>"
"3368","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	4.  <U>Compensation</U>:  The Advisor shall compensate the Sub-Advisor on the following basis for the services to"
"3369","be furnished hereunder."
"3370","</P>"
"3371","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(a) <I><U>Investment Advisory Fee</U></I>:  For services provided under subparagraph (a) of paragraph 1 of this Agreement,"
"3372","the Advisor agrees to pay the Sub-Advisor a monthly Sub-Advisory Fee.  The Sub-Advisory Fee shall be"
"3373","equal to 110% of the Sub-Advisor's costs incurred in connection with rendering the services referred to in"
"3374","subparagraph (a) of paragraph 1 of this Agreement.  The Sub-Advisory Fee shall not be reduced to reflect"
"3375","expense reimbursements or fee waivers by the Advisor, if any, in effect from time to time."
"3376","</P>"
"3377","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(b) <I><U>Investment Management Fee</U>:</I>  For services provided under subparagraph (b) of paragraph 1 of this Agreement, the Advisor agrees to pay the Sub-Advisor a monthly Investment Management Fee.  The Investment"
"3378","Management Fee shall be equal to: (i) 50% of the monthly management fee rate (including performance adjustments, if any) that the Portfolio is obligated to pay the Advisor under its Management Contract with the"
"3379","Advisor, multiplied by: (ii) the fraction equal to the net assets of the Portfolio as to which the Sub-Advisor"
"3380","shall have provided investment management services divided by the net assets of the Portfolio for that month;"
"3381","provided, however, that the Investment Management Fee paid to the Sub-Advisor for any period hereunder"
"3382","shall in all circumstances be an amount not less than 110% of the Sub-Advisor's costs incurred in connection"
"3383","with rendering the services referred to in subparagraph (b) of paragraph 1 of this Agreement (but in no event"
"3384","will the Investment Management Fee paid to the Sub-Advisor exceed the management fee paid to the Advisor"
"3385","pursuant to its management contract with respect to the Portfolio) (the minimum fee described in this proviso"
"3386","being referred to herein as the &quot;Minimum Investment Management Fee&quot;).  If in any fiscal year the aggregate"
"3387","expenses of the Portfolio exceed any applicable expense limitation imposed by any state or federal securities"
"3388","laws or regulations, and the Advisor waives all or a portion of its management fee or reimburses the Portfolio"
"3389","for expenses to the extent required to satisfy such limitation, the Investment Management Fee paid to the"
"3390","Sub-Advisor will be reduced by 50% of the amount of such waivers or reimbursements multiplied by the fraction determined in (ii), subject to the Minimum Investment Management Fee.  If the Sub-Advisor reduces its"
"3391","fees to reflect such waivers or reimbursements and the Advisor subsequently recovers all or any portion of"
"3392","such waivers or reimbursements, then the Sub-Advisor shall be entitled to receive from the Advisor a proportionate share of the amount recovered."
"3393","</P>"
"3394","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(c)<I> <U>Provision of Multiple Services</U>:</I>  If the Sub-Advisor shall have provided both investment advisory services"
"3395","under subparagraph (a) and investment management services under subparagraph (b) of paragraph (1) for the"
"3396","same portion of the investments of the Portfolio for the same period, the fees paid to the Sub-Advisor with"
"3397","respect to such investments shall be calculated exclusively under subparagraph (b) of this paragraph 4."
"3398","</P>"
"3399","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	5.  <U>Expenses</U>: It is understood that the Portfolio will pay all of its expenses other than those expressly stated to"
"3400","be payable by the Sub-Advisor hereunder or by the Advisor under the Management Contract with the Portfolio."
"3401","</P>"
"3402","<P ID=C__\desktop\q77q1_subadvisory_eq.html.3 ALIGN=LEFT>	6.  <U>Interested Persons</U>:  It is understood that Trustees, officers, and shareholders of the Trust are or may be or"
"3403","become interested in the Advisor or the Sub-Advisor as directors, officers or otherwise and that directors, officers"
"3404","and stockholders of the Advisor or the Sub-Advisor are or may be or become similarly interested in the Trust, and"
"3405","that the Advisor or the Sub-Advisor may be or become interested in the Trust as a shareholder or otherwise."
"3406","</P>"
"3407","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	7.  <U>Services to Other Companies or Accounts</U>:  The services of the Sub-Advisor to the Advisor are not to be"
"3408","deemed to be exclusive, the Sub-Advisor being free to render services to others and engage in other activities, provided, however, that such other services and activities do not, during the term of this Agreement, interfere, in a material manner, with the Sub-Advisor's ability to meet all of its obligations hereunder.  The Sub-Advisor shall for all"
"3409","purposes be an independent contractor and not an agent or employee of the Advisor or the Trust."
"3410","</P>"
"3411","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	8.  <U>Standard of Care</U>: In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard"
"3412","of obligations or duties hereunder on the part of the Sub-Advisor, the Sub-Advisor shall not be subject to liability to"
"3413","the Advisor, the Trust or to any shareholder of the Portfolio for any act or omission in the course of, or connected"
"3414","with, rendering services hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any"
"3415","security."

"3421","after such period shall be specifically approved at least annually by vote of the Trust's Board of"
"3422","Trustees or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Portfolio."
"3423","</P>"
"3424","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(b)	This Agreement may be modified by mutual consent of the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor and the Portfolio subject to the provisions of Section 15 of the 1940 Act, as modified by or interpreted by any applicable order or orders of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &quot;Commission&quot;) or any rules"
"3425","or regulations adopted by, or interpretative releases or no-action letters of, the Commission or its"

"3430","party, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval."
"3431","</P>"
"3432","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(d)	Either the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor or the Portfolio may, at any time on sixty (60) days' prior written"
"3433","notice to the other parties, terminate this Agreement, without payment of any penalty, by action of its"
"3434","Board of Trustees or Directors, or with respect to the Portfolio by vote of a majority of its outstanding voting securities.  This Agreement shall terminate automatically in the event of its assignment."

"3437","any obligations of the Trust or the Portfolio arising in connection with this Agreement shall be limited in all cases to"
"3438","the Portfolio and its assets, and the Sub-Advisor shall not seek satisfaction of any such obligation from the shareholders or any shareholder of the Portfolio.  Nor shall the Sub-Advisor seek satisfaction of any such obligation from"
"3439","the Trustees or any individual Trustee."
"3440","</P>"
"3441","<P ALIGN=LEFT>  	11.	<U>Governing Law</U>:  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws"
"3442","of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without giving effect to the choice of laws provisions thereof."
"3443","</P>"
"3444","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	The terms &quot;registered investment company,&quot; &quot;vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities,&quot; &quot;assignment,&quot; and &quot;interested persons,&quot; when used herein, shall have the respective meanings specified in the 1940 Act"
