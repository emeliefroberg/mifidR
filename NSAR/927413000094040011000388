"3490","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"3491","To the Shareholders and Trustees of WT Mutual Fund"
"3492","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"3493","statements of WT Mutual Fund (the Trust) as of and for the"
"3494","year ended June 30, 2011, in accordance with the standards of"
"3495","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"3496","we considered the Trust's internal control over financial"
"3497","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"3498","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"3499","of expressing our opinions on the financial statements and to"
"3500","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"3501","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"3502","Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"3503","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3504","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing"
"3505","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"3506","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"3507","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"3508","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal"
"3509","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"3510","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"3511","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"3512","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"3513","accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"3514","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"3515","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"3516","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"3517","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"3518","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"3519","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"3520","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"3521","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"3522","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"3523","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"3524","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"3525","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"3526","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"3527","statements."
"3528","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"3529","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"3530","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"3531","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3532","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"3533","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"3534","deteriorate."
"3535","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"3536","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"3537","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"3538","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3539","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"3540","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"3541","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"3542","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"3543","company's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"3544","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3545","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over"
"3546","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"3547","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"3548","deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"3549","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"3550","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted"
"3551","no deficiencies in the Trust's internal control over financial"
"3552","reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"3553","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material"
"3554","weakness as defined above as of June 30, 2011."
"3555","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"3556","management and the Board of Trustees of the Trust and the"
"3557","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be"
"3558","and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"3559","parties."

"3889","brokers, subject to the Adviser determining in good faith"
"3890","that such commission is reasonable in terms either of the"
"3891","particular transaction or of the overall responsibility"
"3892","of the Adviser to the Fund and its other clients and that"

"4930","objective, policies or restrictions in accordance with"
"4931","applicable laws, at any time."

"4933","consummated by payment to or delivery by the custodian"
"4934","designated by the Trust (the Custodian), or such"
"4935","depositories or agents as may be designated by the Custodian"
"4936","in writing, of all cash and/or securities due to or from each"
"4937","Fund Account, and the Sub-Adviser shall not have possession or"
"4938","custody thereof.  The Sub-Adviser shall advise the Custodian"
"4939","and confirm in writing to the Trust and to the administrator"
"4940","designated by the Trust or any other designated agent of the"
"4941","Trust, all investment orders for each Fund Account placed by"
"4942","it with brokers and dealers at the time and in the manner set"
"4943","forth in Schedule B hereto (as amended from time to time). The"
"4944","Trust shall issue to the Custodian such instructions as may be"
"4945","appropriate in connection with the settlement of any"
"4946","transaction initiated by the Sub-Adviser. The Trust shall be"
"4947","responsible for all custodial arrangements and the payment of"
"4948","all custodial charges and fees, and, upon giving proper"
"4949","instructions to the Custodian, the Sub-Adviser shall have no"
"4950","responsibility or liability with respect to custodial"
"4951","arrangements or the acts, omissions or other conduct of the"
"4952","Custodian, except that it shall be the responsibility of the"

"4954","to confirm in writing proper execution of the instructions."
"4955","VII.	Allocation of Brokerage.  The Sub-Adviser shall have"
"4956","authority and discretion to select brokers and dealers"
"4957","(including brokers that may be affiliates of the Sub-Adviser"
"4958","to the extent permitted by Section VII C hereof) to execute"

"4960","the selection of the markets on or in which the transactions"
"4961","will be executed, subject to the following and subject to"
"4962","conformance with the policies and procedures disclosed in the"
"4963","Funds' Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information and"
"4964","the policies and procedures adopted by the Trust's Board of"

"4966","      A.	In executing portfolio transactions, the Sub-Adviser"

"4969","consider the financial responsibility, research and investment"
"4970","information and other services provided by brokers or dealers"
"4971","who may effect or be a party to any such transaction or other"
"4972","transactions to which other clients of the Sub-Adviser may be"
"4973","a party. It is understood that neither the Trust, nor the"
"4974","Adviser or Sub-Adviser has adopted a formula for allocation of"

"4978","research and security and economic analyses provided by"
"4979","certain brokers who may execute brokerage transactions at a"
"4980","higher commission to the Funds than may result when allocating"
"4981","brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the lowest"
"4982","commission. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to place"
"4983","orders for the purchase and sale of securities for the Funds"
"4984","with certain such brokers, subject to review by the Trust's"
"4985","Board of Trustees from time to time with respect to the extent"
"4986","and continuation of this practice. It is understood that the"
"4987","services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-"
"4988","Adviser in connection with its services to other clients of"
"4989","the Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser is also authorized to place"
"4990","orders with certain brokers for services deemed by the Adviser"
"4991","to be beneficial for the Funds; and the Sub-Adviser shall"

"4993","regard."

"4995","or sale of a security to be in the best interest of a Fund"
"4996","Account as well as other clients of the Sub-Adviser, the Sub-"
"4997","Adviser, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and"
"4998","regulations, may, but shall be under no obligation to,"
"4999","aggregate the securities to be sold or purchased in order to"
"5000","obtain the best price and execution.  In such event,"
"5001","allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as"
"5002","expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Sub-"
"5003","Adviser in the manner it considers to be the most equitable"
"5004","and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Trust in"
"5005","respect of the Funds and to such other clients."
"5006","      C.	The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not execute any"
"5007","portfolio transactions for a Fund Account with a broker or"
"5008","dealer which is (i) an affiliated person of the Trust, the"
"5009","Adviser or any sub-adviser for any Funds of the Trust; (ii) a"
"5010","principal underwriter of the Trust 's shares; or (iii) an"
"5011","affiliated person of such an affiliated person or principal"
"5012","underwriter, unless such transactions are (x) exempt under"
"5013","Rules 10f-3(b) or 17a-10, (y) executed in accordance with Rule"

"5019","connection with the exemptions provided under Rules 10f-3(b),"
"5020","12d3-1, and 17a-10 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Adviser (i)"
"5021","will not consult with any other sub-adviser of the Funds,"
"5022","which is advising the Funds, concerning the Sub-Adviser or its"
"5023","affiliated persons' transactions with the Funds in securities"

"5043","advisory services for other individuals or entities and that"
