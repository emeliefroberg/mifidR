"656","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"657","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"658","Franklin Strategic Mortgage Portfolio"
"659","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Franklin"
"660","Strategic Mortgage Portfolio (the Fund) as of and for the year ended"
"661","September 30, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"662","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's"
"663","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"664","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"665","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"666","to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"667","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"668","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"669","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"670","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"671","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"672","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"673","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal"
"674","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"675","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"676","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"677","with generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over"
"678","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"679","to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"680","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"681","(2) provide  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"682","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"683","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"684","fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"685","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"686","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"687","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"688","effect on the financial statements."
"689","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"690","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"691","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"692","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"693","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"694","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"695","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"696","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"697","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"698","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"699","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"700","misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"701","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"702","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"703","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"704","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"705","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"706","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we"
"707","noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"708","and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"709","consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of September 30, 2012."
"710","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"711","the Board of Trustees of Franklin Strategic Mortgage Portfolio and the"
"712","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should"
"713","not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"741","opportunities through access to a wider range of mortgage-related investments."
"742","These strategic changes are consistent with the Fund's current goal of seeking"
"743","high total return relative to the performance of the general mortgage"
"744","securities market, and will permit the Fund to expand its investments in:"
"745","(1) non-agency mortgage securities; (2) non-investment grade (high-yield)"
"746","mortgage securities; (3) non-U.S. dollar denominated mortgage securities;"
"747","and (4) certain derivative instruments that could be used to assist the Fund"
"748","in hedging its investments in, or gaining exposure to, the general mortgage"
"749","securities market.  The Board also approved reducing the Fund's current 20%"
"750","of assets limitation on investments in foreign securities to 15%, and"
"751","removing the separate 10% limitation on non-U.S. dollar denominated mortgage"
"752","securities of non-U.S. issuers. By seeking incrementally greater returns"
"753","through a wider range of mortgage investments, the Fund may be subject to"
"754","certain greater risks, including increased credit, counterparty, currency"
"755","and liquidity risks.  Overall, it is likely that the proposed changes will"
"756","increase the volatility of the Fund's returns, relative to the current"
"757","portfolio and the Fund's benchmark."
"758","Effective on or about August 15, 2012, the Fund's principal investment"
"759","strategies will be as follows:"
"760","Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net"
"761","assets in mortgage securities. The Fund invests substantially in mortgage"
"762","securities that are issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies"
"763","or instrumentalities, which include mortgage pass-through securities"
"764","representing interests in pools of mortgage loans issued or guaranteed"
"765","by the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), Fannie Mae,"
"766","and Freddie Mac.  These securities may be fixed-rate or adjustable-rate"
"767","mortgage securities (ARMS). Government agency or instrumentality issues have"
"768","different levels of credit support."
"769","The Fund also invests in other types of mortgage securities including, but"
"770","not limited to, certain ARMS, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS),"
"771","home equity loan asset-backed securities (HELs), manufactured housing"
"772","asset-backed securities (MHs), and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs),"
"773","as well as in other mortgage-related asset-backed securities. The Fund also"
"774","may invest in U.S. Treasury securities.  The Fund may invest a small portion"
"775","of its assets directly in mortgage loans."
"776","The Fund may invest up to 15% of its assets in foreign securities, which may"
"777","include non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign mortgage securities.  In addition,"
"778","the Fund may invest up to 20% of its total assets in high-yield, lower-quality"
"779","securities rated, at the time of purchase, below BBB by S&P, or Baa by"
"780","Moody's, respectively, or, if unrated, deemed to be of comparable quality"
"781","by the investment manager. The Fund may also invest up to 33% of its gross"
"782","assets in mortgage dollar rolls and may buy securities on a when-issued"
"783","or delayed delivery basis."
"784","For purposes of pursuing its investment goal the Fund may enter into interest"
"785","rate and credit related transactions involving certain derivative instruments,"
"786","including interest rate and credit default swaps and U.S. Treasury futures"
"787","contracts. The Fund may use these derivative instruments for hedging purposes"
"788","or for other investment purposes, including to generate income, to increase"
"789","liquidity and/or to gain exposure to certain instruments or markets in a more"
"790","efficient or less expensive way.  The use of credit default swaps may allow"
"791","the Fund to obtain net long or short exposure to select credit risks. The"
"792","Fund may also enter into currency-related derivative transactions for"
"793","hedging purposes, including currency forwards and currency swaps."
"794","III. The following is added to the FUND DETAILS - Principal Investment
Policies and Practices section beginning on page 10:"
"795","On May 22, 2012, the Board of Trustees of Franklin Strategic Mortgage"
"796","Portfolio approved changes to the Fund's investment strategies to be"
"797","implemented on or about August 15, 2012.  Once implemented, the Fund's"
"798","principal investment strategies will be as follows:"
"799","Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net"
"800","assets in mortgage securities.  Shareholders will be given at least 60 days'"
"801","advance notice of any change to the 80% policy. The Fund invests"
"802","substantially in mortgage securities that are issued or guaranteed by the"
"803","U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities, which include mortgage"
"804","pass-through securities representing interests in pools of mortgage loans"
"805","issued or guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association"
"806","(Ginnie Mae), Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.  These securities may be fixed-rate"
"807","or adjustable-rate mortgage securities (ARMS)."
"808","Government agency or instrumentality issues have different levels of credit"
"809","support. Ginnie Mae pass-through mortgage certificates are backed by the full"
"810","faith and credit of the U.S. government. U.S. government-sponsored entities,"
"811","such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, may be chartered by Acts of Congress, but"
"812","their securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. government."
"813","Although the U.S. government has recently provided financial support to"
"814","Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, no assurance can be given that the U.S."
"815","government will continue to do so.  Accordingly, securities issued by"
"816","Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may involve a risk of non-payment of principal"
"817","and interest. For example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pass-through mortgage"
"818","certificates are backed by the credit of the respective instrumentality and"
"819","are not guaranteed by the U.S. government. The U.S. Department of the"
"820","Treasury, however, has the authority to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac"
"821","by purchasing limited amounts of their respective obligations. Investors"
"822","should remember that guarantees of timely repayment of principal and interest"
"823","do not apply to the market prices and yields of the securities or to the net"
"824","asset value or performance of the Fund, which will vary with changes in"
"825","interest rates and other market conditions. Any downgrade of the credit"
"826","rating of the securities issued by the U.S. government may result in a"
"827","downgrade of securities issued by its agencies or instrumentalities,"
"828","including government-sponsored entities."
"829","The Fund also invests in other types of mortgage securities that may be"
"830","issued or guaranteed by private issuers including, but not limited to,"
"831","certain ARMS, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), home equity"
"832","loan asset-backed securities (HELs), manufactured housing asset-backed"
"833","securities (MHs), and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), as well"
"834","as in other mortgage-related asset-backed securities. The Fund also may"
"835","invest in U.S. Treasury securities.  The Fund may invest a small portion of"
"836","its assets directly in mortgage loans."
"837","The Fund may invest up to 15% of its assets in foreign securities, which"
"838","may include non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign mortgage securities."
"839","In addition, the Fund may invest up to 20% of its total assets in high-yield,"
"840","lower quality securities rated, at the time of purchase, below BBB by S&P, or"
"841","Baa by Moody's, respectively, or, if unrated, deemed to be of comparable"
"842","quality by the investment manager. In the event the rating of an issue is"
"843","changed by the ratings service or the security goes into default, the Fund"
"844","will consider that event in its evaluation of the overall investment merits of"
"845","that security, but will not necessarily dispose of the security immediately."
"846","The Fund may invest up to 33% of its gross assets in mortgage dollar rolls."
"847","In a mortgage dollar roll, the Fund sells (or buys) mortgage-backed"
"848","securities for delivery on a specified date and simultaneously contracts"
"849","to repurchase (or sell) substantially similar (same type,"
"850","coupon, and maturity) securities on a future date. During the period between"
"851","a sale and repurchase, the Fund forgoes principal and interest paid on"
"852","the mortgage-backed securities. The Fund earns or loses money on a mortgage"
"853","dollar roll from any difference between the sale price and the future"
"854","purchase price.  In a sale and repurchase, the Fund also earns money on the"
"855","interest earned on the cash proceeds of the initial sale. The Fund will"
"856","invest only in covered mortgage dollar rolls, meaning that the Fund"
"857","establishes a segregated account with liquid securities equal in value to"
"858","the securities it will repurchase."
"859","The Fund may buy securities on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis."
"860","This means that the securities will be paid for and delivered to the Fund"
"861","at a future date, generally in 30 to 45 days."
"862","For purposes of pursuing its investment goal, the Fund may enter into"
"863","currency-related derivative transactions, including currency forwards and"
"864","currency swaps. The Fund may also enter into interest rate and credit related"
"865","derivative transactions including interest rate and credit default swaps and"
"866","U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Fund may use any of these derivative"
"867","instruments for hedging purposes or for other investment purposes, including"
"868","to generate income, to increase liquidity and/or to gain exposure to certain"
"869","instruments or markets in a more efficient or less expensive way.  The use of"
"870","credit default swaps may allow the Fund to obtain net long or short exposure"
"871","to select credit risks. The Fund may also enter into currency-related"
"872","derivative transactions for hedging purposes, including currency"
"873","forwards and currency swaps."
"874","By way of example, when used for hedging purposes, a forward contract or"
"875","other currency-related derivative instrument could be used to protect"
"876","against possible declines in a currency's value where a security held or"
"877","to be purchased by the Fund is denominated in that currency, or it may be"
"878","used to hedge the Fund's position by entering into a transaction on another"
"879","currency expected to perform similarly to the currency of the security held"
"880","or to be purchased (a proxy hedge). The investment manager considers"
"881","various factors, such as availability and cost, in deciding whether, when"
"882","and to what extent to enter into derivative transactions."
"883","A currency forward contract is an obligation to purchase or sell a specific"
"884","foreign currency at an agreed exchange rate (price) at a future date, which"
"885","is typically individually negotiated and privately traded by currency"
"886","traders and their customers in the interbank market."
"887","A futures contract is a standard binding agreement between two parties to buy"
"888","or sell a specified quantity of an underlying instrument or asset, such as a"
"889","specific security or currency, at a specified price at a specified later date"
"890","that trade on an exchange. A sale of a futures contract means the"
"891","acquisition of a contractual obligation to deliver the underlying instrument"
"892","called for by the contract at a specified price on a specified date. A"
"893","purchase of a futures contract means the acquisition of a contractual"
"894","obligation to acquire the underlying instrument called for by the contract"
"895","at a specified price on a specified date. The purchase or sale of a futures"
"896","contract will allow the Fund to increase or decrease its exposure to the"
"897","underlying instrument or interest rate. Although most futures contracts by"
"898","their terms require the actual delivery or acquisition of the"
"899","underlying instrument, some require cash settlement."
"900","Swap agreements, such as currency, interest rate and credit default swaps,"
"901","are contracts between the Fund and, typically, a brokerage firm, bank, or"
"902","other financial institution (the swap counterparty) for periods ranging"
"903","from a few days to multiple years. In a basic swap transaction, the Fund"
"904","agrees with its counterparty to exchange the returns (or differentials in"
"905","rates of return) earned or realized on a particular notional amount of"
"906","underlying instruments or currencies. The notional amount is the set amount"
"907","selected by the parties as the basis on which to calculate the obligations"
"908","that they have agreed to exchange. The parties agree to exchange the returns"
"909","that would be earned or realized if the notional amount were invested in"
"910","given instruments or at given interest rates. For credit default swaps,"
"911","the buyer of the credit default swap agreement is obligated to pay the"
"912","seller a periodic stream of payments over the term of the agreement in"
"913","return for a payment by the seller that is contingent upon the occurrence"
"914","of a credit event with respect to an underlying reference debt obligation."
"915","Generally, a credit event means bankruptcy, failure to timely pay interest"
"916","or principal, obligation acceleration, or modified restructuring of the"
"917","reference debt obligation. The contingent payment by the seller generally"
"918","is the face amount of the debt obligation in exchange for the physical"
"919","delivery of the reference debt obligation or a cash payment equal to the"
"920","then current market value of that debt obligation. By way of example, the"
"921","investment manager might buy credit default swaps to help protect against"
"922","the risk of default by the issuer of one or more debt securities held by the"
"923","Fund. Alternatively, the investment manager may sell a credit default swap"
"924","to gain exposure to an asset class more efficiently or less expensively"
"925","than by purchasing the related debt security outright."
"926","An interest rate swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange"
"927","interest rate obligations,generally one based on an interest rate fixed to"
"928","maturity while the other is based on an interest rate that changes in"
"929","accordance with changes in a designated benchmark (for example, LIBOR, prime,"
"930","commercial paper, or other benchmarks). A currency swap is generally a"
"931","contract between two parties to exchange one currency for another currency at"
"932","the start of the contract and then exchange periodic floating or fixed rates"
"933","during the term of the contract based upon the relative value differential"
"934","between the two currencies.  Unlike other types of swaps, currency swaps"
"935","typically involve the delivery of the entire principal (notional) amounts"
"936","of the two currencies at the time the swap is entered into."
