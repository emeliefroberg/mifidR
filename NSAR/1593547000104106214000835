"987","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"988","Firm"
"989","To the Board of Trustees of Advisors Inner Circle"
"990","Fund III and the Shareholders of the Companies, as"
"991","defined:"
"992","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"993","financial statements of NorthPointe Small Cap Value"
"994","Fund and NorthPointe Large Cap Value Fund (two of"
"995","the funds constituting Advisors Inner Circle Fund"
"996","III, hereafter referred to as the Companies) as of"
"997","and for the period ended October 31, 2014, in"
"998","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"999","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1000","considered the Companies internal control over"
"1001","financial reporting, including controls over"
"1002","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"1003","our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1004","expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"1005","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1006","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1007","the effectiveness of the Companies internal control"
"1008","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not"
"1009","express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1010","Companies internal control over financial reporting."
"1011","The management of the Companies is responsible for"
"1012","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1013","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"1014","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1015","management are required to assess the expected"
"1016","benefits and related costs of controls.  A companys"
"1017","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1018","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1019","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1020","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"1021","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1022","accounting principles.  A companys internal control"
"1023","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1024","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1025","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1026","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"1027","the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1028","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1029","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1030","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"1031","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1032","expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"1033","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1034","trustees of the company; and (3)  provide reasonable"
"1035","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"1036","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"1037","companys assets that could have a material effect on"
"1038","the financial statements."
"1039","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1040","control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"1041","detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any"
"1042","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1043","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1044","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"1045","the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1046","procedures may deteriorate."
"1047","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1048","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1049","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1050","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1051","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1052","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1053","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1054","control over financial reporting, such that there is"
"1055","a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1056","misstatement of the Companies annual or interim"
"1057","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1058","detected on a timely basis."
"1059","Our consideration of the Companies internal control"
"1060","over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1061","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1062","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"1063","control over financial reporting that might be"
"1064","material weaknesses under standards established by"
"1065","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1066","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1067","in the Companies internal control over financial"
"1068","reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"1069","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be"
"1070","material weaknesses as defined above as of October"
"1071","31, 2014."
"1072","This report is intended solely for the information"
"1073","and use of management and the Board of Trustees of"
"1074","Advisors Inner Circle Fund III and the Securities"
"1075","and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be"

"1094","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"1095","financial statements of Rothschild Larch Lane"
"1096","Alternatives Fund (the Fund), as of October 31, 2014"
"1097","and for the period July 25, 2014 (commencement of"
"1098","operations) through October 31, 2014,  in"
"1099","accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public"
"1100","Company Accounting Oversight  Board (United States),"
"1101","we considered the Funds internal control over"
"1102","financial reporting, including controls over"
"1103","safeguarding securities, as a basis for  designing"
"1104","our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1105","expressing our opinion on  the  financial statements"
"1106","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1107","but  not  for  the  purpose of expressing an opinion"
"1108","on the effectiveness of the Funds internal  control"
"1109","over  financial reporting. Accordingly, we express"
"1110","no such opinion."
"1111","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"1112","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1113","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"1114","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1115","management are required to assess the expected"
"1116","benefits and related costs of controls. A companys"
"1117","internal control over financial  reporting  is  a"
"1118","process  designed  to  provide reasonable assurance"
"1119","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial"
"1120","reporting  and  the  preparation  of financial"
"1121","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1122","generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A"
"1123","companys internal control over financial reporting"
"1124","includes  those  policies  and procedures that (1)"
"1125","pertain to the maintenance of records   that,   in"
"1126","reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly"
"1127","reflect  the transactions  and dispositions of the"
"1128","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1129","assurance  that  transactions are recorded as"
"1130","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1131","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that"
"1132","receipts and expenditures of  the company are being"
"1133","made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1134","management and  directors  of  the  company;  and"
"1135","(3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1136","prevention  or  timely detection of unauthorized"
"1137","acquisition, use or disposition of  a  companys"
"1138","assets  that  could  have  a  material  effect  on"
"1139","the financial statements."
"1140","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1141","control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"1142","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"1143","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1144","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1145","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"1146","the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1147","procedures may deteriorate."
"1148","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1149","reporting exists when the design or  operation of a"
"1150","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1151","the normal course   of   performing   their"
"1152","assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"1153","misstatements  on  a  timely  basis.  A material"
"1154","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"1155","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1156","reporting, such that there is reasonable possibility"
"1157","that a material misstatement of the companys annual"
"1158","or interim financial statements will not be"
"1159","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1160","Our  consideration  of  the Funds internal control"
"1161","over financial reporting was for  the  limited"
"1162","purpose  described  in  the  first  paragraph  and"
"1163","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1164","internal control that might be material weaknesses"
"1165","under  standards  established  by  the  Public"
"1166","Company  Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1167","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds"
"1168","internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1169","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1170","securities that we consider to be a material"
"1171","weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2014."
"1172","This report is intended solely for the information"
"1173","and use of management and the Board of Trustees of"
"1174","the Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"1175","and is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"1176","anyone other than these specified parties."
