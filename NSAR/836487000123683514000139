"10273","Inc.) as of and for the period ended December 31, 2013, in"
"10274","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"10275","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"10276","their internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"10277","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"10278","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"10279","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"10280","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"10281","opinion on the effectiveness of the Portfolios' internal control"
"10282","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such"
"10283","opinion."
"10284","The management of the Portfolios is responsible for"
"10285","establishing and maintaining effective internal control over"
"10286","financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"10287","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"10288","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"10289","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"10290","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"10291","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"10292","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"10293","accounting principles. A company's internal control over"
"10294","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"10295","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"10296","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"10297","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"10298","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"10299","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"10300","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"10301","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"10302","with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"10303","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"10304","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"10305","or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material"
"10306","effect on the financial statements."
"10307","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"10308","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"10309","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"10310","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"10311","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"10312","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"10313","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"10314","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"10315","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
