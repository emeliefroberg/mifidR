"3766","brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the Fund and/or the other accounts over which the Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who"

"3796","such other services and activities do not, during the term of this Contract, interfere, in a material"
"3797","manner, with the Adviser's ability to meet all of its obligations with respect to rendering services"
"3798","to the Fund hereunder.  In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or"

"3800","not be subject to liability to the Fund or to any shareholder of the Fund for any act or omission in"

"3814","</P>"
"3815","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(d)	Either party hereto may, at any time on sixty (60) days' prior written notice"

"4023","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises hereinafter set forth, the"
"4024","Adviser and the Sub-Adviser agree as follows:"
"4025","</P>"
"4026","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	1.	(a)  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Adviser, direct the investments of all"
"4027","or such portion of the Fund's assets as the Adviser shall designate in accordance with the investment objective,"
"4028","policies and limitations as provided in the Fund's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as amended from"
"4029","time to time, the Investment Company Act of l940 and rules thereunder, as amended from time to time (the"
"4030","&acute;&acute;l940 Act&quot;), and such other limitations as the Fund may impose by notice in writing to the Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish for the use of the Fund office space and all necessary office facilities,"

"4038","may deem to be desirable.  The Sub-Adviser shall make recommendations to the Trust's Board of Trustees with"
"4039","respect to Fund policies, and shall carry out such policies as are adopted by the Trustees.  The Sub-Adviser shall,"
"4040","subject to review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other services as the Sub-Adviser shall from time to time"
"4041","determine to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under this Agreement and which are not otherwise"

"4043","</P>"
"4044","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(c)  The Sub-Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Fund's"

"4046","the Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at"
"4047","prices which are advantageous to the Fund and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may"
"4048","be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the"
"4049","Securities Exchange Act of l934) to the Fund and/or the other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser, Adviser or"
"4050","their affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Fund"
"4051","which is in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that"
"4052","transaction if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation"
"4053","to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be"
"4054","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Adviser and its"
"4055","affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Trust"
"4056","shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Fund to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Fund."

"4073","Trust."
