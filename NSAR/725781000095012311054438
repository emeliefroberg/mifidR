"2079","             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"2080","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM Sector Funds (Invesco Sector"
"2081","Funds):"
"2082","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Invesco"
"2083","Technology Sector Fund, Invesco Van Kampen Mid Cap Growth Fund, Invesco Van"
"2084","Kampen Small Cap Value Fund, Invesco Van Kampen Utility Fund and Invesco Van"
"2085","Kampen Value Opportunities Fund (formerly known as Morgan Stanley Technology"
"2086","Fund, Van Kampen Mid Cap Growth Fund, Van Kampen Small Cap Value Fund, Van"
"2087","Kampen Utility Fund, and Van Kampen Value Opportunities Fund; five of the funds"
"2088","constituting AIM Sector Funds (Invesco Sector Funds), hereafter referred to as"
"2089","the Funds) as of and for the period ended March 31, 2011, in accordance with"
"2090","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"2091","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including"
"2092","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"2093","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"2094","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2095","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"2096","financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"2097","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"2098","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"2099","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"2100","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"2101","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"2102","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2103","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"2104","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2105","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"2106","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"2107","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"2108","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"2109","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"2110","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2111","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"2112","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and"
"2113","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"2114","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"2115","a material effect on the financial statements."
"2116","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2117","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2118","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2119","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"2120","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2121","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"2122","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"2123","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2124","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2125","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"2126","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2127","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"2128","on a timely basis."
"2129","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"2130","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"2131","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"2132","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"2133","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (placecountry-regionUnited States)."
"2134","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2135","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities"
"2136","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of March 31,"
"2137","2011."

"2156","SETTLED  REGULATORY  ENFORCEMENT  ACTIONS  AND  INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO MARKET"
"2157","TIMING"
"2158","     On  October  8, 2004, Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco), successor by merger"
"2159","to  Invesco  Aim Advisors, Inc. and INVESCO Funds Group, Inc. (IFG), both former"
"2160","investment  advisers,  along  with  Invesco  Aim  Distributors,  n/k/a  Invesco"
"2161","Distributors, Inc. (Invesco Distributors) reached final settlements with certain"
"2162","regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York"
"2163","Attorney General and the Colorado Attorney General, to resolve civil enforcement"
"2164","actions  and/or  investigations related to market timing and related activity in"
"2165","the  AIM  Funds  (n/k/a  the Invesco Funds), including those formerly advised by"
"2166","IFG.  As  part  of  the  settlements,  a $325 million fair fund ($110 million of"
"2167","which  is  civil  penalties)  was  created  to compensate shareholders harmed by"
"2168","market  timing  and  related  activity  in  funds  formerly  advised  by  IFG."
"2169","Additionally,  Invesco  and Invesco Distributors created a $50 million fair fund"
"2170","($30  million  of which is civil penalties) to compensate shareholders harmed by"
"2171","market  timing  and related activity in funds advised by Invesco, which was done"
"2172","pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the settlement.  The methodology of the fair funds"
"2173","distributions  was  determined  by Invesco's independent distribution consultant"
"2174","(IDC  Plan),  in  consultation  with Invesco and the independent trustees of the"
"2175","Invesco  Funds,  and  approved  by  the  SEC  on  May  23,  2008."
"2176","     The  IDC  Plan  provides for distribution to all eligible investors for the"
"2177","periods  spanning  January 1, 2000 through July 31, 2003 (for the IFG Fair Fund)"
"2178","and  January  1,  2001 through September 30, 2003 (for the AIM Fair Fund), their"
"2179","proportionate share of the applicable Fair Fund to compensate such investors for"
"2180","injury  they  may  have  suffered  as  a result of market timing in the affected"
"2181","funds.  The  IDC  Plan includes a provision for any residual amounts in the Fair"
"2182","Funds  to  be  distributed in the future to the affected funds.  Further details"
"2183","regarding  the  IDC Plan and distributions thereunder are available on Invesco's"
"2184","Web  site,  available  at  http://www.invesco.com/us."
"2185","RESOLVED  REGULATORY  ACTION  ALLEGING  MARKET  TIMING"
"2186","     On  August  30,  2005,  the  West  Virginia  Office  of the State Auditor -"
"2187","Securities  Commission  (WVASC)  issued  a Summary Order to Cease and Desist and"
"2188","Notice  of  Right  to Hearing to Invesco and Invesco Distributors (collectively,"
"2189","Invesco)  (Order  No.  05-1318).  The  WVASC  made findings of fact that Invesco"
"2190","allegedly  entered  into  certain  arrangements  permitting market timing of the"
"2191","Invesco  Funds and failed to disclose these arrangements in the prospectuses for"
"2192","such  Funds, and conclusions of law to the effect that Invesco violated the West"
"2193","Virginia  securities  laws.  The  WVASC  ordered  Invesco  to  cease any further"
"2194","violations  and  sought  to  impose monetary sanctions, including restitution to"
"2195","affected  investors,  disgorgement  of  fees,  reimbursement  of  investigatory,"
"2196","administrative  and  legal  costs  and  an  administrative  assessment  to  be"
"2197","determined  by the Commissioner.  Invesco is not aware of any further efforts by"
"2198","WVASC  to  pursue  the  prosecution  of  this matter.  Invesco settled all other"
"2199","regulatory  investigations  related  to market timing, resulting in: 1) affected"
"2200","shareholders  receiving  restitution;  2)  Invesco paying disgorgement and civil"
"2201","penalties;  and  3)  Invesco  taking  remedial actions to prevent market timing."
"2202","Accordingly,  Invesco  considers  this  matter  resolved."
"2203","At  the  present time, management of Invesco and the Invesco Funds are unable to"
"2204","estimate  the  impact,  if  any,  that the outcome of the Pending Litigation and"
"2205","Regulatory  Inquiries described herein may have on Invesco, Invesco Distributors"
"2206","or  the  Invesco  Funds."
