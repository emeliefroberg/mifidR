"4428","Material Event and Results of the Shareholder Meeting (Unaudited)"
"4429","The Adviser entered into an agreement with Fiera Capital Corporation (Fiera Capital), under the terms of which Fiera Capital will acquire 100% of the equity of the Adviser (the Transaction). Under the 1940 Act, the Adviser's ownership change results in a technical assignment of the existing investment advisory agreement between the Adviser and the Trust, on behalf of the Fund, and, consequently, the automatic termination of the existing investment advisory agreement. In anticipation of the Transaction, at an in person special meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Trust (the Board) held on March 23, 2015, the Board approved a new investment advisory agreement between the Adviser and the Trust, on behalf of the Fund, on terms substantially identical to the existing investment advisory agreement with the Adviser.  Detailed information about the proposed new investment advisory agreement and the Adviser's ownership change in connection with the solicitation of their approval of the new investment advisory agreement was mailed to Fund shareholders on or about April 22, 2015."
"4430","A special meeting of the shareholders of the Fund was held on May 27, 2015 (the special meeting). The sole proposal at the special meeting was to approve an Investment Advisory Agreement between the Adviser and the Trust, on behalf of the Fund (the proposal). As of the March 31, 2015 record date for the special meeting, there were 4,740,771.379 shares of the Fund outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. The quorum required to conduct business at the special meeting was one-third of the outstanding shares of the Fund as of the March 31, 2015 record date. The shares present at the May 27, 2015 special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum existed were 2,516,050 present by proxy, representing 53.07% of the total outstanding shares of the Fund. Of the 2,516,050 shares present at the special meeting by proxy, 2,516,050 shares, or 100%, voted in favor (representing 53.07% of total outstanding shares), 0 shares, or 0%, voted against (representing 0% of total outstanding shares), and 0 shares, or 0%, abstained from voting (representing 0% of total outstanding shares). The vote required for approval of the proposal was the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund. Under the 1940 Act, a majority of the outstanding voting securities means the affirmative vote of the lesser of (i) 67% of the shares present at the meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are present in person or by proxy; or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund. As such, the proposal was determined to have passed."
"4431","As of August 31, 2015, the proposed change in control of the Adviser was delayed pending regulatory approval."

"4449","Board of Trustees of the Trust for Professional Managers"
"4450","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Morgan Dempsey Small/Micro Cap Value Fund (the Fund) a series of the Trust for Professional Managers as of and for the year ended August 31, 2015, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"4451","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and Trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"4452","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"4453","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"4454","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of August 31, 2015."
