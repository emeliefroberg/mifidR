"958","Litigation Update"
"959","Federal Court Market Timing Litigation:"
"960","A number of private lawsuits have been filed including purported"
"961","class and derivative lawsuits, making various allegations and"
"962","naming as defendants various persons, including certain Scudder"
"963","and Deutsche (now DWS) funds (singularly, a Fund and"
"964","collectively, the Funds), the Funds' investment advisors and"
"965","their affiliates, certain individuals (including in some cases Fund"
"966","Trustees/Directors, officers), and other parties.  Each Fund's"
"967","investment advisor has agreed to indemnify the applicable Funds"
"968","in connection with these lawsuits, or other lawsuits or regulatory"
"969","actions that may be filed making allegations similar to these"
"970","lawsuits regarding market timing, revenue sharing, fund valuation"
"971","or other subjects related to investigations of the foregoing matters."
"972","Based on currently available information, the Funds' investment"
"973","advisors believe the likelihood that the pending lawsuits will have"
"974","a material adverse financial impact on a Fund is remote and such"
"975","actions are not likely to materially affect their ability to perform"
"976","under their investment management agreements with the Funds."
"977","Fifteen class and derivative actions pertaining to market timing"
"978","have been consolidated and transferred to a Multidistrict Litigation"
"979","Panel in the District of Maryland (MDL) (Multidistrict Litigation"
"980","1586-In re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation).  The 11"
"981","Complaints originally filed in the Southern District of New York"
"982","that were transferred to the MDL were virtually identical and each"
"983","asserted claims against Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Investment"
"984","Management Americas Inc. (DIMA) and Deutsche Asset"
"985","Management, Inc. as well as approximately 85 Funds in the"
"986","Scudder and Deutsche family of funds and John Doe defendants."
"987","The three cases that were originally filed in the Eastern District of"
"988","New York and the one case originally filed in the District of"
"989","Delaware are derivative actions brought by purported shareholders"
"990","in certain of the Funds.  These actions are against Deutsche"
"991","Investment Management Americas Inc., Deutsche Asset"
"992","Management, Inc., and John Doe defendants."
"993","On September 29, 2004, two consolidated amended complaints,"
"994","one a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint and the"
"995","other a Consolidated Amended Fund Derivative Complaint, were"
"996","filed in the MDL."
"997","On January 11, 2006, Plaintiffs filed a Second Consolidated"
"998","Amended Class Action Complaint in the MDL.  The officer"
"999","defendants have been voluntarily dismissed from the class action"
"1000","pursuant to a tolling agreement with Plaintiffs.  Deutsche Bank AG"
"1001","has been dismissed from the derivative action.  On March 16,"
"1002","2007, the Court issued an opinion in the MDL granting in part and"
"1003","denying in part the Deutsche Defendants' motion to dismiss the"
"1004","Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint."
"1005","Plaintiffs filed a Third Consolidated Amended Class Action"
"1006","Complaint (Third Amended Complaint) on December 10, 2007"
"1007","in the MDL.  In the Third Amended Complaint, the Plaintiffs"
"1008","added the names of Funds that they allegedly purchased or held"
"1009","during the class period.  In addition, as contemplated in the Court's"
"1010","scheduling order, the Third Amended Complaint added a new"
"1011","Plaintiff in an attempt to address standing challenges raised by the"
"1012","Defendants.  On January 16, 2008, the Court granted in part and"
"1013","denied in part the Defendants' motion to dismiss certain claims on"
"1014","standing grounds.  The parties conducted extensive discovery.  The"
"1015","Defendants have filed a motion for summary judgment and various"
"1016","related motions, and Class Plaintiffs contemporaneously filed a"
"1017","motion for class certification. The Court heard oral argument on"
"1018","these motions on December 10-11, 2008."
"1019","On February 12, 2010, the parties agreed to a stipulation and"
"1020","agreement of settlement, which is subject to approval by the Court."
"1021","Plaintiffs' motions for preliminary approval of the settlement by"
"1022","the Court are scheduled to be filed by March 31, 2010, and the"
"1023","Court has scheduled a hearing on April 16, 2010 for those motions."
"1024","The Court has set the hearing for final settlement approval for"
"1025","October 1, 2010."
"1026","State Court Market Timing Litigation:"
"1027","On September 16, 2003, an action was commenced in the Circuit"
"1028","Court for Madison County, Illinois, entitled Potter v. Janus"
"1029","Investment Fund, et al.  Defendants include, among others, DIMA"
"1030","and the Scudder International Fund. On October 23, 2003,"
"1031","Defendants removed the action to the United States District Court"
"1032","for the Southern District of Illinois. On February 9, 2004 the"
"1033","District Court remanded the case back to the Circuit Court for"
"1034","Madison County.  Defendants appealed this decision.  On April 5,"
"1035","2005 the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District"
"1036","Court's decision and instructed the District Court to undo the"
"1037","remand order and dismiss the complaint.  On May 27, 2005, the"
"1038","District Court, in accord with the Seventh Circuit's mandate,"
"1039","dismissed the action with prejudice.  On September 29, 2005,"
"1040","Plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme"
"1041","Court of the United States.  On January 6, 2006, the Supreme"
"1042","Court granted the petition to address jurisdictional questions.  On"
"1043","June 15, 2006, the Supreme Court vacated the decision of the"
"1044","Seventh Circuit and held that the Court of Appeals did not have"
"1045","jurisdiction to address the District Court's remand order.  The case"
"1046","was remanded to and reopened in the Circuit Court for Madison"
"1047","County.  On November 13, 2006, Defendants removed the case to"
"1048","Federal District Court for a second time.  On April 6, 2007, the"
"1049","District Court remanded the case back to the Circuit Court for"
"1050","Madison County.  Defendants appealed this decision to the"
"1051","Seventh Circuit, which dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction"
"1052","on July 13, 2007.  The case is now back in the Circuit Court for"
"1053","Madison County.  Argument on Defendants' motion to dismiss"
"1054","occurred in August 2007, and the parties are awaiting the Circuit"
"1055","Court's decision.  The Circuit Court issued an Order dated July 16,"
"1056","2008 stating that the issues raised by the motion to dismiss are"
"1057","nearly identical to those in a pending appeal in an action involving"
"1058","the Putnam funds, and that the Court would therefore wait for the"
"1059","decision of the Illinois Appellate Court in that case before ruling"
"1060","on the motion to dismiss."
"1061","On January 6, 2010, the Illinois Appellate Court ruled in favor of"
"1062","the Putnam fund defendants and against the plaintiffs in that"
"1063","action, holding that the plaintiffs' claims are precluded by the"
"1064","Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act.  The plaintiffs filed a"
"1065","motion for rehearing in the Illinois Appellate Court, which was"
"1066","denied on February 16, 2010.  The plaintiffs may file a petition for"
"1067","leave to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.  The Circuit Court in"
"1068","the Potter case has scheduled a hearing for March 5, 2010 to"
"1069","determine whether to act on the pending motions or await further"
"1070","proceedings in the Putnam case."
"1071","Federal Court Revenue Sharing Litigation:"
"1072","The following purported class actions pertaining to revenue"
"1073","sharing were filed in the Southern District of New York: Walker v."
"1074","Deutsche Bank AG, et al., Mazza v. Deutsche Bank AG, et al. and"
"1075","Icardo v. Deutsche Bank AG, et al.  These three class actions were"
"1076","consolidated. The consolidated Complaint filed on December 19,"
"1077","2005 named as defendants Deutsche Bank AG, certain affiliated"
"1078","adviser entities, and Scudder Distributors Inc.  On August 15,"
"1079","2007, the Court granted the Defendants' motion to dismiss with"
"1080","prejudice and denied Plaintiffs' request for leave to amend the"
"1081","complaint.  The Plaintiffs did not appeal, and the deadline for"
"1082","appealing this decision has now passed."

"1102","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1103","statements of DWS RREEF Global Infrastructure Fund"
"1104","(the Fund), as of and for the year ended December 31,"
"1105","2009 in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1106","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"1107","we considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1108","reporting, including control activities for safeguarding"
"1109","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1110","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1111","the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1112","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1113","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"1114","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"1115","do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1116","Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"1117","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"1118","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1119","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1120","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"1121","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1122","controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"1123","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1124","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1125","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1126","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1127","principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"1128","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1129","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1130","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1131","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1132","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1133","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"1134","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1135","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"1136","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1137","management and trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide"
"1138","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1139","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1140","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1141","financial statements."
"1142","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1143","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1144","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1145","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1146","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1147","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1148","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1149","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1150","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1151","allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"1152","of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1153","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"1154","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1155","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1156","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1157","misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial"
"1158","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"1159","basis."
"1160","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"1161","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"1162","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1163","all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting"
"1164","that might be significant deficiencies or material"
"1165","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"1166","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1167","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal"
"1168","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1169","including controls for safeguarding securities, that we"
"1170","consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as"
"1171","of December 31, 2009."

"1173","of the Directors, management, and the Securities and"
"1174","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
