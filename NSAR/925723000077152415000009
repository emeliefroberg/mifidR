"556","Intermediate Total"
"557","Return Bond Fund"
"558","(formerly Federated"

"560","Government/Corporate"
"561","Fund), (the ?Fund?), a"
"562","portfolio of Federated"
"563","Institutional Trust, as"
"564","of and for the year"
"565","ended August 31,"
"566","2015, in accordance"
"567","with the standards of"
"568","the Public Company"
"569","Accounting Oversight"
"570","Board (United States),"
"571","we considered the"
"572","Fund?s internal control"
"573","over financial"
"574","reporting, including"
"575","controls over"
"576","safeguarding"
"577","securities, as a basis"
"578","for designing our"
"579","auditing procedures for"
"580","the purpose of"
"581","expressing our opinion"
"582","on the financial"
"583","statements and to"
"584","comply with the"
"585","requirements of Form"
"586","N-SAR, but not for the"
"587","purpose of expressing"
"588","an opinion on the"
"589","effectiveness of the"
"590","Fund?s internal control"
"591","over financial"
"592","reporting. Accordingly,"
"593","we express no such"
"594","opinion."
"595","Management of the"
"596","Fund is responsible for"
"597","establishing and"
"598","maintaining effective"
"599","internal control over"
"600","financial reporting. In"
"601","fulfilling this"
"602","responsibility,"
"603","estimates and"
"604","judgments by"
"605","management are"
"606","required to assess the"
"607","expected benefits and"
"608","related costs of"
"609","controls. A company?s"
"610","internal control over"
"611","financial reporting is a"
"612","process designed to"
"613","provide reasonable"
"614","assurance regarding"
"615","the reliability of"
"616","financial reporting and"
"617","the preparation of"
"618","financial statements for"
"619","external purposes in"
"620","accordance with"
"621","generally accepted"
"622","accounting principles."
"623","A company?s internal"
"624","control over financial"
"625","reporting includes"
"626","those policies and"
"627","procedures that (1)"
"628","pertain to the"
"629","maintenance of records"
"630","that, in reasonable"
"631","detail, accurately and"
"632","fairly reflect the"
"633","transactions and"
"634","dispositions of the"
"635","assets of the company;"
"636","(2) provide reasonable"
"637","assurance that"
"638","transactions are"
"639","recorded as necessary"
"640","to permit preparation"
"641","of financial statements"
"642","in accordance with"
"643","generally accepted"
"644","accounting principles,"
"645","and that receipts and"
"646","expenditures of the"
"647","company are being"
"648","made in accordance"
"649","with authorizations of"
"650","management and"
"651","directors of the"
"652","company; and (3)"
"653","provide reasonable"
"654","assurance regarding"
"655","prevention or timely"
"656","detection of the"
"657","unauthorized"
"658","acquisition, use, or"
"659","disposition of the"
"660","company?s assets that"
"661","could have a material"
"662","effect on the financial"
"663","statements."
"664","Because of its inherent"
"665","limitations, internal"
"666","control over financial"
"667","reporting may not"
"668","prevent or detect"
"669","misstatements. Also,"
"670","projections of any"
"671","evaluation of"
"672","effectiveness to future"
"673","periods are subject to"
"674","the risk that controls"
"675","may become"
"676","inadequate because of"
"677","changes in conditions,"
"678","or that the degree of"
"679","compliance with the"
"680","policies or procedures"
"681","may deteriorate."
"682","A deficiency in"
"683","internal control over"
"684","financial reporting"
"685","exists when the design"
"686","or operation of a"
"687","control does not allow"
"688","management or"
"689","employees, in the"
"690","normal course of"
"691","performing their"
"692","assigned functions, to"
"693","prevent or detect"
"694","misstatements on a"
"695","timely basis. A"
"696","material weakness is a"
"697","deficiency, or a"
"698","combination of"
"699","deficiencies, in internal"
"700","control over financial"
"701","reporting, such that"
"702","there is a reasonable"
"703","possibility that a"
"704","material misstatement"
"705","of the Funds? annual or"
"706","interim financial"
"707","statements will not be"
"708","prevented or detected"
"709","on a timely basis."
"710","Our consideration of"
"711","the Fund?s internal"
"712","control over financial"
"713","reporting was for the"
"714","limited purpose"
"715","described in the first"
"716","paragraph and would"
"717","not necessarily"
"718","disclose all"
"719","deficiencies in internal"
"720","control that might be"
"721","material weaknesses"
"722","under standards"
"723","established by the"
"724","Public Company"
"725","Accounting Oversight"
"726","Board (United States)."
"727","However, we noted no"
"728","deficiencies in the"
"729","Fund?s internal control"
"730","over financial"
"731","reporting and its"
"732","operation, including"
"733","controls over"
"734","safeguarding securities"
"735","that we consider to be"
"736","a material weakness as"
"737","defined above as of"
"738","August 31, 2015."
"739","This report is intended"
"740","solely for the"
"741","information and use of"
