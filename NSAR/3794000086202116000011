"3114","			Exhibit 77Q1"
"3115","Effective September 1, 2016, the Portfolio has adopted a change"
"3116","to its investment strategy to include investments in equity"
"3117","securities of companies that the Adviser believes have the ability"
"3118","to pass along increasing costs to consumers and maintain or grow"
"3119","margins in rising inflation environments."
"3120","Following the change, under normal circumstances, the Fund expects"
"3121","to invest its assets principally in the following instruments that, in the"
"3122","judgment of the Adviser, are affected directly or indirectly by the level"
"3123","and change in rate of inflation: inflation-indexed fixed-income"
"3124","securities, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities TIPS and"
"3125","similar bonds issued by governments outside of the United States;"
"3126","commodities; commodity-related equity securities; real estate equity"
"3127","securities; inflation sensitive equity securities, which the Fund defines"
"3128","as equity securities of companies that the Adviser believes have the"
"3129","ability to pass along increasing costs to consumers and maintain or"
"3130","grow margins in rising inflation environments, including equity"
"3131","securities of utilities and infrastructure-related companies inflation"
"3132","sensitive equities; securities and derivatives linked to the price of other"
