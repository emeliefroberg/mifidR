"1085","investment adviser to each Series.  The Adviser accepts the"
"1086","appointment and agrees to furnish the services for the"
"1087","compensation set forth below."

"1090","of Trustees of the Fund, the Adviser will (a) act in strict"
"1091","conformity with the Fund's Trust Instrument, the Investment"
"1092","Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the 1940 Act) and the"
"1093","Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as the same may from time to time"
"1094","be amended, (b) manage each Series' assets in accordance with such"
"1095","Series' investment objective and policies as stated in the Series'"
"1096","Prospectus and SAI, (c) make investment decisions for each Series,"

"1098","Series, (e) exercise voting rights in respect of portfolio securities"
"1099","and other investments for each Series, and (f) monitor and evaluate"
"1100","the services provided by each Series' investment sub-adviser(s), if"
"1101","any, under the terms of the applicable investment sub-advisory"
"1102","agreement.  In providing those services, the Adviser will provide"
"1103","investment research and supervision of each Series' investments and"

"1105","appropriate, sale and reinvestment of such Series' assets.  In"
"1106","addition, the Adviser will furnish each Series with whatever"
"1107","statistical information the Fund may reasonably request with"
"1108","respect to the securities that such Series may hold or contemplate"
"1109","purchasing."
"1110","            Subject to the approval of the Board of Trustees of the"
"1111","Fund and, where required, the Series' shareholders, the Adviser"
"1112","may engage an investment sub-adviser or sub-advisers to provide"
"1113","advisory services in respect of a Series and may delegate to such"
"1114","investment sub-adviser(s) the responsibilities described in"
"1115","subparagraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) above.  In the event that an"
"1116","investment sub-adviser's engagement has been terminated, the"
"1117","Adviser shall be responsible for furnishing each Series with the"
"1118","services required to be performed by such investment"
"1119","sub-adviser(s) under the applicable investment sub-advisory"
"1120","agreement(s) or arranging for a successor investment"

"1125","            In executing transactions for each Series, selecting"
"1126","brokers or dealers and negotiating any brokerage commission"
"1127","rates, the Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best"
"1128","overall terms available.  In assessing the best overall terms"
"1129","available for any portfolio transaction, the Adviser will"
"1130","consider all factors it deems relevant including, but not"
"1131","limited to, breadth of the market in the security, the price of"
"1132","the security, the financial condition and execution capability"
"1133","of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of any"
"1134","commission for the specific transaction and for transactions"
"1135","executed through the broker or dealer in the aggregate.  In"
"1136","selecting brokers or dealers to execute a particular"
"1137","transaction and in evaluating the best overall terms available,"
"1138","the Adviser may consider the brokerage and research services"
"1139","(as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"1140","Exchange Act of 1934, as the same may from time to time be"
"1141","amended) provided to each Series and/or other accounts over"
"1142","which the Adviser or an affiliate exercises investment"
"1143","discretion."
"1144","4.	Information Provided to the Fund"
"1145","            The Adviser will keep each Series informed of"
"1146","developments materially affecting such Series, and will, on"
"1147","its own initiative, furnish such Series from time to time"
"1148","with whatever information the Adviser believes is appropriate"
"1149","for this purpose."
"1150","5.	Standard of Care"
"1151","            The Adviser shall exercise its best judgment in"
"1152","rendering the services listed in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 above."
"1153","The Adviser shall not be liable for any error of judgment or"
"1154","mistake of law or for any loss suffered by a Series in"
"1155","connection with the matters to which this Agreement relates,"
"1156","provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to protect or"
"1157","purport to protect the Adviser against any liability to each"
"1158","Series or to shareholders of such Series to which the Adviser"
"1159","would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance,"
"1160","bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the performance"
"1161","of its duties or by reason of the Adviser's reckless"
"1162","disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"1163","6.	Compensation"
"1164","            In consideration of the services rendered pursuant"
"1165","to this Agreement, each Series will pay the Adviser an annual"
"1166","fee applicable to such Series calculated at an annual rate set"
"1167","forth on Annex I hereto of such Series' average daily net assets."
"1168","The fee for the period from the date of this Agreement to the"
"1169","end of the calendar year shall be prorated according to the"
"1170","proportion that such period bears to the full yearly period."
"1171","Upon any termination of this Agreement before the end of a year,"
"1172","the fee for such part of that year shall be prorated according"
"1173","to the proportion that such period bears to the full yearly"
"1174","period and shall be payable upon the date of termination"
"1175","of this Agreement.  For the purpose of determining fees payable"
"1176","to the Adviser, the value of each Series' net assets shall be"
"1177","computed at the times and in the manner specified in such"
"1178","Series' Prospectus or SAI."
"1179","7.	Expenses"
"1180","            The Adviser will bear all expenses in connection"
"1181","with the performance of its services under this Agreement,"
"1182","including the fees payable to any investment sub-adviser"
"1183","engaged pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Agreement.  Each"
"1184","Series will bear its proportionate share of certain other"
"1185","expenses to be incurred in its operation, including:"
"1186","investment advisory and administration fees; taxes, interest,"
"1187","brokerage fees and commissions, if any; fees of Trustees of"
"1188","the Fund who are not officers, directors, or employees of the"

"1202","such Series and of the officers or Board of Trustees of the"
"1203","Fund; and any extraordinary expenses."
"1204","            Each Series will be responsible for nonrecurring"
"1205","expenses which may arise, including costs of litigation to"
"1206","which the Fund is a party and of indemnifying officers and"
"1207","Trustees of such Series with respect to such litigation and"
"1208","other expenses as determined by the Trustees."
"1209","8.	Services to Other Companies or Accounts"
"1210","            The Fund understands that the Adviser now acts,"
"1211","will continue to act and may act in the future as investment"
"1212","adviser to fiduciary and other managed accounts and to one or"
"1213","more other investment companies or series of investment"
"1214","companies, and the Fund has no objection to the Adviser so"
"1215","acting, provided that whenever a Series and one or more other"
"1216","accounts or investment companies or portfolios advised by the"
"1217","Adviser have available funds for investment, investments"
"1218","suitable and appropriate for each will be allocated in"
"1219","accordance with a formula believed to be equitable to each"
"1220","entity.  The Fund recognizes that in some cases this"
"1221","procedure may adversely affect the size of the position"
"1222","obtainable for the Series.  In addition, the Fund"
"1223","understands that the persons employed by the Adviser to"
"1224","assist in the performance of the Adviser's duties hereunder"
"1225","will not devote their full time to such service and nothing"
"1226","contained herein shall be deemed to limit or restrict the"
"1227","right of the Adviser or any affiliate of the Adviser to"
"1228","engage in and devote time and attention to other"
"1229","businesses or to render services of whatever kind or"
"1230","nature, provided that doing so does not adversely affect"
"1231","the ability of the Adviser to perform its services under"
"1232","this Agreement."
"1233","9.	Term of Agreement"
"1234","            This Agreement shall continue with respect to"
"1235","each Series for an initial two-year period from the"
"1236","commencement date for the Series, specified in Annex I,"

"1240","the Fund or (b) a vote of a majority (as defined in the"
"1241","1940 Act) of the Series' outstanding voting securities,"
"1242","provided that in either event the continuance is also"
"1243","approved by a majority of the Board of Trustees who are"
"1244","not interested persons (as defined in said Act) of any"
"1245","party to this Agreement, by vote cast in person at a"
"1246","meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval."
"1247","This Agreement is terminable, without penalty, with respect"
"1248","to a Series, on 60 days' written notice, by the Board of"
"1249","Trustees of the Fund or by vote of holders of a majority"
"1250","of the Series shares, or upon 90 days' written notice, by"
"1251","the Adviser.  This Agreement will also terminate"
"1252","automatically in the event of its assignment"
"1253","(as defined in said Act)."
"1254","10.	Representation by the Fund"

"1265","thereof) as part of their names, and that the Adviser or its"
"1266","affiliates may enter into advisory or other agreements with"

"1324","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1325","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders"
"1326","of Credit Suisse Commodity Access Strategy Fund:"
"1327","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"1328","of Credit Suisse Commodity Access strategy Fund (the Fund) as"
"1329","of and for the year ended October 31, 2013, in accordance with"
"1330","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1331","(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"1332","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1333","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"1334","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1335","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1336","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1337","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1338","reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"1339","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1340","reporting."
"1341","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"1342","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1343","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1344","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"1345","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal"
"1346","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1347","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1348","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"1349","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1350","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"1351","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1352","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1353","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1354","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"1355","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1356","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"1357","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"1358","and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance"
"1359","with authorizations of management and directors of the fund;"
"1360","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"1361","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1362","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1363","financial statements."
"1364","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1365","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1366","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1367","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1368","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"1369","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1370","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1371","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1372","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1373","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"1374","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1375","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1376","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1377","material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial"
"1378","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1379","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1380","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1381","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"1382","in internal control over financial reporting that might be"
"1383","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"1384","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However,"
"1385","we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over"
"1386","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"

"1388","weaknesses as defined above as of October 31, 2013."
