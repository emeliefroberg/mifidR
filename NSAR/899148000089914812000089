"1421","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1422","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"1423","Rydex Series Funds"
"1424","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Rydex"
"1425","Series Funds (the Trust) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011, in"
"1426","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1427","Board (United States), we considered the Trusts internal control over financial"
"1428"," reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1429","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinions on"
"1430"," the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1431","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1432"," Trusts internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"1433","such opinion."
"1434","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1435"," effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1436","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1437","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A companys internal"
"1438","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1439","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1440","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1441","accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial"
"1442","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1443","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1444","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"1445","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1446","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1447","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1448","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1449","and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1450"," prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1451"," of a companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1452","statements."
"1453","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1454","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1455","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1456","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1457","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1458","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1459","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1460","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1461","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1462","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1463"," that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1464","companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1465","detected on a timely basis."
"1466","Our consideration of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting was"
"1467"," for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1468","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"1469","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1470","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1471","in the Trusts internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1472","including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"1473","material weakness as defined above as of December 31, 2011."
"1474","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"1475","the Board of Trustees of Rydex Series Funds and the Securities and Exchange"
"1476","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"1477","than these specified parties."

"1527","On September 20, 2011, Guggenheim Capital, LLC agreed to purchase the indirect"
"1528","holding company of Security Investors, LLC, the Funds investment manager"
"1529","(the Investment Manager) (the Transaction). Guggenheim Capital, LLCs"
"1530","subsidiary, Guggenheim Partners, LLC (Guggenheim), is a global, independent,"
"1531","privately-held, diversified financial services firm with more than 1,500"
"1532","dedicated professionals."
"1533","The Transaction should not result in material changes to the day-to-day"

"1537","circumstances."
"1538","In anticipation of the Transaction, the Board of Trustees of the Funds"
"1539","(the Board) called a special meeting of shareholders (the Meeting), at"
"1540","which shareholders of the Funds of record as of October 3, 2011 were asked to"
"1541","consider the approval of a new investment management agreement between the"
"1542","Funds and the Investment Manager (the New Agreement). This approval was"
"1543","necessary because, under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act),"
"1544","the Transaction could result in the termination of the Funds current"

"1560","Rydex Series Funds has been named as a defendant and a putative"
"1561","member of the proposed defendant class of shareholders in the"
"1562","case entitled Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Tribune"
"1563","Co. v. FitzSimons(In re Tribune Co.), Adv. Pro. No. 10-54010"
"1564","(Bankr. D. Del.), as a resultof ownership of shares in the"
"1565","Tribune Company (Tribune) in 2007 by"
"1566","certain series of the Rydex Series Funds when Tribune effected a"
"1567","leveraged buyout transaction (LBO) by which Tribune converted to a"
"1568","privately-held company.  In its complaint, the Unsecured Creditors"
"1569","Committee (the UCC) has alleged that, in connection with the LBO,"
"1570","insiders and major shareholders were overpaid for their Tribune stock"
"1571","using financing that the insiders knew would, and ultimately did, leave"
"1572","the Tribune insolvent. The UCC has asserted claims against certain"
"1573","insiders, major shareholders, professional advisers, and others involved"
"1574","in the LBO, and is attempting to obtain from these individuals and"
"1575","entities the proceeds paid out in connection with the LBO. This"
"1576","adversary proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court has been stayed pending"
"1577","further order of the Bankruptcy Court."
"1578","In June 2011, a group of Tribune creditors, not including the UCC, filed"
"1579","multiple actions involving state law constructive fraudulent conveyance"
"1580","claims against former Tribune shareholders. Rydex Series Funds also has"
"1581","been named as a defendant in one or more of these suits. These cases"
"1582","have been consolidated in a multidistrict litigation proceeding in the"
"1583","United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and"
"1584","have been stayed pending further order of that court or of the Bankruptcy"
"1585","Court."
"1586","None of these lawsuits allege any wrongdoing on the part of Rydex Series"
"1587","Funds. The following series of Rydex Series Funds held shares of Tribune"
"1588","and tendered these shares as part of Tribunes LBO Nova Fund, S&P 500"
"1589","Pure Value Fund, Multi-Cap Core Equity Fund, S&P 500 Fund, Multi-Hedge"
"1590","Strategies Fund and Hedged Equity Fund (the Funds). The value of the"

"1592","$3,400, $1,181,160, and $10,880, respectively. At this stage of the"
