"377","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"378","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"379","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal"

"382","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"383","of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"384","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"385","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"386","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"387","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
