"511","<TEXT>"
"512","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"513","To the Shareholders of EM Capital India Gateway Fund"
"514","and the Board of Trustees of Northern Lights Fund Trust"
"515","In planning and performing our audit of the consolidated"
"516","financial statements of EM Capital India Gateway Fund"
"517","(the Fund), a series of shares of beneficial interest of the"
"518","Northern Lights Fund Trust, as of and for the year ended"
"519","December 31, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the"
"520","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)"
"521","(PCAOB), we considered its internal control over financial"
"522","reporting, including control activities for safeguarding"
"523","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"524","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"525","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"526","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"527","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"528","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"529","The management of Northern Lights Fund Trust is responsible"
"530","for establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"531","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"532","estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"533","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A funds"
"534","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed"
"535","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"536","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"537","for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles"
"538","generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP)."
"539","A funds internal control over financial reporting includes"
"540","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"541","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"542","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of a fund;"
"543","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"544","necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in"
"545","accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of a fund"
"546","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"547","and trustees of a fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"548","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"549","disposition of a funds assets that could have a material effect on"
"550","the financial statements."
"551","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"552","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"553","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"554","are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"555","of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the"
"556","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"557","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"558","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"559","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"560","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness"
"561","is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"562","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"563","material misstatement of the Funds annual or interim financial statements"
"564","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"565","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial reporting"
"566","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"567","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"568","material weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB.  However,"
"569","we noted no deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting"
"570","and its operations, including controls for safeguarding securities that"
"571","we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above, as of December"
"572","31, 2010."
"573","This report is intended solely for the information and use of the shareholders"
"574","of EM Capital India Gateway Fund, management and the Board of Trustees of"
"575","Northern Lights Fund Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"576","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"577","parties."
