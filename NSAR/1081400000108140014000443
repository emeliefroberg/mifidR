"907","<TEXT>"
"908","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"909","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Wells Fargo Funds Trust:"
"910","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"911","of the Wells Fargo Advantage Alternative Strategies Fund, Wells Fargo"
"912","Advantage Capital Growth Fund, Wells Fargo Advantage Disciplined"
"913","U.S. Core Fund, Wells Fargo Advantage Endeavor Select Fund, Wells"
"914","Fargo Advantage Growth Fund, Wells Fargo Advantage Intrinsic Value"
"915","Fund, Wells Fargo Advantage Large Cap Core Fund, Wells Fargo Advantage"
"916","Large Cap Growth Fund, Wells Fargo Advantage Large Company Value Fund,"
"917","Wells Fargo Advantage Omega Growth Fund, and Wells Fargo Advantage"
"918","Premier Large Company Growth Fund,  (collectively the Funds), eleven"
"919","of the funds comprising the Wells Fargo Funds Trust, as of and for the"
"920","year ended July 31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the"
"921","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"922","the Funds internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"923","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"924","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"925","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"926","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"927","Funds internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"928","express no such opinion."
"929","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"930","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"931","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"932","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"933","costs of controls.  A Funds internal control over financial reporting"
"934","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"935","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"936","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"937","accounting principles.  A Funds internal control over financial reporting"
"938","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"939","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"940","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"941","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"942","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"943","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"944","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"945","directors of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"946","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"947","disposition of the funds assets that could have a material effect on the"
"948","financial statements."
"949","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"950","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"951","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"952","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"953","or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may"
"954","deteriorate."
"955","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"956","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"957","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"958","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"959","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"960","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"961","a material misstatement of the Funds annual or interim financial"
"962","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"963","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial reporting"
"964","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"965","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might"
"966","be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"967","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"968","deficiencies in the Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"969","operations, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider"
"970","to be a material weakness as defined above as of July 31, 2014."
"971","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"972","and the Board of Trustees of Wells Fargo Funds Trust and the Securities"
"973","and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used"
"974","by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1496","2003, and amended as of October 1, 2005 and March 27, 2009, between Wells Fargo"
"1497","Funds Trust (the Trust), a statutory trust organized under the laws of the"

"1510","(each a Fund and collectively the Funds), and the Adviser is willing to"
"1511","provide those services on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;"
"1512","     NOW THEREFORE, the Trust and the Adviser agree as follows:"
"1513","     SECTION 1. APPOINTMENT OF THE ADVISER. The Trust is engaged in the business"
"1514","of investing and reinvesting its assets in securities of the type and in"
"1515","accordance with the limitations specified in its Declaration of Trust, as"
"1516","amended and supplemented from time to time, By-Laws (if any) and Registration"

"1523","The Board is authorized to issue any unissued shares in any number of additional"
"1524","classes or series."
"1525","     The investment authority granted to the Adviser shall include the authority"
"1526","to exercise whatever powers the Trust may possess with respect to any of its"
"1527","assets held by the Funds, including, but not limited to, the power to exercise"
"1528","rights, options, warrants, conversion privileges, redemption privileges, and to"
"1529","tender securities pursuant to a tender offer, and participate in class actions"
"1530","and other legal proceedings on behalf of the Funds."
"1531","     The Trust hereby employs Adviser, subject to the direction and control of"
"1532","the Board, to manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets in the Funds"
"1533","and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to provide the other"
"1534","services specified in Section 2 hereof."
"1535","<PAGE>"
"1536","     SECTION 2. DUTIES OF THE ADVISER."
"1537","     (a) The Adviser shall make decisions with respect to all purchases and"
"1538","sales of securities and other investment assets for the Funds. Among other"
"1539","things, the Adviser shall make all decisions with respect to the allocation of"
"1540","the Funds' investments in various securities or other assets, in investment"
"1541","styles and, if applicable, in other investment companies or pooled vehicles in"
"1542","which a Fund may invest. To carry out such decisions, the Adviser is hereby"
"1543","authorized, as agent and attorney-in-fact for the Trust, for the account of, at"
"1544","the risk of and in the name of the Trust, to place orders and issue instructions"
"1545","with respect to those transactions of the Funds. In all purchases, sales and"
"1546","other transactions in securities for the Funds, the Adviser is authorized to"
"1547","exercise full discretion and act for the Trust in the same manner and with the"
"1548","same force and effect as the Trust might or could do with respect to such"
"1549","purchases, sales or other transactions, as well as with respect to all other"
"1550","things necessary or incidental to the furtherance or conduct of such purchases,"
"1551","sales or other transactions."
"1552","     (b) The Adviser will report to the Board at each regular meeting thereof"
"1553","regarding the investment performance of the Funds since the prior report, and"
"1554","will also keep the Board informed of important developments affecting the Trust,"
"1555","each Fund and the Adviser, and on its own initiative will furnish the Board from"
"1556","time to time with such information as the Adviser may believe appropriate,"
"1557","whether concerning the individual companies whose securities are held by a Fund,"
"1558","the industries in which they engage, or the economic, social or political"
"1559","conditions prevailing in each country in which a Fund maintains investments. The"
"1560","Adviser will also furnish the Board with such statistical and analytical"
"1561","information with respect to securities in the Funds as the Adviser may believe"
"1562","appropriate or as the Board reasonably may request."
"1563","          The Adviser shall promptly notify the Trust of (i) any changes"
"1564","regarding the Adviser that would impact disclosure in the Trust's Registration"
"1565","Statement, or (ii) any violation of any requirement, provision, policy or"
"1566","restriction that the Adviser is required to comply with under Section 6 of this"
"1567","Agreement. The Adviser shall immediately notify the Trust of any legal process"
"1568","served upon it in connection with its activities hereunder, including any legal"
"1569","process served upon it on behalf of the Funds or the Trust."
"1570","     (c) The Adviser will from time to time employ or sub-contract the services"
"1571","to certain persons as the Adviser believes to be appropriate or necessary to"
"1572","assist in the execution of the Adviser's duties hereunder; provided, however,"
"1573","that the employment or sub-contracting with any such person shall not relieve"
"1574","the Adviser of its responsibilities or liabilities hereunder and provided"
"1575","further that the Adviser shall not have the authority to sub-contract advisory"
"1576","responsibilities without the consent of the Trust. The cost of performance of"
"1577","such duties will be borne and paid by the Adviser. No obligation may be imposed"
"1578","on the Trust in any such respect."
"1579","          The Adviser shall supervise and monitor the activities of its"
"1580","representatives, personnel, sub-contractors, and agents in connection with the"
"1581","execution of its duties and obligations hereunder. The appropriate personnel of"
"1582","the Adviser will be made available to consult with the Board at reasonable times"
"1583","and upon reasonable notice concerning the business of the Trust."

"1585","<PAGE>"
"1586","     (d) The Adviser shall maintain records relating to portfolio transactions"
"1587","and the placing and allocation of brokerage orders as are required to be"
"1588","maintained by the Trust under the 1940 Act. The Adviser shall prepare and"
"1589","maintain, or cause to be prepared and maintained, in such form, for such periods"
"1590","and in such locations as may be required by applicable law, all documents and"
"1591","records relating to the services provided by the Adviser pursuant to this"
"1592","Agreement required to be prepared and maintained by the Trust pursuant to the"
"1593","rules and regulations of any national, state, or local government entity with"
"1594","jurisdiction over the Trust, including the Commission and the Internal Revenue"
"1595","Service. The books and records pertaining to the Trust which are in possession"
"1596","of the Adviser shall be the property of the Trust. The Trust, or the Trust's"
"1597","authorized representatives, shall have access to such books and records at all"
"1598","times during the Adviser's normal business hours. Upon the reasonable request of"
"1599","the Trust, copies of any such books and records shall be provided promptly by"
"1600","the Adviser to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives."
"1601","     (e) With respect to a Fund, the Adviser shall have no duties or obligations"
"1602","pursuant to this Agreement, during any period during which the Fund invests all"
"1603","(or substantially all) of its investment assets in a registered, open-end"
"1604","management investment company, or separate series thereof, in accordance with"
"1605","Section 12(d)(1)(E) under the 1940 Act."
"1606","     SECTION 3. DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO THE ADVISER. The Trust has furnished"
"1607","the Adviser with true, correct and complete copies of the following documents:"
"1608","          (a)  The Declaration of Trust, as in effect on the date hereof;"
"1609","          (b)  The Registration Statement filed with the Commission under the"
"1610","               1940 Act and the Securities Act; and"
"1611","          (c)  Written guidelines, policies and procedures adopted by the Trust."
"1612","     The Trust will furnish the Adviser with all future amendments and"
"1613","supplements to the foregoing as soon as practicable after such documents become"
"1614","available. The Trust shall furnish the Adviser with any further documents,"
"1615","materials or information that the Adviser may reasonably request in connection"
"1616","with the performance of its duties hereunder."
"1617","     SECTION 4. DELEGATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES. The Adviser may carry out any of"
"1618","its obligations under this Agreement by employing, subject to supervision by the"
"1619","Adviser, one or more Sub-Adviser(s) who are registered as investment advisers"
"1620","pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Sub-Advisers). Each"
"1621","Sub-Adviser's employment will be evidenced by a separate written agreement"
"1622","approved by the Board and, if required under the 1940 Act, by the shareholders"
"1623","of the Fund (unless the Commission or its staff has given authorization or"
"1624","issued an interpretation dispensing with the requirement of shareholder"
"1625","approval). The Adviser shall not be liable hereunder for any act or omission of"
"1626","any Sub-Adviser, except for failure to exercise good faith in the employment of"
"1627","the Sub-Adviser and for failure to exercise appropriate supervision of such"
"1628","Sub-Adviser, and as may otherwise be agreed in writing. The Adviser shall be"
"1629","solely responsible for compensating any Sub-Adviser for services rendered under"
"1630","any Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Adviser may, from time to time and at any time,"
"1631","terminate any Sub-Adviser and reassume the responsibilities assigned to such"
"1632","Sub-Adviser with respect to any Fund without obtaining the approval of the"
"1633","shareholders of the Fund."
"1634","                                       3"
"1635","<PAGE>"
"1636","     SECTION 5. CONTROL BY BOARD. Any investment activities undertaken by the"
"1637","Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any other activities undertaken"
"1638","by the Adviser on behalf of the Funds, shall at all times be subject to the"
"1639","direction and control of the Board."
"1640","     SECTION 6. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS. In carrying out its"
"1641","obligations under this Agreement, the Adviser shall at all times comply with:"
"1642","     (a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"1643","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"1644","     (b) the Registration Statement of the Trust, as it may be amended from time"
"1645","to time, filed with the Commission under the Securities Act and the 1940 Act;"
"1646","     (c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it may be"
"1647","amended from time to time;"
"1648","     (d) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,"
"1649","applicable to the Trust or the Funds, and any rules and regulations adopted"
"1650","thereunder; and"
"1651","     (e)any other applicable provisions of state or federal law, and any rules"
"1652","and regulations adopted thereunder."
"1653","     SECTION 7. PROXIES. The Adviser shall have responsibility to vote proxies"
"1654","solicited with respect to issuers of securities in which assets of the Funds are"
"1655","invested in accordance with the Trust's policies on proxy voting."
"1656","     SECTION 8. BROKER-DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. In connection with the purchase and"
"1657","sale of securities for the Funds, the Adviser is responsible for broker-dealer"
"1658","selection and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Adviser's primary"
"1659","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain the best"
"1660","price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular"
"1661","transaction for a Fund, the Adviser will consider among other things: the best"
"1662","net price available, the reliability, integrity and financial condition of the"
"1663","broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value"
"1664","of the expected contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing"
"1665","basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any transaction may be less"
"1666","favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the difference is"
"1667","reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio execution services"
"1668","offered. Subject to such policies as the Board may from time to time determine,"
"1669","the Adviser shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any"
"1670","duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a"
"1671","Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and research services to"
"1672","the Adviser an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"1673","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would"
"1674","have charged for effecting that transaction, if the Adviser determines in good"
"1675","faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of"
"1676","the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in"
"1677","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of"
"1678","the Adviser with respect to the Fund and to other clients of the"
"1679","                                       4"
"1680","<PAGE>"
"1681","Adviser. The Adviser is further authorized to allocate the orders placed by it"
"1682","on behalf of the Funds to brokers and dealers who also provide brokerage and"
"1683","research services within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange"
"1684","Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith. Such allocation shall be in such"
"1685","amounts and proportions as the Adviser shall determine and the Adviser will"
"1686","report on said allocations regularly to the Board, indicating the brokers to"
"1687","whom such allocations have been made and the basis therefore."
"1688","     SECTION 9. EXPENSES. All of the ordinary business expenses incurred in the"
"1689","operations of the Funds and the offering of their shares shall be borne by the"
"1690","Funds unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement. The expenses"
"1691","borne by the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage commissions,"
"1692","taxes, legal, auditing or governmental fees, the cost of preparing share"
"1693","certificates, custodian, transfer agent and shareholder service agent costs,"
"1694","expense of issue, sale, redemption and repurchase of shares, expenses of"
"1695","registering and qualifying shares for sale, expenses relating to trustees and"
"1696","shareholder meetings, the cost of preparing and distributing reports and notices"

"1698","with membership in investment company organizations and the cost of printing"
"1699","copies of prospectuses and statements of additional information distributed to"
"1700","the Funds' shareholders."
"1701","     The Adviser shall pay its own expenses in connection with the services to"
"1702","be provided by it pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, the Adviser shall be"
"1703","responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the"
"1704","Trust: (a) to amend the Trust's registration statement or supplement the Fund's"
"1705","prospectus, and circulate the same, to reflect a change in the personnel of the"
"1706","Adviser responsible for making investment decisions in relation to a Fund; (b)"
"1707","to obtain shareholder approval of a new sub-advisory agreement as a result of a"
"1708","change in control (as such term in defined in Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act)"
"1709","of the Adviser, or to otherwise comply with the 1940 Act, the Securities Act, or"
"1710","any other applicable statute, law, rule or regulation, as a result of such"
"1711","change; or (c) to meet other legal or regulatory obligations caused by actions"
"1712","of the Adviser."
"1713","     SECTION 10. COMPENSATION."
"1714","     (a) As compensation for the advisory services provided under this"
"1715","Agreement, the Trust shall pay the Adviser fees, payable monthly, at the annual"
"1716","rates indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such Schedule may be amended or"
"1717","supplemented from time to time;"
"1718","     (b) Except as provided in the following paragraph, no fee shall be payable"
"1719","hereunder with respect to a Fund during any period in which the Fund invests all"
"1720","(or substantially all) of its investment assets in a single registered, open-end"
"1721","management investment company, or separate series thereof, in accordance with"
"1722","Section 12(d)(1)(E) under the 1940 Act (a Master-Feeder Fund structure);"
"1723","     (c) The adviser shall receive a fee of 0.25% (0.35% in the case of the"
"1724","WealthBuilder Funds) for asset allocation services if a Fund invests some of its"
"1725","investment assets in two or more registered, open-end management investment"
"1726","companies, or separate series thereof, in each case, in accordance with Section"
"1727","12(d)(1)(G) under the Act, the rules thereunder or an exemptive order"

"1729","<PAGE>"

"1731","12(d)(1)(A) under the Act (a Fund of Funds structure)."
"1732","     SECTION 11. STANDARD OF CARE. The Trust will expect of the Adviser, and the"
"1733","Adviser will give the Trust the benefit of, the Adviser's best judgment and"
"1734","efforts in rendering its services to the Trust, and the Adviser shall not be"

"1736","misfeasance, bad faith, negligence or reckless disregard of obligations or"
"1737","duties hereunder on the part of the Adviser or any of its officers, directors,"
"1738","employees or agents, the Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Trust"
"1739","or to any shareholders of the Trust for any act or omission in the course of, or"
"1740","connected with, rendering services hereunder or for any losses that may be"
"1741","sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security."
"1742","     SECTION 12. NON-EXCLUSIVITY. The services of the Adviser to the Funds are"
"1743","not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Adviser shall be free to render"
"1744","investment advisory or other services to others (including other investment"
"1745","companies) and to engage in other activities. It is understood and agreed that"
"1746","officers or directors of the Adviser may serve as officers and directors of the"
"1747","Trust, and that officers or directors of the Trust may serve as officers or"
"1748","directors of the Adviser, to the extent that such services may be permitted by"

"1847","(i) it will use the words Wells Fargo as a component of its corporate name,"

"1855","longer acting as investment adviser to any Fund, the Trust shall, upon request"
"1856","by the Adviser, promptly take such action as may be necessary to change its"
"1857","corporate name to one not containing the words Wells Fargo and following such"
"1858","change, shall not use the words Wells Fargo, or any combination thereof, as a"
"1859","part of its corporate name or for any other commercial purpose, and shall use"
"1860","its best efforts to cause its trustees, officers and shareholders to take any"

"1866","the Adviser's overall management of the Funds. The Trust understands that"
"1867","investment decisions made for the Funds by the Adviser are subject to various"
"1868","market, currency, economic and business risks, and that those investment"
"1869","decisions will not always be profitable. The Adviser will manage only the"
"1870","securities, cash and other investments for which management responsibility is"
"1871","delegated to it and which are held in the Funds' account(s) and, in making"
"1872","investment decisions for the Funds, the Adviser will not consider any other"

"2942","or federal law."
"2943","For purposes of clarification and without"
"2944","limiting the foregoing, the parties agree that the"
"2945","obligations of the Manager with respect to the"
"2946","foregoing will not require the Manger to comply with"
"2947","such provisions of law that apply specifically to the"
"2948","management of the Fund(s) assets or operation of the"
"2949","Fund(s) as a whole and not individually to the Manager"
"2950","Portion."
"2951","In addition, without limiting the generality of"
"2952","the foregoing, the Manager agrees that: (i) any code of"
"2953","ethics adopted by the Manager must comply with Rule"
"2954","17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the"
"2955","Advisers Act, as they may be amended from time to"
"2956","time, and, if requested by the Trust, the Adviser or the"
"2957","Sub-Adviser, any practices regarding personal investing"
"2958","as may be set out in any interpretive release or"
"2959","guidance issued by the Commission or its staff, (ii) the"
"2960","Adviser and the Trust may disclose Fund(s) portfolio"
"2961","holdings information (including with respect to the"
"2962","Manager Portion) in accordance with the Trusts policies"
"2963","and procedures governing the disclosure of Fund(s)"
"2964","portfolio holdings, as amended or supplemented from"
"2965","time to time, and as required by applicable law or as"
"2966","otherwise provided hereunder, and (iii) the Manager"
"2967","will not use, nor will it seek to obtain, material nonpublic"
"2968","information concerning portfolio companies in"
"2969","connection with performing its duties hereunder."
"2970","Section 8. Proxies. The Adviser shall have responsibility"
"2971","to vote proxies solicited with respect to issuers of"
"2972","securities in which assets of the Manager Portion of the"
"2973","Fund(s) are invested from time to time in accordance"
"2974","with the Trust's policies on proxy voting. The Manager"
"2975","will provide, when requested by the Adviser,"
"2976","information on a particular issuer to assist the Adviser"
"2977","in the voting of a proxy."
"2978","Section 9. Broker-Dealer Relationships. The"
"2979","Manager is responsible for the purchase and sale of"
"2980","securities for the Manager Portion of the Fund(s),"
"2981","broker-dealer selection, and negotiation of brokerage"
"2982","commission rates. The Managers primary"
"2983","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be"
"2984","to obtain the best execution under the circumstances."
"2985","In selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular"
"2986","transaction for the Manager Portion of the Fund(s), the"
"2987","Manager will consider such factors it considers to be"
"2988","relevant to the transaction, which are expected to"
"2989","include, among other things: the best net price"
"2990","available, the reliability, integrity and financial condition"
"2991","of the broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in"
"2992","executing the order; and the value of the expected"
"2993","contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund(s) on a"
"2994","continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund(s)"
"2995","in any transaction may be less favorable than that"
"2996","available from another broker-dealer if the Manager"
"2997","determines in good faith that the difference is"
"2998","reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio"
"2999","execution services offered. Subject to such policies as"
"3000","the Board may from time to time determine, the"
"3001","Manager shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully"
"3002","or to have breached any duty created by this"
"3003","Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having"
"3004","caused the Fund(s) with respect to the Manager Portion"
"3005","to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and"
"3006","research services to the Manager an amount of"
"3007","commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"3008","transaction in excess of the amount of commission"
"3009","another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"3010","effecting that transaction, if the Manager determines in"
"3011","good faith that such amount of commission was"
"3012","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"3013","research services provided by such broker or dealer,"
"3014","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or"
"3015","the overall responsibilities of the Manager with respect"
"3016","to the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) and to other"
"3017","clients of the Manager. The Manager is further"
"3018","authorized to allocate the orders placed by it on behalf"
"3019","of the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) to brokers and"
"3020","dealers who provide brokerage and research services"
"3021","within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"3022","Exchange Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith."
"3023","Such allocation shall be in such amounts and"
"3024","proportions as the Manager shall determine and the"
"3025","Manager will report regularly to the Board upon"
"3026","request, indicating the services provided."
"3027","Provided the investment objective of the Fund(s) is"
"3028","adhered to, the Manager may aggregate sales and"
"3029","purchase orders of securities for the Manager Portion of"
"3030","the Fund(s) with similar orders being made at"
"3031","approximately the same time for other portfolios"
"3032","managed by the Manager, if, in the Manager's"
"3033","reasonable judgment, such aggregation is reasonably"
"3034","expected to result in an overall economic benefit to the"
"3035","Fund(s). In accounting for such aggregated order, price"
"3036","and commission shall be averaged on a per bond or"
"3037","share basis daily. The Trust and the Adviser"
"3038","acknowledge that the Managers determination of such"
"3039","economic benefit to the Fund(s) may be based on an"
"3040","evaluation that the Fund(s) is benefited by relatively"
"3041","better purchase or sales price, lower commission"
"3042","expenses and beneficial timing of transactions, the"
"3043","Managers fiduciary duty to fairly allocate trading"
"3044","opportunities among its clients, or a combination of"
"3045","these and other factors. The allocation of securities so"
"3046","purchased or sold shall be made by the Manager in the"
"3047","manner that the Manager considers to be most"
"3048","equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to"
"3049","the Fund(s) and other clients. The Manager represents"
"3050","and acknowledges that it is solely responsible for"
"3051","complying, and agrees that it shall comply, with any and"
"3052","all applicable pronouncements of the Commission or its"
"3053","staff with respect to the requirements for aggregating"
"3054","trades as may be set out in any interpretive release"
"3055","and/or no-action letters issued by the Commission or its"
"3056","staff. The Manager shall not be responsible for any acts"
"3057","or omissions by any broker or dealer, provided that the"
"3058","Manager did not act with gross negligence or willful"
"3059","misconduct in the selection of such broker or dealer."
"3060","The Manager shall not engage in any transactions for"
"3061","the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) with or through any"
"3062","broker-dealer that is an affiliated person of the"
"3063","Manager or of the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser except in"
"3064","compliance with all applicable regulations of the"
"3065","Commission and the applicable policies and procedures"
"3066","of the Trust governing such transactions. The Adviser"
"3067","and Sub-Adviser agree to provide the Manager a"
"3068","written list of any broker-dealers that are affiliated"
"3069","persons of the Adviser and Sub-Adviser and to update"
"3070","such list from time to time to ensure that it remains"
"3071","accurate and complete."
"3072","Section 10. Expenses of the Fund(s). All of the"
"3073","ordinary business expenses incurred in the operations"
"3074","of the Fund(s) and the offering of their shares shall be"
"3075","borne by the Fund(s) unless specifically provided"
"3076","otherwise in this Agreement. These expenses borne by"

"3965","For purposes of clarification and without"

"3972","Portion."
"3973","In addition, without limiting the generality of"
"3974","the foregoing, the Manager agrees that: (i) any code of"
"3975","ethics adopted by the Manager must comply with Rule"
"3976","17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the"
"3977","Advisers Act, as they may be amended from time to"

"3980","as may be set out in any interpretive release or"
"3981","guidance issued by the Commission or its staff (ii) the"
"3982","Adviser and the Trust may disclose Fund(s) portfolio"
"3983","holdings information (including with respect to the"
"3984","Manager Portion) in accordance with the Trust's policies"
"3985","and procedures governing the disclosure of Fund(s)"
"3986","portfolio holdings, as amended or supplemented from"
"3987","time to time, and as required by applicable law or as"

"3989","will not use, nor will it seek to obtain, material nonpublic"
"3990","information concerning portfolio companies in"
"3991","connection with performing its duties hereunder."
"3992","Section 8. Proxies. The Adviser shall have responsibility"
"3993","to vote proxies solicited with respect to issuers of"
"3994","securities in which assets of the Manager Portion of the"
"3995","Fund(s) are invested from time to time in accordance"
"3996","with the Trust's policies on proxy voting. The Manager"
"3997","will provide, when requested by the Adviser,"
"3998","information on a particular issuer to assist the Adviser"
"3999","in the voting of a proxy."
"4000","Section 9. Broker-Dealer Relationships. The"
"4001","Manager is responsible for the purchase and sale of"
"4002","securities for the Manager Portion of the Fund(s),"
"4003","broker-dealer selection, and negotiation of brokerage"
"4004","commission rates. The Manager's primary"
"4005","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be"
"4006","to obtain the best price and execution under the"
"4007","circumstances. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute"
"4008","each particular transaction for the Manager Portion of"
"4009","the Fund(s), the Manager will consider such factors it"
"4010","considers to be relevant to the transaction, which are"
"4011","expected to include, among other things: the best net"
"4012","price available, the reliability, integrity and financial"
"4013","condition of the broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty"
"4014","in executing the order; and the value of the expected"
"4015","contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund(s) on a"
"4016","continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund(s)"
"4017","in any transaction may be less favorable than that"
"4018","available from another broker-dealer if the Manager"
"4019","determines in good faith that the difference is"
"4020","reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio"
"4021","execution services offered. Subject to such policies as"
"4022","the Board may from time to time determine, the"
"4023","Manager shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully"
"4024","or to have breached any duty created by this"
"4025","Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having"
"4026","caused the Fund(s) with respect to the Manager Portion"
"4027","to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and"
"4028","research services to the Manager an amount of"
"4029","commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"4030","transaction in excess of the amount of commission"
"4031","another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"4032","effecting that transaction, if the Manager determines in"
"4033","good faith that such amount of commission was"
"4034","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"4035","research services provided by such broker or dealer,"
"4036","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or"
"4037","the overall responsibilities of the Manager with respect"
"4038","to the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) and to other"
"4039","clients of the Manager. The Manager is further"
"4040","authorized to allocate the orders placed by it on behalf"
"4041","of the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) to brokers and"
"4042","dealers who provide brokerage and research services"
"4043","within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"4044","Exchange Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith."
"4045","Such allocation shall be in such amounts and"
"4046","proportions as the Manager shall determine and the"
"4047","Manager will report on said allocations regularly to the"
"4048","Board, indicating the brokers to whom such allocations"
"4049","have been made and the basis therefor."
"4050","Provided the investment objective of the Fund(s) is"
"4051","adhered to, the Manager may aggregate sales and"
"4052","purchase orders for the Manager Portion of the Fund(s)"
"4053","with similar orders being made at approximately the"
"4054","same time for other portfolios managed by the"
"4055","Manager, if, in the Manager's reasonable judgment,"
"4056","such aggregation will result in an overall economic"
"4057","benefit to the Fund(s). In accounting for such"
"4058","aggregated orders, price and commission shall be"
"4059","averaged on a per security basis where possible. If local"
"4060","regulations do not allow for average pricing, then a best"
"4061","fit allocation algorithm will be employed to optimize the"
"4062","allocation as close to an average as commercially"
"4063","reasonably possible. The Trust and the Adviser"
"4064","acknowledge that the Manager's determination of such"
"4065","economic benefit to the Fund(s) may be based on an"
"4066","evaluation that the Fund(s) is benefited by relatively"
"4067","better purchase or sales price, lower commission"
"4068","expenses and beneficial timing of transactions, the"
"4069","Manager's fiduciary duty to fairly allocate trading"
"4070","opportunities among its clients, or a combination of"
"4071","these and other factors. The allocation of securities so"
"4072","purchased or sold shall be made by the Manager in the"
"4073","manner that the Manager considers to be most"
"4074","equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to"
"4075","the Fund(s) and other clients. The Manager represents"
"4076","and acknowledges that it is solely responsible for"
"4077","complying, and agrees that it shall comply, with any and"
"4078","all applicable pronouncements of the Commission or its"
"4079","staff with respect to the requirements for aggregating"
"4080","trades as may be set out in any interpretive release"
"4081","and/or no-action letters issued by the Commission or its"
"4082","staff. The Manager shall not be responsible for any acts"
"4083","or omissions by any broker or dealer, provided that the"
"4084","Manager did not act with gross negligence or willful"
"4085","misconduct in the selection of such broker or dealer."
"4086","The Manager shall not engage in any transactions for"
"4087","the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) with or through any"
"4088","broker-dealer that is an affiliated person of the"
"4089","Manager or of the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser except in"
"4090","compliance with all applicable regulations of the"
"4091","Commission and the applicable policies and procedures"
"4092","of the Trust governing such transactions."
"4093","Section 10. Expenses of the Fund(s). All of the"
"4094","ordinary business expenses incurred in the operations"
"4095","of the Fund(s) and the offering of their shares shall be"
"4096","borne by the Fund(s) unless specifically provided"
"4097","otherwise in this Agreement. These expenses borne by"
"4098","the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage"
"4099","commissions, taxes, legal, auditing or governmental"
"4100","fees, the cost of preparing share certificates, custodian,"

"4108","membership in investment company organizations and"
"4109","the cost of printing copies of prospectuses and"
"4110","statements of additional information distributed to the"
"4111","Fund(s)' shareholders."
"4112","The Manager shall pay its own expenses in"
"4113","connection with the services to be provided by it"
"4114","pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, the Manager"
"4115","shall be responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket costs"
"4116","and expenses incurred by the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser"

"4120","the Fund(s)' prospectuses and/or statement of"
"4121","additional information, and circulate the same, solely to"
"4122","reflect a change in the personnel of the Manager"
"4123","responsible for making investment decisions in relation"
"4124","to the Fund(s); or (b) to obtain shareholder approval of"
"4125","a new sub-advisory agreement as a result of a change in"

Advisers/Managers) in reliance on exemptions under"
"4734","Rule 10f-3, Rule 12d3-1, Rule 17a-10 and Rule 17e-1"

"4736","agrees that it will not consult with any Other Sub-"

"4739","Fund(s), the Manager shall be limited to"
"4740","managing only the Manager Portion, and shall not"
"4741","consult with another Sub-Adviser/Manager as to any"
"4742","other portion of the Fund(s)' portfolio concerning"

"4756","Fund(s) and the Manager, and on its own initiative will"
"4757","furnish the Board from time to time with such"

"4762","economic, social or political conditions prevailing in"
"4763","each country in which the Manager Portion of the"
"4764","Fund(s) maintains investments. At the request of the"
"4765","Adviser or the Sub-Adviser, the Manager shall review"
"4766","draft shareholder reports and annual updates to"
"4767","prospectuses and other documents and provide"
"4768","comments thereon with respect to the Manager and"
"4769","the Manager Portion, provided, however, that Manager"
"4770","receives such documents at least five (5) business days"
"4771","prior to the day on which such comments are due. The"
"4772","Manager will also furnish the Board with such statistical"
"4773","and analytical information with respect to securities or"

"4784","Adviser and the Sub-Adviser (i) of any material changes"
"4785","regarding the Manager that would impact disclosure in"
"4786","the Trust's Registration Statement, including, without"
"4787","limitation, any change in the personnel of the Manager"
"4788","responsible for making investment decisions for the"
"4789","Fund(s), (ii) of any violation of any requirement,"

"4791","required to comply with under Section 7 of this"
"4792","Agreement, and (iii) upon Manager becoming aware"
"4793","that it is, or likely may become, subject to any statutory"
"4794","disqualification pursuant to Section 9 of the 1940 Act or"
"4795","any other event otherwise that prevents the Manager"
"4796","from performing its duties pursuant to this Agreement."
"4797","The Manager shall notify the Adviser and the Sub-"

"4812","proceedings relating to the holdings (historical and/or"
"4813","current) of the Fund(s) with respect to the Manager"
"4814","Portion."
"4815","(e) The Manager shall supervise and"

"5009","securities in which assets of the Manager Portion of the"
"5010","Fund(s) are invested from time to time in accordance"
"5011","with the Trust's policies on proxy voting. The Manager"
"5012","will provide, when requested by the Adviser,"

"5015","Section 9. Broker-Dealer Relationships. The"
"5016","Manager is responsible for the purchase and sale of"
"5017","securities for the Manager Portion of the Fund(s),"
"5018","broker-dealer selection, and negotiation of brokerage"
"5019","commission rates. Subject to the remainder of this"
"5020","paragraph, Manager's primary consideration in"
"5021","effecting a security transaction will be to obtain the"
"5022","best price and execution under the circumstances. In"
"5023","selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular"
"5024","transaction for the Manager Portion of the Fund(s), the"
"5025","Manager will consider such factors it considers to be"
"5026","relevant to the transaction, which are expected to"
"5027","include, among other things: the best net price"
"5028","available, the reliability, integrity and financial condition"
"5029","of the broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in"
"5030","executing the order; and the value of the expected"
"5031","contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund(s) on a"
"5032","continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund(s)"
"5033","in any transaction may be less favorable than that"
"5034","available from another broker-dealer if the Manager"
"5035","determines in good faith that the difference is"
"5036","reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio"
"5037","execution services offered. Subject to such policies as"
"5038","the Board may from time to time determine, the"
"5039","Manager shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully"
"5040","or to have breached any duty created by this"
"5041","Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having"
"5042","caused the Fund(s) with respect to the Manager Portion"
"5043","to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and"
"5044","research services to the Manager an amount of"
"5045","commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"5046","transaction in excess of the amount of commission"
"5047","another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"5048","effecting that transaction, if the Manager determines in"
"5049","good faith that such amount of commission was"
"5050","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"5051","research services provided by such broker or dealer,"
"5052","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or"
"5053","the overall responsibilities of the Manager with respect"
"5054","to the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) and to other"
"5055","clients of the Manager. The Manager is further"
"5056","authorized to allocate the orders placed by it on behalf"
"5057","of the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) to brokers and"
"5058","dealers who provide brokerage and research services"
"5059","within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"5060","Exchange Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith."
"5061","Such allocation shall be in such amounts and"
"5062","proportions as the Manager shall determine and the"
"5063","Manager will report on said allocations regularly to the"
"5064","Board, indicating the brokers to whom such allocations"
"5065","have been made and the basis therefor."
"5066","Provided the investment objective of the Manager"
"5067","Portion of the Fund(s) is adhered to, the Manager may"
"5068","aggregate sales and purchase orders of securities for"
"5069","the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) with similar orders"
"5070","being made at approximately the same time for other"
"5071","portfolios managed by the Manager, if, in the"
"5072","Manager's reasonable judgment, such aggregation will"
"5073","result in an overall economic benefit to the Fund(s). In"
"5074","accounting for such aggregated order, price and"
"5075","commission shall be averaged on a per bond or share"
"5076","basis daily. The Trust and the Adviser acknowledge that"
"5077","the Manager's determination of such economic benefit"
"5078","to the Fund(s) may be based on an evaluation that the"
"5079","Fund(s) is benefited by relatively better purchase or"
"5080","sales price, lower commission expenses and beneficial"
"5081","timing of transactions, the Manager's fiduciary duty to"
"5082","fairly allocate trading opportunities among its clients, or"
"5083","a combination of these and other factors. The"
"5084","allocation of securities so purchased or sold shall be"
"5085","made by the Manager in the manner that the Manager"
"5086","considers to be most equitable and consistent with its"
"5087","fiduciary obligations to the Fund(s) and other clients"
"5088","over time. The Manager represents and acknowledges"
"5089","that it is solely responsible for complying, and agrees"
"5090","that it shall comply, with any and all applicable"

"5098","misconduct in the selection of such broker or dealer."
"5099","The Manager shall not engage in any transactions for"

"6028","responsibility to vote proxies solicited with respect to"
"6029","issuers of securities in which assets of the Manager"
"6030","Portion of the Fund(s) are invested from time to time in"

"6038","securities for the Manager Portion of the Fund(s),"
"6039","broker-dealer selection, and negotiation of brokerage"
"6040","commission rates. Subject to the remainder of this"
"6041","paragraph, the Manager's primary consideration in"
"6042","effecting a security transaction will be to seek to obtain"
"6043","the best price and execution under the circumstances."
"6044","In selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular"
"6045","transaction for the Manager Portion of the Fund(s), the"
"6046","Manager will consider such factors it considers to be"
"6047","relevant to the transaction, which are expected to"
"6048","include, among other things: the best net price"
"6049","available, the reliability, integrity and financial condition"
"6050","of the broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in"
"6051","executing the order; and the value of the expected"
"6052","contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund(s) on a"
"6053","continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund(s)"
"6054","in any transaction may be less favorable than that"
"6055","available from another broker-dealer if the Manager"
"6056","determines in good faith that the difference is"
"6057","reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio"
"6058","execution services offered. Subject to such policies as"
"6059","the Board may from time to time determine, the"
"6060","Manager shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully"
"6061","or to have breached any duty created by this"
"6062","Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having"
"6063","caused the Fund(s) with respect to the Manager Portion"
"6064","to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and"
"6065","research services to the Manager an amount of"
"6066","commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"6067","transaction in excess of the amount of commission"
"6068","another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"6069","effecting that transaction, if the Manager determines in"
"6070","good faith that such amount of commission was"
"6071","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"6072","research services provided by such broker or dealer,"
"6073","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or"
"6074","the overall responsibilities of the Manager with respect"
"6075","to the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) and to other"
"6076","clients of the Manager. The Manager is further"
"6077","authorized to allocate the orders placed by it on behalf"
"6078","of the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) to brokers and"
"6079","dealers who provide brokerage and research services"
"6080","within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"6081","Exchange Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith."
"6082","Such allocation shall be in such amounts and"
"6083","proportions as the Manager shall determine and the"
"6084","Manager will report on said allocations regularly to the"
"6085","Board, indicating the brokers to whom such allocations"
"6086","have been made and the basis therefor."
"6087","Provided the investment objective of the Manager"
"6088","Portion of the Fund(s) is adhered to, the Manager may"
"6089","aggregate sales and purchase orders of securities for"
"6090","the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) with similar orders"
"6091","being made at approximately the same time for other"
"6092","portfolios managed by the Manager, if, in the"
"6093","Manager's reasonable judgment, such aggregation will"
"6094","result in an overall economic benefit to the Fund(s). In"
"6095","accounting for such aggregated order, price and"
"6096","commission shall be averaged on a per bond or share"
"6097","basis daily. The Trust and the Adviser acknowledge that"
"6098","the Manager's determination of such economic benefit"
"6099","to the Fund(s) may be based on an evaluation that the"
"6100","Fund(s) is benefited by relatively better purchase or"
"6101","sales price, lower commission expenses and beneficial"
"6102","timing of transactions, the Manager's fiduciary duty to"
"6103","fairly allocate trading opportunities among its clients, or"
"6104","a combination of these and other factors. The"
"6105","allocation of securities so purchased or sold shall be"
"6106","made by the Manager in the manner that the Manager"
"6107","considers to be most equitable and consistent with its"
"6108","fiduciary obligations to the Fund(s) and other clients"
"6109","over time. The Manager represents and acknowledges"
"6110","that it is solely responsible for complying, and agrees"
"6111","that it shall comply, with any and all applicable"
"6112","pronouncements of the Commission or its staff with"
"6113","respect to the requirements for aggregating trades as"
"6114","may be set out in any interpretive release and/or noaction"
"6115","letters issued by the Commission or its staff. The"
"6116","Manager shall not be responsible for any acts or"
"6117","omissions by any broker or dealer, provided that the"
"6118","Manager did not act with gross negligence or willful"
"6119","misconduct in the selection of such broker or dealer."
"6120","The Manager shall not engage in any transactions for"
"6121","the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) with or through any"
"6122","broker-dealer that is an affiliated person of the"
"6123","Manager or that is described in writing to the Manager"
"6124","as being an affiliated person of the Adviser or the Sub-"
"6125","Adviser except in compliance with all applicable"

"6133","otherwise in this Agreement. These expenses borne by"

"6708","Advisory Agreement, all in such manner and to such"
"6709","extent as may be directed from time to time by the"
"6710","Board or the Adviser."
"6711","Subject to the direction and control of the"
"6712","Board, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser, and with the"
"6713","oversight of the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser, the"
"6714","Manager is hereby appointed and agrees to manage the"
"6715","investment and reinvestment (or, as determined by the"
"6716","Manager, the amount (if any) held in cash or cash"
"6717","equivalents) of that portion of the assets of the Fund(s)"
"6718","allocated to it from time to time by the Board, the"

"6722","specified herein, all in such manner and to such extent"

"6741","including, but not limited to, the power to exercise"
"6742","rights, options, warrants, conversion privileges,"
"6743","redemption privileges, and to tender securities"
"6744","pursuant to a tender offer. To the extent that any"
"6745","communication directing the provision of management"
"6746","services with respect to the Manager Portion are made"
"6747","or delivered pursuant to this Agreement by either the"
"6748","Adviser or the Sub-Adviser, such communications or"

"6750","to have been made by both the Adviser and the Sub-"
"6751","Adviser."
"6752","Section 3. Duties and Representations and"
"6753","Warranties of the Manager."
"6754","(a) The Manager shall make decisions with"
"6755","respect to all purchases and sales of securities and"
"6756","other investment assets for the Manager Portion of the"
"6757","Fund(s). To carry out such decisions, the Manager is"
"6758","hereby authorized, as agent and attorney-in-fact for the"
"6759","Trust, for the account of, at the risk of and in the name"
"6760","of the Trust, to place orders, issue instructions and"
"6761","execute documentation with respect to those"
"6762","transactions of the Fund(s) with respect to the Manager"
"6763","Portion thereof. In all purchases, sales and other"
"6764","transactions in securities and other investment assets"
"6765","for the Manager Portion of the Fund(s), the Manager is"
"6766","authorized to exercise full discretion and act for the"
"6767","Trust in the same manner and with the same force and"
"6768","effect as the Trust might or could do with respect to"
"6769","such purchases, sales or other transactions, as well as"
"6770","with respect to all other things necessary or incidental"
"6771","to the furtherance or conduct of such purchases, sales"
"6772","or other transactions."
"6773","(b) The Manager acknowledges that the"
"6774","Fund(s) and other mutual funds advised by the Adviser"
"6775","(collectively, the fund complex) may engage in"
"6776","transactions with certain sub-advisers or other"
"6777","managers in the fund complex (and their affiliated"

"6780","on exemptions under Rule 10f-3, Rule 12d3-1, Rule 17a-"
"6781","10 and Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act. Accordingly, the"
"6782","Manager hereby agrees that it will not knowingly"
"6783","consult with any Other Managers concerning"
"6784","transactions for a fund in securities or other Fund(s)"
"6785","assets. With respect to a multi-managed Fund(s), the"

"6787","Portion as may be determined from time-to-time by the"
"6788","Board, the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser, and shall not"
"6789","consult with the Other Managers as to any other"
"6790","portion of the Fund(s)' portfolio concerning transactions"
"6791","for the Fund(s) in securities or other Fund assets."
"6792","Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be"
"6793","deemed to prohibit consultations between (i) the"
"6794","Manager that is not an affiliated person of the Adviser"
"6795","or the Sub-Adviser and a sub-adviser or manager that is"
"6796","an affiliated person of the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser or"
"6797","(ii) the Manager that is an affiliated person of the"
"6798","Adviser or Sub-Adviser and any other sub-adviser or"
"6799","manager."
"6800","(c) The Manager will report to the Board at"
"6801","each regular meeting thereof all material changes in the"
"6802","Manager Portion of the Fund(s) since the prior report,"
"6803","and will also keep the Board informed of important"
"6804","developments affecting the Trust, the Manager Portion"
"6805","of the Fund(s) and the Manager, and will furnish the"
"6806","Board from time to time with such information as the"
"6807","Board, the Adviser or Sub-Adviser may reasonably"
"6808","request, whether concerning the individual companies"

"6810","Fund(s), the industries in which they engage, or the"
"6811","economic, social or political conditions prevailing in"
"6812","each country in which the Manager Portion of the"
"6813","Fund(s) maintains investments. At the request of the"
"6814","Adviser or the Sub-Adviser, the Manager shall review"
"6815","draft shareholder reports and annual updates to"
"6816","prospectuses and other documents and provide timely"
"6817","comments thereon. The Manager will also furnish the"
"6818","Board with such statistical and analytical information"
"6819","with respect to securities or other assets in the"
"6820","Manager Portion of the Fund(s) in respect of the"
"6821","Manager Portion as the Board, the Adviser or the Sub-"
"6822","Adviser may reasonably request. In making purchases"
"6823","and sales of securities for the Manager Portion of the"
"6824","Fund(s), the Manager will comply with the provisions,"
"6825","policies, restrictions and other requirements set forth in"
"6826","Section 7 of this Agreement, and the investment"
"6827","objectives, policies and restrictions of the Fund(s)."
"6828","(d) The Manager shall promptly notify the"
"6829","Adviser and the Sub-Adviser (i) of any changes regarding"
"6830","the Manager that would impact disclosure in the Trust's"
"6831","Registration Statement, including, without limitation,"
"6832","any change in the personnel of the Manager responsible"
"6833","for making investment decisions for the Fund(s), (ii) of"
"6834","any violation of any requirement, provision, policy or"
"6835","restriction that the Manager is required to comply with"
"6836","under Section 7 (Compliance with Applicable"
"6837","Requirements) of this Agreement, and (iii) upon"
"6838","Manager becoming aware that it is, or likely may"
"6839","become, subject to any statutory disqualification"
"6840","pursuant to Section 9 of the 1940 Act or any other"
"6841","event otherwise that prevents the Manager from"
"6842","performing its duties pursuant to this Agreement. The"
"6843","Manager shall notify the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser"
"6844","promptly: (a) of any change in control or(as such term
in defined in Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act) of the
Manager, or (b) after executing any definitive
agreement that provides for transactions that when
consummated would result in a change in control of the
Manager, or, if earlier, upon notice of any such
transactions to other clients of the Manager. The
Manager shall, within two business days, notify the
Adviser, the Sub-Adviser and the Trust of any legal
process served upon it in connection with its activities
hereunder, including any legal process served upon it
on behalf of the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser, the Fund(s) or
the Trust. The Manager shall reasonably cooperate
with the Fund(s)' custodian (Custodian) in the
Custodian's processing of class actions or other legal
proceedings relating to the holdings (historical and/or
current) of the Fund(s).
(e) The Manager shall supervise and
monitor the activities of its representatives, personnel
and agents in connection with the execution of its
duties and obligations hereunder. The appropriate
personnel of the Manager will be made available to
consult with the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser, the Trust and
the Board at reasonable times and upon reasonable
notice concerning the Manager's performance of
services hereunder or any other aspect of the business
of the Trust and the Fund(s). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, appropriate personnel of
the Manager will assist the Adviser and/or the Board in
the valuation of securities or other investment assets
held within the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) in
accordance with the Trust's Procedures for the
Valuation of Portfolio Securities.
(f) The Manager is not authorized to subcontract
or otherwise delegate any of the services
contemplated hereby to any other person without the
prior written consent of the Trust, the Adviser and the
Sub-Adviser, which consent may be withheld for any
reason. Any attempt to sub-contract or delegate any
such services without such consent shall be invalid.
(g) The Manager represents and warrants
to the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser and the Trust that: (i)

under the Advisers Act and is registered or licensed as
an investment adviser under the laws of all jurisdictions
in which its activities require it to be so registered or
licensed; (ii) the Manager is duly organized and validly

obligations under this Agreement; and (iii) the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by the Adviser and Sub-Adviser has been duly
authorized by appropriate action of the Adviser and
Sub-Adviser.
Section 4. Delivery of Documents to the Manager. The
Adviser or the Sub-Adviser has furnished the Manager
with true, correct and complete copies of the following
documents:
(a) The Declaration of Trust and By-Laws of the
Trust, as in effect on the date hereof;

(c) The Advisory Agreement and the Sub-Advisory

adopted by the Trust that are applicable to the Fund(s)
and the Investment Guidelines.
The Adviser or the Sub-Adviser will furnish the Manager
with all future amendments and supplements to the
foregoing as soon as practicable after such documents
become available, and the Manager shall not be liable
hereunder for failure to comply with the foregoing until
the Manager has received such documents or drafts
thereof. The Adviser or the Sub-Adviser shall furnish
the Manager with any further documents, materials or
information that the Manager may reasonably request
in connection with the performance of its duties
hereunder.
The Manager shall furnish the Adviser or the Sub-
Adviser with written certifications, in such form as the
Adviser or the Sub-Adviser shall reasonably request,
that it has received and reviewed the most recent
version of the foregoing documents provided by the
Adviser or the Sub-Adviser and that it will comply with
such documents in the performance of its obligations
under this Agreement.
Section 5. Delivery of Documents to the Adviser and
the Sub-Adviser. The Manager has furnished, and in the
future will furnish, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser with
true, correct and complete copies of each of the
following documents:
(a) The Manager's most recent Form ADV;
(b) The Manager's most recent balance sheet;
(c) The current Code of Ethics of the Manager,
adopted pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act, and

Code; and
(d) Copies of its policies and procedures adopted

amended from time to time, and the report
memorializing the results of the annual review of the

In addition, the Manager will furnish the Adviser and
the Sub-Adviser with a summary of the results of any
examination of the Manager by the Commission or
other regulatory agency with respect to the Manager's
investment management activities.
The Manager will furnish the Adviser and the Sub-
Adviser with all such documents as soon as practicable
after such documents become available, to the extent
that such documents have been changed materially.
The Manager shall furnish the Adviser and the Sub-
Adviser with any further documents, materials or
information as the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser may
reasonably request in connection with the Manager's
performance of its duties under this Agreement,
including, but not limited to, information regarding the
Manager's financial condition, level of insurance
coverage, code of ethics compliance, conflict mitigation
practices, and any certifications or sub-certifications
which may reasonably be requested in connection with
Fund(s) registration statements, Form N-CSR filings or
other regulatory filings, and in connection with the
consideration of the continuation of this Agreement for
approval as set forth in Section 15 hereof.
Section 6. Control by Board. As is the case
with respect to the Adviser under the Advisory
Agreement, and the Sub-Adviser under the Sub-
Advisory Agreement, any investment activities
undertaken by the Manager pursuant to this
Agreement, as well as any other activities undertaken
by the Manager on behalf of the Fund(s), shall at all
times be subject to the direction and control of the
Trust's Board.
Section 7. Compliance with Applicable
Requirements. In carrying out its obligations under this
Agreement, the Manager shall at all times comply with:
(a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act
and the Advisers Act, and any rules and regulations
adopted thereunder;
(b) the provisions of the registration
statement of the Trust, as it may be amended or
supplemented from time to time, under the Securities
Act and the 1940 Act;
(c) the provisions of the Declaration of
Trust of the Trust, as it may be amended or
supplemented from time to time;
(d) the provisions of any By-laws of the
Trust, if adopted and as it may be amended from time
to time, resolutions of the Board as may be adopted
from time to time, the applicable provisions of written
guidelines, policies and procedures adopted by the
Trust or the Board, and the Investment Guidelines;
(e) the provisions of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, applicable to the
Manager Portion; and
(f) any other provisions of state or federal
law applicable to the Manager's role as a sub-advisor to
the Manager Portion.
For purposes of clarification and without
limiting the foregoing, the parties agree that the
obligations of the Manager with respect to the
foregoing will not require the Manger to comply with
such provisions of law that apply specifically to the
management of the Fund(s)' assets or operation of the
Fund(s) as a whole and not individually to the Manager
Portion. The Manager shall not be required to comply
with the requirements or conditions of any exemptive
order of the Commission or no-action letter of the
Commission staff issued specifically to the Trust or the
Fund(s) and applicable to the services provided by the
Manager hereunder unless such order or letter shall
have been delivered to the Manager by the Adviser or
the Sub-Adviser.
In addition, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Manager agrees that: (i) any code of
ethics adopted by the Manager must comply with Rule
17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the
Advisers Act, as they may be amended from time to
time, and, if requested by the Trust, the Adviser or the
Sub-Adviser, any practices regarding personal investing
as may be set out in any interpretive release or
published guidance issued by the Commission or its
staff, (ii) the Adviser and the Trust may disclose Fund(s)
portfolio holdings information (including with respect to
the Manager Portion) in accordance with the Trust's
policies and procedures governing the disclosure of
Fund(s) portfolio holdings, as amended or
supplemented from time to time, and as required by
applicable law or as otherwise provided hereunder, and
(iii) the Manager will not use, nor will it seek to obtain,
material non-public information concerning portfolio
companies in connection with performing its duties
hereunder.
Section 8. Proxies. The Adviser shall have responsibility
to vote proxies solicited with respect to issuers of
securities in which assets of the Manager Portion of the
Fund(s) are invested from time to time in accordance
with the Trust's policies on proxy voting. The Manager
will provide, when requested by the Adviser,
information it has or can obtain without unreasonable
burden or expense on a particular issuer held on behalf
of the Manager Portion to assist the Adviser in the
voting of a proxy.
Section 9. Broker-Dealer Relationships. The
Manager is responsible for the purchase and sale of
securities for the Manager Portion of the Fund(s),
broker-dealer selection, and negotiation of brokerage
commission rates. Subject to the remainder of this
paragraph, the Manager's primary consideration in
effecting a security transaction will be to seek to obtain
the best price and execution under the circumstances.
In selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular
transaction for the Manager Portion of the Fund(s), the
Manager will consider such factors it considers to be
relevant to the transaction, which are expected to
include, among other things: the best net price
available, the reliability, integrity and financial condition
of the broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in
executing the order; and the value of the expected
contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund(s) (or the
Manager or its clients) on a continuing basis.
Accordingly, the price to the Fund(s) in any transaction
may be less favorable than that available from another
broker-dealer if the Manager determines in good faith
that the difference is reasonably justified by other
aspects of the portfolio execution services offered.
Subject to such policies as the Board may from time to
time determine, the Manager shall not be deemed to
have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty
created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by
reason of having caused the Fund(s) with respect to the
Manager Portion to pay a broker or dealer that provides
brokerage and research services to the Manager an
amount of commission for effecting a portfolio
investment transaction in excess of the amount of
commission another broker or dealer would have
charged for effecting that transaction, if the Manager
determines in good faith that such amount of
commission was reasonable in relation to the value of
the brokerage and research services provided by such
broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that
particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of
the Manager with respect to the Manager Portion of
the Fund(s) and to other clients of the Manager. The
Manager is further authorized to allocate the orders
placed by it on behalf of the Manager Portion of the
Fund(s) to brokers and dealers who provide brokerage
and research services within the meaning of Section
28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and in
compliance therewith. Such allocation shall be in such
amounts and proportions as the Manager shall
determine and the Manager will report on said
allocations regularly to the Board, indicating the brokers
to whom such allocations have been made and the basis
therefor.
Provided the investment objective of the Manager
Portion is adhered to, the Manager may aggregate sales
and purchase orders of securities for the Manager
Portion of the Manager Portion with similar orders
being made at approximately the same time for other
portfolios managed by the Manager, if, in the
Manager's reasonable judgment, such aggregation is
consistent with the objective of seeking to obtain best
execution (as described in the preceding paragraph). In
accounting for such aggregated order, price and
commission shall be averaged on a per bond or share
basis daily, to the extent permitted by the executing
broker. The Trust and the Adviser acknowledge that the
Manager's determination that such aggregation is
consistent with the objective of seeking to obtain best
execution may be based on an evaluation that the
Fund(s) is benefited by relatively better purchase or
sales price, lower commission expenses and beneficial
timing of transactions, the Manager's fiduciary duty to
fairly allocate trading opportunities among its clients,
efficiency of execution by the Manager, or a
combination of these and other factors. The allocation
of securities so purchased or sold shall be made by the
Manager in the manner that the Manager considers to
be most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Fund(s) and other clients over time.
The Manager represents and acknowledges that it is
solely responsible for complying, and agrees that it shall
comply, with any and all applicable pronouncements of
the Commission or its staff with respect to the
requirements for aggregating trades as may be set out
in any interpretive release and/or no-action letters
issued by the Commission or its staff. The Manager
shall not be responsible for any acts or omissions by any
broker or dealer, provided that the Manager did not act
with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the
selection of such broker or dealer.
The Manager shall not engage in any transactions for
the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) with or through any
broker-dealer that is an affiliated person of the
Manager or of the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser except in
compliance with all applicable regulations of the
Commission and the applicable policies and procedures
of the Trust governing such transactions.
Section 10. Expenses of the Fund(s). All of the
ordinary business expenses incurred in the operations
of the Fund(s) and the offering of their shares shall be
borne by the Fund(s) unless specifically provided
otherwise in this Agreement. These expenses borne by
the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage
commissions, taxes, legal, auditing or governmental
fees, the cost of preparing share certificates, custodian,
transfer agent and shareholder service agent costs,
expense of issue, sale, redemption and repurchase of
shares, expenses of registering and qualifying shares for
sale, expenses relating to trustees and shareholder
meetings, the cost of preparing and distributing reports
and notices to shareholders, the fees and other
expenses incurred by the Fund(s) in connection with
membership in investment company organizations and
the cost of printing copies of prospectuses and
statements of additional information distributed to the
Fund(s)' shareholders.
The Manager shall pay its own overhead
expenses in connection with the services to be provided
by it pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, the
Manager shall be responsible for reasonable out-ofpocket
costs and expenses incurred by the Adviser, the
Sub-Adviser or the Trust: (a) to amend the Trust's
registration statement (other than as part of a normal
annual updating of the registration statement) or
supplement the Fund(s)' prospectuses and/or
statement of additional information, and circulate the
same, solely to reflect a change in the personnel of the
Manager responsible for making investment decisions
in relation to the Fund(s); (b) to obtain shareholder
approval, if required, of a new sub-advisory agreement
as a result of a change in control (as such term in
defined in Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act) of the
Manager (which may include, without limitation, the
costs of preparing, printing and mailing a proxy
statement for the shareholder meeting and proxy
solicitation services, among others), or to otherwise
comply with the 1940 Act, the Securities Act, or any
other applicable statute, law, rule or regulation, as a
result of such change; or (c) to obtain Board approval of
a new sub-advisory agreement as a result of a change of
the type described in clause (b) if the Manager requests
that approval be sought at a special, as opposed to a
regularly scheduled, Board meeting.
Section 11. Compensation. As compensation
for the sub-advisory services provided under this
Agreement, the Adviser shall pay the Manager fees,
payable monthly, at the annual rates indicated on
Schedule A hereto, pro rated for partial periods based
on calendar days, as such Schedule may be amended or
supplemented from time to time. It is understood that
the Adviser shall be responsible for the Manager's fee
for its services hereunder, and the Manager agrees that
it shall have no claim against the Trust, the Fund(s) or
the Sub-Adviser with respect to compensation under
this Agreement.
Section 12. Standard of Care. The Trust and
Adviser and Sub-Adviser shall expect of the Manager,
and the Manager will give the Trust and the Adviser and
Sub-Adviser the benefit of, the Manager's best
judgment and efforts in rendering its services to the
Trust, and the Manager shall not be liable hereunder for
any mistake in judgment. In the absence of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless
disregard of obligations or duties hereunder on the part
of the Manager or any of its officers, directors,
employees or agents, the Manager shall not be subject
to liability to the Trust or to any shareholders in the
Trust for any act or omission in the course of, or
connected with, rendering services hereunder or for
any losses that may be sustained in the purchase,
holding or sale of any security.
Section 13. Non-Exclusivity. The services of the
Manager to the Sub-Adviser, the Adviser and the Trust
are not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Manager
shall be free to render investment advisory and
administrative or other services to others (including
other investment companies) and to engage in other
activities. It is understood and agreed that officers,
directors, managers, partners and members of the
Manager are not prohibited from engaging in any other
business activity or from rendering services to any other
person, or from serving as partners, officers, members,
managers, directors or trustees of any other firm or
trust, including other investment advisory companies.
Section 14. Records. The Manager shall, with
respect to the placing and allocation of brokerage
orders placed by it for the purchase and sale of portfolio
securities or other investment assets and other
portfolio transactions of the Fund(s) in the Manager
Portion, maintain or arrange for the maintenance of the
documents and records required to be maintained by
the Trust pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act
and other applicable law or regulation as well as trade
tickets and confirmations of portfolio trades and such
other records as the Adviser or the Fund(s)'
Administrator reasonably requests to be maintained.
All such records shall be maintained in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Fund(s) and in compliance
with the provisions of Rule 31a-1 or any successor rule
or other applicable law or regulation. The Manager
shall prepare and maintain, or cause to be prepared and
maintained, in such form, for such periods and in such
locations as may be required by applicable law, any and
all other documents and records relating to the services
provided by the Manager pursuant to this Agreement
required to be prepared and maintained by the Trust
pursuant to the rules and regulations of any national,
state, or local government entity with jurisdiction over
the Trust, including the Commission and the Internal
Revenue Service of the U.S. Department of Treasury. All
such records will be the property of the Trust, and will

prevailing in each country in which the Manager Portion
of the Fund(s) maintains investments. At the request of

review draft shareholder reports and annual updates to
prospectuses and other documents and provide timely

and the Trust of any legal process served upon it in
connection with its activities hereunder, including any
legal process served upon it on behalf of the Adviser,

actions or other legal proceedings relating to the
holdings (historical and/or current) of the Fund(s).

Section 6. Control by Board. As is the case
with respect to the Adviser under the Advisory
Agreement, and the Sub-Adviser under the Sub-
Advisory Agreement, any investment activities
undertaken by the Manager pursuant to this
Agreement, as well as any other activities undertaken
by the Manager on behalf of the Fund(s), shall at all
times be subject to the direction and control of the
Trust's Board.
Section 7. Compliance with Applicable
Requirements. In carrying out its obligations under this
Agreement, the Manager shall at all times comply with:
(a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act
and the Advisers Act, and any rules and regulations
adopted thereunder;
(b) the provisions of the registration
statement of the Trust, as it may be amended or
supplemented from time to time, under the Securities
Act and the 1940 Act;
(c) the provisions of the Declaration of
Trust of the Trust, as it may be amended or
supplemented from time to time;
(d) the provisions of any By-laws of the
Trust, if adopted and as it may be amended from time
to time, resolutions of the Board as may be adopted
from time to time, the applicable provisions of written
guidelines, policies and procedures adopted by the
Trust or the Board, and the Investment Guidelines;
(e) the provisions of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, applicable to the
Trust or the Fund(s); and
(f) any other applicable provisions of state
or federal law.
For purposes of clarification and without
limiting the foregoing, the parties agree that the
obligations of the Manager with respect to the
foregoing will not require the Manger to comply with
such provisions of law that apply specifically to the
management of the Fund(s)' assets or operation of the
Fund(s) as a whole and not individually to the Manager
Portion.
In addition, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Manager agrees that: (i) any code of
ethics adopted by the Manager must comply with Rule
17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the
Advisers Act, as they may be amended from time to
time, and, if requested by the Trust, the Adviser or the
Sub-Adviser, any practices regarding personal investing
as may be set out in any interpretive release or
guidance issued by the Commission or its staff, (ii) the
Adviser and the Trust may disclose Fund(s) portfolio
holdings information (including with respect to the
Manager Portion) in accordance with the Trust's policies
and procedures governing the disclosure of Fund(s)
portfolio holdings, as amended or supplemented from
time to time, and as required by applicable law or as
otherwise provided hereunder, and (iii) the Manager
will not use, nor will it seek to obtain, material nonpublic
information concerning portfolio companies in
connection with performing its duties hereunder.
Section 8. Proxies. The Adviser shall have responsibility
to vote proxies solicited with respect to issuers of
securities in which assets of the Manager Portion of the
Fund(s) are invested from time to time in accordance
with the Trust's policies on proxy voting. The Manager
will provide, when requested by the Adviser,
information on a particular issuer to assist the Adviser
in the voting of a proxy.
Section 9. Broker-Dealer Relationships. The
Manager is responsible for the purchase and sale of
securities for the Manager Portion of the Fund(s),
broker-dealer selection, and negotiation of brokerage
commission rates. The Manager's primary
consideration in effecting a security transaction will be
to obtain the best price and execution under the
circumstances. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute
each particular transaction for the Manager Portion of
the Fund(s), the Manager will consider such factors it
considers to be relevant to the transaction, which are
expected to include, among other things: the best net
price available, the reliability, integrity and financial
condition of the broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty
in executing the order; and the value of the expected
contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund(s) on a
continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund(s)
in any transaction may be less favorable than that
available from another broker-dealer if the Manager
determines in good faith that the difference is
reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio
execution services offered. Subject to such policies as
the Board may from time to time determine, the
Manager shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully
or to have breached any duty created by this
Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having
caused the Fund(s) with respect to the Manager Portion
to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and
research services to the Manager an amount of
commission for effecting a portfolio investment
transaction in excess of the amount of commission
another broker or dealer would have charged for
effecting that transaction, if the Manager determines in
good faith that such amount of commission was
reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and
research services provided by such broker or dealer,
viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or
the overall responsibilities of the Manager with respect
to the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) and to other
clients of the Manager. The Manager is further
authorized to allocate the orders placed by it on behalf
of the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) to brokers and
dealers who provide brokerage and research services
within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith.
Such allocation shall be in such amounts and
proportions as the Manager shall determine and the
Manager will report on said allocations regularly to the
Board, indicating the brokers to whom such allocations
have been made and the basis therefor.
Provided the investment objective of the Fund(s) is
adhered to, the Manager may aggregate sales and
purchase orders of securities for the Manager Portion of
the Fund(s) with similar orders being made at
approximately the same time for other portfolios
managed by the Manager, if, in the Manager's
reasonable judgment, such aggregation is conducted in
a manner reasonably determined in good faith by the
Manager to be fair and equitable to the Fund(s) over
time. In accounting for such aggregated order, price
and commission shall be averaged on a per bond or
share basis daily. The Trust and the Adviser
acknowledge that the Manager's determination of such
economic benefit to the Fund(s) may be based on an
evaluation that the Fund(s) is benefited by relatively
better purchase or sales price, lower commission
expenses and beneficial timing of transactions, the
Manager's fiduciary duty to fairly allocate trading
opportunities among its clients, or a combination of
these and other factors. The allocation of securities so
purchased or sold shall be made by the Manager in the
manner that the Manager considers to be most
equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to
the Fund(s) and other clients. The Manager represents
and acknowledges that it is solely responsible for
complying, and agrees that it shall comply, with any and
all applicable pronouncements of the Commission or its
staff with respect to the requirements for aggregating
trades as may be set out in any interpretive release
and/or no-action letters issued by the Commission or its
staff. The Manager shall not be responsible for any acts
or omissions by any broker or dealer, provided that the
Manager did not act with gross negligence or willful
misconduct in the selection of such broker or dealer.
The Manager shall not engage in any transactions for
the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) with or through any
broker-dealer that is an affiliated person of the
Manager or that the Adviser or Sub-Adviser has
communicated to the Manager in writing is an affiliated
person of the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser, in each case
except in compliance with all applicable regulations of
the Commission and the applicable policies and
procedures of the Trust governing such transactions.
For purposes of the preceding sentence affilated"
"6849","person shall be interepreted in accordance with the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
Section 10. Expenses of the Fund(s). All of the
ordinary business expenses incurred in the operations

and expenses incurred by the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser
or the Trust: (a) to amend the Trust's registration
statement (other than as part of a normal annual
updating of the registration statement) or supplement
the Fund(s)' prospectuses and/or statement of
additional information, and circulate the same, solely to
reflect a change in the personnel of the Manager
responsible for making investment decisions in relation
to the Fund(s); or (b) to obtain shareholder approval of
a new sub-advisory agreement solely as a result of a
change in control (as such term in defined in Section
2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act) of the Manager (which may
include, without limitation, the costs of preparing,
printing and mailing a proxy statement for the
shareholder meeting and proxy solicitation services,
among others), or to otherwise comply with the 1940
Act, the Securities Act, or any other applicable statute,
law, rule or regulation, as a result of such change.
Section 11. Compensation. As compensation
for the sub-advisory services provided under this
Agreement, the Adviser shall pay the Manager fees,
payable monthly, at the annual rates indicated on
Schedule A hereto, as such Schedule may be amended
or supplemented from time to time. It is understood
that the Adviser shall be responsible for the Manager's
fee for its services hereunder, and the Manager agrees
that it shall have no claim against the Trust, the Fund(s)
or the Sub-Adviser with respect to compensation under
this Agreement.
Section 12. Standard of Care. The Trust and
Adviser and Sub-Adviser shall expect of the Manager,

Sub-Adviser the benefit of, the Manager's reasonable
best judgment and efforts in rendering its services to
the Trust, and the Manager shall not be liable
hereunder for any mistake in judgment. In the absence
of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or
reckless disregard of obligations or duties hereunder on
the part of the Manager or any of its officers, directors,

to liability to the Trust or to any shareholders in the
Trust for any act or omission in the course of, or
connected with, rendering services hereunder or for
any losses that may be sustained in the purchase,
holding or sale of any security.
Section 13. Non-Exclusivity. The services of the
Manager to the Sub-Adviser, the Adviser and the Trust
are not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Manager
shall be free to render investment advisory and
administrative or other services to others (including
other investment companies) and to engage in other
activities. It is understood and agreed that officers or
directors of the Manager are not prohibited from
engaging in any other business activity or from
rendering services to any other person, or from serving
as partners, officers, directors or trustees of any other
firm or trust, including other investment advisory
companies.
Section 14. Records. The Manager shall, with

Section 3. Duties and Representations and
Warranties of the Manager.
(a) The Manager shall make decisions with
respect to all purchases and sales of securities and
other investment assets for the Manager Portion of the
Fund(s). To carry out such decisions, the Manager is
hereby authorized, as agent and attorney-in-fact for the
Trust, for the account of, at the risk of and in the name
of the Trust, to place orders and issue instructions with
respect to those transactions of the Fund(s) with
respect to the Manager Portion thereof. In all
purchases, sales and other transactions in securities and
other investment assets for the Manager Portion of the
Fund(s), the Manager is authorized to exercise full
discretion and act for the Trust in the same manner and
with the same force and effect as the Trust might or
could do with respect to such purchases, sales or other
transactions, as well as with respect to all other things
necessary or incidental to the furtherance or conduct of
such purchases, sales or other transactions.
(b) The Manager acknowledges that the
Fund(s) and other mutual funds advised by the Adviser
(collectively, the fund complex) may engage in
transactions with certain sub-advisers or other
managers in the fund complex (and their affiliated
persons) in reliance on exemptions under Rule 10f-3,
Rule 12d3-1, Rule 17a-10 and Rule 17e-1 under the
1940 Act. Accordingly, the Manager hereby agrees that
it will not consult with any other sub-adviser or
manager of a fund in the fund complex, or an affiliated
person of a sub-adviser or manager, concerning
transactions for a fund in securities or other fund
assets. With respect to a multi-managed Fund(s), the
Manager shall be limited to managing only the Manager
Portion as may be determined from time-to-time by the
Board, the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser, and shall not
consult with another manager as to any other portion of
the Fund(s)' portfolio concerning transactions for the
Fund(s) in securities or other Fund assets.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be
deemed to prohibit consultations between (i) a
Manager that is not an affiliated person of the Adviser
or the Sub-Adviser and a sub-adviser or manager that is
an affiliated person of the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser or
(ii) a Manager that is an affiliated person of the Adviser
or Sub-Adviser and any other sub-adviser or manager.
(c) The Manager will provide information
and reports to the Adviser and/or the Sub-Adviser at
their reasonable request, and, upon request, to the
Board at a meeting thereof, concerning all material
changes in the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) since the
prior report, and will also keep the Adviser and/or the
Sub-Adviser, and, upon request, the Board informed of
important developments affecting the Trust, the
Manager Portion of the Fund(s). At the request of the
Adviser or the Sub-Adviser, the Manager shall review
draft shareholder reports and annual updates to
prospectuses and other documents and provide timely
comments thereon. The Manager will also furnish the
Adviser and/or the Sub-Adviser, and upon request, the
Board with such statistical and analytical information
with respect to securities or other assets in the
Manager Portion of the Fund(s) as the Board, the
Adviser or the Sub-Adviser reasonably may request. In
making purchases and sales of securities for the
Manager Portion of the Fund(s), the Manager will
comply with the provisions, policies, restrictions and
other requirements set forth in Section 7 of this
Agreement, and the investment objectives, policies and
restrictions of the Fund(s).
(d) The Manager shall promptly notify the
Adviser and the Sub-Adviser (i) of any changes regarding
the Manager that would reasonably be expected to
impact disclosure in the Trust's Registration Statement,
including, without limitation, any change in the
personnel of the Manager responsible for making
investment decisions for the Fund(s), (ii) of any material
violation of any requirement, provision, policy or
restriction that the Manager is required to comply with
under Section 7 of this Agreement, and (iii) upon
Manager becoming aware that it is, or likely may
become, subject to any statutory disqualification
pursuant to Section 9 of the 1940 Act or any other
event otherwise that prevents the Manager from
performing its duties pursuant to this Agreement. The
Manager shall notify the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser of
any change in control (as such term in defined in
Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act) of the Manager
promptly after the reasonable possibility of such event
becomes known to Manager. The Manager shall, as
soon as reasonably practicable, notify the Adviser, the
Sub-Adviser and the Trust of any legal process served
upon it in connection with its activities hereunder,
including any legal process served upon it on behalf of
the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser, the Fund(s) or the Trust.
The Manager shall reasonably cooperate with the
Fund(s)' custodian (Custodian) in the Custodian's
processing of class actions or other legal proceedings
relating to the holdings (historical and/or current) of the
Fund(s). The Manager shall not be required to compile
or file claims or take any related actions on behalf of the
Trust in any class action, bankruptcy or other legal
proceeding related to securities currently or previously
held by the Trust, but shall provide reasonable
assistance to the Adviser in connection with such
matters.
(e) The Manager shall supervise and
monitor the activities of its representatives, personnel
and agents in connection with the execution of its
duties and obligations hereunder. The appropriate
personnel of the Manager will be made available to
consult with the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser, the Trust and
the Board at reasonable times and upon reasonable
notice concerning the Manager's performance of
services hereunder or any other aspect of the business
of the Trust and the Fund(s). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, appropriate personnel of
the Manager will assist the Adviser and/or the Board in
the valuation of securities or other investment assets
held within the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) in
accordance with the Trust's Procedures for the
Valuation of Portfolio Securities.
(f) The Manager is not authorized to subcontract
or otherwise delegate any of the services
contemplated hereby to any other person without the
prior written consent of the Trust, the Adviser and the
Sub-Adviser, which consent may be withheld for any
reason. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Manager
may: (i) from time to time employ or sub-contract the
services of certain persons as the Manager believes to
be appropriate or necessary to assist in the execution of
the Manager's duties hereunder (other than the
provision of investment advice to the Fund(s)), and (ii)
utilize the personnel of its foreign affiliates to assist it
with providing its services under this Agreement
consistent with the guidance issued by the staff of the
Commission relating to participating affiliates;
provided, however, that the employment or association
with any such person shall not relieve the Manager of
its responsibilities or liabilities hereunder and the
Manager will remain solely responsible for the provision
of services under this Agreement, and the cost of
performance of such duties shall be borne and paid
solely by the Manager and no obligation may be
imposed on the Trust in any such respect. Any other
attempt to sub-contract or delegate any such services
without such consent shall be invalid.
(g) The Manager represents and warrants
to the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser and the Trust that: (i)
the Manager is registered as an investment adviser
under the Advisers Act and is registered or licensed as
an investment adviser under the laws of all jurisdictions
in which its activities require it to be so registered or
licensed; (ii) the Manager is duly organized and validly
existing and has requisite power and authority to enter
into and perform its obligations under this Agreement;
and (iii) the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Manager has been duly authorized by
appropriate action of the Manager.
Section 4. Delivery of Documents to the Manager. The

of its duties hereunder.
The Manager shall furnish the Adviser or the Sub-
Adviser with written certifications, in such form as the

that it has received and reviewed the most recent
version of the foregoing documents provided by the
Adviser or the Sub-Adviser and that it will comply with
such documents in the performance of its obligations
under this Agreement.
Section 5. Delivery of Documents to the Adviser and

following documents:

In addition, the Manager will furnish the Adviser and

examination of the Manager by the Commission or
other regulatory agency with respect to the Manager's
investment management activities.
The Manager will furnish the Adviser and the Sub-
Adviser with all such documents as soon as practicable
after such documents become available, to the extent
that such documents have been changed materially.
The Manager shall furnish the Adviser and the Sub-
Adviser with any further documents, materials or
information as the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser may
reasonably request in connection with the Manager's
performance of its duties under this Agreement,
including, but not limited to, information regarding the
Manager's financial condition, level of insurance
coverage, code of ethics compliance, conflict mitigation
practices, and any certifications or sub-certifications
which may reasonably be requested in connection with
Fund(s) registration statements, Form N-CSR filings or
other regulatory filings, and in connection with the
consideration of the continuation of this Agreement for
approval as set forth in Section 15 hereof.
Section 6. Control by Board. As is the case
with respect to the Adviser under the Advisory
Agreement, and the Sub-Adviser under the Sub-
Advisory Agreement, any investment activities
undertaken by the Manager pursuant to this
Agreement, as well as any other activities undertaken
by the Manager on behalf of the Fund(s), shall at all
times be subject to the direction and control of the
Trust's Board.
Section 7. Compliance with Applicable
Requirements. In carrying out its obligations under this
Agreement, the Manager shall at all times comply with:
(a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act
and the Advisers Act, and any rules and regulations
adopted thereunder;
(b) the provisions of the registration
statement of the Trust, as it may be amended or
supplemented from time to time, under the Securities
Act and the 1940 Act provided that the Manager has
had an opportunity to review the description of its
activities under this Agreement;
(c) the provisions of the Declaration of
Trust of the Trust, as it may be amended or
supplemented from time to time;
(d) the provisions of any By-laws of the
Trust, if adopted and as it may be amended from time
to time, resolutions of the Board as may be adopted
from time to time, the applicable provisions of written
guidelines, policies and procedures adopted by the
Trust or the Board, and the Investment Guidelines;
(e) the provisions of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code),
applicable to the Trust or the Fund(s); and
(f) any other applicable provisions of state
or federal law.
For purposes of clarification and without
limiting the foregoing, the parties agree that the
obligations of the Manager with respect to the
foregoing will not require the Manger to comply with
such provisions of law (including the income and
diversification provisions of Subchapter M of the Code)
that apply specifically to the management of the
Fund(s)' assets or operation of the Fund(s) as a whole
and not individually to the Manager Portion.
In addition, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Manager agrees that: (i) any code of
ethics adopted by the Manager must comply with Rule
17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the
Advisers Act, as they may be amended from time to
time, and, if requested by the Trust, the Adviser or the
Sub-Adviser, any practices regarding personal investing
as may be set out in any interpretive release or
guidance issued by the Commission or its staff, (ii) the
Adviser and the Trust may disclose Fund(s) portfolio
holdings information (including with respect to the
Manager Portion) in accordance with the Trust's policies
and procedures governing the disclosure of Fund(s)
portfolio holdings, as amended or supplemented from
time to time, and as required by applicable law or as
otherwise provided hereunder, and (iii) the Manager
will not use, nor will it seek to obtain, material nonpublic
information concerning portfolio companies in
connection with performing its duties hereunder.
Section 8. Proxies. The Manager shall not have
responsibility to vote proxies solicited with respect to
issuers of securities in which assets of the Manager
Portion of the Fund(s) are invested; however, the
Manager will provide, when requested by the Adviser,
information on a particular issuer to assist the Adviser
in the voting of a proxy.
Section 9. Broker-Dealer Relationships. The
Manager is responsible for the purchase and sale of
securities for the Manager Portion of the Fund(s),
broker-dealer selection, and negotiation of brokerage
commission rates. The Manager's primary
consideration in effecting a security transaction will be
to obtain the best price and execution under the
circumstances. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute
each particular transaction for the Manager Portion of
the Fund(s), the Manager will consider such factors it
considers to be relevant to the transaction, which are
expected to include, among other things: the best net
price available, the reliability, integrity and financial
condition of the broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty
in executing the order; and the value of the expected
contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund(s) on a
continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund(s)
in any transaction may be less favorable than that
available from another broker-dealer if the Manager
determines in good faith that the difference is
reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio
execution services offered. Subject to such policies as
the Board may from time to time determine, the
Manager shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully
or to have breached any duty created by this
Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having
caused the Fund(s) with respect to the Manager Portion
to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and
research services to the Manager an amount of
commission for effecting a portfolio investment
transaction in excess of the amount of commission
another broker or dealer would have charged for
effecting that transaction, if the Manager determines in
good faith that such amount of commission was
reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and
research services provided by such broker or dealer,
viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or
the overall responsibilities of the Manager with respect
to the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) and to other
clients of the Manager. The Manager is further
authorized to allocate the orders placed by it on behalf
of the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) to brokers and
dealers who provide brokerage and research services
within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith.
Such allocation shall be in such amounts and
proportions as the Manager shall determine and the
Manager will report on said allocations regularly to the
Board, indicating the brokers to whom such allocations
have been made and the basis therefor.
Provided the investment objective of the Fund(s) is
adhered to, the Manager may aggregate sales and
purchase orders of securities for the Manager Portion of
the Fund(s) with similar orders being made at
approximately the same time for other portfolios
managed by the Manager, if, in the Manager's
reasonable judgment, such aggregation will result in an
overall economic benefit to the Fund(s). In accounting
for such aggregated order, price and commission shall
be averaged on a per bond or share basis daily. The
Trust and the Adviser acknowledge that the Manager's
determination of such economic benefit to the Fund(s)
may be based on an evaluation that the Fund(s) is
benefited by relatively better purchase or sales price,
lower commission expenses and beneficial timing of
transactions, the Manager's fiduciary duty to fairly
allocate trading opportunities among its clients, or a
combination of these and other factors. The allocation
of securities so purchased or sold shall be made by the
Manager in the manner that the Manager considers to
be most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Fund(s) and other clients. The
Manager represents and acknowledges that it is solely
responsible for complying, and agrees that it shall
comply, with any and all applicable pronouncements of
the Commission or its staff with respect to the
requirements for aggregating trades as may be set out
in any interpretive release and/or no-action letters
issued by the Commission or its staff. The Manager
shall not be responsible for any acts or omissions by any
broker or dealer, provided that the Manager did not act
with negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of
such broker or dealer.
The Manager shall not engage in any transactions for
the Manager Portion of the Fund(s) with or through any
broker-dealer that is an affiliated person of the
Manager or of the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser except in
compliance with all applicable regulations of the
Commission and the applicable policies and procedures
of the Trust governing such transactions.
Section 10. Expenses of the Fund(s). All of the
ordinary business expenses incurred in the operations
of the Fund(s) and the offering of their shares shall be
borne by the Fund(s) unless specifically provided
otherwise in this Agreement. These expenses borne by
the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage
commissions, taxes, legal, auditing or governmental
fees, the cost of preparing share certificates, custodian,
transfer agent and shareholder service agent costs,
expense of issue, sale, redemption and repurchase of
shares, expenses of registering and qualifying shares for
sale, expenses relating to trustees and shareholder
meetings, the cost of preparing and distributing reports
and notices to shareholders, the fees and other
expenses incurred by the Fund(s) in connection with
membership in investment company organizations and
the cost of printing copies of prospectuses and
statements of additional information distributed to the
Fund(s)' shareholders.
The Manager shall pay its own expenses in
connection with the services to be provided by it
pursuant to this Agreement.
In addition, the Adviser (and not any other party to this
Agreement) shall be responsible for reasonable out-ofpocket
costs and expenses incurred by it, the Sub-
Adviser or the Trust: (a) to amend the Trust's
registration statement (other than as part of a normal
annual updating of the registration statement) or
supplement the Fund(s)' prospectuses and/or
statement of additional information, and circulate the
same, solely to reflect a change in the personnel of the
Manager responsible for making investment decisions
in relation to the Fund(s); or (b) to obtain shareholder
approval of a new sub-advisory agreement as a result of
a change in control (as such term in defined in Section
2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act) of the Manager (which may
include, without limitation, the costs of preparing,
printing and mailing a proxy statement for the
shareholder meeting and proxy solicitation services,
among others), or to otherwise comply with the 1940
Act, the Securities Act, or any other applicable statute,
law, rule or regulation, as a result of such change.
Section 11. Compensation. As compensation
for the sub-advisory services provided under this
Agreement, the Adviser shall pay the Manager fees,
payable monthly, at the annual rates indicated on
Schedule A hereto, as such Schedule may be amended
or supplemented from time to time. It is understood
that the Adviser shall be responsible for the Manager's
fee for its services hereunder, and the Manager agrees
that it shall have no claim against the Trust, the Fund(s)
or the Sub-Adviser with respect to compensation under
this Agreement.
Section 12. Standard of Care. The Trust and
Adviser and Sub-Adviser shall expect of the Manager,
and the Manager will give the Trust and the Adviser and
Sub-Adviser the benefit of, the Manager's best
judgment and efforts in rendering its services to the
Trust, and the Manager shall not be liable hereunder for
any mistake in judgment. In the absence of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless
disregard of obligations or duties hereunder on the part
of the Manager or any of its officers, directors,
employees or agents, the Manager shall not be subject
to liability to the Trust or to any shareholders in the
Trust for any act or omission in the course of, or
connected with, rendering services hereunder or for
any losses that may be sustained in the purchase,
holding or sale of any security.
Section 13. Non-Exclusivity. The services of the

applicable Manager Investment Guidelines, the Fund(s)'
investment objective, policies and strategies, any
Investment Guidelines applicable to the Fund(s) and the
Manager's portfolio management duties set forth in
Section 2 of its Manager Sub-Advisory Agreement. The
Sub-Adviser's performance of the foregoing across all
Manager Portions in total (including any Manager
Portion managed directly by the Sub-Adviser) shall be
conducted in compliance with the provisions, policies,
restrictions and other requirements set forth in Section
7 of this Agreement, provided that the Sub-Adviser shall
not be responsible for overseeing the adherence, by the
Fund(s) in total, with the diversification and income

reasonable times and upon reasonable notice
concerning the Sub-Adviser's performance of services
hereunder or any other aspect of the business of the

validly existing and has requisite power and authority to

direction and control of the Trust's Board.
Section 7. Compliance with Applicable
Requirements. In carrying out its obligations under this
Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall at all times comply in
all material respects with:
(a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act
and the Advisers Act, and any rules and regulations
adopted thereunder;
(b) the applicable provisions of the
registration statement of the Trust, as it may be
amended or supplemented from time to time, under
the Securities Act and the 1940 Act;
(c) the resolutions of the Board as may be adopted

guidelines, policies and procedures adopted by the
Trust or the Board, and the Investment Guidelines (in all
cases, only to the extent not inconsistent with the
services required to be provided by the Sub-Adviser
under this Agreement (except as to the provisions of
this Section 7(c)); provided that the Sub-Adviser shall
not be required to comply with any such resolutions or
documents until delivered to the Sub-Adviser; and
(d) any other applicable provisions of state
or federal law.
In addition, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Sub-Adviser agrees that: (i) any code
of ethics adopted by the Sub-Adviser must comply with
Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under
the Advisers Act, as they may be amended from time to
time, and, if requested by the Trust or the Adviser, any
practices regarding personal investing as may be set out
in any interpretive release or guidance issued by the
Commission or its staff, (ii) the Adviser and the Trust
may disclose Fund(s) portfolio holdings information in
accordance with the Trust's policies and procedures
governing the disclosure of Fund(s) portfolio holdings,
as amended or supplemented from time to time, and as
required by applicable law or as otherwise provided
hereunder, and (iii) the Sub-Adviser will not use, nor will
it seek to obtain, material non-public information
concerning portfolio companies in connection with
performing its duties hereunder.
Section 8. Proxies. The Adviser shall have responsibility
to vote proxies solicited with respect to issuers of
securities in which assets of the Fund(s) are invested
from time to time in accordance with the Trust's
policies on proxy voting. The Sub-Adviser will provide,
when reasonably requested by the Adviser, information
it has or can obtain without unreasonable burden or
expense from the responsible Manager(s) on a
particular issuer to assist the Adviser in the voting of a
proxy.
Section 9. Broker-Dealer Relationships. The
Managers are responsible for the purchase and sale of
securities for the Fund(s), broker-dealer selection, and
negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The parties
hereto shall ensure that each Manager Sub-Advisory
Agreement shall provide that the Manager's primary
consideration in effecting a security transaction will be
to obtain the best price and execution under the
circumstances. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute
each particular transaction for the Fund(s), the parties
hereto shall ensure that each Manager Sub-Advisory
Agreement shall provide that the Manager will consider
such factors it considers to be relevant to the
transaction, which are expected to include, among
other things: the best net price available, the reliability,
integrity and financial condition of the broker-dealer;
the size of and difficulty in executing the order; and the
value of the expected contribution of the broker-dealer
to the Fund(s) on a continuing basis. Accordingly, the
price to the Fund(s) in any transaction may be less
favorable than that available from another brokerdealer
if the Manager determines in good faith that the
difference is reasonably justified by other aspects of the
portfolio execution services offered. Subject to such
policies as the Board may from time to time determine,
a Manager shall not be deemed to have acted
unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this
Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having
caused the Fund(s) to pay a broker or dealer that
provides brokerage and research services to the
Manager an amount of commission for effecting a
portfolio investment transaction in excess of the
amount of commission another broker or dealer would
have charged for effecting that transaction, if the
Manager determines in good faith that such amount of
commission was reasonable in relation to the value of
the brokerage and research services provided by such
broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that
particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of
the Manager with respect to the Fund(s) and to other
clients of the Manager. The Manager is further
authorized to allocate the orders placed by it on behalf
of the Fund(s) to brokers and dealers who provide
brokerage and research services within the meaning of
Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
in compliance therewith. Such allocation shall be in
such amounts and proportions as the Manager shall
determine and the Sub-Adviser will report on said
allocations regularly to the Board, indicating the brokers
to whom such allocations have been made and the basis
therefor. With respect to any Manager Portion as to
which the Sub-Adviser is acting as the Manager, the
Sub-Adviser shall be directly responsible for compliance
with all requirements of this Section 9. With respect to
any Manager Portion allocated to another Manager, the
Sub-Adviser shall be responsible for monitoring,
overseeing and reporting on compliance with all
requirements of this Section 9.
Provided the investment objective of the Fund(s) is
adhered to, the Sub-Adviser when acting as a Manager
may aggregate sales and purchase orders of securities
for the Fund(s) with similar orders being made at
approximately the same time for other portfolios
managed by the Sub-Adviser, if, in the Sub-Adviser's
reasonable judgment, such aggregation will result in an
overall economic benefit to the Fund(s). In accounting
for such aggregated order, price and commission shall
be averaged on a per bond or share basis daily. The
Trust and the Adviser acknowledge that the Sub-
Adviser's determination of such economic benefit to the
Fund(s) may be based on an evaluation that the Fund(s)
is benefited by relatively better purchase or sales price,
lower commission expenses and beneficial timing of
transactions, the Sub-Adviser's fiduciary duty to fairly
allocate trading opportunities among its clients, or a
combination of these and other factors. The allocation
of securities so purchased or sold shall be made by the
Sub-Adviser when acting as a Manager in the manner
that the Sub-Adviser considers to be most equitable and
consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund(s)
and other clients. The Sub-Adviser when acting as a
Manager represents and acknowledges that it is solely
responsible for complying, and agrees that it shall
comply, with any and all applicable pronouncements of
the Commission or its staff with respect to the
requirements for aggregating trades as may be set out
in any interpretive release and/or no-action letters
issued by the Commission or its staff. The Sub-Adviser
shall not be responsible for any acts or omissions by any
broker or dealer, provided that the Sub-Adviser did not
act with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the
selection of such broker or dealer.
The Sub-Adviser shall not engage in any transactions for
the Fund(s) with or through any broker-dealer that is an
affiliated person of the Sub-Adviser or of the Adviser
except in compliance with all applicable regulations of
the Commission and the applicable policies and
procedures of the Trust governing such transactions.
Section 10. Expenses of the Fund(s). All of the
ordinary business expenses incurred in the operations
of the Fund(s) and the offering of their shares shall be
borne by the Fund(s) unless specifically provided
otherwise in this Agreement. These expenses borne by
the Fund(s) include, but are not limited to, brokerage
commissions, taxes, legal, auditing or governmental
fees, the cost of preparing share certificates, custodian,
transfer agent and shareholder service agent costs,
expense of issue, sale, redemption and repurchase of
shares, expenses of registering and qualifying shares for
sale, expenses relating to trustees and shareholder
meetings, the cost of preparing and distributing reports
and notices to shareholders, the fees and other
expenses incurred by the Fund(s) in connection with
membership in investment company organizations and
the cost of printing copies of prospectuses and
statements of additional information distributed to the
Fund(s)' shareholders.
The Sub-Adviser shall pay its own expenses in
connection with the services to be provided by it
pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, the Sub-
Adviser (and not any other party to this Agreement)
shall be responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by it or the Trust: (a) to amend
the Trust's registration statement (other than as part of
a normal annual updating of the registration statement)
or supplement the Fund(s)' prospectuses and/or
statement of additional information, and circulate the
same, solely to reflect a change in the personnel of the
Sub-Adviser responsible for making investment
decisions in relation to the Fund(s); or (b) to obtain
shareholder approval of a new sub-advisory agreement
as a result of a change in control (as such term in
defined in Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act) of the Sub-
Adviser (which may include, without limitation, the
costs of preparing, printing and mailing a proxy
statement for the shareholder meeting and proxy
solicitation services, among others), or to otherwise
comply with the 1940 Act, the Securities Act, or any
other applicable statute, law, rule or regulation, as a
result of such change.
Section 11. Compensation. As compensation
for the sub-advisory services provided under this
Agreement, the Adviser shall pay the Sub-Adviser fees,
payable monthly, at the annual rates indicated on
Schedule A hereto, as such Schedule may be amended
or supplemented from time to time. It is understood
that the Adviser shall be responsible for the Sub-
Adviser's fee for its services hereunder, and the Sub-
Adviser agrees that it shall have no claim against the
Trust, the Fund(s) or the Sub-Adviser with respect to
compensation under this Agreement.
Section 12. Standard of Care. The Trust and the
Adviser shall expect of the Sub-Adviser, and the Sub-
Adviser will give the Trust and the Adviser the benefit
of, the Sub-Adviser's best judgment and efforts in
rendering its services to the Trust, and the Sub-Adviser
shall not be liable hereunder for any mistake in
judgment. In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad
faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of
obligations or duties hereunder on the part of the Sub-
Adviser or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents, the Sub-Adviser shall not be subject to liability
to the Trust or to any shareholders in the Trust for any
act or omission in the course of, or connected with,
rendering services hereunder or for any losses that may
be sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any
security. Notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement, and for avoidance of doubt, in the absence
of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or
reckless disregard of obligations or duties hereunder on
the part of the Sub-Adviser or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents (which shall not be
deemed to include any Manager), the Sub-Adviser shall
not be in violation of its standard of care under this
Agreement or be deemed to not have performed its
obligations hereunder solely by reason of a Manager's
non-performance, or violation of, any provision of its
Manager Sub Adviser Agreement, or by reason of the
Manager's violation of any applicable law or violation.
Section 13. Non-Exclusivity. The services of the
Sub-Adviser to the Adviser and the Trust are not to be
deemed to be exclusive, and the Sub-Adviser shall be
free to render investment advisory and administrative
or other services to others (including other investment
companies) and to engage in other activities. It is
understood and agreed that officers or directors of the
Sub-Adviser are not prohibited from engaging in any
other business activity or from rendering services to any
other person, or from serving as partners, officers,
directors or trustees of any other firm or trust, including
other investment advisory firms.
Section 14. Records. The Sub-Adviser when
acting as a Manager shall, with respect to the placing
and allocation of brokerage orders placed by it for the
purchase and sale of portfolio securities or other
investment assets and other portfolio transactions of
the Fund(s), maintain or arrange for the maintenance of
the documents and records required to be maintained
by the Trust pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act
and other applicable law or regulation as well as trade
tickets and confirmations of portfolio trades and such
other records as the Adviser or the Fund(s)'
Administrator reasonably requests to be maintained.
All such records shall be maintained in a form
acceptable to the Fund(s) and in compliance with the
provisions of Rule 31a-1 or any successor rule or other
applicable law or regulation. The Sub-Adviser shall
prepare and maintain, or cause to be prepared and
maintained, in such form, for such periods and in such
locations as may be required by applicable law, any and
all other documents and records relating to the services
provided by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this
Agreement required to be prepared and maintained by
the Trust pursuant to the rules and regulations of any
national, state, or local government entity with
jurisdiction over the Trust, including the Commission
and the Internal Revenue Service of the Department of
Treasury. All such records will be the property of the
Trust, and will be available for inspection and use by the
Trust and its authorized representatives (including the
Adviser) at all times during the Sub-Adviser's normal
business hours. The Sub-Adviser shall promptly, upon
the request of the Trust or the Trust's authorized
representatives (including the Adviser), surrender and
deliver to the Fund(s) those records which are the
property of the Trust or any Fund(s). The Sub-Adviser
will promptly notify the Fund(s)' Administrator if it
experiences any difficulty in maintaining the records in
an accurate and complete manner.

Materials to the Sub-Adviser (via email at an address
designated by the Sub-Adviser from time to time), for

accepted by the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser agrees
that the Fund(s) and the Adviser may request that the
Sub-Adviser approve the use of a type of Marketing
Material, and if approved by the Sub-Adviser, that the
Fund(s) and the Sub-Adviser need not obtain approval
for each additional piece of Marketing Material that is
of substantially the same type or form, unless such
consent is withdrawn in writing by the Sub-Adviser.

                              AMENDED AND RESTATED
                        INVESTMENT SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT
                         AMONG WELLS FARGO FUNDS TRUST,
                      WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT, LLC AND
                      WELLS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT INCORPORATED

This AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT is made as
of this 1st day of March 2001, as amended and restated as of November 7,
2012, between Wells Fargo Funds Trust (the Trust), a business trust
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware with its principal place
of business at 525 Market Street, 12th Floor, San Francisco, California
94163, Wells Fargo Funds Management, LLC (the Adviser), a limited
liability company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware with

a corporation organized under the laws of the State of California, with its
principal place of business at 525 Market Street, 12th Floor, San
Francisco, California 94163 (the Sub-Adviser).

WHEREAS, the Trust is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the 1940 Act) as an open-end,
series management investment company; and

WHEREAS, the Trust and the Adviser desire that the Sub-Adviser
perform investment advisory services for each of the series of the Trust
listed in Appendix A hereto as it may be amended from time to time (each
a Fund and collectively the Funds), and the Sub-Adviser is willing to
perform those services on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

NOW THEREFORE, the Trust, the Adviser and Sub-Adviser
agrees as follows:

Section 1. The Trust; Delivery of Documents. The Trust is
engaged in the business of investing and reinvesting its assets in securities
of the type and in accordance with the limitations specified in its
Declaration of Trust, as amended or supplemented from time to time, By-
Laws (if any) and Registration Statement filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the Commission) under the 1940 Act and the
Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act), including any
representations made in the prospectus and statement of additional
information relating to the Funds contained therein and as may be
supplemented from time to time, all in such manner and to such extent as
may from time to time be authorized by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the
Board). The Board is authorized to issue any unissued shares in any
number of additional classes or series. The Trust has delivered copies of
the documents listed in this Section to the Sub-Adviser and will from time
to time furnish the Sub-Adviser with any amendments thereof.

Section 2. Appointment of Sub-Adviser. Subject to the direction
and control of the Board, the Adviser manages the investment and
reinvestment of the assets of the Funds and provides for certain
management and services as specified in the Investment Advisory
Agreement between the Trust and the Adviser with respect to the Funds.

Subject to the direction and control of the Board, the Sub-Adviser
shall manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets of the Funds,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall provide the
management and other services specified below, all in such manner and to
such extent as may be directed from time to time by the Adviser.

The Sub-Adviser acknowledges that the Fund and other mutual
funds advised by the Adviser (collectively, the fund complex) may
engage in transactions with certain sub-advisers in the fund complex (and
their affiliated persons) in reliance on exemptions under Rule 10f-3, Rule
12d3-1, Rule 17a-10 and Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act. Accordingly,
the Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that it will not consult with any other
subadviser of a fund in the fund complex that is not an affiliated person (as
that term is defined in the 1940 Act) of Wells Fargo & Company (Wells"
"6857","Fargo), or an affiliated person of such a sub-adviser, concerning
transactions for a fund in securities or other fund assets. With respect to a
multi-managed Fund, the Sub-Adviser shall be limited to managing only
the discrete portion of the Fund's portfolio as may be determined from
time-to-time by the Board or the Adviser, and shall not consult with the
any Sub-adviser that is not an affiliated person of Wells Fargo as to any
other portion of the Fund's portfolio concerning transactions for the Fund
in securities or other Fund assets.

Section 3. Duties of the Sub-Adviser.

(a) The Sub-Adviser shall make decisions with respect to all
purchases and sales of securities and other investment assets for the Funds.
To carry out such decisions, the Sub-Adviser is hereby authorized, as
agent and attorney-in-fact for the Trust, for the account of, at the risk of
and in the name of the Trust, to place orders and issue instructions with
respect to those transactions of the Funds. In all purchases, sales and other
transactions in securities for the Funds, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to
exercise full discretion and act for the Trust in the same manner and with
the same force and effect as the Trust might or could do with respect to
such purchases, sales or other transactions, as well as with respect to all
other things necessary or incidental to the furtherance or conduct of such
purchases, sales or other transactions.

(b) The Sub-Adviser will report to the Board at each regular
meeting thereof all material changes in the Funds since the prior report, and
will also keep the Board informed of important developments affecting the
Trust, the Funds and the Sub-Adviser, and on its own initiative will furnish
the Board from time to time with such information as the Sub-Adviser may
believe appropriate, whether concerning the individual companies whose
securities are held by a Fund, the industries in which they engage, or the
economic, social or political conditions prevailing in each country in which
the Fund maintains investments. The Sub-Adviser will also furnish the Board
with such statistical and analytical information with respect to securities in
the Funds as the Sub-Adviser may believe appropriate or as the Board reasonably
may request. In making purchases and sales of securities for the Funds, the
Sub-Adviser will comply with the policies set from time to time by the Board
as well as the limitations imposed by the Trust's Declaration of Trust, as
amended from time to time, By-Laws (if any), Registration Statement under
the Act and the Securities Act, the limitations in the Act and in the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended applicable to the Trust and the investment
objectives, policies and restrictions of the Funds.

(c) The Sub-Adviser may from time to time employ or associate
with such persons as the Sub-Adviser believes to be appropriate or
necessary to assist in the execution of the Sub-Adviser's duties hereunder,
the cost of performance of such duties to be borne and paid by the Sub-
Adviser. No obligation may be imposed on the Trust in any such respect.

(d) The Sub-Adviser shall maintain records relating to portfolio
transactions and the placing and allocation of brokerage orders as are
required to be maintained by the Trust under the Act. The Sub-Adviser
shall prepare and maintain, or cause to be prepared and maintained, in such
form, for such periods and in such locations as may be required by
applicable law, all documents and records relating to the services provided
by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement required to be prepared and
maintained by the Trust pursuant to the rules and regulations of any
national, state, or local government entity with jurisdiction over the Trust,
including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal
Revenue Service. The books and records pertaining to the Trust which are
in possession of the Sub-Adviser shall be the property of the Trust. The
Trust, or the Trust's authorized representatives (including the Adviser), shall
have access to such books and records at all times during the Sub-Adviser's
normal business hours. Upon the reasonable request of the Trust, copies of
any such books and records shall be provided promptly by the Sub-Adviser
to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives.

Section 4. Control by Board. As is the case with respect to the
Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, any investment
activities undertaken by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, as
well as any other activities undertaken by the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the
Funds, shall at all times be subject to the direction and control the Trust's
Board.

Section 5. Compliance with Applicable Requirements. In
carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall at
all times comply with:

(a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and
regulations adopted thereunder;

(b) the provisions of the registration statement of the Trust, as
it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, under the
Securities Act and the 1940 Act;

(c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it
may be amended or supplemented from time to time;

(d) the provisions of any By-laws of the Trust, if adopted and
as it may be amended from time to time, or resolutions of the Board as
may be adopted from time to time;

(e) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, applicable to the Trust or the Funds;

(f) any other applicable provisions of state or federal law; and

In addition, any code of ethics adopted by the Sub-Adviser must
comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act, as it may be amended from
time to time, and any broadly accepted industry practices, if requested by
the Trust or the Adviser.

Section 6. Broker-Dealer Relationships. The Sub-Adviser is
responsible for the purchase and sale of securities for the Funds, brokerdealer
selection, and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Sub-
Adviser's primary consideration in effecting a security transaction will be
to obtain the best price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to
execute each particular transaction for a Fund, the Sub-Adviser will take
the following into consideration: the best net price available, the
reliability, integrity and financial condition of the broker-dealer; the size
of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value of the expected
contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing basis.
Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any transaction may be less
favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the difference is
reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio execution services
offered. Subject to such policies as the Trust's Board of Trustees may
from time to time determine, the Sub-Adviser shall not be deemed to have
acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this Agreement
or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a Fund to pay a broker or
dealer that provides brokerage and research services to the Sub-Adviser an
amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in
excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have
charged for effecting that transaction, if the Sub-Adviser determines in
good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to
the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker
or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the
overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund and to
other clients of the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser is further authorized to
allocate the orders placed by it on behalf of the Funds to brokers and
dealers who also provide research or statistical material, or other services
to the Funds or to the Sub-Adviser. Such allocation shall be in such
amounts and proportions as the Sub-Adviser shall determine and the Sub-
Adviser will report on said allocations regularly to the Board of Trustees
of the Trust indicating the brokers to whom such allocations have been
made and the basis therefor.

Section 7. Expenses of the Fund. All of the ordinary business
expenses incurred in the operations of the Funds and the offering of their
shares shall be borne by the Funds unless specifically provided otherwise
in this Agreement. These expenses borne by the Trust include, but are not
limited to, brokerage commissions, taxes, legal, auditing or governmental
fees, the cost of preparing share certificates, custodian, transfer agent and
shareholder service agent costs, expense of issue, sale, redemption and
repurchase of shares, expenses of registering and qualifying shares for
sale, expenses relating to trustees and shareholder meetings, the cost of
preparing and distributing reports and notices to shareholders, the fees and
other expenses incurred by the Funds in connection with membership in
investment company organizations and the cost of printing copies of
prospectuses and statements of additional information distributed to the
Funds' shareholders.

Section 8. Compensation. As compensation for the sub-advisory
services provided under this Agreement, the Adviser shall pay the Sub-
Adviser fees, payable monthly, the annual rates indicated on Schedule A
hereto, as such Schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to
time. It is understood that the Adviser shall be responsible for the Sub-
Adviser's fee for its services hereunder, and the Sub-Adviser agrees that it
shall have no claim against the Trust or the Funds with respect to
compensation under this Agreement.

Section 9. Standard of Care. The Trust and Adviser shall expect of
the Sub-Adviser, and the Sub-Adviser will give the Trust and the Adviser
the benefit of, the Sub-Adviser's best judgment and efforts in rendering its
services to the Trust, and as an inducement to the Sub-Adviser's
undertaking these services at the compensation level specified, the Sub-
Adviser shall not be liable hereunder for any mistake in judgment. In the
absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, negligence or reckless disregard
of obligations or duties hereunder on the part of the Sub-Adviser or any of
its officers, directors, employees or agents, the Sub-Adviser shall not be
subject to liability to the Trust or to any shareholders in the Trust for any
act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering services
hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding
or sale of any security.

Section 10. Non-Exclusivity. The services of the Sub-Adviser to
the Adviser and the Trust are not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the
Sub-Adviser shall be free to render investment advisory and
administrative or other services to others (including other investment
companies) and to engage in other activities. It is understood and agreed
that officers or directors of the Sub-Adviser are not prohibited from
engaging in any other business activity or from rendering services to any
other person, or from serving as partners, officers, directors or trustees of
any other firm or trust, including other investment advisory companies.

Section 11. Records. The Sub-Adviser shall, with respect to orders
the Sub-Adviser places for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities of
the Funds, maintain or arrange for the maintenance of the documents and
records required pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act as well as
trade tickets and confirmations of portfolio trades and such other records
as the Adviser or the Funds' Administrator reasonably requests to be
maintained. All such records shall be maintained in a form acceptable to
the Funds and in compliance with the provisions of Rule 31a-1 or any
successor rule. All such records will be the property of the Funds, and
will be available for inspection and use by the Funds and their authorized
representatives (including the Adviser). The Sub-Adviser shall promptly,
upon the Trust's request, surrender to the Funds those records which are
the property of the Trust or any Fund. The Sub-Adviser will promptly
notify the Funds' Administrator if it experiences any difficulty in
maintaining the records in an accurate and complete manner.

Section 12. Term and Approval. This Agreement shall become
effective with respect to a Fund after it is approved in accordance with the
express requirements of the 1940 Act, and executed by the Trust, Adviser
and Sub-Adviser and shall thereafter continue from year to year, provided
that the continuation of the Agreement is approved in accordance with the
requirements of the 1940 Act, which currently requires that the
continuation be approved at least annually:

(a) (i) by the Trust's Board of Trustees or (ii) by the vote of a"
"6858","majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund (as defined in
Section 2(a)(42) of the 1940 Act), and

(b) by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Trust's Trustees
who are not parties to this Agreement or interested persons (as defined
in the 1940 Act) of a party to this Agreement (other than as Trustees of the
Trust), by votes cast in person at a meeting specifically called for such
purpose.

Section 13. Termination. As required under the 1940 Act, this
Agreement may be terminated with respect to a Fund at any time, without
the payment of any penalty, by vote of the Trust's Board of Trustees or by
vote of a majority of a Fund's outstanding voting securities, or by the
Adviser or Sub-Adviser, on sixty (60) days written notice to the other
party. The notice provided for herein may be waived by the party entitled
to receipt thereof. This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the
event of its assignment, the term assignment for purposes of this
paragraph having the meaning defined in Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act,
as it may be interpreted by the Commission or its staff in interpretive
releases, or applied by the Commission staff in no-action letters, issued
under the 1940 Act.

Section 14. Indemnification by the Sub-Adviser. The Trust shall
not be responsible for, and the Sub-Adviser shall indemnify and hold the
Trust or any Fund of the Trust harmless from and against, any and all
losses, damages, costs, charges, counsel fees, payments, expenses and
liability arising out of or attributable to the willful misfeasance, bad faith,
negligent acts or reckless disregard of obligations or duties of the Sub-
Adviser or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents.

Section 15. Indemnification by the Trust. In the absence of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, negligence or reckless disregard of duties
hereunder on the part of the Sub-Adviser or any of its officers, directors,
employees or agents, the Trust hereby agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Sub-Adviser against all claims, actions, suits or proceedings
at law or in equity whether brought by a private party or a governmental
department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality of any
kind, arising from the advertising, solicitation, sale, purchase or pledge of
securities, whether of the Funds or other securities, undertaken by the
Funds, their officers, directors, employees or affiliates, resulting from any
violations of the securities laws, rules, regulations, statutes and codes,
whether federal or of any state, by the Funds, their officers, directors,
employees or affiliates. Federal and state securities laws impose liabilities
under certain circumstances on persons who act in good faith, and nothing
herein shall constitute a waiver or limitation of any rights which a Fund may
have and which may not be waived under any applicable federal and state
securities laws.

Section 16. Notices. Any notices under this Agreement shall be in
writing, addressed and delivered or mailed postage paid to the other party
at such address as such other party may designate for the receipt of such
notice. Until further notice to the other party, it is agreed that the address
of the Trust shall be 525 Market Street, 12th Floor, San Francisco,

Market Street, 10th Floor, San Francisco, California 94163, Attention: J.
Mari Casas.

Section 17. Questions of Interpretation. Any question of
interpretation of any term or provision of this Agreement having a
counterpart in or otherwise derived from a term or provision of the 1940
Act shall be resolved by reference to such terms or provision of the 1940
Act and to interpretations thereof, if any, by the United States Courts or in
the absence of any controlling decision of any such court, by rules,
regulations or orders of the Commission, or interpretations of the
Commission or its staff, or Commission staff no-action letters, issued
pursuant to the 1940 Act. In addition, where the effect of a requirement of
the 1940 Act or the Advisers Act reflected in any provision of this
Agreement is revised by rule, regulation or order of the Commission, such
provision shall be deemed to incorporate the effect of such rule, regulation
or order. The duties and obligations of the parties under this Agreement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of Delaware.

Section 18. Amendment. This Agreement supersedes the subadvisory
agreement among Wells Fargo Funds Trust, Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. and Wells Fargo Capital Management Incorporated dated November
8, 1999, as approved by the Board of Trustees on March 26, 1999 as
amended October 28, 1999, May 9, 2000 and July 25, 2000. No provision
of this Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated
orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against
which enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is
sought. If shareholder approval of an amendment is required under the
1940 Act, no such amendment shall become effective until approved by a
vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of the affected Funds.
Otherwise, a written amendment of this Agreement is effective upon the
approval of the Board of Trustees, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser.

Section 19. Wells Fargo Name. The Sub-Adviser and the Trust
each agree that the name Wells Fargo, which comprises a component of
the Trust's name, is a property right of the parent of the Adviser. The
Trust agrees and consents that: (i) it will use the words Wells Fargo as a
component of its corporate name, the name of any series or class, or all of
the above, and for no other purpose; (ii) it will not grant to any third party
the right to use the name Wells Fargo for any purpose; (iii) the Adviser
or any corporate affiliate of the Adviser may use or grant to others the
right to use the words Wells Fargo, or any combination or abbreviation
thereof, as all or a portion of a corporate or business name or for any
commercial purpose, other than a grant of such right to another registered
investment company not advised by the Adviser or one of its affiliates;
and (iv) in the event that the Adviser or an affiliate thereof is no longer
acting as investment adviser to any Fund or class of a Fund, the Trust
shall, upon request by the Adviser, promptly take such action as may be
necessary to change its corporate name to one not containing the words
Wells Fargo and following such change, shall not use the words Wells"
"6859","Fargo, or any combination thereof, as a part of its corporate name or for
any other commercial purpose, and shall use its best efforts to cause its
trustees, officers and shareholders to take any and all actions that the
Adviser may request to effect the foregoing and to reconvey to the Adviser
any and all rights to such words.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
Agreement to be executed in duplicate by their respective officers on the
day and year first written above.

FEE AGREEMENT
WELLS FARGO FUNDS TRUST

This fee agreement is made as of the 27th day of March, 2009, and
is amended as of the 14th day of August, 2013, by and between Wells
Fargo Funds Management, LLC (the Adviser) and Wells Capital
Management Incorporated (the Sub-Adviser); and

WHEREAS, the parties and Wells Fargo Funds Trust (the
Trust) have entered into an Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement (Sub-"
"6860","Advisory Agreement) whereby the Sub-Adviser provides investment
management advice to each series of the Trust as listed in Appendix A to
the Sub-Advisory Agreement (each a Fund and collectively the
Funds).

WHEREAS, the Sub-Advisory Agreement provides that the fees
to be paid to the Sub-Adviser are to be as agreed upon in writing by the
parties.

NOW THEREFORE, the parties agree that the fees to be paid to
the Sub-Adviser under the Sub-Advisory Agreement shall be calculated as
follows on a monthly basis by applying the annual rates described in this
Schedule A to Appendix A for each Fund listed in Appendix A.

The Sub-Adviser shall receive a fee as described in this Schedule A to
Appendix A of the assets of the Conservative Allocation Fund, Growth
Balanced Fund and Moderate Balanced Fund and from each WealthBuilder
Portfolio for providing services with respect to which Master Trust
Portfolios (or, in the case of the WealthBuilder Portfolios, other
unaffiliated funds) these Funds will invest in and the percentage to
allocate to each Master Portfolio or unaffiliated fund in reliance on
Section 12(d)(1)(G) under the Act, the rules thereunder, or order issued
by the Commission exempting the Fund from the provisions of Section
12(d)(1)(A) under the Act (a Fund of Funds structure).

The net assets under management against which the foregoing fees
are to be applied are the net assets as of the first business day of the
month. If this fee agreement becomes effective subsequent to the first day
of a month or shall terminate before the last day of a month, compensation
for that part of the month this agreement is in effect shall be subject to a
pro rata adjustment based on the number of days elapsed in the current
month as a percentage of the total number of days in such month. If the
determination of the net asset value is suspended as of the first business
day of the month, the net asset value for the last day prior to such
suspension shall for this purpose be deemed to be the net asset value on
the first business day of the month.
