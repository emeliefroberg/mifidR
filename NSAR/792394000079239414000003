"472","Certified Public Accountants"
"473","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"474","To the Board of Directors and the Shareholders of"
"475","Volumetric Fund, Inc."
"476","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of the"
"477"," Volumetric Fund, Inc., as of December 31, 2013 and for the year then"
"478","ended, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"479","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered internal control"
"480","over financial reporting, including control activities over safeguarding"
"481","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"482","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"483","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"484","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"485","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"486","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"487","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"488","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"489","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's"
"490","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"491","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"492","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"493","with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of"
"494","America (GAAP).  A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"495","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"496","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"497","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"498","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"499","preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that"
"500","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"501","with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)"
"502","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"503","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"504","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"505","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"506","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"507","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"508","become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of"
"509","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"510","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"511","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"512","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"513","or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"514","deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"515","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"516","material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial statements"
"517","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"518","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"519","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"520","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"521","material weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB.  However,"
"522","we noted the following matter concerning a control procedure and its"
"523","operation that we considered to be a material weakness as defined above."
"524","The semi-annual report for the period ended June 30, 2013  filed with the"
"525","Securities and Exchange Commission and mailed to shareholders did not meet"
"526","all the  requirements as prescribed by Regulation S-X and the instructions"
"527","to Form N-1A , Registration Form for Open-End Management Investment"
"528","Companies.  This material weakness was considered in determining  the"
"529","nature, timing,  and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the"
"530","financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, and"
"531","does not affect our report dated  February 19, 2014 on those financial"
"532","statements."
"533","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management,"
"534","the shareholders, and the Board of Directors of Volumetric Fund, Inc. and"
"535","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should"
"536","not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."
