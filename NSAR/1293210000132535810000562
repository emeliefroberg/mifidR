"3834","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"3835","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of"
"3836","American Century Asset Allocation Portfolios, Inc.:"
"3837","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"3838","American Century Asset Allocation Portfolios, Inc. (the &#147;Corporation&#148;),"
"3839","including One Choice Portfolio: Very Conservative, One Choice Portfolio:"
"3840","Conservative, One Choice Portfolio: Moderate, One Choice Portfolio: Aggressive,"
"3841","One Choice Portfolio: Very Aggressive, LIVESTRONG Income Portfolio,"
"3842","LIVESTRONG 2015 Portfolio, LIVESTRONG 2020 Portfolio, LIVESTRONG 2025 Portfolio,"
"3843","LIVESTRONG 2030 Portfolio, LIVESTRONG 2035 Portfolio, LIVESTRONG 2040 Portfolio,"
"3844","LIVESTRONG 2045 Portfolio and LIVESTRONG 2050 Portfolio, as of and for the year"
"3845","ended July 31, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"3846","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Corporation&#146;s"
"3847","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"3848","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"3849","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"3850","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"3851","on the effectiveness of the Corporation&#146;s internal control over financial"
"3852","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3853","The management of the Corporation is responsible for establishing and"
"3854","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"3855","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"3856","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"3857","A corporation&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"3858","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"3859","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"3860","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"3861","principles.  A corporation&#146;s internal control over financial reporting"
"3862","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"3863","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"3864","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation;"
"3865","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"3866","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"3867","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"3868","corporation are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"3869","management and directors of the corporation; and (3) provide reasonable"
"3870","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"3871","acquisition, use, or disposition of a corporation&#146;s assets that could"
"3872","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3873","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"3874","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"3875","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"3876","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"3877","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"3878","procedures may deteriorate."
"3879","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"3880","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"3881","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"3882","or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is"
"3883","a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"3884","over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"3885","that a material misstatement of the corporation&#146;s annual or interim"
"3886","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"3887","basis."
"3888","Our consideration of the Corporation&#146;s internal control over financial"
"3889","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"3890","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"3891","that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"3892","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"3893","we noted no deficiencies in the Corporation&#146;s internal control over"
"3894","financial reporting and its operation, including controls for"
"3895","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness"
"3896","as defined above, as of July 31, 2010."
"3897","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"3898","and the Board of Directors of American Century Asset Allocation Portfolios,"
"3899","Inc., and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be"

"4029","&#147;A Class&#148;, effective 03/01/10."
"4030","The Advisor Class shares of each fund were renamed A Class shares.  A Class"
"4031","shares have a front end sales charge (load).  However, the sales charge on"
"4032","A Class shares will be waived for purchases of additional shares in accounts"
"4033","that held shares of an Advisor Class fund prior to March 1, 2010."

"4037","Portfolio and LiveSTRONG Income Porfolio,, each a series of the Registrant"
"4038","(the corporation), began offering C Class during the period,"
"4039","effective 03/01/10."
"4040","    Each fund is a series of shares issued by the corporation, and shares"
"4041","of each fund have equal voting rights. In addition, each series (or fund)"
"4042","may be divided into separate classes. Additional funds and classes may be"
"4043","added without a shareholder vote. Each fund votes separately on matters"
"4044","affecting that fund exclusively. Voting rights are not cumulative, so that"
"4045","investors holding more than 50% of the corporation&#146;s (i.e.., all funds&#146;)"
"4046","outstanding shares may be able to elect a Board of Directors. The corporation"
"4047","undertakes dollar-based voting, meaning that the number of votes a shareholder"
"4048","is entitled to is based upon the dollar amount of the shareholder&#146;s investment."
"4049","The election of directors is determined by the votes received from all"
"4050","corporation shareholders without regard to whether a majority of shares of"
"4051","any one fund voted in favor of a particular nominee or all nominees as a group."
"4052","Each shareholder has rights to dividends and distributions declared by the"
"4053","fund he or she owns and to the net assets of such fund upon its liquidation"
"4054","or dissolution proportionate to his or her share ownership interest in the"
"4055","fund. Shares of each fund have equal voting rights, although each fund votes"
"4056","separately on matters affecting that fund exclusively."
"4057","The assets belonging to each series are held separately by the custodian and"
"4058","the shares of each series represent a beneficial interest in the principal,"
"4059","earnings and profit (or losses) of investments and other assets held for each"
"4060","series. Shareholder rights are the same for all series of securities unless"
"4061","otherwise stated. Within their respective series, all shares have equal"
"4062","redemption rights. Each share, when issued, is fully paid and non-assessable."
"4063","The A, C, and R Class shares of the funds are made available to participants"
"4064","in employer-sponsored retirement plans and to persons purchasing through"
"4065","broker-dealers, banks, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries"
"4066","that provide various administrative, shareholder and distribution services."
"4067","The funds&#146; distributor enters into contracts with various banks,"
"4068","broker-dealers, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries,"
"4069","with respect to the sale of the funds&#146; shares and/or the use of the funds&#146;"
"4070","shares in various investment products or in connection with various financial"
"4071","services."
"4072","Certain recordkeeping and administrative services that would otherwise be"
"4073","performed by the funds&#146; transfer agent may be performed by a plan sponsor"
"4074","(or its agents) or by a financial intermediary for A Class, C Class and"
"4075","R Class investors. In addition to such services, the financial intermediaries"
"4076","provide various individual shareholder and distribution services."
"4077","To enable the funds&#146; shares to be made available through such plans and"
"4078","financial intermediaries, and to compensate them for such services, the"
"4079","funds&#146; Board of Directors has adopted the A, C and R Class Plans."
"4080","Pursuant to the A Class Plan, the A Class pays the funds&#146; distributor 0.25%"
"4081","annually of the average daily net asset value of the funds&#146; A Class shares."
"4082","The distributor may use these fees to pay for certain ongoing shareholder"
"4083","and administrative services and for distribution services, including past"
"4084","distribution services. This payment is fixed at 0.25% and is not based on"
"4085","expenses incurred by the distributor."
"4086","Pursuant to the C Class Plan, the C Class pays the funds&#146; distributor 1.00%"
"4087","annually of the average daily net asset value of the funds&#146; C Class shares,"
"4088","0.25% of which is paid for certain ongoing individual shareholder and"
"4089","administrative services and 0.75% of which is paid for distribution services,"
"4090","including past distribution services. This payment is fixed at 1.00% and"
"4091","is not based on expenses incurred by the distributor."
"4092","Pursuant to the R Class Plan, the R Class pays the funds&#146; distributor 0.50%"
"4093","annually of the average daily net asset value of the R Class shares.  The"
"4094","distributor may use these fees to pay for certain ongoing shareholder"
"4095","and administrative services and for distribution services,"
"4096","including past distribution services. This payment is fixed at 0.50%"
"4097","and is not based on expenses incurred by the distributor."
"4098","The distributor then makes these payments to the financial intermediaries"
"4099","(including underwriters and broker-dealers, who may use some of the"
"4100","proceeds to compensate sales personnel) who offer the A Class for the"
"4101","services described below. No portion of these payments is used by"
"4102","the distributor to pay for advertising, printing costs or interest"
"4103","expenses."
"4104","Payments may be made for a variety of individual shareholder services,"
"4105","including, but not limited to:"
"4106","    (a)  providing individualized and customized investment advisory services,"
"4107","including the consideration of shareholder profiles and specific goals;"
"4108","    (b)  creating investment models and asset allocation models for use by"

"4112","    (d)  periodic rebalancing of shareholder accounts to ensure compliance"
"4113","with the selected asset allocation;"
"4114","    (e)  consolidating shareholder accounts in one place; and"
"4115","    (f)  other individual services."
"4116","    Individual shareholder services do not include those activities and"
"4117","expenses that are primarily intended to result in the sale of additional"
"4118","shares of the funds."
"4119","Distribution services include any activity undertaken or expense"
"4120","incurred that is primarily intended to result in the sale of A Class,"
"4121","C Class or R Class shares, which services may include but are not limited to:"
"4122","    (a)  paying sales commissions, on-going commissions and other payments"
"4123","to brokers, dealers, financial institutions or others who sell A Class,"
"4124","C Class or R Class shares pursuant to selling agreements;"
"4125","    (b)  compensating registered representatives or other employees of"
"4126","the distributor who engage in or support distribution of the funds&#146;"
"4127","A Class, C Class or R Class shares;"
"4128","    (c)  paying and compensating expenses (including overhead and"
"4129","telephone expenses) of the distributor;"
"4130","    (d)  printing prospectuses, statements of additional information"
"4131","and reports for other-than-existing shareholders;"
"4132","    (e)  preparing, printing and distributing sales literature and"

"4134","shareholders;"
"4135","    (f)  receiving and answering correspondence from prospective shareholders,"
"4136","including distributing prospectuses, statements of additional information,"
"4137","    and shareholder reports;"
"4138","    (g)  providing facilities to answer questions from prospective"
"4139","shareholders about fund shares;"
"4140","    (h)  complying with federal and state securities laws pertaining"
"4141","to the sale of fund shares;"
"4142","    (i)  assisting shareholders in completing application forms and"
"4143","selecting dividend and other account options;"
"4144","    (j)  providing other reasonable assistance in connection with the"
"4145","distribution of fund shares;"
"4146","     (k)  organizing and conducting of sales seminars and payments in the"
"4147","form of transactional and compensation or promotional incentives;"
"4148","    (l)  profit on the foregoing;"
"4149","    (m)  paying service fees for providing personal, continuing services"
"4150","to investors, as contemplated by the Conduct Rules of the FINRA; and"
"4151","    (n)  such other distribution and services activities as the advisor"
"4152","determines may be paid for by the funds pursuant to the terms of the"
"4153","agreement between the corporation and the funds&#146; distributor and in"
"4154","accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act."
"4155","Each shareholder&#146;s ability to purchase, exchange, redeem and transfer"
"4156","shares will be affected by the policies of the financial intermediary"
"4157","through which he/she does business. Some policy differences may include"
"4158","    &#149;	minimum investment requirements"
"4159","    &#149;	exchange policies"
"4160","    &#149;	fund choices"
"4161","    &#149;	cutoff time for investments"
"4162","    &#149;	trading restrictions"
"4163","    In addition, a financial intermediary may charge a transaction fee"
"4164","for the purchase or sale of fund shares. Those charges are retained by"
"4165","the financial intermediary and are not shared with American Century"
"4166","Investments or the funds."
"4167","The funds have authorized certain financial intermediaries to accept orders"
"4168","on the funds&#146; behalf. American Century has selling agreements with these"
"4169","financial intermediaries requiring them to track the time investment orders"
"4170","are received and to comply with procedures relating to the transmission of"
"4171","orders. Orders must be received by the financial intermediary on the funds&#146;"
"4172","behalf before the time the net asset value is determined in order to receive"
"4173","that day&#146;s share price. If those orders are transmitted to American Century"
"4174","and paid for in accordance with the selling agreement, they will be priced"
"4175","at the net asset value next determined after your request is received in the"
"4176","form required by the intermediary."
"4177","Unless otherwise specified below, the minimum initial investment amount to"
"4178","open an account is $2,500. American Century Investments will waive the minimum"
"4179","if you make an initial investment of at least $500 and continue to make"
"4180","automatic investments of at least $100 a month until reaching the minimum."
"4181","Financial intermediaries may open an account with $250, but may require their"
"4182","clients to meet different investment minimums.  There is a $50 minimum for"
"4183","subsequent purchases. However, there is no subsequent purchase minimum for"
"4184","financial intermediaries or employer-sponsored retirement plans, but financial"
"4185","intermediaries may require their clients to meet different subsequent purchase"
"4186","requirements."
"4187","The Institutional Class shares are made available for purchase by individuals"
"4188","and large institutional shareholders such as bank trust departments,"
"4189","corporations, retirement plans, endowments, foundations and financial"
"4190","advisors that meet the fund&#146;s minimum investment requirements."
"4191","Institutional Class shares are not available for purchase by insurance"
"4192","companies for variable annuity and variable life products."
"4193","The minimum initial investment amount for Institutional Class shares is"
"4194","$5 million ($3 million for endowments and foundations) per fund. If you invest"
"4195","with us through a financial intermediary, this requirement may be met if your"
"4196","financial intermediary aggregates your investments with those of other clients"
"4197","into a single group, or omnibus, account that meets the minimum. The minimum"
"4198","investment requirement may be waived if you, or your financial intermediary if"
"4199","you invest through an omnibus account, have an aggregate investment in our"
"4200","family of funds of $10 million or more ($5 million for endowments and"
"4201","foundations), or in other situations as determined by American Century"
"4202","Investments. In addition, financial intermediaries or plan recordkeepers"
"4203","may require retirement plans to meet certain other conditions, such as plan"
"4204","size or a minimum level of assets per participant, in order to be eligible"
"4205","to purchase Institutional Class shares."
"4206","If you sell C, or in certain cases, A Class shares, you may pay a sales"
"4207","charge, depending on how long you have held your shares.  Redemption proceeds"
"4208","will be calculated using the net asset value (NAV) next determined after we"
"4209","receive a transaction request in good order."
"4210","However, we reserve the right to delay delivery of redemption proceeds up"
"4211","to seven days. For example, each time a shareholder makes an investment with"
"4212","American Century, there is a seven-day holding period before we will release"
"4213","redemption proceeds from those shares, unless a shareholder provides us with"
"4214","satisfactory proof that the purchase funds have cleared.  For funds with"
"4215","CheckWriting privileges, we will not honor checks written against shares"
"4216","subject to this seven-day holding period. Investments by wire generally"
"4217","require only a one-day holding period. If you change your address, we may"
"4218","require that any redemption request made within 15 days be submitted in"
"4219","writing and be signed by all authorized signers with their signatures"
"4220","guaranteed. If you change your bank information, we may impose a 15-day"
"4221","holding period before we will transfer or wire redemption proceeds to"
"4222","your bank. Please remember, if you request redemptions by wire, $10 will"
"4223","be deducted from the amount redeemed. Your bank also may charge a fee."
"4224","In addition, we reserve the right to honor certain redemptions with"
"4225","securities, rather than cash."
"4226","If, during any 90-day period, a shareholder redeems fund shares worth more than"
"4227","$250,000 (or 1% of the value of a fund&#146;s assets if that amount is less than"
"4228","$250,000), we reserve the right to pay part or all of the redemption proceeds"
"4229","in excess of this amount in readily marketable securities instead of in cash."
"4230","The portfolio managers would select these securities from the fund&#146;s portfolio."
"4231","We will value these securities in the same manner as we do in computing the"
"4232","fund&#146;s net asset value. We may provide these securities in lieu of cash"
"4233","without prior notice. Also, if payment is made in securities, the shareholder"
"4234","may have to pay brokerage or other transaction costs to convert the securities"
"4235","to cash."
"4236","If the redemption would exceed this limit and the shareholder would like"
"4237","to avoid being paid in securities, please provide us with an unconditional"
"4238","instruction to redeem at least 15 days prior to the date on which the"
"4239","redemption transaction is to occur. The instruction must specify the dollar"
"4240","amount or number of shares to be redeemed and the date of the transaction."
"4241","This minimizes the effect of the redemption on a fund and its remaining"
"4242","investors."
"4243","If the shareholder&#146;s account balance falls below the minimum initial"
"4244","investment amount for any reason, American Century Investments reserves"
"4245","the right to redeem the shares in the account and send the proceeds to"
"4246","your address of record. Prior to doing so, we will notify the shareholder"
"4247","and give him/her 60 days to meet the minimum. Please note that shares"
"4248","redeemed in this manner may be subject to a sales charge if held less"
"4249","than the applicable time period.  The shareholder also may incur tax"
"4250","liability as a result of the redemption.  For Institutional Class"
"4251","shares, we reserve the right to convert the shareholder&#146;s shares to"
"4252","Investor Class shares of the same fund. The total annual operating"
"4253","expenses of Investor Class shares are 0.20% higher than Institutional"
"4254","Class shares."
"4255","Within 90 days of a redemption of any A Class shares, you may reinvest"
"4256","all of the redemption proceeds in A Class shares of any American Century"
"4257","Investments fund at the then-current net asset value without paying an"
"4258","initial sales charge. At your request, any CDSC you paid on an"
"4259","A Class redemption that you are reinvesting will be credited to your"
"4260","account. You or your financial professional must notify the fund&#146;s"
"4261","transfer agent in writing at the time of the reinvestment to"
"4262","take advantage of this privilege, and you may use it only once per"
"4263","account. This privilege applies only if the new account is owned by"
"4264","the original account owner."
"4265","You may exchange shares of the fund for shares of the same class of"
"4266","another American Century fund without a sales charge if you meet"
"4267","the following criteria:"
"4268","* The exchange is for a minimum of $100"
"4269","* For an exchange that opens a new account, the amount of the exchange"
"4270","must meet or exceed the minimum account size requirement for the fund"
"4271","receiving the exchange"
"4272","    For purposes of computing any applicable CDSC on shares that have"
"4273","been exchanged, the holding period will begin as of the date of purchase"
"4274","of the original fund owned. Exchanges from a money market fund are subject"
"4275","to a sales charge on the fund being purchased, unless the"
"4276","money market fund shares were acquired by exchange from a fund with"
"4277","a sales charge or by reinvestment of dividends or capital gains"
"4278","distributions."
"4279","A signature guarantee - which is different from a notarized"
"4280","signature - is a warranty that the signature presented is genuine."
"4281","We may require a signature guarantee for the following transactions."
"4282","* You have chosen to conduct business in writing only and would like"
"4283","to redeem over $100,000."
"4284","* Your redemption or distribution check or automatic redemption is"
"4285","made payable to someone other than the account owners."
"4286","* Your redemption proceeds or distribution amount is sent by EFT"
"4287","(ACH or wire) to a destination other than your personal bank account."
"4288","* You are transferring ownership of an account over $100,000."
"4289","* You change your address and request a redemption over $100,000"
"4290","within 15 days."
"4291","* You change your bank information and request a redemption"
"4292","within 15 days."
"4293","We reserve the right to require a signature guarantee for other"
"4294","transactions, at our discretion."
"4295","Investment instructions are irrevocable. That means that once you have"
"4296","mailed or otherwise transmitted your investment instruction, you may"
"4297","not modify or cancel it. Each fund reserves the right to suspend the"
"4298","offering of shares for a period of time and to reject any specific"
"4299","investment (including a purchase by exchange). Additionally, we may"
"4300","refuse a purchase if, in our judgment, it is of a size that would disrupt"
"4301","the management of a fund."
"4302","We reserve the right to change any stated investment requirement,"
"4303","including those that relate to purchases, exchanges and redemptions."
"4304","We also may alter, add or discontinue any service or privilege. Changes"
"4305","may affect all investors or only those in certain classes or"
"4306","groups. In addition, from time to time we may waive a policy on"
"4307","a case-by-case basis, as the advisor deems appropriate."
