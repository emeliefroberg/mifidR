"931","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"

"936","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"937","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"938","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"

"942","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"

"956","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"

"958","deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
