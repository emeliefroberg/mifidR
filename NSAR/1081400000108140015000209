"2031","     NOW THEREFORE, the Trust and the Adviser agree as follows:"
"2032","     SECTION 1. APPOINTMENT OF THE ADVISER. The Trust is engaged in the business"

"2051","the Board, to manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets in the Funds"
"2052","and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to provide the other"
"2053","services specified in Section 2 hereof."
"2054","<PAGE>"
"2055","     SECTION 2. DUTIES OF THE ADVISER."
"2056","     (a) The Adviser shall make decisions with respect to all purchases and"
"2057","sales of securities and other investment assets for the Funds. Among other"
"2058","things, the Adviser shall make all decisions with respect to the allocation of"
"2059","the Funds' investments in various securities or other assets, in investment"
"2060","styles and, if applicable, in other investment companies or pooled vehicles in"
"2061","which a Fund may invest. To carry out such decisions, the Adviser is hereby"
"2062","authorized, as agent and attorney-in-fact for the Trust, for the account of, at"
"2063","the risk of and in the name of the Trust, to place orders and issue instructions"
"2064","with respect to those transactions of the Funds. In all purchases, sales and"
"2065","other transactions in securities for the Funds, the Adviser is authorized to"
"2066","exercise full discretion and act for the Trust in the same manner and with the"
"2067","same force and effect as the Trust might or could do with respect to such"
"2068","purchases, sales or other transactions, as well as with respect to all other"
"2069","things necessary or incidental to the furtherance or conduct of such purchases,"
"2070","sales or other transactions."
"2071","     (b) The Adviser will report to the Board at each regular meeting thereof"
"2072","regarding the investment performance of the Funds since the prior report, and"
"2073","will also keep the Board informed of important developments affecting the Trust,"
"2074","each Fund and the Adviser, and on its own initiative will furnish the Board from"

"2078","conditions prevailing in each country in which a Fund maintains investments. The"
"2079","Adviser will also furnish the Board with such statistical and analytical"
"2080","information with respect to securities in the Funds as the Adviser may believe"
"2081","appropriate or as the Board reasonably may request."

"2092","that the employment or sub-contracting with any such person shall not relieve"
"2093","the Adviser of its responsibilities or liabilities hereunder and provided"

"2134","materials or information that the Adviser may reasonably request in connection"
"2135","with the performance of its duties hereunder."
"2136","     SECTION 4. DELEGATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES. The Adviser may carry out any of"
"2137","its obligations under this Agreement by employing, subject to supervision by the"
"2138","Adviser, one or more Sub-Adviser(s) who are registered as investment advisers"
"2139","pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Sub-Advisers). Each"
"2140","Sub-Adviser's employment will be evidenced by a separate written agreement"
"2141","approved by the Board and, if required under the 1940 Act, by the shareholders"
"2142","of the Fund (unless the Commission or its staff has given authorization or"
"2143","issued an interpretation dispensing with the requirement of shareholder"
"2144","approval). The Adviser shall not be liable hereunder for any act or omission of"
"2145","any Sub-Adviser, except for failure to exercise good faith in the employment of"
"2146","the Sub-Adviser and for failure to exercise appropriate supervision of such"
"2147","Sub-Adviser, and as may otherwise be agreed in writing. The Adviser shall be"
"2148","solely responsible for compensating any Sub-Adviser for services rendered under"
"2149","any Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Adviser may, from time to time and at any time,"
"2150","terminate any Sub-Adviser and reassume the responsibilities assigned to such"
"2151","Sub-Adviser with respect to any Fund without obtaining the approval of the"
"2152","shareholders of the Fund."

"2155","     SECTION 5. CONTROL BY BOARD. Any investment activities undertaken by the"
"2156","Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any other activities undertaken"
"2157","by the Adviser on behalf of the Funds, shall at all times be subject to the"
"2158","direction and control of the Board."
"2159","     SECTION 6. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS. In carrying out its"
"2160","obligations under this Agreement, the Adviser shall at all times comply with:"
"2161","     (a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"2162","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"2163","     (b) the Registration Statement of the Trust, as it may be amended from time"
"2164","to time, filed with the Commission under the Securities Act and the 1940 Act;"
"2165","     (c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it may be"
"2166","amended from time to time;"
"2167","     (d) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,"
"2168","applicable to the Trust or the Funds, and any rules and regulations adopted"
"2169","thereunder; and"
"2170","     (e)any other applicable provisions of state or federal law, and any rules"
"2171","and regulations adopted thereunder."
"2172","     SECTION 7. PROXIES. The Adviser shall have responsibility to vote proxies"
"2173","solicited with respect to issuers of securities in which assets of the Funds are"
"2174","invested in accordance with the Trust's policies on proxy voting."
"2175","     SECTION 8. BROKER-DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. In connection with the purchase and"
"2176","sale of securities for the Funds, the Adviser is responsible for broker-dealer"
"2177","selection and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Adviser's primary"
"2178","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain the best"
"2179","price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular"
"2180","transaction for a Fund, the Adviser will consider among other things: the best"
"2181","net price available, the reliability, integrity and financial condition of the"
"2182","broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value"
"2183","of the expected contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing"
"2184","basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any transaction may be less"
"2185","favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the difference is"
"2186","reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio execution services"
"2187","offered. Subject to such policies as the Board may from time to time determine,"
"2188","the Adviser shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any"
"2189","duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a"
"2190","Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and research services to"
"2191","the Adviser an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"2192","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would"
"2193","have charged for effecting that transaction, if the Adviser determines in good"
"2194","faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of"
"2195","the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in"
"2196","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of"
"2197","the Adviser with respect to the Fund and to other clients of the"
"2198","                                       4"
"2199","<PAGE>"
"2200","Adviser. The Adviser is further authorized to allocate the orders placed by it"
"2201","on behalf of the Funds to brokers and dealers who also provide brokerage and"
"2202","research services within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange"
"2203","Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith. Such allocation shall be in such"
"2204","amounts and proportions as the Adviser shall determine and the Adviser will"
"2205","report on said allocations regularly to the Board, indicating the brokers to"
"2206","whom such allocations have been made and the basis therefore."
"2207","     SECTION 9. EXPENSES. All of the ordinary business expenses incurred in the"
"2208","operations of the Funds and the offering of their shares shall be borne by the"
"2209","Funds unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement. The expenses"
"2210","borne by the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage commissions,"
"2211","taxes, legal, auditing or governmental fees, the cost of preparing share"
"2212","certificates, custodian, transfer agent and shareholder service agent costs,"

"2219","the Funds' shareholders."
"2220","     The Adviser shall pay its own expenses in connection with the services to"
"2221","be provided by it pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, the Adviser shall be"
"2222","responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the"
"2223","Trust: (a) to amend the Trust's registration statement or supplement the Fund's"
"2224","prospectus, and circulate the same, to reflect a change in the personnel of the"
"2225","Adviser responsible for making investment decisions in relation to a Fund; (b)"
"2226","to obtain shareholder approval of a new sub-advisory agreement as a result of a"

"2234","Agreement, the Trust shall pay the Adviser fees, payable monthly, at the annual"
"2235","rates indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such Schedule may be amended or"
"2236","supplemented from time to time;"
"2237","     (b) Except as provided in the following paragraph, no fee shall be payable"

"2240","management investment company, or separate series thereof, in accordance with"
"2241","Section 12(d)(1)(E) under the 1940 Act (a Master-Feeder Fund structure);"
"2242","     (c) The adviser shall receive a fee of 0.25% (0.35% in the case of the"
"2243","WealthBuilder Funds) for asset allocation services if a Fund invests some of its"
"2244","investment assets in two or more registered, open-end management investment"
"2245","companies, or separate series thereof, in each case, in accordance with Section"
"2246","12(d)(1)(G) under the Act, the rules thereunder or an exemptive order"

"2252","Adviser will give the Trust the benefit of, the Adviser's best judgment and"
"2253","efforts in rendering its services to the Trust, and the Adviser shall not be"
"2254","liable hereunder for any mistake in judgment. In the absence of willful"
"2255","misfeasance, bad faith, negligence or reckless disregard of obligations or"
"2256","duties hereunder on the part of the Adviser or any of its officers, directors,"
"2257","employees or agents, the Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Trust"

"2259","connected with, rendering services hereunder or for any losses that may be"
"2260","sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security."
"2261","     SECTION 12. NON-EXCLUSIVITY. The services of the Adviser to the Funds are"
"2262","not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Adviser shall be free to render"
"2263","investment advisory or other services to others (including other investment"
"2264","companies) and to engage in other activities. It is understood and agreed that"
"2265","officers or directors of the Adviser may serve as officers and directors of the"
"2266","Trust, and that officers or directors of the Trust may serve as officers or"
"2267","directors of the Adviser, to the extent that such services may be permitted by"
"2268","law, and that the officers and directors of the Adviser are not prohibited from"
"2269","engaging in any other business activity or from rendering services to any other"
"2270","person, or from serving as partners, officers, directors or trustees of any"
"2271","other firm or trust, including other investment advisory companies."

"2354","     SECTION 20. AMENDMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. This Agreement supersedes the"
"2355","advisory agreement between the parties hereto dated March 1, 2001. No provision"

"2375","by the Adviser, promptly take such action as may be necessary to change its"
"2376","corporate name to one not containing the words Wells Fargo and following such"
"2377","change, shall not use the words Wells Fargo, or any combination thereof, as a"
"2378","part of its corporate name or for any other commercial purpose, and shall use"

"2383","performance of the Funds or any specific level of performance, the success of"
"2384","any investment decision or strategy that the Adviser may use, or the success of"
"2385","the Adviser's overall management of the Funds. The Trust understands that"
"2386","investment decisions made for the Funds by the Adviser are subject to various"
"2387","market, currency, economic and business risks, and that those investment"
"2388","decisions will not always be profitable. The Adviser will manage only the"
"2389","securities, cash and other investments for which management responsibility is"
"2390","delegated to it and which are held in the Funds' account(s) and, in making"
"2391","investment decisions for the Funds, the Adviser will not consider any other"

"3063","Funds Trust (collectively, the Funds), as of and for the year ended February"
"3064","28, 2015, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"3065","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"3066","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"3067","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"3068","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"3069","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"3070","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"3071","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3072","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"3073","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"3074","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"3075","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company s internal"
"3076","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"3077","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"3078","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"3079","accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A company's internal control over"
"3080","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"3081","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"3082","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"3083","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"3084","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that"
"3085","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"3086","with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"3087","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"3088","acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a"
"3089","material effect on the financial statements."
"3090","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"3091","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"3092","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"3093","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"3094","compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3095","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"3096","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"3097","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"3098","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"3099","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"3100","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"3101","the Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"3102","detected on a timely basis."
"3103","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"3104","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3105","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"3106","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"3107","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"3108","in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its operations,"
"3109","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"3110","material weakness as defined above as of February 28, 2015."

"3188","Agreement;"
"3189","NOW THEREFORE, the Trust, the Adviser and Sub-Adviser"
"3190","agree as follows:"
"3191","Section 1. Appointment of Sub-Adviser. The Trust is"
"3192","engaged in the business of investing and reinvesting its assets in"

"3194","in its Declaration of Trust, as amended or supplemented from time to"
"3195","time, By-Laws (if any) and Registration Statement filed with the"
"3196","Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) under the"
"3197","1940 Act and the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act),"
"3198","including any representations made in the prospectus and statement"

"3209","reinvestment of the assets of the Funds as contemplated in this"
"3210","Agreement, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall"
"3211","provide the management and other services specified below in Section"
"3212","2(a), all in such manner and to such extent as may be directed from"
"3213","time to time by the Adviser. Notwithstanding anything in this"
"3214","Agreement to the contrary, the Adviser shall be responsible for"
"3215","compliance with any statute, rule, regulation, guideline or investment"
"3216","restriction that applies to the Funds' investment portfolio as a whole"
"3217","and the Sub-Adviser's responsibility shall be limited to following any"
"3218","instruction the Sub-Adviser might receive from the Adviser."
"3219","The investment authority granted to the Sub-Adviser shall"
"3220","include the authority to exercise whatever powers the Trust may"
"3221","possess with respect to any of its assets held by the Funds, including,"
"3222","but not limited to, the power to exercise rights, options, warrants,"

"3225","responsible for voting proxies, for participating in class actions and/or"
"3226","other legal proceedings on behalf of the Funds, but will provide such"
"3227","assistance as is reasonably requested by the Adviser."
"3228","Section 2. Duties of the Sub-Adviser."
"3229","(a) The Sub-Adviser shall make decisions with respect to"
"3230","all purchases and sales of securities and other investment assets for"
"3231","the Funds. To carry out such decisions, the Sub-Adviser is hereby"
"3232","authorized, as agent and attorney-in-fact for the Trust, for the account"
"3233","of, at the risk of and in the name of the Trust, to place orders and"
"3234","issue instructions with respect to those transactions of the Funds. In"
"3235","all purchases, sales and other transactions in securities and other"
"3236","assets for the Funds, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to exercise full"
"3237","discretion and act for the Trust and instruct the Fund's custodian (the"
"3238","Custodian) in the same manner and with the same force and effect"
"3239","as the Trust might or could do with respect to such purchases, sales or"
"3240","other transactions, as well as with respect to all other things necessary"
"3241","or incidental to the furtherance or conduct of such purchases, sales or"
"3242","other transactions."
"3243","The Sub-Adviser acknowledges that the Funds and other"
"3244","mutual funds advised by the Adviser (collectively, the fund complex)"
"3245","may engage in transactions with certain sub-advisers in the fund"
"3246","complex (and their affiliated persons) in reliance on exemptions under"
"3247","Rule 10f-3, Rule 12d3-1, Rule 17a-10 and Rule 17e-1 under the 1940"
"3248","Act. Accordingly, the Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that it will not consult"
"3249","with any other sub-adviser of a fund in the fund complex, or an"
"3250","affiliated person of a sub-adviser, concerning transactions for a fund in"
"3251","securities or other fund assets. With respect to a multi-managed"
"3252","Fund, the Sub-Adviser shall be limited to managing only the discrete"
"3253","portion of the Fund's portfolio as may be determined from time-totime"
"3254","by the Board or the Adviser, and shall not consult with the subadviser"
"3255","as to any other portion of the Fund's portfolio concerning"
"3256","transactions for the Fund in securities or other Fund assets. The"
"3257","foregoing is in no way intended to limit the Sub-Adviser from serving"
"3258","fully in its capacity as administrator to the Dow Jones Target Date"
"3259","Indexes."
"3260","(b) Following the close of each calendar quarter, the Sub-"
"3261","Adviser will report to the Board regarding the investment performance of"
"3262","the Fund since the prior report, and will also keep the Board informed of"
"3263","important developments known by it to affect the Trust, the Fund and the"
"3264","Sub-Adviser, and on its own initiative will furnish the Board and the Adviser"
"3265","from time to time with such information as the Sub-Adviser may believe"
"3266","appropriate, whether concerning the individual companies whose"
"3267","securities are held by a Fund, the industries in which they engage, or the"
"3268","economic, social or political conditions prevailing in each country in which"
"3269","the Fund maintains investments. The Sub-Adviser will also furnish the"
"3270","Board and the Adviser with such statistical and analytical information with"
"3271","respect to securities held by the Fund as the Sub-Adviser may believe"
"3272","appropriate or as the Board or the Adviser reasonably request."

"3274","changes regarding the Sub-Adviser that would impact disclosure in the"
"3275","Trust's Registration Statement, or (ii) any violation of any requirement,"
"3276","provision, policy or restriction that the Sub-Adviser is required to comply"
"3277","with under Section 6 of this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser shall, within two"
"3278","business days, notify both the Adviser and the Trust of any legal process"
"3279","served upon it in connection with its activities hereunder, including any"
"3280","legal process served upon it on behalf of the Adviser, the Fund or the Trust."

"3282","Custodian's processing of class actions or other legal proceedings relating"
"3283","to the holdings (historical and/or current) of the Fund."
"3284","(c) The Sub-Adviser may from time to time employ or subcontract"
"3285","the services of certain persons as the Sub-Adviser believes to be"
"3286","appropriate or necessary to assist in the execution of the Sub-Adviser's"
"3287","duties hereunder; provided, however, that the employment of or subcontracting"
"3288","to any such person shall not relieve the Sub-Adviser of its"
"3289","responsibilities or liabilities hereunder. The cost of performance of such"
"3290","duties shall be borne and paid by the Sub-Adviser. No obligation may be"
"3291","imposed on the Trust in any such respect."
"3292","The Sub-Adviser shall supervise and monitor the activities of its"
"3293","representatives, personnel and agents in connection with the execution"
"3294","of its duties and obligations hereunder. The appropriate personnel of"

"3296","Trust and the Board at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice"
"3297","concerning the business of the Trust."
"3298","(d) The Sub-Adviser shall maintain records relating to"
"3299","portfolio transactions and the placing and allocation of brokerage orders"
"3300","as are required to be maintained by the Trust under the 1940 Act. The"

"3302","maintained, in such form, for such periods and in such locations as may"

"3313","of the Trust, copies of any such books and records shall be provided"
"3314","promptly by the Sub-Adviser to the Trust or the Trust's authorized"
"3315","representatives."
