"2560","To the Trustees of Deutsche Investment Trust and"

"2562","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"2563","statements of Deutsche Core Equity Fund (the Fund), as"
"2564","of and for the year ended September 30, 2016, in"
"2565","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"2566","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"2567","considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"2568","reporting, including control activities for safeguarding"
"2569","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"2570","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"2571","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"2572","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"2573","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"2574","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"2575","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"2576","over financial reporting."
"2577","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"2578","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"2579","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"2580","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"2581","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"2582","A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"2583","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2584","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"2585","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"2586","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2587","principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"2588","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"2589","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"2590","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2591","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"2592","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2593","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2594","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"2595","and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"2596","made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"2597","management and trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide"
"2598","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"2599","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"2600","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"2601","financial statements."
"2602","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2603","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2604","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2605","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"2606","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2607","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"2608","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2609","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"2610","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"2611","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"2612","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2613","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"2614","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2615","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"2616","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2617","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"2618","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2619","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"2620","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"2621","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"2622","all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting"
"2623","that might be material weaknesses under standards"

"3047","(the Fund)

Effective October 3, 2016, the Fund's principal
investment strategy was amended to include the
following:



Management process. Portfolio management
aims to add value through stock selection. In
choosing securities, portfolio management employs a
risk-balanced bottom-up selection process to identify
companies it believes are well-positioned and that
have above average and sustainable growth potential.
Portfolio management utilizes a proprietary investment
process designed to identify attractive investments by
utilizing proprietary research, including regional and
sector research, conducted by in-house analysts. The
investment process also takes into consideration
various valuation metrics to assess the attractiveness
of stocks and assists portfolio management in devising
allocations among investable securities.


All investment decisions are made within risk
parameters set by portfolio management. The
factors considered and models used by portfolio
management may change over time. Portfolio
management may favor different types of securities
from different industries and companies at
different times.
Portfolio management will normally sell a stock when
its price fully reflects portfolio management's
estimate of its fundamental value, its fundamentals
have deteriorated, other investments offer better
opportunities or in the course of adjusting the
fund's exposure to a given sector.
Derivatives. Portfolio management generally may
use futures contracts, which are a type of derivative
(a contract whose value is based on, for example,
indices, currencies or securities), as a substitute for
direct investment in a particular asset class, to keep
cash on hand to meet shareholder redemptions or other
needs while maintaining exposure to the stock
market.
The fund may also use other types of derivatives (i) for
hedging purposes; (ii) for risk management; (iii) for non-
hedging purposes to seek to enhance potential gains;
or (iv) as a substitute for direct investment in a
particular asset class or to keep cash on hand to
meet shareholder redemptions.

<SEQUENCE>4
<FILENAME>ex77E.txt
<TEXT>
Item 77E - Deutsche Investment Trust (formerly
DWS Investment Trust)
On December 7, 2010, Deutsche Investment Trust
(formerly DWS Investment Trust) (the Trust) was
named as a defendant in the First Amended
Complaint filed by the Official Committee of
Unsecured Creditors in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
for the District of Delaware in the lawsuit styled
Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of
Tribune Company, et al., v. Fitzsimons et al. (the
Lawsuit).  The Lawsuit arises out of a leveraged
buyout transaction (LBO) in 2007 by which loans
were made to the Tribune Company to fund the
LBO and shares of the Tribune Company held by
shareholders were tendered for or were converted to
a right to receive cash.  Following the completion of
the LBO in 2007, the Tribune Company filed for
bankruptcy.  The Lawsuit seeks to recover all
payments made to the shareholders in the LBO.
The Lawsuit has been consolidated in a multi-
district litigation in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York, case no. 12-
MC-2296.  At the outset of the Lawsuit, the Court
issued a scheduling order which stayed all
substantive proceedings in the Lawsuit until after
the decision on motions to dismiss based on certain
defenses common to the defendants filed in related
cases.  On September 23, 2013, the District Court
entered an order granting the defendants' motion to
dismiss in those related cases due to the pendency
of the Lawsuit seeking recoveries on similar
grounds, and the plaintiffs in the related cases have
appealed that order to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit.  Oral arguments
were held in November 2014. On March 29, 2015,
the Second Circuit, in a unanimous opinion,
affirmed the District Court's dismissal of the related
cases.  The plaintiffs in the related cases
subsequently filed a petition for rehearing, which
the Second Circuit denied on July 22, 2016.  On
September 9, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a petition for
a writ of certiorari of the Second Circuit's decision
in the U.S. Supreme Court.  The writ petition has
been fully briefed.  Accordingly, the Lawsuit will
continue to seek recovery of all amounts that the
Trust received on a theory of intentional fraudulent
conveyance.  On November 21, 2013, the District
Court entered Master Case Order No. 4 (MCO 4)
setting forth the procedures to govern the Lawsuit
and effectively lifting the above-referenced stay.
Among other things, MCO 4 requires the parties to
present proposals for a structure to govern the
upcoming pre-answer motions to dismiss stage of
the Lawsuit.  On April 25, 2014, the District Court
entered an order governing the upcoming stage of
the Lawsuit, which directed Ropes & Gray, as
Liaison Counsel to the Shareholder Defendants, to
file a global motion to dismiss (the Global Motion"
"3048","to Dismiss) the Lawsuit on behalf of all
shareholder defendants named in Exhibit A to the
current Fifth Amended Complaint (including the
Trust).  Briefing of the Global Motion to Dismiss
has concluded, and the District Court has not yet
scheduled a date for oral argument.  The District
Court has also deferred all other proposed motions
to dismiss the Lawsuit, if necessary, until a later
date to be determined. Management is currently
assessing the Lawsuit and has not yet determined
the effect, if any, on any series of the Trust.
Deutsche S&P 500 Index Fund, the only fund in the
Trust that was the beneficial holder of shares of the
Tribune Company, has been reorganized into
Deutsche Institutional Funds and none of the
Trust's current funds have exposure in the litigation.
