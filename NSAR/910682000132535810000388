"1163","sub-adviser (as defined in Paragraph 5 hereof, a Sub-Adviser) or to any other fund or account"
"1164","for which the Investment Manager or any Sub-Adviser provides investment advisory services"
"1165","and/or with broker/dealers who sell shares of the Trust or who sell shares of any other investment"
"1166","company (or series thereof) for which the Investment Manager or any Sub-Adviser provides"
"1167","investment advisory services.  Broker/dealers who sell shares of any investment companies or"
"1168","series thereof for which the Investment Manager or Sub-Adviser provides investment advisory"
"1169","services shall only receive orders for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities to the extent that"
"1170","the placing of such orders is in compliance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange"
"1171","Commission (the SEC) and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and does"
"1172","not take into account such broker/dealer's promotion or sale of such shares."
"1173","		(b) 	Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a) above and subject to"
"1174","such policies and procedures as may be adopted by the Board of Trustees and officers of the"
"1175","Trust, the Investment Manager may cause a Fund to pay a member of an exchange, broker or"
"1176","dealer an amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount of"
"1177","commission another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have charged for effecting"
"1178","that transaction, in such instances where the Investment Manager has determined in good faith"
"1179","that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"1180","research services provided by such member, broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that"
"1181","particular transaction or the Investment Manager's overall responsibilities with respect to the"
"1182","Trust and to other investment companies (or series thereof) and other advisory accounts for which"
"1183","the Investment Manager exercises investment discretion."
"1184","	4. 	As compensation for the investment services to be rendered to a particular Fund"
"1185","by the Investment Manager under the provisions of this Agreement, the Trust shall pay monthly"
"1186","to the Investment Manager exclusively from that Fund's assets, a fee based on the average daily"
"1187","net assets of that Fund during the month.  Such fee shall be calculated in accordance with the fee"
"1188","schedule applicable to that Fund as set forth in Exhibit A hereto."
"1189","       If this Agreement is terminated prior to the end of any calendar month with respect to a"
"1190","particular Fund, the management fee for such Fund shall be prorated for the portion of any month"
"1191","in which this Agreement is in effect with respect to such Fund according to the proportion which"
"1192","the number of calendar days during which the Agreement is in effect bears to the number of"
"1193","calendar days in the month, and shall be payable within 10 calendar days after the date of"
"1194","termination."
"1195","       5. 	The Investment Manager may, at its expense, select and contract with one or"
"1196","more investment advisers registered under the Advisers Act (Sub-Advisers) to perform some or"
"1197","all of the services for a Fund for which it is responsible under this Agreement.  The Investment"
"1198","Manager will compensate any Sub-Adviser for its services to the Fund.  The Investment Manager"
"1199","may terminate the services of any Sub-Adviser at any time in its sole discretion, and shall at such"
"1200","time assume the responsibilities of such Sub-Adviser unless and until a successor Sub-Adviser is"
"1201","selected and the requisite approval of the Fund's shareholders, if required, is obtained.  The"
"1202","Investment Manager will continue to have responsibility for all advisory services furnished by"
"1203","any Sub-Adviser."
"1204","       6. 	The services to be rendered by the Investment Manager to the Trust under the"
"1205","provisions of this Agreement are not to be deemed to be exclusive.  The Investment Manager, its"
"1206","trustees, officers, employees, agents and shareholders may engage in other businesses, may"
"1207","render investment advisory services to other investment companies, or to any other corporation,"
"1208","association, firm or individual, and may render underwriting services to the Trust or to any other"
"1209","investment company, corporation, association, firm or individual, so long as the Investment"
"1210","Manager's other activities do not impair its ability to render the services provided for in this"
"1211","Agreement."
"1212","       7. 	It is understood and agreed that so long as the Investment Manager and/or its"
"1213","advisory affiliates shall continue to serve as the Trust's investment adviser, other investment"
"1214","companies as may be sponsored or advised by the Investment Manager or its affiliates may have"
"1215","the right permanently to adopt and to use the words Delaware, Delaware Investments or"
"1216","Delaware Group in their names and in the names of any series or class of shares of such funds."
"1217","	8. 	In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or a reckless"
"1218","disregard of the performance of its duties as the Investment Manager to the Trust, the Investment"
"1219","Manager shall not be subject to liability to the Trust or to any shareholder of the Trust for any"
"1220","action or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering services hereunder or for any"
"1221","losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security, or otherwise."
"1222","	9. 	(a)	This Agreement shall be executed and become effective as of the date"
"1223","written below, and shall become effective with respect to a particular Fund as of the effective date"
"1224","set forth in Exhibit A for that Fund, only if approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding"
"1225","voting securities of that Fund.  It shall continue in effect for an initial period of two years for each"
"1226","Fund and may be renewed thereafter only so long as such renewal and continuance is specifically"
"1227","approved at least annually by the Board of Trustees or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding"
"1228","voting securities of that Fund and only if the terms and the renewal hereof have been approved by"
"1229","the vote of a majority of the Trustees of the Trust who are not parties hereto or interested persons"
"1230","of any such party (Independent Trustees), cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of"
"1231","voting on such approval."
"1232","             (b)	This Agreement (and Exhibit A hereto) may be amended without the"
"1233","approval of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund if the amendment relates"
"1234","solely to a management fee reduction or other change that is permitted or not prohibited under"
"1235","then current federal law, rule, regulation or SEC staff interpretation thereof to be made without"
"1236","shareholder approval.  This Agreement may be amended from time to time pursuant to a written"

"1238","             (c)	This Agreement may be terminated as to any Fund by the Trust at any"

"1240","of the Trust's intention to do so, pursuant to action by the Board of Trustees of the Trust or"
"1241","pursuant to the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the affected Fund.  The"
"1242","Investment Manager may terminate this Agreement at any time, without the payment of a penalty,"
"1243","on sixty days' written notice to the Trust of its intention to do so.  Upon termination of this"
"1244","Agreement, the obligations of all the parties hereunder shall cease and terminate as of the date of"
