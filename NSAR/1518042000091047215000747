"441","Report of Independent Registered"
"442","Public Accounting Firm"
"443","To the Board of Trustees of Northern"
"444","Lights Fund Trust II"
"445","and the Shareholders of PCS"
"446","Commodity Strategy Fund"
"447","In planning and performing our audit of"
"448","the consolidated financial statements of"
"449","PCS Commodity Strategy Fund (the"
"450","Fund), as of August 31, 2015 and for the"
"451","period from December 10, 2014"
"452","(commencement of operations) through"
"453","August 31, 2015, in accordance with the"
"454","standards of the Public Company"
"455","Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"456","States), we considered the Funds"
"457","internal control over financial reporting,"
"458","including controls over safeguarding"
"459","securities, as a basis for designing our"
"460","auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"461","expressing our opinion on the"
"462","consolidated financial statements and to"
"463","comply with the requirements of Form"
"464","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"465","expressing an opinion on the"
"466","effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"467","control over financial reporting."
"468","Accordingly, we express no such"
"469","opinion."
"470","The management of the Fund is"
"471","responsible for establishing and"
"472","maintaining effective internal control"
"473","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"474","responsibility, estimates and judgments"
"475","by management are required to assess"
"476","the expected benefits and related costs"
"477","of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"478","financial reporting is a process designed"
"479","to provide reasonable assurance"
"480","regarding the reliability of financial"
"481","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"482","statements for external purposes in"
"483","accordance with generally accepted"
"484","accounting principles (GAAP). A funds"
"485","internal control over financial reporting"
"486","includes those policies and procedures"
"487","that (a) pertain to the maintenance of"
"488","records that, in reasonable detail,"
"489","accurately and fairly reflect the"
"490","transactions and dispositions of the"
"491","assets of the fund; (b) provide"
"492","reasonable assurance that transactions"
"493","are recorded as necessary to permit"
"494","preparation of financial statements in"
"495","accordance with GAAP, and that"
"496","receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"497","are being made only in accordance with"
"498","authorizations of management and"
"499","trustees of the fund; and (c) provide"
"500","reasonable assurance regarding"
"501","prevention or timely detection of"
"502","unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"503","disposition of a fund's assets that could"
"504","have a material effect on the financial"
"505","statements."
"506","Because of inherent limitations, internal"
"507","control over financial reporting may not"
"508","prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"509","projections of effectiveness to future"
"510","periods are subject to the risk that"
"511","controls may become inadequate"
"512","because of changes in conditions, or"
"513","that the degree of compliance with the"
"514","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"515","A deficiency in internal control over"
"516","financial reporting exists when the"
"517","design or operation of a control does not"
"518","allow management or employees, in the"
"519","normal course of performing their"
"520","assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"521","misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"522","material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"523","combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"524","control over financial reporting, such"
"525","that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"526","a material misstatement of the Fund's"
"527","annual or interim financial statements"
"528","will not be prevented or detected on a"
"529","timely basis."
"530","Our consideration of the Fund's internal"
"531","control over financial reporting was for"
"532","the limited purpose described in the first"
"533","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"534","identify all deficiencies in internal control"
"535","that might be material weaknesses"
"536","under standards established by the"
"537","Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"538","Board (United States). However, we"
"539","noted no deficiencies in the Funds"
"540","internal control over financial reporting"
"541","and its operation, including controls over"
"542","safeguarding of securities that we"
"543","consider to be a material weakness as"
"544","defined above as of August 31, 2015."
"545","This report is intended solely for the"
"546","information and use of management and"
"547","the Board of Trustees of the Fund and"
"548","the Securities and Exchange"
"549","Commission and is not intended to be"
"550","and should not be used by anyone other"
"551","than these specified parties."
