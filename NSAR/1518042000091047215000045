"495","<TEXT>"
"496","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED"
"497","PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"498","To the Shareholders of Linde Hansen"
"499","Contrarian Value Fund"
"500","and Board of Trustees of Northern Lights"
"501","Fund Trust II"
"502","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"503","financial statements of the Linde Hansen"
"504","Contrarian Value Fund (the Fund), a series of"
"505","shares of beneficial interest in Northern Lights"
"506","Fund Trust II, as of November 30, 2014 and for"
"507","the year then ended, in accordance with the"
"508","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"509","Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we"
"510","considered internal control over financial"
"511","reporting, including control activities over"
"512","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"513","our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"514","expressing our opinion on the financial"
"515","statements and to comply with the requirements"
"516","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"517","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"518","the Fund's internal control over financial"
"519","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such"
"520","opinion."
"521","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"522","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"523","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"524","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"525","management are required to assess the"
"526","expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"527","A company's internal control over financial"
"528","reporting is a process designed to provide"
"529","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"530","financial reporting and the preparation of"
"531","financial statements for external purposes in"
"532","accordance with accounting principles generally"
"533","accepted in the United States of America"
"534","(GAAP).  A company's internal control over"
"535","financial reporting includes those policies and"
"536","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"537","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"538","and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"539","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"540","provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"541","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"542","of the financial statements in accordance with"
"543","GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"544","company are being made only in accordance"
"545","with authorizations of management and trustees"
"546","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"547","assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"548","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"549","disposition of a company's assets that could"
"550","have a material effect on the financial"
"551","statements."
"552","Because of inherent limitations, internal control"
"553","over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"554","detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any"
"555","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"556","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"557","inadequate because of changes in conditions or"
"558","that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"559","or procedures may deteriorate."
"560","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"561","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"562","a control does not allow management or"
"563","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"564","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"565","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"566","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"567","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"568","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"569","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"570","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will"
"571","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"572","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control"
"573","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"574","purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"575","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"576","internal control that might be material"
"577","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"578","PCAOB.  However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"579","the internal control over financial reporting and"
"580","operations, including controls over safeguarding"
"581","securities that we consider to be material"
"582","weaknesses, as defined above, as of November"
"583","30, 2014."
"584","This report is intended solely for the information"
"585","and use of management, the shareholders of the"
"586","Linde Hansen Contrarian Value Fund, the Board"
"587","of Trustees of Northern Lights Fund Trust II and"
"588","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"589","not intended to be and should not be used by"
"590","anyone other than these specified parties."
