"869","September 30, 2013, in accordance with the standards"

"874","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"875","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"

"880","The management of Northern Lights Fund Trust is"

"882","internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"883","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"884","are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"885","costs of controls.  A company's internal control over"

"888","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"889","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"890","accounting principles generally accepted in the United"

"892","control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"893","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"894","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"895","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"

"903","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"904","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"905","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"906","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over"
"907","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"908","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"909","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"910","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"911","conditions or that the degree of compliance with the"
"912","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"913","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"914","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"915","allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"916","of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"

"918","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,"

"923"," Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
