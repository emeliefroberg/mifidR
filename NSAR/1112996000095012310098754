"8017","SETTLED ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO MARKET TIMING"
"8018","     On October 8, 2004, Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco), successor by merger"
"8019","to Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc. and INVESCO Funds Group, Inc. (IFG), both former"
"8020","investment advisers, along with Invesco Aim Distributors, n/k/a Invesco"
"8021","Distributors, Inc. (Invesco Distributors) reached final settlements with certain"
"8022","regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York"
"8023","Attorney General and the Colorado Attorney General, to resolve civil enforcement"
"8024","actions and/or investigations related to market timing and related activity in"
"8025","the AIM Funds (n/k/a the Invesco Funds), including those formerly advised by"
"8026","IFG. As part of the settlements, a $325 million fair fund ($110 million of which"
"8027","is civil penalties) was created to compensate shareholders harmed by market"
"8028","timing and related activity in funds formerly advised by IFG. Additionally,"
"8029","Invesco and Invesco Distributors created a $50 million fair fund ($30 million of"
"8030","which is civil penalties) to compensate shareholders harmed by market timing and"
"8031","related activity in funds advised by Invesco, which was done pursuant to the"
"8032","terms of the settlement. The methodology of the fair funds distributions was"
"8033","determined by Invesco's independent distribution consultant (IDC Plan), in"
"8034","consultation with Invesco and the independent trustees of the Invesco Funds, and"
"8035","approved by the SEC on May 23, 2008."
"8036","     The IDC Plan provides for distribution to all eligible investors, for the"
"8037","periods spanning January 1, 2000 through July 31, 2003 (for the IFG Fair Fund)"
"8038","and January 1, 2001 through September 30, 2003 (for the AIM Fair Fund), their"
"8039","proportionate share of the applicable Fair Fund to compensate such investors for"
"8040","injury they may have suffered as a result of market timing in the affected"
"8041","funds. The IDC Plan includes a provision for any residual amounts in the Fair"
"8042","Funds to be distributed in the future to the affected funds. Further details"
"8043","regarding the IDC Plan and distributions thereunder are available on Invesco's"
"8044","Web site, available at http://www.invesco.com/us."
"8045","At the present time, management of Invesco and the Invesco Funds are unable to"
"8046","estimate the impact, if any, that the outcome of the Pending Litigation and"
"8047","Regulatory Inquiries described herein may have on Invesco, Invesco Distributors"
"8048","or the Invesco Funds."
"8049","Pending Regulatory Action Alleging Market Timing"
"8050","     On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Office of the State Auditor -"
"8051","Securities Commission (WVASC) issued a Summary Order to Cease and Desist and"
"8052","Notice of Right to Hearing to Invesco and Invesco Distributors (Order No."
"8053","05-1318). The WVASC makes findings of fact that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"8054","entered into certain arrangements permitting market timing of the Invesco Funds"
"8055","and failed to disclose these arrangements in the prospectuses for such Funds,"
"8056","and conclusions of law to the effect that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"8057","violated the West Virginia securities laws. The WVASC orders Invesco and Invesco"
"8058","Distributors to cease any further violations and seeks to impose monetary"
"8059","sanctions, including restitution to affected investors, disgorgement of fees,"
"8060","reimbursement of investigatory, administrative and legal costs and an"
"8061","administrative assessment, to be determined by the Commissioner. Initial"
"8062","research indicates that these damages could be limited or capped by statute. By"
"8063","agreement with the Commissioner of Securities, Invesco's time to respond to that"
"8064","Order has been indefinitely suspended."
"8065","Private Civil Actions Alleging Market Timing"
"8066","           Multiple civil lawsuits, including purported class action and"
"8067","shareholder derivative suits, have been filed against various parties"
"8068","(including, depending on the lawsuit, certain Invesco Funds, IFG, Invesco,"
"8069","Invesco Aim Management Group, Inc., n/k/a Invesco Management Group, Inc. and"
"8070","certain related entities, certain of their current and former officers and/or"

"8075","allegations of improper market timing and related activity in the Invesco Funds."
"8076","These lawsuits allege a variety of theories of recovery, including but not"
"8077","limited to: (i) violation of various provisions of the Federal and state"
"8078","securities laws; (ii) violation of various provisions of Employee Retirement"
"8079","Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA); (iii) breach of fiduciary duty;"
"8080","and/or (iv) breach of contract. These lawsuits were initiated in both Federal"
"8081","and state courts and seek such remedies as compensatory damages; restitution;"
"8082","injunctive relief; disgorgement of management fees; imposition of a constructive"
"8083","trust; removal of certain directors and/or employees; various corrective"
"8084","measures under ERISA; rescission of certain Funds' advisory agreements;"
"8085","interest; and attorneys' and experts' fees. All lawsuits based on allegations of"
"8086","market timing, late trading, and related issues have been transferred to the"
"8087","United States District Court for the District of Maryland (the MDL Court) for"
"8088","consolidated or coordinated pre-trial proceedings."
"8089","     Pursuant to an Order of the MDL Court, plaintiffs in these lawsuits"
"8090","consolidated their claims for pre-trial purposes into three amended complaints"
"8091","against various Invesco - and IFG-related parties. The parties in the amended"
"8092","complaints have agreed in principle to settle the actions. A list identifying"
"8093","the amended complaints in the MDL Court and details of the settlements are"
"8094","discussed below."
"8095","- -    RICHARD LEPERA, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED"
"8096","     (LEAD PLAINTIFF: CITY OF CHICAGO DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN), V. INVESCO"

"8098","     04-CV-00814-JFM) (originally in the United States District Court for the"
"8099","     District of Colorado), filed on September 29, 2004."

"8101","     Trusts and Corporations Comprising the Invesco and AIM Family of Mutual"
"8102","     Funds v. AMVESCAP, PLC, ET AL., in the MDL Court (Case No. 04-MD-15864-FPS;"

"8104","- -    MIRIAM CALDERON, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY"
"8105","     SITUATED, V. AVZ, INC., ET AL., in the MDL Court (Case No."
"8106","     1:04-MD-15864-FPS), filed on September 29, 2004."
"8107","     On March 1, 2006, the MDL Court dismissed all derivative causes of action"
"8108","in the Essenmacher lawsuit but two: (i) the excessive fee claim under Section"
"8109","36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act); and (ii) the"
"8110","control person liability claim under Section 48 of the 1940 Act, and all"
"8111","claims asserted in the Lepera class action lawsuit but three: (i) the securities"
"8112","fraud claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (ii)"
"8113","the excessive fee claim under Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act (which survived only"
"8114","insofar as plaintiffs seek recovery of fees associated with the assets involved"
"8115","in market timing); and (iii) the control person liability claim under Section"
"8116","48 of the 1940 Act. On June 14, 2006, the MDL Court entered an order dismissing"
"8117","the Section 48 claim in the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuit. Based on the MDL"
"8118","Court's March 1, 2006 and June 14, 2006 orders, all claims asserted against the"
"8119","Funds that were transferred to the MDL Court were dismissed, although certain"
"8120","Funds remain nominal defendants in the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuit. On"
"8121","January 5, 2008, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle both"
"8122","the class action (Lepera) and the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuits, subject to"
"8123","the MDL Court approval. Individual class members have the right to object."
"8124","     On September 15, 2006, Judge Motz for the MDL Court granted the Defendants'"
"8125","motion to dismiss the ERISA (Calderon) lawsuit and dismissed such lawsuit. The"
"8126","Plaintiff appealed this decision. On June 16, 2008, the Fourth Circuit Court of"
"8127","Appeals reversed the dismissal and remanded this lawsuit back to the MDL Court"
"8128","for further proceedings. On December 15, 2008, the parties reached an agreement"
"8129","in principle to settle this lawsuit, subject to the MDL Court approval."
"8130","Individual class members have the right to object. No payments are required"
"8131","under the settlement; however, the parties agreed that certain limited changes"
"8132","to benefit plans and participants' accounts would be made."

"8136","Other Actions Involving AIM Floating Rate Fund n/k/a Invesco Floating Rate Fund"
"8137","     Invesco Floating Rate Fund has been named as a defendant in a private civil"
"8138","action based on its position as a creditor to a certain entity that has filed a"
"8139","petition in bankruptcy court. Set forth below is a brief description of the"
"8140","civil lawsuit that was served or had service of process waived."
"8141","     ADELPHIA COMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND ITS AFFILIATE DEBTORS IN POSSESSION AND"
"8142","     OFFICIAL COMMITTEE OF UNSECURED CREDITORS OF ADELPHIA COMMUNICATIONS CORP."
"8143","     V. BANK OF AMERICA, INDIVIDUALLY AND AS AGENT FOR VARIOUS BANKS PARTY TO"
"8144","     CREDIT AGREEMENTS, AIM FLOATING RATE FUND, ET AL., in the United States"
"8145","     Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, Case No. 02-41729,"
"8146","     filed July 6, 2003. This is an adversary proceeding by Adelphia"
"8147","     Communications Corp. (Adelphia) and related parties, along with its"
"8148","     Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, against more than 360 banks,"
"8149","     financial services companies, insurance companies, investment banks, mutual"
"8150","     funds and other parties that had arranged for the sale of, or purchased the"
"8151","     bank debt of, Adelphia or its related parties. Named defendants include"
"8152","     Invesco Floating Rate Fund as a purchaser of this bank debt. The Complaint"
"8153","     alleges that the purchasers of this bank debt knew, or should have known,"
"8154","     that the loan proceeds would not benefit Adelphia, but instead would be"
"8155","     used to enrich Adelphia insiders. It seeks avoidance of the loans and"
"8156","     recovery of intentionally fraudulent transfers. Invesco Floating Rate Fund"
"8157","     and similarly situated non-agent bank lenders have negotiated a resolution"
"8158","     to their claims as creditors in the Adelphia bankruptcy; however, this"
"8159","     adversary proceeding will continue. On June 11, 2007, the judge in this"
"8160","     adversary proceeding ruled on the Agent Banks' Motions to Dismiss and"
"8161","     dismissed some of the claims but left most of the suit intact. Plaintiffs"
"8162","     filed their Amended Complaint against almost 700 defendants on October 19,"
"8163","     2007; but made no new allegations against Invesco Floating Rate Fund. This"
"8164","     latest Amended Complaint adds hundreds of new defendants and makes"
"8165","     materially different claims and is much more than a repleading of the prior"
"8166","     Complaint's allegations. Invesco Floating Rate Fund is still the only"
"8167","     Invesco-related party named as a defendant. On June 17, 2008, the Court"
"8168","     granted, in its entirety, the Motion to Dismiss filed by a group of"
"8169","     defendants that includes Invesco Floating Rate Fund and dismissed all of"
"8170","     Adelphia's claims against it. On July 17, 2008, the Invesco Floating Rate"
"8171","     Fund's group of defendants filed a Motion to make the Dismissal a Final"
"8172","     Judgment, which the court granted. Adelphia appealed the ruling. On May 26,"
"8173","     2010, the court granted a Summary Order denying the appeal and affirming"
"8174","     the Final Judgment. Adelphia has a right to a further appeal."
"8175","     More detailed information regarding each of the civil lawsuits identified"
"8176","above, including the parties to the lawsuits and summaries of the various"
"8177","allegations and remedies sought, can be found in the Fund's Statement of"

"8607","     by the Target Entity's Board of Trustees, which shall be provided to the"
