"498","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"499","To the Board of Trustees of Legg Mason Global Asset"
"500","Management Trust and Shareholders of Legg Mason Capital"
"501","Management Disciplined Equity Research Fund:"
"502","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"503","statements of Legg Mason Capital Management Disciplined"
"504","Equity Research Fund (one of the funds comprising Legg"
"505","Mason Global Asset Management Trust, the Company) as"
"506","of and for the period ended October 31, 2010, in"
"507","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"508","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"509","the Companys internal control over financial reporting,"
"510","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"511","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"512","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"513","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"514","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"515","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys"
"516","internal control over financial reporting."
"517","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"518","effectiveness of the Company's internal control"
"519","over financial reporting."
"520","The management of the Company is responsible for"
"521","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"522","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"523","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"524","management are required to assess the expected"
"525","benefits and related costs of controls.  A companys"
"526","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"527","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"528","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"529","preparation of financial statements for external"
"530","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"531","accounting principles.  A company's internal control"
"532","over financial reporting includes those policies"
"533","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"534","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"535","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"536","of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"537","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"538","to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"539","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"540","and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"541","being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"542","management and trustees of the company; and"
"543","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"544","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"545","or disposition of a companys assets that could have"
"546","a material effect on the financial statements."
"547","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"548","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"549","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"550","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"551","risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"552","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"553","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"554","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"555","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"556","a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"557","the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"558","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"559","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"560","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"561","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"562","that a material misstatement of the Company's annual"
"563","or interim financial statements will not be prevented"
"564","or detected on a timely basis."
"565","Our consideration of the Companys internal control over"
"566","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"567","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"568","all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"569","reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"570","standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"571","Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"572","deficiencies in the Companys internal control over"
"573","financial reporting and its operation, including"
"574","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider"
"575","to be material weaknesses as defined above as of October"
"576","31, 2010."
"577","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"578","use of management and the Board of Trustees of Legg Mason"
"579","Global Asset Management Trust and the Securities and"
"580","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should"
"581","not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"592","LEGG MASON GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT TRUST"
"593","LEGG MASON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT DISCIPLINED EQUITY"
"594","RESEARCH FUND"
"595","The fund invests primarily in securities that, in the"
"596","opinion of the investment manager (manager), offer the"
"597","potential for capital growth."
"598","The fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets,"
"599","plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in equity"
"600","securities. This policy will not be changed without"
"601","providing shareholders with at least 60 days prior"
"602","written notice. The manager utilizes a long-term,"
"603","fundamental, valuation-based investment process to make"
"604","investment decisions for the fund. Through a disciplined"
"605","application of this research-intensive process, the"
"606","manager will seek to generate returns for the fund in"
"607","excess of the Russell 1000 Index by purchasing securities"
"608","at large discounts to the managers assessment of their"
"609","intrinsic value. While it is expected that the majority"
"610","of the funds assets will be invested in equity securities"
"611","issued by companies in the Russell 1000 Index, the fund"
"612","may invest in securities issued by companies of any size"
"613","and by foreign companies."
"614","The managers investment research analysts have direct"
"615","responsibility for selecting securities for the fund."
"616","The analysts are assigned to one or more teams that are"
"617","responsible for particular sectors of the market. The"
"618","funds portfolio is divided into segments each managed"
"619","by an analyst team. Each analyst team determines how its"
"620","respective segment will be invested and chooses investments"
"621","for the fund from the market sectors that the team covers."
"622","It is expected that under normal circumstances the fund"
"623","will have broad exposure to a variety of market sectors."
"624","Investment decisions by any particular analyst team are"
"625","subject to the funds investment objectives, policies and"
"626","restrictions and the oversight of the team leader. The"
"627","managers Director of Research is responsible for"
"628","overseeing the funds investment program and for allocating"
"629","fund assets among the analyst teams in order to obtain"
"630","broad exposure to a variety of market sectors."
"631","The fund may also invest in debt securities. The fund may"
"632","invest up to 20% of its total assets in long-term debt"
"633","securities, including up to 10% of its total assets that"
"634","may be invested in debt securities rated below investment"
"635","grade, and unrated securities judged by the manager to be"
"636","below investment grade. These below-investment grade"
"637","securities are commonly known as junk bonds."
"638","The fund may, but need not, use derivative contracts for"
"639","hedging and investment purposes. The fund may also hold"
"640","cash or cash equivalents."
"641","The fund may take temporary defensive and cash management"
"642","positions; in such a case, the fund may not be pursuing"
"643","its principal investment strategies and may not achieve"
"644","its investment objective."
