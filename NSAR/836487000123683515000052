"7684","Portfolio, and US Real Estate Portfolio (the"
"7685","Portfolios) (twenty-six of the portfolios"
"7686","constituting Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund, Inc.)"
"7687","as of and for the period ended December 31, 2014,"
"7688","in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"7689","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"7690","States), we considered their internal control over"
"7691","financial reporting, including controls over"
"7692","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"7693","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"7694","our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"7695","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"7696","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"7697","effectiveness of the Portfolios' internal control over"
"7698","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no"
"7699","such opinion."
"7700","The management of the Portfolios is responsible for"
"7701","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"7702","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"7703","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"7704","management are required to assess the expected"
"7705","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"7706","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"7707","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"7708","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"7709","preparation of financial statements for external"
"7710","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"7711","accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"7712","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"7713","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"7714","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"7715","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"7716","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"7717","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"7718","to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"7719","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"7720","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"7721","company are being made only in accordance with"
"7722","authorizations of management and directors of the"
"7723","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"7724","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"7725","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"7726","company's assets that could have a material effect"
"7727","on the financial statements."
"7728","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"7729","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"7730","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"7731","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"7732","risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"7733","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"7734","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"7735","deteriorate."
"7736","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"7737","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"7738","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"7739","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"7740","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"7741","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"7742","a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"7743","over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"7744","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"7745","the company's annual or interim financial statements"
"7746","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"7747","Our consideration of the Portfolios' internal control"
"7748","over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"7749","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"7750","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"7751","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"7752","standards established by the Public Company"
"7753","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"7754","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Portfolios'"
"7755","internal control over financial reporting and its"
"7756","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"7757","securities that we consider to be a material weakness"
"7758","as defined above as of December 31, 2014."
"7759","This report is intended solely for the information and"

"9521","INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT made"
"9522","this 30th day of June, 2009 by and between Morgan"
"9523","Stanley Institutional Fund, Inc., a Maryland"
"9524","corporation (the Fund), and Morgan Stanley"
"9525","Investment Management Inc. (formerly, Morgan"
"9526","Stanley Asset Management Inc.), a Delaware"
"9527","corporation (the Adviser)."
"9528","       RECITALS"
"9529","       WHEREAS, the Fund entered into an"
"9530","Investment Advisory Agreement to provide"
"9531","investment advisory services with the Adviser,"
"9532","effective as of May 1, 1997, as amended (the"
"9533","Current Investment Advisory Agreement); and"
"9534","       WHEREAS, as of November 1, 2004, the"
"9535","Current Investment Advisory Agreement was"
"9536","amended and restated (the Amended Investment
Advisory Agreement) to reduce the fee payable"
"9537","with respect to certain series of the Fund; and"
"9538","       WHEREAS, this Agreement amends and"
"9539","restates, in its entirety, the Amended Investment"
"9540","Advisory Agreement to incorporate amendments"
"9541","thereto and to make other ministerial changes"
"9542","designed to facilitate the administration of this"
"9543","Agreement."
"9544","       AGREEMENTS"
"9545","       Now, Therefore, the Fund and the Adviser"
"9546","agree as follows:"
"9547","       1.	Duties of Adviser.  The Fund"
"9548","hereby appoints the Adviser to act as investment"
"9549","adviser to the series of the Fund set forth on"
"9550","Schedule A hereto, as such Schedule A may be"
"9551","amended from time to time (each a Portfolio and,"
"9552","collectively, the Portfolios), for the period and on"
"9553","such terms as set forth in this Agreement.  The Fund"
"9554","employs the Adviser to manage the investment and"
"9555","reinvestment of the assets of the Fund's Portfolios,"
"9556","to continuously review, supervise and administer the"
"9557","investment program of each of the Portfolios, to"
"9558","determine in its discretion the securities to be"
"9559","purchased or sold and the portion of each such"
"9560","Portfolio's assets to be held uninvested, to provide"
"9561","the Fund with records concerning the Adviser's"
"9562","activities which the Fund is required to maintain,"
"9563","and to render regular reports to the Fund's officers"
"9564","and Board of Directors concerning the Adviser's"
"9565","discharge of the foregoing responsibilities.  The"
"9566","Adviser shall discharge the foregoing"
"9567","responsibilities subject to the control of the officers"
"9568","and the Board of Directors of the Fund, and in"
"9569","compliance with the objectives, policies and"
"9570","limitations set forth in the Fund's prospectus and"
"9571","applicable laws and regulations.  The Adviser"
"9572","accepts such employment and agrees to render the"
"9573","services and to provide, at its own expense, the"
"9574","office space, furnishings and equipment and the"
"9575","personnel required by it to perform the services on"
"9576","the terms and for the compensation provided herein."
"9577","       2.	Portfolio Transactions.  The"
"9578","Adviser is authorized to select the brokers or dealers"
"9579","that will execute the purchases and sales of securities"
"9580","for each of the Fund's Portfolios and is directed to"
"9581","use its best efforts to obtain the best available price"
"9582","and most favorable execution, except as prescribed"
"9583","herein.  Unless and until otherwise directed by the"
"9584","Board of Directors of the Fund, the Adviser may"
"9585","also be authorized to effect individual securities"
"9586","transactions at commission rates in excess of the"
"9587","minimum commission rates available, if the Adviser"
"9588","determines in good faith that such amount of"
"9589","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of"
"9590","the brokerage or research services provided by such"
"9591","broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that"
"9592","particular transaction or the Adviser's overall"
"9593","responsibilities with respect to the Fund.  The"
"9594","execution of such transactions shall not be deemed"
"9595","to represent an unlawful act or breach of any duty"
"9596","created by this Agreement or otherwise.  The"
"9597","Adviser will promptly communicate to the officers"
"9598","and Directors of the Fund such information relating"
"9599","to portfolio transactions as they may reasonably"
"9600","request."
"9601","       3.	Compensation of the Adviser.  For"
"9602","the services to be rendered by the Adviser as"
"9603","provided in Section 1 of this Agreement, the Fund"
"9604","shall pay to the Adviser at the end of each of the"
"9605","Fund's fiscal quarters, an advisory fee calculated by"
"9606","applying a quarterly rate, based on the annual"
"9607","percentage rates set forth on Schedule A to this"
"9608","Agreement attached hereto, to the average daily net"
"9609","assets of each of the Portfolios for the quarter."
"9610","       In the event of termination of this"
"9611","Agreement, the fee set forth in Schedule A to this"
"9612","Agreement shall be computed on the basis of the"
"9613","period ending on the last business day on which this"
"9614","Agreement is in effect subject to a pro rata"
"9615","adjustment based on the number of days elapsed in"
"9616","the current fiscal quarter as a percentage of the total"
"9617","number of days in such quarter."
"9618","       4.	Other Services.  At the request of"
"9619","the Fund, the Adviser in its discretion may make"
"9620","available to the Fund office facilities, equipment,"
"9621","personnel and other services.  Such office facilities,"
"9622","equipment, personnel and services shall be provided"
"9623","for or rendered by the Adviser and billed to the Fund"
"9624","at the Adviser's cost."
"9625","       5.	Reports.  The Fund and the Adviser"
"9626","agree to furnish to each other current prospectuses,"
"9627","proxy statements, reports to shareholders, certified"
"9628","copies of their financial statements, and such other"
"9629","information with regard to their affairs as each may"
"9630","reasonably request."
"9631","       6.	Status of Adviser.  The services of"
"9632","the Adviser to the Fund are not to be deemed"
"9633","exclusive, and the Adviser shall be free to render"
"9634","similar services to others."
"9635","       7.	Liability of Adviser.  In the"
"9636","absence of (i) willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross"
"9637","negligence on the part of the Adviser in performance"
"9638","of its obligations and duties hereunder, (ii) reckless"
"9639","disregard by the Adviser of its obligations and duties"
"9640","hereunder, or (iii) a loss resulting from a breach of"

"9642","compensation for services (in which case any award"
"9643","of damages shall be limited to the period and the"
"9644","amount set forth in Section 36(b)(3) of the"
"9645","Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act), the"
"9646","Adviser shall not be subject to any liability"
"9647","whatsoever to the Fund, or to any shareholder of the"
"9648","Fund, for any error or judgment, mistake of law or"
"9649","any other act or omission in the course of, or"
"9650","connected with, rendering services hereunder"
"9651","including, without limitation, for any losses that may"
"9652","be sustained in connection with the purchase,"
"9653","holding, redemption or sale of any security on behalf"
"9654","of any Portfolio of the Fund."
"9655","       8.	Permissible Interests.  Subject to"
"9656","and in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation"
"9657","of the Fund and the Certificate of Incorporation of"
"9658","the Adviser, Directors, officers, agents and"
"9659","shareholders of the Fund are or may be interested in"
"9660","the Adviser (or any successor thereof) as Directors,"
"9661","officers, agents, shareholders or otherwise;"
"9662","Directors, officers, agents and shareholders of the"
"9663","Adviser are or may be interested in the Fund as"
"9664","Directors, officers, shareholders or otherwise; and"
"9665","the Adviser (or any successor) is or may be"
"9666","interested in the Fund as a shareholder or otherwise;"
"9667","and that the effect of any such interrelationships"
"9668","shall be governed by said Articles of Incorporation,"
"9669","Certificate of Incorporation and the provisions of the"

"9671","       9.	Duration and Termination.  This"
"9672","Agreement, unless sooner terminated as provided"
"9673","herein, shall continue in effect with respect to each"
"9674","Portfolio for a period of up to one year from the"
"9675","effective date hereof (except with respect to any"
"9676","Portfolio added to Schedule A of this Agreement"
"9677","after the date hereof, for an initial period of two"
"9678","years from the date that such Portfolio is added) and"
"9679","thereafter provided such continuance is specifically"
"9680","approved at least annually (a) by the vote of a"
"9681","majority of those members of the Board of Directors"
"9682","of the Fund who are not parties to this Agreement or"
"9683","interested persons of any such party, cast in person"
"9684","at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such"
"9685","approval, and (b) by the Board of Directors of the"
"9686","Fund or by vote of a majority of the outstanding"
"9687","voting securities of each Portfolio of the Fund;"
"9688","provided however, that if the holders of any"
"9689","Portfolio fail to approve the Agreement as provided"
"9690","herein, the Adviser may continue to serve in such"
"9691","capacity in the manner and to the extent permitted"
"9692","by the 1940 Act and Rules thereunder.  This"
"9693","Agreement may be terminated by any Portfolio of"
"9694","the Fund at any time, without the payment of any"
"9695","penalty, by vote of a majority of the entire Board of"
"9696","Directors of the Fund or by vote of a majority of the"
"9697","outstanding voting securities of the Portfolio on 60"
"9698","days' written notice to the Adviser.  This Agreement"
"9699","may be terminated by the Adviser at any time,"
"9700","without the payment of any penalty, upon 90 days'"
"9701","written notice to the Fund.  This agreement will"
"9702","automatically and immediately terminate in the"
"9703","event of its assignment, provided that an assignment"
"9704","to a corporate successor to all or substantially all of"
"9705","the Adviser's business or to a wholly-owned"
"9706","subsidiary of such corporate successor which does"
"9707","not result in a change of actual control of the"
"9708","Adviser's business shall not be deemed to be an"
"9709","assignment for the purposes of this Agreement.  Any"
"9710","notice under this Agreement shall be given in"
"9711","writing, addressed and delivered or mailed postpaid,"
"9712","to the other party at any office of such party and"
"9713","shall be deemed given when received by the"
"9714","addressee."
"9715","       As used in this Section 9, the terms"
"9716","assignment, interested persons, and a vote of a
majority of the outstanding voting securities shall"
"9717","have the respective meanings set forth in"
"9718","Section 2(a)(4), Section 2(a)(19) and"
"9719","Section 2(a)(42) of the 1940 Act."
"9720","       10.	Amendment of Agreement.  This"
"9721","Agreement may be amended by mutual consent, but"
"9722","the consent of the Fund must be approved (a) by"
"9723","vote of a majority of those members of the Board of"
"9724","Directors of the Fund who are not parties to this"
"9725","Agreement or interested persons of any such party,"
"9726","cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of"
"9727","voting on such amendment, and (b) by vote of a"
"9728","majority of the outstanding voting securities of each"
"9729","Portfolio of the Fund."
"9730","       11.	Use of Name.  The Fund agrees that"
"9731","if this Agreement is terminated and the Adviser shall"
"9732","no longer be the adviser to the Fund, the Fund will,"
"9733","within a reasonable period of time, change its name"
"9734","to delete reference to Morgan Stanley."
"9735","       12.	Severability.  If any provisions of"
"9736","this Agreement shall be held or made invalid by a"
"9737","court decision, statute, rule or otherwise, the"
"9738","remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected"
"9739","thereby."
"9740","       13.	Applicable Law.  This Agreement"
"9741","shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the"
"9742","State of New York, provided, however, that nothing"
"9743","herein shall be construed as being inconsistent with"
"9744","the 1940 Act."
"9745","       14.	Counterparts.  This Agreement"
"9746","may be executed in one or more counterparts, each"
"9747","of which shall be deemed to be an original."

"10558","ARTICLE I"
"10559","Duties of the Local Manager"
"10560","       The Investment Adviser hereby employs the"
"10561","Local Manager to act as discretionary investment"
"10562","manager to the Investment Adviser and to furnish"
"10563","the investment management services described"
"10564","below, subject to the broad supervision of the"
"10565","Investment Adviser and the Fund, for the period and"
"10566","on the terms and conditions set forth in this"
"10567","Agreement.  The Local Manager hereby accepts"
"10568","such employment and agrees during such period, at"
"10569","its own expense, to render, or arrange for the"
"10570","rendering of, such services and to assume the"
"10571","obligations herein set forth for the compensation"
"10572","provided for herein.  The Investment Adviser and its"
"10573","affiliates shall for all purposes herein be deemed a"
"10574","Professional Client as defined under the rules and"
"10575","guidance promulgated by the Financial Conduct"
"10576","Authority in the FCA Handbook (hereinafter"
"10577","referred to as the FCA Rules).  The Investment"
"10578","Adviser has the right to request to be treated as a"
"10579","retail client.  Classification as a retail client requires"
"10580","the Local Manager to exercise a higher level of"
"10581","protective care under the regulatory system."
"10582","However, the Local Manager is not obliged to accept"
"10583","any such request.  The Investment Adviser should be"
"10584","aware that professional clients will not be entitled to"
"10585","certain protections afforded by the FCA Rules to"
"10586","retail clients.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Local"
"10587","Manager will, for purposes of the FCA Rules, only"
"10588","treat the Investment Adviser (but not the Fund) as its"
"10589","customer from both a regulatory and a contractual"
"10590","perspective. The Local Manager and its affiliates"
"10591","shall for all purposes herein each be deemed to be an"
"10592","independent contractor and shall, unless otherwise"
"10593","expressly provided or authorized, have no authority"
"10594","to act for or represent the Fund in any way or"
"10595","otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund."
"10596","       The Local Manager shall have full"
"10597","discretion, power and authority on the Fund's behalf"
"10598","to buy, sell, retain, exchange or otherwise deal in"
"10599","investments and other assets, make deposits,"
"10600","subscribe to issues and offers for sale and accept"
"10601","placings of any investments, enter into foreign"
"10602","currency transactions on a spot or forward basis,"
"10603","effect transactions on any markets, take all day to"
"10604","day decisions and otherwise act as the Local"
"10605","Manager judges appropriate in relation to the"
"10606","investment and reinvestment of the portfolio of"
"10607","assets of each Portfolio.  This includes performing"
"10608","all acts and executing all documents which the Local"
"10609","Manager reasonably considers incidental thereto,"
"10610","including (without limitation) power to execute and"
"10611","deliver all applications, requests, or claims for"
"10612","refund, reduction, repayment or credit of, or"
"10613","exemption or relief from, any withholding tax or"
"10614","similar taxes in any jurisdiction in which such"
"10615","applications, requests or claims may be made."
"10616","Subject to guidelines adopted by each Portfolio, the"
"10617","Local Manager shall also make recommendations or"
"10618","take action as to the manner in which voting rights,"
"10619","rights to consent to corporate action and any other"
"10620","rights pertaining to the portfolio of assets of each"
"10621","Portfolio shall be exercised.  All of the foregoing is"
"10622","subject always to the restrictions of the Articles of"
"10623","Incorporation and By-Laws of the Fund, as they may"
"10624","be amended and/or restated from time to time and as"
"10625","provided to the Local Manager by the Investment"
"10626","Adviser, the provisions of the Investment Company"
"10627","Act and the statements relating to each Portfolio's"
"10628","investment objective(s), investment policies and"

"10633","(the Prospectus and Statement of Additional
Information, respectively), as well as to the"
"10634","supervision of the Investment Adviser and the Board"
"10635","of Directors of the Fund."

"10637","behalf of the Investment Adviser or the Fund, nor"
"10638","will the Local Manager be the registered holder of"

"10640","or the Fund or be the custodian of documents or"
"10641","other evidence of title."

"10649","       The Local Manager assumes and shall pay"

"10658","furnished and expenses assumed by the Local"

"10667","Investment Adviser to the Local Manager in respect"

"11314","ORDER EXECUTION POLICY DISCLOSURE"
"11315","STATEMENT"
"11316","Transaction Execution Arrangements"
"11317","Morgan Stanley Investment Management Limited ("
"11318","the Local Manager) has established and"
"11319","implemented transaction execution arrangements"
"11320","that are designed to allow the Local Manager to take"
"11321","all reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result"
"11322","when executing or placing orders as portfolio"
"11323","manager on behalf of its clients in relation to"
"11324","financial instruments that form part, or may become"
"11325","part, of one or more investment portfolios managed"
"11326","by the Local Manager for that or those clients (each"
"11327","a Transaction).  For the purposes of this"
"11328","document: any reference to the Local Manager"
"11329","executing an order is a reference to the Local"
"11330","Manager, as agent, entering into a Transaction on"
"11331","behalf of a client with another person that acts as"
"11332","principal to that Transaction, any reference to the"
"11333","Local Manager placing an order is a reference to"
"11334","the Local Manager, as agent, arranging for a"
"11335","Transaction to be entered into by another person that"
"11336","acts as agent on behalf of a client when entering into"
"11337","that Transaction, and any reference to the Local"
"11338","Manager effecting a Transaction is a reference to"
"11339","the Local Manager either placing or executing an"
"11340","order."
"11341","As part of its transaction execution arrangements,"
"11342","the Local Manager has an order execution policy in"
"11343","place that is designed to ensure that the Local"
"11344","Manager complies with its duty to obtain the best"
"11345","possible result when effecting a Transaction for one"
"11346","or more clients (the Order Execution Policy)."
"11347","This document is intended to provide the Local"
"11348","Manager's clients with a summary of the Local"
"11349","Manager's Order Execution Policy. Nothing herein"
"11350","is intended to place upon the Local Manager"
"11351","fiduciary or other duties or responsibilities over and"
"11352","above the specific obligations provided for in the"
"11353","investment management agreement between the"
"11354","Local Manager and a client."
"11355","The quality of execution"
"11356","Where the Local Manager effects a Transaction for"
"11357","its professional clients, subject to any specific"
"11358","instructions received from a client, the Local"
"11359","Manager will determine the best possible result"
"11360","taking the following factors into account: (a)  price;"
"11361","(b) costs; (c) speed; (d) likelihood of execution or"
"11362","settlement; (e) size of the Transaction; (f) nature of"
"11363","the Transaction; and (g) any other consideration"
"11364","relevant to the Transaction, including availability of"
"11365","liquidity, the impact on the market of the"
"11366","Transaction and the Local Manager's operational"
"11367","costs."
"11368","Price is normally judged with reference to normal"
"11369","market size for the relevant financial instrument."
"11370","Where trades are outside of normal market size and"
"11371","in sizeable volume or made on an over the counter"
"11372","basis, it is not generally possible to source a quote"
"11373","for price from Brokers because a declaration of"
"11374","intention to deal could result in market/security price"
"11375","sensitivity.  As a result, the Local Manager must"
"11376","then determine what is likely to be the best"
"11377","execution venue without being able to get firm"
"11378","quotes, but there can be no guarantee that it will be."
"11379","In certain circumstances, the relevant execution"
"11380","venue may not be able to provide sufficient"
"11381","immediately available liquidity to carry the"
"11382","contemplated Transaction out in full at the time"
"11383","required. In addition, other circumstances may"
"11384","dictate that the best immediately available price for a"
"11385","Transaction may not be the best possible result for"
"11386","that Transaction.  Where, in the Local Manager's"
"11387","opinion, those circumstances occur the Local"
"11388","Manager may need to split the Transaction up into"
"11389","multiple Transactions with a view to obtaining the"
"11390","best possible result in relation to the original"
"11391","Transaction by completing that Transaction over a"
"11392","period of time using a variety of execution venues."
"11393","The Local Manager will determine the relative"
"11394","importance of each factor using the following"
"11395","criteria: (a) the characteristics of the Investment"
"11396","Adviser; (b) the characteristics and nature of the"
"11397","Transaction, including whether any specific"
"11398","instructions are given by the Investment Adviser; (c)"
"11399","the characteristics of the financial instruments that"
"11400","are the subject of the Transaction; and (d) the"
"11401","characteristics of the execution venues to which the"
"11402","Transaction can be directed."
"11403","While the Local Manager will take all reasonable"
"11404","steps, based on the resources available to it, to"
"11405","satisfy itself that it has processes in place that can"
"11406","reasonably be expected to lead to the delivery of the"
"11407","best possible result, the Local Manager does not"
"11408","guarantee that it will always be able to obtain the"
"11409","best possible result in relation to each Transaction."
"11410","Specific Instructions"
"11411","Where a client provides the Local Manager with a"
"11412","specific instruction in relation to a proposed"
"11413","Transaction or any particular aspect of that"
"11414","Transaction (including, but not limited to, a direction"
"11415","to execute on a particular venue) the Local Manager"
"11416","will effect that Transaction in accordance with those"
"11417","instructions. Specific instructions may prevent the"
"11418","Local Manager from following some or all of the"
"11419","steps provided for in the Order Execution Policy"
"11420","which are designed to obtain the best possible result"
"11421","in respect of the elements covered by those"
"11422","instructions."
"11423","In following such instructions, the Local Manager"
"11424","will be deemed to have taken all reasonable steps to"
"11425","provide the best possible result in respect of the"
"11426","relevant Transaction or aspect of that Transaction"
"11427","covered by the specific instructions. To the extent"
"11428","that specific instructions are not comprehensive, the"
"11429","Local Manager will determine any non-specified"
"11430","components in accordance with its Order Execution"
"11431","Policy."
"11432","Selection of Execution Venues"
"11433","The Local Manager includes in its Order Execution"
"11434","Policy those execution venues (sources of liquidity)"
"11435","that enable the Local Manager to obtain on a"
"11436","consistent basis the best possible result in relation to"
"11437","the Transactions. The Local Manager may use one"
"11438","or more of the following venues types: (a) Regulated"
"11439","Markets; (b) Multilateral Trading Facilities; (c)"
"11440","Systematic Internalisers; (d) third party investment"
"11441","firms; and/or (e) non-EU entities performing similar"
"11442","functions. In this document, the terms Regulated
Market, Multilateral Trading Facility and"
"11443","Systematic Internaliser have the meaning given to"
"11444","them in the Markets in Financial Instruments"
"11445","Directive."
"11446","Certain Transactions may be effected outside a"
"11447","Regulated Market or a Multilateral Trading Facility"
"11448","where the Local Manager believes it can achieve the"
"11449","best possible result by doing so."
"11450","The Local Manager assesses product-by-product"
"11451","which venues are likely to provide the best possible"
"11452","result, it also monitors the execution of all"
"11453","Transactions on that venue if an order has been"
"11454","placed with another person and keeps informed of"
"11455","relevant market information. For certain financial"
"11456","instruments, there may be only one execution venue"
"11457","available and in such circumstances, the Local"
"11458","Manager will presume that it has obtained the best"
"11459","possible result if it effects a Transaction in that"
"11460","venue."
"11461","If a Transaction is effected by placing an order with"
"11462","another person for execution, the Local Manager"
"11463","will either determine the ultimate execution venue"
"11464","itself and instruct the other person accordingly, or"
"11465","the Local Manager will use all reasonable efforts to"
"11466","satisfy itself that the other person has arrangements"
"11467","in place to enable the Local Manager to comply with"
"11468","the Local Manager's obligation to obtain the best"
"11469","possible result in relation to the relevant Transaction."
"11470","Approval of brokers, monitoring and review"
"11471","The Local Manager's Order Execution Policy"
"11472","provides for a broker approval procedure. Apart"
"11473","from a broker's commission/commission equivalent"
"11474","rates, the Local Manager will consider the following"
"11475","matters when selecting and approving a broker: (a)"
"11476","reliability, integrity and reputation in the industry;"
"11477","(b) execution capabilities, including block"
"11478","positioning, speed of execution and quality and"
"11479","responsiveness of its trading desk; (c) knowledge of,"
"11480","and access to, the markets for the securities being"
"11481","traded; (d) ability to obtain price improvement; (e)"
"11482","ability to maintain confidentiality; (f) ability to"
"11483","handle non-traditional trades; (g) technology"
"11484","infrastructure; and (h) clearance and settlement"
"11485","capabilities."
"11486","In addition, in certain circumstances and in some"
"11487","markets, a broker's research capabilities may be"
"11488","considered relevant factors in connection with the"
"11489","selection and approval of a broker. This may include"
"11490","a broker's coverage of certain industries in which the"
"11491","Local Manager may seek to invest on behalf of its"
"11492","clients, the quality of the broker's research, as well"
"11493","as the reputation and standing of the broker's"
"11494","analysts, their investment strategies, timing,"
"11495","accuracy of statistical information and idea"
"11496","generation."
"11497","The Local Manager monitors the quality of the"
"11498","execution services provided by approved brokers"
"11499","and reviews each broker's performance on a regular"
"11500","basis, taking the above factors into account. The"
"11501","Local Manager meets with the most significant"
"11502","brokers periodically to review the service and"
"11503","performance levels provided."
"11504","Commission Rates"
"11505","The Local Manager effects Transactions on the basis"
"11506","of standard commission rates for specific markets."
"11507","The rates are negotiated from time to time with each"
"11508","broker to ensure competitiveness, taking into"
"11509","account market trends whilst seeking a commercial"
"11510","balance so as to ensure the quality of services"
"11511","provided by the brokers."

"11553","effecting Transactions, may make payments on"

"11555","Services and about certain non-monetary benefits"
"11556","that the Local Manager may receive from certain"

"11559","The conditions upon which dealing commissions"
"11560","will be paid to providers of Research Services"
"11561","The Local Manager will only make payments to a"
"11562","broker in consideration of the provision of Research"
"11563","Services when it is satisfied using its reasonable"
"11564","judgement that the Research Services received in"
"11565","return for the payments will reasonably assist the"
"11566","Local Manager in the provision of its portfolio"
"11567","management services to the investment advisers on"
"11568","whose behalf the relevant Transactions are being"
"11569","effected and do not, and are not likely to, impair"
"11570","compliance with the duty of the Local Manager to"
"11571","act in the best interests of its clients (including,"
"11572","without limitation, its obligation to take all"
"11573","reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result"
"11574","when effecting a Transaction)."
"11575","The manner in which dealing commissions are"
"11576","paid to providers of research services"
"11577","If the conditions for payment have been satisfied, the"
"11578","eligible providers of Research Services may be"
"11579","remunerated for the provision of Research Services"
"11580","as part of the Local Manager's commission sharing"
"11581","arrangements. Under the commission sharing"
"11582","arrangements, the Local Manager will instruct"
"11583","participating brokers to record a certain portion of"
"11584","dealing commission that is received pursuant to the"
"11585","completion of a Transaction, based upon a"
"11586","previously agreed allocation, as research credits"
"11587","(each a Pool). Each of the participating brokers"
"11588","has undertaken to the Local Manager,"
"11589","periodically, subject to an instruction from the Local"
"11590","Manager, to make payments from their Pool to"
"11591","providers of Research Services (including the"
"11592","administering broker itself) as the Local Manager"
"11593","may specify in the instruction(s). Any balance that"
"11594","may remain after allocation instructions have been"
"11595","carried out will be carried forward to the next period."
"11596","The Local Manager allocates the Pools based on a"
"11597","periodic assessment of the quality of the Research"
"11598","Services provided to the Local Manager by the"
"11599","participating brokers during that period. The Local"
"11600","Manager tends to consider, without limitation, the"
"11601","quality of the analyst service, the sales service, and"
"11602","the company meetings that have been arranged with"
"11603","senior management of companies in which the Local"
"11604","Manager invests for its clients.  Decisions are being"
"11605","taken based on a voting system in which the Local"
"11606","Manager equity portfolio managers participate. As"
"11607","part of a relationship management effort, the Local"
"11608","Manager will meet periodically with those providers"
"11609","of Research Services that the Local Manager deems"
"11610","most significant."
"11611","The conditions upon which the Local Manager"
"11612","employees may accept non-monetary benefits from"

"11614","The Local Manager's employees that interact with"
"11615","brokers may from time to time receive certain non-"
"11616","monetary benefits in the form of gifts. The Local"
"11617","Manager has detailed compliance procedures"
"11618","relating to the standard of conduct expected from"
"11619","employees in these circumstances which are"
"11620","designed to achieve that receipt of such gifts does"
"11621","not, and is not likely to, impair compliance with the"
"11622","duty of the Local Manager and its employees to act"
"11623","in the best interests of its clients. Most gifts are"
"11624","received during the holiday season and depending on"
"11625","the number received gifts are either put into a raffle"

"11632","INFORMATION ON THE NATURE AND"
"11633","RISKS OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS"
"11634","The information contained in this notice cannot"
"11635","disclose everything about the nature and risks of all"
"11636","financial instruments in each Portfolio.  Rather it is a"
"11637","general description of the nature and risks of"
"11638","financial instruments, which explains the nature of"
"11639","the specific types of instruments which the"
"11640","Investment Adviser may include in each Portfolio's"
"11641","investment guidelines (the Investment
Guidelines), as well as the risks particular to those"
"11642","instruments.  The Investment Adviser should not"
"11643","include these financial instruments in the Investment"
"11644","Guidelines unless the Investment Adviser"
"11645","understand the nature of the financial instruments"
"11646","the Investment Adviser is permitting Morgan"
"11647","Stanley Investment Management Limited (the"
"11648","Local Manager) to enter into on the Investment"
"11649","Adviser's behalf and the extent of the Investment"
"11650","Adviser's exposure to risk.  The Investment Adviser"
"11651","should also be satisfied that such financial"
"11652","instruments are suitable for each Portfolio in light of"
"11653","the Investment Adviser's circumstances and"
"11654","financial position.  Certain strategies, such as a"
"11655","spread position or straddle, may be as risky as a"
"11656","simple long or short position.  While financial"
"11657","instruments can be utilised for the management of"
"11658","investment risk, certain financial instruments are"
"11659","unsuitable for certain investors.  Different financial"
"11660","instruments involve different levels of exposure to"
"11661","risk, and in deciding whether to include such"
"11662","instruments in the Investment Guidelines, the"
"11663","Investment Adviser should be aware of the"
"11664","following points."
"11665","1.	GENERAL"
"11666","1.1	Returns"
"11667","The value of investments and the income from them"
"11668","may fluctuate and go down as well as up.  There is"
"11669","no guarantee that the investment objective will"
"11670","actually be achieved or that the Investment Adviser"
"11671","will get back the amount initially invested.  The"
"11672","value of investments may be affected by a variety of"
"11673","factors, including economic and political"
"11674","developments, interest rates and foreign exchange"
"11675","rates, as well as issuer-specific events."
"11676","1.2	Currency Risk"
"11677","Investments denominated in currencies other than"
"11678","the Investment Adviser's base currency carry the"
"11679","risk of exchange-rate movements.  A movement in"
"11680","exchange rates may have a separate effect,"
"11681","unfavourable as well as favourable, on gains and"
"11682","losses in a Portfolio.  Hedging techniques may, in"
"11683","certain circumstances, be limited or not be"
"11684","successful."
"11685","1.3	Investments which are not Readily"
"11686","Realisable"
"11687","The market for some investments may be restricted"
"11688","or illiquid.  Subject to the Investment Guidelines, the"
"11689","Local Manager may effect transactions in such"
"11690","investments for a Portfolio.  There may be no readily"
"11691","available market and from time to time there may be"
"11692","difficulty in dealing in such investments or obtaining"
"11693","reliable information about the value and extent of"
"11694","risks associated with such investments."
"11695","2.	EQUITY SECURITIES AND DEBT"
"11696","SECURITIES"
"11697","Buying equity securities (the most common form of"
"11698","which are shares) will mean that the Investment"
"11699","Adviser will become a member of the issuer"
"11700","company and participate fully in its economic risk."
"11701","Holding equity securities will generally entitle the"
"11702","Investment Adviser to receive any dividend"
"11703","distributed each year (if any) out of the issuer's"
"11704","profits made during the reference period."
"11705","On the other hand, buying debt securities (such as"
"11706","bonds and certificates of deposit) will mean that the"
"11707","Investment Adviser is, in effect, a lender to the"
"11708","company or entity that has issued the securities."
"11709","Holding debt securities will entitle the Investment"
"11710","Adviser to receive specified periodic interest"
"11711","payments, as well as repayment of the principal at"
"11712","maturity."
"11713","Generally, holdings in equity securities will expose"
"11714","the Investment Adviser to more risk than debt"
"11715","securities since remuneration is tied more closely to"
"11716","the profitability of the issuer.  In the event of"
"11717","insolvency of the issuer, the Investment Adviser's"
"11718","claims for recovery of the Investment Adviser's"
"11719","equity investment in the issuer will generally be"
"11720","subordinated to the claims of both preferred or"
"11721","secured creditors and ordinary unsecured creditors of"
"11722","the issuer."
"11723","There is an extra risk of losing money when shares"
"11724","are bought in some smaller companies, such as"
"11725","penny shares.  There is a usually big difference"
"11726","between the buying price and the selling price of"
"11727","these shares.  If they have to be sold immediately,"
"11728","the Investment Adviser may get back much less than"
"11729","was paid for them.  The price may change quickly"
"11730","and it may go down as well as up."
"11731","Holdings in debt securities, on the other hand,"
"11732","generally risk not being remunerated only if the"
"11733","issuer is in a state of financial distress.  Moreover, in"
"11734","the event of insolvency of the issuer, the Investment"
"11735","Adviser is likely to be able to participate with other"
"11736","creditors in the allotment of the proceeds from the"
"11737","sale of the company's assets in priority to holders of"
"11738","equity securities."
"11739","If the Investment Guidelines allow the Local"
"11740","Manager to buy equity or debt securities the"
"11741","Investment Adviser will be exposed to both the"
"11742","specific risks associated with individual securities"
"11743","held (and the financial soundness of their issuers), as"
"11744","well as the systemic risks of the equity and debt"
"11745","securities markets."
"11746","3.	DERIVATIVES"
"11747","3.1	Futures"
"11748","Transactions in futures involve the obligation to"
"11749","make, or to take, delivery of the underlying asset of"
"11750","the contract at a future date, or in some cases to"
"11751","settle the Investment Adviser's position with cash"
"11752","from a Portfolio or elsewhere.  Transactions in"
"11753","futures carry a high degree of risk.  The gearing or"
"11754","leverage often obtainable in futures trading means"
"11755","that a small deposit or down payment can lead to"
"11756","large losses as well as gains.  It also means that a"
"11757","relatively small market movement can lead to a"
"11758","proportionately much larger movement in the value"
"11759","of the Investment Adviser's investment, and this can"
"11760","work against the Investment Adviser as well as for"
"11761","the Investment Adviser.  Futures transactions have a"
"11762","contingent liability, and the Investment Adviser"
"11763","should be aware of the implications of this, in"
"11764","particular the margining requirements, which are"
"11765","described in paragraph 7.2 below."
"11766","3.2	Options"
"11767","There are many different types of options with"
"11768","different characteristics subject to different"
"11769","conditions:"
"11770","3.2.1	Buying Options:"
"11771","Allowing the Local Manager to buy options involves"
"11772","less risk than allowing the Local Manager to sell"
"11773","options because, if the price of the underlying asset"
"11774","moves against the Investment Adviser, the Local"
"11775","Manager can simply allow the option to lapse.  The"
"11776","maximum loss is limited to the premium, plus any"
"11777","commission or other transaction charges.  However,"
"11778","if the Local Manager buys a call option on a futures"
"11779","contract for the Investment Adviser and later"
"11780","exercises the option, the Investment Adviser will"
"11781","acquire the future.  This will expose the Investment"
"11782","Adviser to the risks described under futures and"
"11783","contingent liability transactions."
"11784","3.2.2	Writing Options:"
"11785","If the Investment Guidelines allow the Local"
"11786","Manager to write an option for the Investment"
"11787","Adviser, the risk involved is considerably greater"
"11788","than buying options.  The Investment Adviser may"
"11789","be liable for margin to maintain its position and a"
"11790","loss may be sustained well in excess of any premium"
"11791","received.  By allowing the Local Manager to write"
"11792","an option on the Investment Adviser's behalf, the"
"11793","Investment Adviser accepts a legal obligation to"
"11794","purchase or sell the underlying asset if the option is"
"11795","exercised against the Investment Adviser, however"
"11796","far the market price has moved away from the"
"11797","exercise price.  If the Investment Adviser already"
"11798","owns the underlying asset which the Local Manager"
"11799","has contracted on the Investment Adviser's behalf to"
"11800","sell as part of a Portfolio (known as covered call
options) the risk is reduced.  If the Investment"
"11801","Adviser does not own the underlying asset (known"
"11802","as uncovered call options) the risk can be"
"11803","unlimited. Only experienced persons should"
"11804","contemplate authorising the Local Manager to write"
"11805","uncovered options, and then only after securing full"
"11806","details of the applicable conditions and potential risk"
"11807","exposure."
"11808","3.2.3	Traditional Options:"
"11809","A particular type of option (called a traditional
option) is written by certain London Stock"
"11810","Exchange firms under special exchange rules.  These"
"11811","may involve greater risk than other options.  Two"
"11812","way prices are not usually quoted and there is no"
"11813","exchange market on which to close out an open"
"11814","position.  It may be difficult to assess the value of a"
"11815","traditional option or for the seller of such an option"
"11816","to manage his exposure to risk.  Again, the"
"11817","Investment Adviser should only provide for the"
"11818","Investment Guidelines to permit the Local Manager"
"11819","to invest in traditional options if the Investment"
"11820","Adviser is fully aware of the risks involved."
"11821","3.2.4	Margin:"
"11822","Certain options markets operate on a margined basis,"
"11823","under which buyers do not pay the full premium on"
"11824","their option at the time they purchase it.  In this"
"11825","situation a Portfolio (or the Investment Adviser if"
"11826","there are insufficient assets in the Fund) may"
"11827","subsequently be called upon to pay margin on the"
"11828","option up to the level of the Investment Adviser's"
"11829","premium.  If the Investment Adviser fails to do so as"
"11830","required, the Investment Adviser's position may be"
"11831","closed or liquidated in the same way as a futures"
"11832","position."
"11833","3.3	Contracts for Differences:"
"11834","A contract for difference is a contract between two"
"11835","parties, buyer and seller, stipulating that the seller"
"11836","will pay to the buyer the difference between the"
"11837","current value of an asset and its value at contract"
"11838","time.  Contracts for differences allow investors to"
"11839","take long or short positions, and unlike futures"
"11840","contracts have no fixed expiry date or contract size."
"11841","Trades are conducted on a leveraged basis and these"
"11842","contracts can only be settled in cash.  Investing in a"
"11843","contract for differences carries the same risks as"
"11844","investing in a future or option and the Investment"
"11845","Adviser should be aware of these as set out in"
"11846","paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 respectively.  Transactions in"
"11847","contracts for differences may also have a contingent"
"11848","liability and the Investment Adviser should be aware"
"11849","of the implications of this as set out in paragraph 7.2"
"11850","below.  As with many leveraged products, maximum"
"11851","exposure is not limited to the initial investment; it is"
"11852","possible to lose more than one put in."
"11853","3.4	Off-Exchange Transactions in Derivatives:"
"11854","It may not always be apparent whether or not a"
"11855","particular derivative is on or off-exchange."
"11856","While some off-exchange markets are highly liquid,"
"11857","transactions in off-exchange or non transferable"
"11858","derivatives may involve greater risk than investing"
"11859","in on-exchange derivatives because there is no"
"11860","exchange market on which to close out an open"
"11861","position.  It may be impossible to liquidate an"
"11862","existing position, to assess the value of the position"
"11863","arising from an off-exchange transaction or to assess"
"11864","the exposure to risk.  Bid and offer prices need not"
"11865","be quoted, and even where they are, they will be"
"11866","established by dealers in these instruments and"
"11867","consequently it may be difficult to establish what a"
"11868","fair price is.  The Investment Adviser should only"
"11869","permit the Local Manager in the Investment"
"11870","Guidelines to invest a Portfolio in off-exchange"
"11871","derivatives transactions if the Investment Adviser is"
"11872","fully aware of the risks involved."
"11873","3.5	ISDA Master Agreement"
"11874","Where the Investment Adviser permits the Local"
"11875","Manager under the Investment Guidelines to enter"
"11876","into derivative transactions, these may be of the type"
"11877","that may be governed by the ISDA Master"
"11878","Agreement.  The ISDA Master Agreement is a"
"11879","standard agreement commonly used in the"
"11880","derivatives market which sets forth key provisions"
"11881","governing the contractual relationship between the"
"11882","parties to such agreement, including each of their"
"11883","rights, liabilities and obligations.  If the Local"
"11884","Manager enters into derivative transactions on the"
"11885","Investment Adviser's behalf, the Local Manager"
"11886","may also enter into a Credit Support Annex.  The"
"11887","Credit Support Annex is an annex to the ISDA"
"11888","Master Agreement and is used to document bilateral"
"11889","credit support arrangements between parties for"
"11890","transactions governed by an ISDA Master"
"11891","Agreement."
"11892","On each date on which a derivatives transaction is"
"11893","entered into, the Investment Adviser will be deemed"
"11894","to have given various representations and"
"11895","undertakings to each counterparty with whom the"
"11896","Local Manager enters into an ISDA Master"
"11897","Agreement on the Investment Adviser's behalf."
"11898","In certain circumstances, the Investment Adviser"
"11899","may be required to pay an additional amount or"
"11900","receive a payment from which an amount is required"
"11901","to be deducted or withheld, in each case in respect of"
"11902","any deduction or withholding for on account of any"
"11903","tax, or be required to pay any stamp tax levied or"
"11904","imposed in respect of the execution or performance"
"11905","of the ISDA Master Agreement."
"11906","Markets and exchanges require that anyone trading"
"11907","in derivatives must advance collateral as security for"
"11908","initial and variation margin requirements.  The Local"
"11909","Manager has been authorised to instruct the"
"11910","Investment Adviser's custodian to advance cash or"
"11911","other collateral acceptable to the counterparty or"
"11912","broker to meet margin payments as required by the"
"11913","rules and regulations of any market or exchange on"
"11914","which derivatives are dealt by the Local Manager as"
"11915","the Investment Adviser's agent.  If, under the rules"
"11916","and regulations of any exchange or market, adverse"
"11917","price movements occur and margin calls are made"
"11918","and insufficient funds are available in the Portfolio"
"11919","to meet such margin calls, the Local Manager may"
"11920","request that the Investment Adviser make additional"
"11921","funds immediately available until assets can be"
"11922","realised to cover the related margin call.  If the"
"11923","Investment Adviser fails to makes such funds"
"11924","available, the Investment Adviser's positions may be"
"11925","closed out and liquidated, resulting in a loss to the"
"11926","Portfolio for which the Local Manager shall not be"
"11927","liable."
"11928","4.	WARRANTS"
"11929","If the Investment Guidelines so permit, the Local"
"11930","Manager may effect transactions in warrants for a"
"11931","Portfolio."
"11932","4.1	Warrants:"
"11933","A warrant is a time-limited right to subscribe for"
"11934","shares, debentures, loan stock or government"
"11935","securities, and is exercisable against the original"
"11936","issuer of the securities.  Warrants often involve a"
"11937","high degree of gearing, so that a relatively small"
"11938","movement in the price of the underlying security"
"11939","results in a disproportionately large movement,"
"11940","favourable or unfavourable in the price of the"
"11941","warrant.  The prices of warrants can therefore be"
"11942","volatile.  The Investment Adviser should not include"
"11943","warrants in the Investment Guidelines unless the"
"11944","Investment Adviser is prepared for a Portfolio to"
"11945","sustain a total loss of the money the Investment"
"11946","Adviser has invested plus any commission or other"
"11947","transaction charges.  Some other instruments are also"
"11948","called warrants but are actually options (for"
"11949","example, a right to acquire securities which is"
"11950","exercisable against someone other than the original"
"11951","issuer of the securities, often called a covered
warrant)."
"11952","If the Investment Adviser is considering including"
"11953","warrants in the Investment Guidelines, it is essential"
"11954","to understand that the right to subscribe which a"
"11955","warrant confers is invariably limited in time."
"11956","Therefore, if the Investment Adviser fails to exercise"
"11957","this right within the pre-determined time scale, the"
"11958","investment becomes worthless."
"11959","4.2	Off-Exchange Transactions:"
"11960","Transactions in off-exchange warrants may involve"
"11961","greater risk than dealing in exchange traded warrants"
"11962","because there is no exchange market through which"
"11963","to liquidate the Investment Adviser's position or to"
"11964","assess the value of the warrant or the exposure to"
"11965","risk.  Bid and offer prices need not be quoted, and"
"11966","even where they are, they will be established by"
"11967","dealers in these instruments and consequently it may"
"11968","be difficult to establish what a fair price is.  The"
"11969","Investment Adviser should only permit the Local"
"11970","Manager in the Investment Guidelines to invest a"
"11971","Portfolio in off-exchange warrants if the Investment"
"11972","Adviser is fully aware of the risks involved."
"11973","5.	COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT"
"11974","SCHEMES"
"11975","Collective investment schemes (such as investment"
"11976","funds and open-ended investment companies) invest"
"11977","funds paid by purchasers of units or shares in the"
"11978","collective investment scheme in the various types of"
"11979","asset provided for in their rules or investment plans."
"11980","As such, collective investment schemes generally"
"11981","allow unit holders and shareholders to achieve a high"
"11982","degree of diversification at a relatively low cost."
"11983","Open-ended investment funds, for example, allow"
"11984","savers to invest or disinvest by buying or selling"
"11985","fund units on the basis of the value of a unit, plus or"
"11986","minus relevant commissions (the value of the unit"
"11987","being obtained by dividing the value of the entire"
"11988","portfolio managed by a Portfolio, calculated at"
"11989","market prices, by the number of units in circulation)."
"11990","Allowing the Local Manager to purchase units or"
"11991","shares in a collective investment scheme will expose"
"11992","the Investment Adviser to the risks associated with"
"11993","the nature of the financial instruments in which the"
"11994","collective investment scheme invests and, where"
"11995","relevant, their concentration in a particular sector,"
"11996","country, region or asset class.  Before allowing the"
"11997","Local Manager to invest in collective investment"
"11998","schemes, the Investment Adviser should make itself"
"11999","fully aware of the risks associated with collective"
"12000","investment schemes, including without limitation,"
"12001","the general risks identified in paragraph 1 above."
"12002","6.	EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS"
"12003","Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are closed-ended"
"12004","collective investment schemes, traded as shares on"
"12005","stock exchanges, and typically replicate a stock"
"12006","market index, market sector, commodity or basket of"
"12007","assets.  As such, they generally combine the"
"12008","flexibility and tradeability of a share with the"
"12009","diversification of a collective investment scheme."
"12010","Where the Investment Guidelines permit the Local"
"12011","Manager to purchase ETFs, the Investment Adviser"
"12012","will be exposed to similar risks as detailed in respect"
"12013","of equity securities and collective investment"
"12014","schemes, as well as the general risks detailed in"
"12015","paragraph 1."
"12016","7.	MISCELLANEOUS"
"12017","7.1	Overseas Markets:"
"12018","Overseas markets may involve different risks to the"
"12019","Investment Adviser's home markets.  In some cases"
"12020","the risks will be greater. In drafting the Investment"
"12021","Guidelines to permit the Local Manager to invest in"
"12022","overseas markets the Investment Adviser should"
"12023","make itself fully aware of the risks and protections"
"12024","(if any) which will operate in any relevant overseas"
"12025","markets.  The potential for profit or loss from"
"12026","transactions on overseas markets or in contracts"
"12027","denominated other than in a Portfolio's base"
"12028","currency will be affected by fluctuations in overseas"
"12029","exchange rates against the Fund's base currency."
"12030","7.2	Contingent Liability Investments:"
"12031","Contingent liability investments are derivatives"
"12032","under the terms of which the Client will or may be"
"12033","liable to make further payments (other than charges,"
"12034","and whether or not secured by margin) when the"
"12035","transaction falls to be completed or upon the earlier"
"12036","closing out of the Investment Adviser's position."
"12037","Contingent liability investments which are margined"
"12038","require a Portfolio (or the Investment Adviser if"
"12039","there are insufficient assets in the Fund) to make a"
"12040","series of payments against the purchase price,"
"12041","instead of paying the whole purchase price"
"12042","immediately."
"12043","If the Investment Adviser permits the Local"
"12044","Manager, as part of the Investment Guidelines, to"
"12045","trade for a Portfolio in futures, contracts for"
"12046","differences or write or otherwise deal on margin in"
"12047","options for the Fund, the Investment Adviser may"
"12048","sustain a total loss of the margin which the Local"
"12049","Manager, on the Investment Adviser's behalf,"
"12050","deposits with a broker to establish or maintain a"
"12051","position.  If the market moves against the Investment"
"12052","Adviser, the Investment Adviser may be called upon"
"12053","to pay out of the Fund (or the Investment Adviser's"
"12054","other assets if there are insufficient assets in the"
"12055","Fund) substantial additional margin at short notice to"
"12056","maintain the position.  If the Investment Adviser"
"12057","fails to do so within the time required, the"
"12058","Investment Adviser's position may be liquidated at a"
"12059","loss and the Investment Adviser will be liable for"
"12060","any resulting deficit."
"12061","Even if a transaction is not margined, it may still"
"12062","carry an obligation to make further payments in"
"12063","certain circumstances over and above any amount"
"12064","paid when the contract was entered into.  Contingent"
"12065","liability investments which are not traded on or"
"12066","under the rules of a regulated market may expose the"
"12067","Investment Adviser and the Fund to substantially"
"12068","greater risks."
"12069","7.3	Collateral:"
"12070","If the Investment Adviser permits the Local"
"12071","Manager as part of the Investment Guidelines to"
"12072","enter into transactions which require the Investment"
"12073","Adviser to deposit collateral as security with a"
"12074","broker, the way in which such collateral will be"
"12075","treated will vary according to the type of transaction"
"12076","and where it is traded.  There could be significant"
"12077","differences in the treatment of the Investment"
"12078","Adviser's collateral depending on whether the"
"12079","trading is on a regulated market, with the rules of"
"12080","that market (and associated clearing house)"
"12081","applying, or is off-exchange.  Deposited collateral"
"12082","may lose its identity as the Investment Adviser's"
"12083","property once dealings on the Investment Adviser's"
"12084","behalf are undertaken.  Even if the Investment"
"12085","Adviser's dealings should ultimately prove"
"12086","profitable, the Investment Adviser may not get back"
"12087","the same assets which the Local Manager deposited"
"12088","on the Investment Adviser's behalf and may have to"
"12089","accept payment in cash."
"12090","7.4	Commissions:"
"12091","The Investment Adviser is liable for all commissions"
"12092","and it may be the case that charges are not expressed"
"12093","in money terms (but for example, as a percentage of"
"12094","contract value).  In the case of futures, when"
"12095","commission is charged as a percentage, it will"
"12096","normally be as a percentage of the total contract"
"12097","value, and not simply as a percentage of the"
"12098","Investment Adviser's initial payment."
"12099","7.5	Suspensions of Trading:"
"12100","Under certain trading conditions or the application"
"12101","of certain rules in force in some markets (such as"
"12102","circuit breakers) it may be difficult or impossible for"
"12103","the Local Manager to liquidate a position held for"
"12104","the Investment Adviser.  This may occur, for"
"12105","example, at times of rapid price movement if the"
"12106","price of an investment rises or falls in one trading"
"12107","session to such an extent that under the rules of the"
"12108","relevant exchange trading of that investment is"
"12109","suspended or restricted.  Further, the Local Manager"
"12110","placing a stop-loss order on the Investment"
"12111","Adviser's behalf will not necessarily limit losses to"
"12112","the intended amounts because market conditions"
"12113","may make it impossible to execute such an order at"
"12114","the stipulated price.  Most electronic and auction"
"12115","trading systems are supported by computerised"
"12116","systems for order routing and trade checking,"
"12117","recording and clearing.  Like all automated"
"12118","procedures, these systems are subject to the risk of"
"12119","stoppages and malfunctions, which may result in the"
"12120","Investment Adviser's orders not being executed in"
"12121","accordance with the Local Manager's instructions or"
"12122","remaining unexecuted."
"12123","7.6	Clearing House Protections:"
"12124","On many exchanges, the performance of a"
"12125","transaction by a broker (or the third party with"
"12126","whom he is dealing on the Investment Adviser's"
"12127","behalf) is guaranteed by the exchange or its"
"12128","clearing house.  However, this guarantee is unlikely"
"12129","in most circumstances to cover the Investment"
"12130","Adviser and may not protect the Investment Adviser"
"12131","if the broker or another party defaults on its"
"12132","obligations to the Investment Adviser.  There is no"
"12133","clearing house for traditional options, nor normally"
"12134","for instruments which are not traded under the rules"
"12135","of a recognised or designated investment exchange."
"12136","7.7	Insolvency:"
"12137","A derivative broker's insolvency or default, or that"
"12138","of any other brokers involved with the Investment"
"12139","Adviser's transaction, may lead to positions being"
"12140","liquidated or closed out without the Investment"
"12141","Adviser's or the Local Manager's consent or"
"12142","knowledge.  In certain circumstances, the Investment"
"12143","Adviser may not get back the actual assets which the"
"12144","Investment Adviser lodged as collateral and the"
"12145","Investment Adviser may have to accept any"
"12146","available payment in cash."
