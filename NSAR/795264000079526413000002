"1053","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"1054","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1055","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"1056","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1057","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1058","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1059","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1060","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal"
"1061","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1062","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1063","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1064","accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A fund's internal control over"
"1065","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"1066","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1067","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"1068","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1069","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that"
"1070","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"1071","authorizations of management and directors of the fund; and (3) provide"
"1072","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1073","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"1074","effect on the financial statements."
"1075","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1076","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1077","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1078","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1079","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1080","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1081","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1082","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1083","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1084","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1085","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"1086","the Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1087","detected on a timely basis."
"1088","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"1089","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1090","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"1091","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1092","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1093","in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1094","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"1095","material weakness as defined above as of November 30, 2012."

"1132","A. The Corporation shall have the authority to issue an indefinite number of"
"1133","shares, consisting of one class only, designated as Common Stock, having"
"1134","par value of $.001 per share. The Corporation's Board of Directors may"
"1135","divide the Common Stock into series, determine the number of shares of the"
"1136","series, the distinguishing designation and the preferences, limitations and"
"1137","relative rights, in whole or in part, of any such series. The following series"
"1138","have been designated, subject to the authority of the Board of Directors to"

"1141","Thompson LargeCap Fund"
"1142","Thompson MidCap Fund"
"1143","Thompson Bond Fund"

"1149","by the Board of Directors. In addition, the Board of Directors is expressly"

"1155","future series of shares of Common Stock which may be created, each series"
"1156","shall have the following relative preferences, rights, voting powers,"
"1157","restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications and terms and"

"1159","of this Article 4:"
"1160","1. Assets Belonging to Series. All consideration received by the Corporation"
"1161","for the issue or sale of shares to a particular series, together with all"
"1162","assets in which such consideration is invested or reinvested, all income,"
"1163","earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof, including any proceeds derived from"
"1164","the sale, exchange or liquidation of such assets, and any funds or payments"
"1165","derived from any reinvestment of such proceeds in whatever form the same may"
"1166","be, shall irrevocably belong to that series for all purposes, subject only to"
"1167","the rights of creditors, and shall be so recorded upon the books and accounts"
"1168","of the Corporation. Such consideration, assets, income, earnings, profits, and"
"1169","proceeds thereof, including any proceeds derived from the sale, exchange or"
"1170","liquidation of such assets, and any funds or payments derived from any"
"1171","reinvestment of such proceeds in whatever form the same may be, together"
"1172","with any General Items allocated to that series as provided in the following"
"1173","sentence, are hereby referred to as assets belonging to that series. In the"
"1174","event that there are any assets, income, earnings, profits, and proceeds"
"1175","thereof, funds, or payments which are not readily identifiable as belonging to"
"1176","any particular series (General Items), such General Items shall be allocated"
"1177","by or under the supervision of the Board of Directors to and among any one"
"1178","or more of the series established and designated from time to time in such"
"1179","manner and on such basis as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion,"
"1180","deems fair and equitable, and any General Items so allocated to a particular"
"1181","series shall belong to that series. Each such allocation by the Board of"
"1182","Directors shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes."
"1183","2. Liabilities Belonging to Series. The assets belonging to each particular"
"1184","series shall be charged with the liabilities of the Corporation with respect"
"1185","of that series and all expenses, costs, charges and reserves attributable to"
"1186","that series, and any general liabilities, expenses, costs, charges or reserves"
"1187","of the Corporation which are not readily identifiable as belonging to any"
"1188","particular series shall be allocated and charged by or under the supervision"
"1189","of the Board of Directors to and among any one or more of the series"
"1190","established and designated from time to time in such manner and on such basis"
"1191","as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, deems fair and equitable. The"
"1192","liabilities, expenses, costs, charges and reserves allocated and so charged to"
"1193","a series are referred to as liabilities belonging to that series. Each"
"1194","allocation of liabilities, expenses, costs, charges and reserves by the Board"
"1195","of Directors shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes."
"1196","3. Income Belonging to Series. The Board of Directors shall have full"
"1197","discretion, to the extent not inconsistent with the Wisconsin Business"
"1198","Corporation Law and the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act),"
"1199","to determine which items shall be treated as income and which items as"
"1200","capital; and each such determination and allocation shall be conclusive and"
"1201","binding. Income belonging to a series includes all income, earnings and"
"1202","profits derived from assets belonging to that series, less any expenses,"
"1203","costs, charges or reserves belonging to that series, for the relevant time"
"1204","period."
"1205","4. Dividends. Dividends and distributions on shares of Common Stock of a"
"1206","particular series may be declared and paid with such frequency, in such form"
"1207","and in such amount as the Board of Directors may from time to time"
"1208","determine. Dividends may be declared daily or otherwise pursuant to a"
"1209","standing resolution or resolutions adopted only once or with such frequency"
"1210","as the Board of Directors may determine, after providing for actual and"
"1211","accrued liabilities belonging to that series."
"1212","All dividends on shares of a particular series shall be paid only out of the"
"1213","income belonging to that series and capital gains distributions on shares of a"
"1214","particular series shall be paid only out of the capital gains belonging to"
"1215","that series. All dividends and distributions on shares of a particular series"
"1216","shall be distributed pro rata to the holders of that series in proportion to"
"1217","the number of shares of that series held by such holders at the date and time"
"1218","of record established for the payment of such dividends or distributions."
"1219","The Board of Directors shall have the power, in its sole discretion, to"
"1220","distribute in any fiscal year as dividends, including dividends designated in"
"1221","whole or in part as capital gains distributions, amounts sufficient, in the"
"1222","opinion of the Board of Directors to enable the Corporation to qualify as a"
"1223","regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or"
"1224","any amended version thereof or any successor or comparable statute thereto,"
"1225","and regulations promulgated thereunder, and to avoid liability of the"
"1226","Corporation for federal income tax in respect of that year. However, nothing"
"1227","in the foregoing shall limit the authority of the Board of Directors to make"
"1228","distributions greater than or less than the amount necessary to qualify as a"
"1229","regulated investment company and to avoid liability of the Corporation for"
"1230","such tax period."
"1231","Dividends and distributions may be paid in cash, property or shares of"
"1232","Common Stock of a series, or a combination thereof, as determined by the"
"1233","Board of Directors or pursuant to any program that the Board of Directors"
"1234","may have in effect at the time. Any such dividend or distribution paid in"
"1235","shares of a series will be paid at the current net asset value thereof as"
"1236","defined in Section 4.B."
"1237","5. Liquidation. In the event of the liquidation of the Corporation or of a"
"1238","particular series, the shareholders of each series that has been established"
"1239","and designated and is being liquidated shall be entitled to receive, as a"
"1240","series, when and as described by the Board of Directors, the excess of the"
"1241","assets belonging to that series over the liabilities belonging to that series."
"1242","The holders of shares of any series shall not be entitled thereby to any"
"1243","distribution upon liquidation of any other series. The assets distributable to"
"1244","the shareholders of any particular series shall be distributed among such"
"1245","shareholders in proportion to the number of shares of that series held by them"
"1246","and recorded on the books of the Corporation. The liquidation of any"
"1247","particular series in which there are shares then outstanding may be"
"1248","authorized by vote of a majority of the Board of Directors then in office,"
"1249","subject to the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of that"
"1250","series, as defined in the 1940 Act."
"1251","6. Voting. On each matter submitted to a vote of the shareholders, each"
"1252","holder of a share of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each"
"1253","share outstanding in his name on the books of the Corporation, irrespective of"
"1254","the series thereof, and all shares of all series shall vote as a single series"
"1255","(Single Series Voting); provided, however, that (a) as to any matter with"
"1256","respect to which a separate vote of any series is required by the 1940 Act or"
"1257","by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, such requirement as to a"
"1258","separate vote by that series shall apply in lieu of Single Class Voting; (b)"
"1259","in the event that the separate vote requirements of subsection (a) apply with"
"1260","respect to one or more series, then, subject to (c), the shares of all other"
"1261","series shall vote as a single series; and (c) as to any matter which does not"
"1262","affect the interest of a particular series, only the holders of shares of one"
"1263","or more affected series shall be entitled to vote."
"1264","7. Equality. All shares of Common Stock of each particular series shall"
"1265","represent an equal proportionate interest in the assets belonging to that"
"1266","series (subject to the liabilities belonging to that series), and each share"
"1267","of any particular series shall be equal to each other share of that series."
"1268","B. The Corporation may issue and sell shares of any series of its Common"
"1269","Stock as its Board of Directors may determine; provided, however, that the"
"1270","consideration per share to be received by the Corporation upon the sale of"
"1271","any shares of its Common Stock shall not be less than the net asset value per"
"1272","share of the series of such Common Stock determined in accordance with the"
"1273","requirements of the 1940 Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the"
"1274","Securities and Exchange Commission (or any succeeding governmental"
"1275","authority) and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles."
"1276","Subject to the suspension of such right of redemption or postponement of the"
"1277","date of payment or satisfaction upon redemption in accordance with the 1940"
"1278","Act, each holder of a series of the Common Stock of the Corporation, upon"
"1279","request and after complying with the redemption procedures established by"
"1280","the Board of Directors, shall be entitled to require the Corporation to redeem"
"1281","out of stated capital, capital surplus, earned surplus or other legally"
"1282","available funds of that series all or any part of the shares of Common Stock"
"1283","of that series standing in the name of such holder on the books of the"
"1284","Corporation at the net asset value of such shares. Such net asset value shall"
"1285","be determined in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the"
"1286","applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (or"
"1287","any succeeding governmental authority) and in conformity with generally"
"1288","accepted accounting principles. Any shares of its Common Stock redeemed by the"
"1289","Corporation shall be deemed to be cancelled and restored to the status of"
"1290","authorized but unissued shares of the particular series."
"1291","C. Each share of a series of Common Stock of the Corporation is subject to"
"1292","redemption by the Corporation out of any of the sources referred to in clause"
"1293","B above as to that particular series, at the price which would be applicable"
"1294","if such share was then being redeemed by the holder thereof pursuant to the"
"1295","other provisions of these Articles of Incorporation, at any time if the Board"
"1296","of Directors determines in its sole discretion that failure to so redeem may"
"1297","have materially adverse consequences to the holders of shares of the series of"
"1298","Common Stock of the Corporation. In addition, the Corporation may redeem"
"1299","out of any of such sources and at such price per share all of the shares of a"
"1300","series of the Common Stock of the Corporation held by any holder if the value"
"1301","of such shares held by such holder is less than the minimum amount"
"1302","established from time to time by the By-laws."
"1303","D. The Board of Directors of the Corporation may, upon reasonable notice to"
"1304","holders of shares of the Common Stock of the Corporation, impose a fee for"
"1305","the redemption of shares, such fee to be not in excess of one percent (1.0%)"
"1306","of the proceeds (before giving effect to such fee) thereof and to apply in the"
"1307","case of such redemptions and under such terms and conditions as the Board"
"1308","shall determine. The Board shall have authority to rescind the imposition of"
"1309","any such fee in its discretion and to re-impose the fee from time to time upon"
"1310","reasonable notice."
"1311","E. Holders of shares of Common Stock shall not be entitled to any"
"1312","preemptive right to acquire unissued shares or securities convertible into"
"1313","such shares or carrying a right to subscribe to or acquire shares nor shall"
"1314","such holders have any other preemptive rights."
"1315","F. Holders of shares of Common Stock shall not be entitled to exercise any"
"1316","right to cumulative voting."
"1317","ARTICLE 5"
"1318","The number of directors shall be such number as is fixed by or in the manner"
"1319","provided in the By-laws."
"1320","ARTICLE 6"
"1321","The Corporation, as to any or all series, may enter into, from time to time,"
"1322","investment advisory and other agreements providing for the management and"
"1323","supervision of the investments of the Corporation and the furnishing of"
"1324","clerical and administrative services to the Corporation. The Corporation also"
"1325","may enter into, from time to time, agreements providing for distribution,"
"1326","custodial, transfer agency, registrar and/or disbursing agency services to the"
"1327","Corporation, as to any or all series. Such agreements shall contain such"
"1328","terms, provisions and conditions as the Board of Directors of the Corporation"
"1329","may deem advisable."
"1330","ARTICLE 7"
"1331","The address of the registered office of the Corporation is 918 Deming Way,"
"1332","3rd Floor, Madison, WI 53717, and the name of its agent at such address is"
"1333","John W. Thompson. The registered office is located in Dane County."
"1334","ARTICLE 8"
"1335","These Articles may be amended in the manner authorized by the Wisconsin"
"1336","Business Corporation Law at the time of amendment and all rights at any time"
"1337","conferred upon the shareholders of the Corporation by these Articles are"
"1338","granted subject to the provision of this Article 8."
