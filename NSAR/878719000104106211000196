"1614","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1615","Trusts internal control over financial reporting."
"1616","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."

"1625","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1626","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"1627","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"

"1631","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1632","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"1633","the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"

"1650","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"1651","the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1652","procedures may deteriorate."
"1653","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1654","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"

"1656","the normal course of performing their assigned"

"1659","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1660","control over financial reporting, such that there is"
"1661","a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1662","misstatement of the companys annual or interim"
"1663","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1664","detected on a timely basis."
"1665","Our consideration of the Trusts internal control"
"1666","over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1667","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1668","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"1669","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1670","standards established by the Public Company"

"1672","we noted no deficiencies in the Trusts internal"

"1756","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1757","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1758","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1759","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1760","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1761","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1762","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1763","control over financial reporting, such that there is"
"1764","a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1765","misstatement of the Funds annual or interim"
"1766","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1767","detected on a timely basis."
"1768","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"1769","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1770","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1771","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"1772","control over financial reporting that might be"
"1773","material weaknesses under standards established by"
"1774","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1775","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1776","in the Funds internal control over financial"
"1777","reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"1778","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be"
"1779","material weaknesses as defined above as of December"
