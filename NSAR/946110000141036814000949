"2838","herewith confirms its agreement with Credit Suisse Asset"

"2880","         Subject to the approval of the Board of Trustees of each"
"2881","of the Series Funds and where required, such Series Fund's"

"2894"," 	3.	Brokerage"
"2895","            In executing transactions for each Series and Fund,"
"2896","selecting brokers or dealers and negotiating any brokerage"
"2897","commission rates, the Adviser will use its best efforts to"
"2898","seek the best overall terms available.  In assessing the best"
"2899","overall terms available for any portfolio transaction, the"
"2900","Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant including,"
"2901","but not limited to, breadth of the market in the security, the"
"2902","price of the security, the financial condition and execution"
"2903","capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of"
"2904","any commission for the specific transaction and for transactions"
"2905","executed through the broker or dealer in the aggregate.  In"
"2906","selecting brokers or dealers to execute a particular transaction"
"2907","and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Adviser"
"2908","may consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms"
"2909","are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of"
"2910","1934, as the same may from time to time be amended) provided to"
"2911","each Series and Fund and/or other accounts over which the"
"2912","Adviser or an affiliate exercises investment discretion."
"2913","	4.	Information Provided to the Fund"
"2914","            The Adviser will keep each Series and Fund informed"
"2915","of developments materially affecting such Series or Fund, and"
"2916","will, on its own initiative, furnish such Series or Fund from"
"2917","time to time with whatever information the Adviser believes is"
"2918","appropriate for this purpose."
"2919","	5.	Standard of Care"
"2920","         The Adviser shall exercise its best judgment in"
"2921","rendering the services listed in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 above."
"2922","The Adviser shall not be liable for any error of judgment or"
"2923","mistake of law or for any loss suffered by any Series or Fund"
"2924","in connection with the matters to which this Agreement relates,"
"2925","provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to protect or"
"2926","purport to protect the Adviser against any liability to each"
"2927","Fund and Series or to shareholders of such Series or Fund to"
"2928","which the Adviser would otherwise be subject by reason of"
"2929","willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part"
"2930","in the performance of its duties or by reason of the Adviser's"
"2931","reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this"
"2932","Agreement."
"2933","	6.	Compensation"
"2934","         In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to"
"2935","this Agreement, each Series and Fund will pay the Adviser the"
"2936","annual fee applicable to such Series or Fund calculated at an"
"2937","annual rate set forth on Annex I hereto of such Series' or"
"2938","Fund's average daily net assets."
"2939","         The fee for the period from the date of this Agreement"
"2940","to the end of the year shall be prorated according to the"
"2941","proportion that such period bears to the full yearly period."
"2942","Upon any termination of this Agreement before the end of a year,"
"2943","the fee for such part of that year shall be prorated according"
"2944","to the proportion that such period bears to the full yearly"
"2945","period and shall be payable upon the date of termination of"
"2946","this Agreement.  For the purpose of determining fees payable to"
"2947","the Adviser, the value of each Series' and Fund's net assets"
"2948","shall be computed at the times and in the manner specified in"
"2949","such Series' or Fund's Prospectus or SAI."
"2950","         With respect to the Credit Suisse Opportunity Funds,"
"2951","such fee shall be calculated and payable monthly. The fee for"
"2952","the Credit Suisse High Yield Bond Fund shall be computed and"
"2953","payable monthly, at the annual rate set forth for the Credit"
"2954","Suisse High Yield Bond Fund on Annex I hereto, of the average"
"2955","weekly value of such Fund's total assets minus the sum of"
"2956","accrued liabilities (other than aggregate indebtedness"
"2957","constituting leverage)."
"2958","	7.	Expenses"
"2959","            The Adviser will bear all expenses in connection with"
"2960","the performance of its services under this Agreement, including"
"2961","the fees payable to any investment sub-adviser engaged pursuant"
"2962","to paragraph 2 of this Agreement.  Each Series and Fund will bear"
"2963","its proportionate share of certain other expenses to be incurred"
"2964","in its operation, including:  investment advisory and administration"
"2965","fees; taxes, interest, brokerage fees and commissions, if any;"
"2966","fees of Trustees of such Series or Fund who are not officers,"
"2967","directors, or employees of the Adviser, any sub-adviser or any of"
"2968","their affiliates; fees of any pricing service employed to value"
"2969","shares of the Series or Fund; Securities and Exchange Commission"
"2970","fees and state blue sky qualification fees; charges of custodians"
"2971","and transfer and dividend disbursing agents; such Series' or"
"2972","Fund's proportionate share of insurance premiums; outside auditing"
"2973","and legal expenses; costs of maintenance of such Series' or Fund's"
"2974","existence; costs attributable to investor services, including,"
"2975","without limitation, telephone and personnel expenses; costs of"
"2976","preparing and printing prospectuses and statements of additional"
"2977","information for regulatory purposes and for distribution to"
"2978","existing shareholders; costs of shareholders' reports and meetings"
"2979","of the shareholders of such Series or Fund and of the officers or"
"2980","Board of Trustees of such Series or Fund; and any extraordinary"
"2981","expenses."
"2982","         Each Series and Fund will be responsible for"
"2983","nonrecurring expenses which may arise, including costs of"
"2984","litigation to which such Series or Fund is a party and of"
"2985","indemnifying officers and Trustees of such Series or Fund with"
"2986","respect to such litigation and other expenses as determined by"
"2987","the Trustees."
"2988","	8.	Services to Other Companies or Accounts"
"2989","           Each Fund and Series understands that the Adviser now"
"2990","acts, will continue to act and may act in the future as investment"
"2991","adviser to fiduciary and other managed accounts and to one or"
"2992","more other investment companies or series of investment companies,"
"2993","and such Series or Fund has no objection to the Adviser so acting,"
"2994","provided that whenever such Series or Fund and one or more other"
"2995","accounts or investment companies or portfolios advised by the Adviser"
"2996","have available funds for investment, investments suitable and"
"2997","appropriate for each will be allocated in accordance with a formula"
"2998","believed to be equitable to each entity.  Each Series and Fund"
"2999","recognizes that in some cases this procedure may adversely affect"
"3000","the size of the position obtainable for such Series or Fund.  In"
"3001","addition, each Series and Fund understands that the persons"
"3002","employed by the Adviser to assist in the performance of the"
"3003","Adviser's duties hereunder will not devote their full time to such"
"3004","service and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit or"
"3005","restrict the right of the Adviser or any affiliate of the Adviser"
"3006","to engage in and devote time and attention to other businesses or"
"3007","to render services of whatever kind or nature, provided that doing"
"3008","so does not adversely affect the ability of the Adviser to perform"
"3009","its services under this Agreement."
"3010","	9.	Term of Agreement"
"3011","            With respect to each Series or Fund, this Agreement"
"3012","shall continue for an initial two-year period commencing on the"
"3013","date first written above, and thereafter shall continue"
"3014","automatically for successive annual periods, provided such"
"3015","continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (a)"
"3016","(i) in the case of a Series, the Board of Trustees of the Fund"
"3017","of which such Series is a part or (ii) in the case of the High"
"3018","Yield Bond Fund, the Board of Trustees of the Fund or (b) a"
"3019","vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of each"
"3020","Series' and Fund's outstanding voting securities, provided"
"3021","that in either event the continuance is also approved by a"
"3022","majority of the Board of Trustees of the applicable Fund, who"
"3023","are not interested persons (as defined in said Act) of any"
"3024","party to this Agreement, by vote cast in person at a meeting"
"3025","called for the purpose of voting on such approval.  This"
"3026","Agreement is terminable with respect to a Series or Fund,"
"3027","without penalty, on 60 days' written notice, by the Board of"
"3028","Trustees of such Series and Fund or by vote of holders of a"
"3029","majority of such Series' or Fund's shares, or upon 90 days'"
"3030","written notice, by the Adviser.  This Agreement will also"
"3031","terminate automatically in the event of its assignment"
"3032","(as defined in said Act)."
"3033","	10.	Representation by the Fund"
"3034","            The Funds represent that copies of their Agreements"
"3035","and Declarations of Trust, together with all amendments thereto,"

"3037","	11.	Use of Names"
"3038","            The Funds recognize that directors, officers and"

"3046","Adviser ceases to act as the investment adviser of a Series or"
"3047","Fund, such Series or Fund agrees that, at the Adviser's request,"
"3048","such Series' or Fund's license to use the words CS or"
"3049","Credit Suisse will terminate and that such Series or Fund"
"3050","will take all necessary action to change the name of such"
"3051","Series or Fund to names not including the words CS or Credit

"3125","Accounting Firm"
"3126","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"3127","Credit Suisse Opportunity Funds:"
"3128","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"3129","financial statements of the funds listed in"
"3130","Appendix I of Credit Suisse Opportunity"
"3131","Funds (hereafter referred to as the Funds)"
"3132","as of and for the periods ended October 31,"
"3133","2014, in accordance with the standards of the"
"3134","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"3135","(United States), we considered the Funds'"
"3136","internal control over financial reporting,"
"3137","including controls over safeguarding"
"3138","securities, as a basis for designing our"
"3139","auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"3140","expressing our opinion on the financial"
"3141","statements and to comply with the"
"3142","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"3143","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"3144","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control"
"3145","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do"
"3146","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"3147","the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3148","reporting."
"3149","The management of the Funds is responsible"
"3150","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"3151","internal control over financial reporting. In"
"3152","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"3153","judgments by management are required to"
"3154","assess the expected benefits and related costs"
"3155","of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"3156","financial reporting is a process designed to"
"3157","provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"3158","reliability of financial reporting and the"
"3159","preparation of financial statements for"
"3160","external purposes in accordance with"
"3161","generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"3162","fund's internal control over financial"
"3163","reporting includes those policies and"
"3164","procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"3165","maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"3166","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"3167","transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"3168","the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"3169","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"3170","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"3171","statements in accordance with generally"
"3172","accepted accounting principles, and that"
"3173","receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"3174","being made only in accordance with"
"3175","authorizations of management and trustees of"
"3176","the fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"3177","assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"3178","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"3179","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a"
"3180","material effect on the financial statements."
"3181","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"3182","control over financial reporting may not"
"3183","prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"3184","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"
"3185","to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"3186","controls may become inadequate because of"
"3187","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"3188","compliance with the policies or procedures"
"3189","may deteriorate."
"3190","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"3191","reporting exists when the design or operation"
"3192","of  a control does not allow management or"
