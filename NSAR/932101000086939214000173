"641","77B Putnam International Growth Fund, as of September 30,"
"642","2014, annual shareholder report"
"643","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"644","To the Trustees of Putnam Investment Funds and Shareholders of"
"645","Putnam International Growth Fund:"
"646","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"647","statements of Putnam International Growth Fund (the Fund) as"
"648","of and for the year ended September 30, 2014, in accordance"
"649","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"650","Board (United States), we considered the Funds internal"
"651","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"652","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"653","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"654","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"655","Form NSAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"656","the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"657","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"658","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"659","reporting."
"660","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"661","maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"662","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"663","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"664","benefits and related costs of controls.  A funds internal"
"665","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"666","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"667","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"668","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"669","accepted accounting principles.  A funds internal control over"
"670","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"671","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"672","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"673","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"674","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"675","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"676","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"677","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"678","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"679","of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"680","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"681","use or disposition of a funds assets that could have a"
"682","material effect on the financial statements."
"683","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"684","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"685","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"686","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"687","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"688","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"689","deteriorate."
"690","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"691","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"692","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"693","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"694","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"695","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"696","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"697","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"698","Funds annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"699","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"700","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"701","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"702","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"703","in internal control over financial reporting that might be"
"704","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"705","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"706","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal control over"
"707","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"708","safeguarding securities,that we consider to be material"
"709","weaknesses as defined above as of September 30, 2014."
"710","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"711","management and the Board of Trustees of Putnam International"
"712","Growth Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"713","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"714","these specified parties."

"776","time to time in effect (the Declaration of Trust), of the"
"777","Massachusetts business trust established by the Declaration of"

"786","ARTICLE 2"
"787","Meetings of Trustees"
"788","      2.1  Regular Meetings.  Regular meetings of the Trustees may"
"789","be held without call or notice at such places and at such times"
"790","as the Trustees may from time to time determine, provided that"
"791","notice of the first regular meeting following any such"
"792","determination shall be given to absent Trustees."
"793","      2.2  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Trustees may"
"794","be held at any time and at any place designated in the call of"
"795","the meeting when called by the Chair of the Trustees, the"
"796","President, the Executive Vice President or the Treasurer or by"
"797","two or more Trustees, sufficient notice thereof being given to"
"798","each Trustee by the Clerk or an Assistant Clerk or by the officer"
"799","or the Trustees calling the meeting."
"800","      2.3  Notice of Special Meetings.  It shall be sufficient"
"801","notice to a Trustee of a special meeting: (a) to send notice (i)"
"802","by mail at least forty eight hours before the meeting, (ii) by"
"803","courier at least forty eight hours before the meeting, (iii) by"
"804","electronic mail (email), facsimile or other electronic means at"
"805","least twenty four hours before the meeting, in each case,"
"806","addressed to the Trustee at his or her usual or last known"
"807","business or residence address (or email address, facsimile number"
"808","or other appropriate address); or (b) to give notice to him or"
"809","her in person or by telephone at least twenty four hours before"
"810","the meeting.  Notice of a special meeting need not be given to"
"811","any Trustee if a written waiver of notice, executed by him or her"
"812","before or after the meeting, is filed with the records of the"
"813","meeting, or to any Trustee who attends the meeting without"
"814","protesting before or at its commencement the lack of notice to"
"815","him or her.  Any written waiver of notice may be provided and"
"816","delivered to the Trust by mail, courier, email, facsimile or"

"822","quorum has been validly established for a meeting, it cannot be"
"823","broken by Trustees withdrawing from the meeting.  Any meeting may"
"824","be adjourned from time to time by a majority of the votes cast"

"826","meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice."
"827","      2.5  Telephone Meeting; Action Without a Meeting.  Except as"
"828","otherwise provided in the Declaration of Trust and these Bylaws,"

"831","being present), including any meeting held by means of a"
"832","conference telephone or other communications equipment by means"
"833","of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each"
"834","other at the same time and participation by such means shall"
"835","constitute presence in person at a meeting. Any action to be"
"836","taken by the Trustees may also be taken without a meeting if one"
"837","or more written consents thereto are signed by a majority of the"
"838","Trustees.  Any written consent may be given by mail, courier,"
"839","email, facsimile or other electronic means.  Copies of such"
"840","written consents shall be filed with the minutes of the"
"841","proceedings of the Trustees.  Such consents shall be treated for"
"842","all purposes as a vote taken at a meeting of the Trustees.  If in"
"843","accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Trust and"
"844","these Bylaws any action is taken by the Trustees by written"
"845","consents of less than all of the Trustees, then prompt notice of"
"846","any such action shall be furnished to each Trustee who did not"
"847","execute such written consent, provided that the effectiveness of"
"848","such action shall not be impaired by any delay or failure to"
"849","furnish such notice."

"854","officers (including Vice President, which shall include the"

"856","time to time may in their discretion elect.  The Trust may also"
"857","have such agents as the Trustees from time to time may in their"
"858","discretion appoint.  In addition, there shall be a Chair of the"
"859","Trustees, who will be considered an officer of the Trustees and"

"888","      3.5  Chair.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide, the"

"892","Trustees may from time to time designate, but shall have no"
"893","individual authority to act for the Trust as an officer of the"
"894","Trust.  The Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who"

"896","in the 1940 Act, may appoint one or more persons to perform the"
"897","duties of the Chair of the Trustees in the event of his or her"
"898","absence at any meeting or in the event of his or her disability."
"899","The Chair of the Trustees shall also have the power to appoint"
"900","one or more persons to perform the duties of the Chair of the"
"901","Trustees in the event of his or her absence at any meeting."
"902","      3.6  President.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide by"
"903","vote or otherwise, the President shall be the principal executive"
"904","officer of the Trust."
"905","      3.7  Treasurer.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide by"
"906","vote or otherwise, the Treasurer shall be the principal financial"
"907","and accounting officer of the Trust, and shall, subject to the"

"909","made by the Trustees with a custodian, investment adviser,"
"910","subadviser or manager, or transfer, Shareholder servicing or"
"911","similar agent, be in charge of the valuable papers, books of"
"912","account and accounting records of the Trust, and shall have such"

"914","the Trustees or by the principal executive officer of the Trust."
"915","      3.8  Clerk.  The Clerk shall record all proceedings of the"
"916","Shareholders and the Trustees in books to be kept therefor, which"
"917","books or a copy thereof shall be kept at the principal office of"
"918","the Trust.  In the absence of the Clerk from any meeting of the"
"919","Shareholders or Trustees (or a Committee thereof), an Assistant"
"920","Clerk, or if there be none or if he or she is absent, a temporary"
"921","Clerk chosen at such meeting by the chair of such meeting, shall"

"927","effective upon receipt unless specified to be effective at some"
"928","other time.  The Trustees may remove any officer elected or"
"929","appointed by them with or without cause.  Except to the extent"
"930","expressly provided in a written agreement with the Trust, no"

"932","any right to any compensation for any period following his or her"
"933","resignation or removal, or any right to damages on account of"
"934","such removal."

"961","consent, provided that the effectiveness of such action shall not"
"962","be impaired by any delay or failure to furnish such notice.  In"
"963","the absence of any member of any such Committee, the members"
"964","thereof present at any properly called meeting, whether or not"
"965","they constitute a quorum, may appoint a member of the Trustees to"
"966","act at that meeting only in the place of any absent member."

"991","Seal"
"992","      7.1  General.  The seal of the Trust, if any, shall consist"
"993","of a flat faced die with the word Massachusetts, together with"
"994","the name of the Trust and the year of its organization cut or"
"995","engraved thereon but, unless otherwise required by the Trustees,"
"996","the seal need not be placed on, and its absence shall not impair"

"1054","      9.4  Issuance of New Certificate to Pledgee.  A pledgee of"
"1055","Shares transferred as collateral security shall be entitled to a"
"1056","new certificate if the instrument of transfer substantially"
"1057","describes the debt or duty that is intended to be secured"
"1058","thereby.  Such new certificate shall express on its face that it"
"1059","is held as collateral security, and the name of the pledgor shall"
"1060","be stated thereon, who alone shall be liable as a Shareholder and"
"1061","entitled to vote thereon."

"1063","Trustees may at any time discontinue the issuance of Share"
"1064","certificates and may, by written notice to each Shareholder whom"
"1065","the Trust believes to hold a Share certificate, require the"
"1066","surrender of Share certificates to the Trust for cancellation."

"1072","a meeting of the Shareholders whenever ordered by the Trustees or"
"1073","requested in writing by the holder or holders of at least one"
"1074","tenth of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote at such meeting."
"1075"," If the Clerk, when so ordered or requested, refuses or neglects"
"1076","for more than 30 days to provide such notice, the Trustees or the"
"1077","Shareholders so requesting may, in the name of the Clerk, call"
"1078","the meeting by giving notice thereof in the manner required when"

"1081","upon public notice given prior to the time previously scheduled"
"1082","for such meeting."
"1083","      10.2  Adjournment.  Any meeting of Shareholders may, by"
