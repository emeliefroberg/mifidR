"1103","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1104","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Pyxis"
"1105","Long/Short Equity Fund (formerly, Highland Long/Short"
"1106","Equity Fund), Pyxis Long/Short Healthcare Fund (formerly,"
"1107","Highland Long/Short Healthcare Fund), and Pyxis Floating"
"1108","Rate Opportunities Fund (formerly, Highland Floating Rate"
"1109","Opportunities Fund:"
"1110","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1111","statements of the investment portfolios of Pyxis Long/Short"
"1112","Equity Fund (formerly, Highland Long/Short Equity Fund),"
"1113","Pyxis Long/Short Healthcare Fund (formerly, Highland"
"1114","Long/Short Healthcare Fund), and Pyxis Floating Rate"
"1115","Opportunities Fund (formerly, Highland Floating Rate"
"1116","Opportunities Fund (the Funds) as of and for the year"
"1117","ended June 30, 2012 in accordance with the standards of the"
"1118","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"1119","we considered the Funds'  internal control over financial"
"1120","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"1121","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1122","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1123","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"1124","SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1125","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"1126","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"1127","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control"
"1128","over financial reporting."
"1129","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"1130","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1131","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"1132","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1133","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's"
"1134","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"1135","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1136","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1137","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"1138","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's"
"1139","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1140","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1141","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1142","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1143","assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1144","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1145","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"1146","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"1147","and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"1148","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"1149","of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance"
"1150","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1151","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that"
"1152","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1153","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1154","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1155","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1156","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"1157","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1158","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1159","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1160","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1161","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1162","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1163","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1164","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1165","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1166","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1167","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1168","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1169","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1170","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"1171","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"1172","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1173","all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"1174","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"1175","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1176","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1177","in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and"
"1178","its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1179","securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as"
"1180","defined above as of June 30, 2012."
"1181","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"1182","of management and the Board of Trustees of the Funds and"
"1183","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"1184","to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"1185","specified parties."

"1197","Unsecured Creditors of TOUSA, Inc. et al. v. Citicorp North"
"1198","America, Inc. et al.; United States Bankruptcy Court for the"
"1199","Southern District of Florida, Case No. 08-1435"
"1200","      Pyxis Floating Rate Opportunities Fund (FRO) is one of"
"1201","numerous defendants (Lenders) that have been named in an"
"1202","adversary proceeding pending in the Bankruptcy Court of the"
"1203","Southern District of Florida (the Court). The action,"
"1204","entitled In re Tousa Inc., et al., was filed on July 15, 2008,"
"1205","by the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of TOUSA,"
"1206","Inc. and its affiliates (the Plaintiff ), which are home"
"1207","building companies to which the Lenders loaned money through"
"1208","different lending facilities. Plaintiff alleges that monies"
"1209","used to repay the Lenders should be voided as fraudulent and"
"1210","preferential transfers under the bankruptcy laws. More"
"1211","specifically, Plaintiff alleges that subsidiaries of the home"
"1212","building companies were forced to become co-borrowers and"
"1213","guarantors of the monies used to repay the Lenders, and that"
"1214","the subsidiaries did not receive fair consideration or"
"1215","reasonably equivalent value when they transferred the proceeds"
"1216","to repay the Lenders. Plaintiff seeks to void the transfers"
"1217","and other equitable relief. The Fund and other Funds and"
"1218","accounts managed by the Investment Adviser and the other"
"1219","Lenders are named as defendants in two separate lending"
"1220","capacities; first, as lenders in a credit agreement (the"
"1221","Credit Lenders); and second, as lenders in a term loan (the"
"1222","Term Loan Lenders)."
"1223","      The case went to trial, which concluded in August 2009."
"1224","On October 13, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court ruled for the"
"1225","Plaintiff in the action and ordered the Defendants to return"
"1226","the proceeds received from the pay-off of the term loan at par"
"1227","on July 31, 2007. The proceeds received by the Crusader"
"1228","Subsidiaries totaled $4.3 million. Additionally, the court"
"1229","ordered the Defendants to pay simple interest on the amount"
"1230","returned at an annual rate of 9%."
"1231","      On February 11, 2011, the District Court entered an order"
"1232","quashing all liability of the Lenders and declaring the"
"1233","remedies against the Lenders null and void. On May 15, 2012,"
"1234","the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeal (Eleventh Circuit)"
"1235","issued its decision reversing the judgment of the District"
"1236","Court, affirming the liability findings of the Bankruptcy"
"1237","Court, and remanding District Court for further proceedings"
"1238","consistent with their opinion."
