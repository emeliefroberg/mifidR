"559","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"560","Accounting Firm"
"561","To the Board of Directors of Legg Mason"
"562","Investment Trust, Inc. and to the Shareholders of"
"563","Legg Mason Capital Management Opportunity Trust:"
"564","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"565","financial statements of Legg Mason Capital"
"566","Management Opportunity Trust (one of the"
"567","portfolios comprising Legg Mason Investment"
"568","Trust, Inc., the Company) as of and for the"
"569","year ended December 31, 2009, in accordance"
"570","with the standards of the Public Company"
"571","Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"572","we considered the Companys internal control"
"573","over financial reporting, including controls"
"574","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"575","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"576","of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"577","statements and to comply with the requirements"
"578","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"579","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"580","of the Companys internal control over"
"581","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not"
"582","express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"583","Company's internal control over financial reporting."
"584","The management of the Company is responsible for"
"585","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"586","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"587","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"588","management are required to assess the expected"
"589","benefits and related costs of controls.  A companys"
"590","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"591","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"592","regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"593","and the preparation of financial statements for"
"594","external purposes in accordance with generally"
"595","accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"596","internal control over financial reporting includes"
"597","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"598","to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"599","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"600","transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"601","the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"602","that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"603","permit preparation of financial statements in"
"604","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"605","principles, and that receipts and expenditures"
"606","of the company are being made only in accordance"
"607","with authorizations of management and directors"
"608","of the company; and (3)  provide reasonable"
"609","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"610","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"611","of a companys assets that could have a material"
"612","effect on the financial statements."
"613","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"614","control over financial reporting may not prevent"
"615","or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"616","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"617","are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"618","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"619","or that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"620","or procedures may deteriorate."
"621","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"622","reporting exists when the design or operation"
"623","of a control does not allow management or"
"624","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"625","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"626","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"627","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"628","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"629","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"630","possibility that a material misstatement of"
"631","the Company's annual or interim financial"
"632","statements will not be prevented or detected"
"633","on a timely basis."
"634","Our consideration of the Companys internal"
"635","control over financial reporting was for the"
"636","limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"637","and would not necessarily disclose all"
"638","deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"639","reporting that might be material weaknesses"
"640","under standards established by the Public Company"
"641","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"642","However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"643","Companys internal control over financial"
"644","reporting and its operation, including"
"645","controls over safeguarding securities that we"
"646","consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"647","above as of December 31, 2009."
"648","This report is intended solely for the information"
"649","and use of management and the Board of Directors"
"650","of Legg Mason Investment Trust, Inc. and the"
"651","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"652","intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
"653","other than these specified parties."
