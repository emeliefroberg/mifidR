"556","<TEXT>"
"557","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"558","The Board of Trustees"
"559","Legg Mason Partners Equity Trust:"
"560","In planning and performing our audit of the Legg Mason Capital"
"561","Management All Cap Fund, a series of Legg Mason Partners Equity"
"562","Trust, as of and for the year ended April 30, 2011, in"
"563","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"564","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's"
"565","internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"566","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"567","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"568","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"569","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"570","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"571","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"572","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"573","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"574","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"575","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"576","related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"577","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"578","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"579","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"580","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"581","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"582","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"583","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"584","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"585","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"586","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"587","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"588","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"589","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"590","and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"591","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"592","acquisition, use, or disposition of the fund's assets that could"
"593","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"594","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"595","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"596","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"597","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"598","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"599","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"600","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"601","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"602","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"603","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"604","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"605","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"606","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"607","material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial"
"608","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"609","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"610","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"611","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"612","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"613","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"614","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"615","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"616","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that"
"617","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"618","April 30, 2011."
"619","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"620","management and the Board of Trustees of Legg Mason Partners"
"621","Equity Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"622","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"623","these specified parties."

"661","conditions hereinafter set forth;"
"662","          NOW THEREFORE, in consideration"
"663","of the promises and mutual covenants herein"
"664","contained, it is agreed as follows:"
"665","          1.           In accordance with and"
"666","subject to the Management Agreement"
"667","between the Trust and the Manager with"
"668","respect to the Fund (the Management
Agreement), the Manager hereby appoints"
"669","the Subadviser to act as Subadviser with"
"670","respect to the Fund for the period and on the"
"671","terms set forth in this Agreement. The"
"672","Subadviser accepts such appointment and"
"673","agrees to render the services herein set forth,"
"674","for the compensation herein provided."
"675","          2.           The Manager shall cause the"
"676","Subadviser to be kept fully informed at all"
"677","times with regard to the securities owned by"
"678","the Fund, its funds available, or to become"
"679","available, for investment, and generally as to"
"680","the condition of the Fund's affairs. The"
"681","Manager shall furnish the Subadviser with"
"682","such other documents and information with"
"683","regard to the Fund's affairs as the"
"684","Subadviser may from time to time"
"685","reasonably request."
"686","          3.           (a)           Subject to the"
"687","supervision of the Trust's Board of Trustees"
"688","(the Board) and the Manager, the"
"689","Subadviser shall regularly provide the Fund"
"690","with respect to such portion of the Fund's"
"691","assets as shall be allocated to the Subadviser"
"692","by the Manager from time to time (the"
"693","Allocated Assets) with investment"
"694","research, advice, management and"
"695","supervision and shall furnish a continuous"
"696","investment program for the Allocated Assets"
"697","consistent with the Fund's investment"
"698","objectives, policies and restrictions, as stated"
"699","in the Fund's current Prospectus and"
"700","Statement of Additional Information. The"
"701","Subadviser shall, with respect to the"
"702","Allocated Assets, determine from time to"
"703","time what securities and other investments"
"704","will be purchased (including, as permitted in"
"705","accordance with this paragraph, swap"
"706","agreements, options and futures), retained,"
"707","sold or exchanged by the Fund and what"
"708","portion of the Allocated Assets will be held"
"709","in the various securities and other"
"710","investments in which the Fund invests, and"
"711","shall implement those decisions (including"
"712","the execution of investment documentation),"
"713","all subject to the provisions of the Trust's"
"714","Declaration of Trust and By-Laws"
"715","(collectively, the Governing Documents),"
"716","the 1940 Act, and the applicable rules and"
"717","regulations promulgated thereunder by the"
"718","Securities and Exchange Commission (the"
"719","SEC) and interpretive guidance issued"
"720","thereunder by the SEC staff and any other"
"721","applicable federal and state law, as well as"
"722","the investment objectives, policies and"
"723","restrictions of the Fund referred to above,"
"724","and any other specific policies adopted by"
"725","the Board and disclosed to the Subadviser."
"726","The Subadviser is authorized as the agent of"
"727","the Trust to give instructions with respect to"
"728","the Allocated Assets to the custodian of the"
"729","Fund as to deliveries of securities and other"
"730","investments and payments of cash for the"
"731","account of the Fund. Subject to applicable"
"732","provisions of the 1940 Act, the investment"
"733","program to be provided hereunder may"
"734","entail the investment of all or substantially"
"735","all of the assets of a Fund in one or more"
"736","investment companies. The Subadviser will"
"737","place orders pursuant to its investment"
"738","determinations for the Fund either directly"
"739","with the issuer or with any broker or dealer,"
"740","foreign currency dealer, futures commission"
"741","merchant or others selected by it. In"
"742","connection with the selection of such"
"743","brokers or dealers and the placing of such"
"744","orders, subject to applicable law, brokers or"
"745","dealers may be selected who also provide"
"746","brokerage and research services (as those"
"747","terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the"
"748","Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as"
"749","amended (the Exchange Act)) to the Fund"
"750","and/or the other accounts over which the"
"751","Subadviser or its affiliates exercise"
"752","investment discretion. The Subadviser is"
"753","authorized to pay a broker or dealer who"
"754","provides such brokerage and research"
"755","services a commission for executing a"
"756","portfolio transaction for the Fund which is in"
"757","excess of the amount of commission another"
"758","broker or dealer would have charged for"
"759","effecting that transaction if the Subadviser"
"760","determines in good faith that such amount"
"761","of commission is reasonable in relation to the"
"762","value of the brokerage and research services"
"763","provided by such broker or dealer. This"
"764","determination may be viewed in terms of"
"765","either that particular transaction or the"
"766","overall responsibilities which the Subadviser"
"767","and its affiliates have with respect to"
"768","accounts over which they exercise"
"769","investment discretion. The Board may adopt"
"770","policies and procedures that modify and"
"771","restrict the Subadviser's authority regarding"
"772","the execution of the Fund's portfolio"
"773","transactions provided herein. The Subadviser"
"774","shall exercise voting rights, rights to consent"
"775","to corporate action and any other rights"
"776","pertaining to the Allocated Assets subject to"
"777","such direction as the Board may provide,"
"778","and shall perform such other functions of"

"971","Fund, provided that nothing in this"
"972","Agreement shall protect the Subadviser"

"975","otherwise be subject by reason of willful"
"976","misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence"
"977","in the performance of its duties or by reason"
"978","of its reckless disregard of its obligations"
"979","and duties hereunder. As used in this"

"986","affiliates."
"987","          10.         Nothing in this Agreement"
"988","shall limit or restrict the right of any director,"
"989","officer, or employee of the Subadviser who"
"990","may also be a Board member, officer, or"
"991","employee of the Trust or the Fund, to"
"992","engage in any other business or to devote his"
"993","time and attention in part to the management"
"994","or other aspects of any other business,"
"995","whether of a similar nature or a dissimilar"
"996","nature, nor to limit or restrict the right of the"
"997","Subadviser to engage in any other business"
"998","or to render services of any kind, including"
"999","investment advisory and management"
