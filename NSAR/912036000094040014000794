"7000","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"7001","To the Shareholders and"
"7002","Board of Trustees of Aston Funds"
"7003","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"7004","statements of the Aston Funds listed in Exhibit A attached"
"7005","hereto (the Funds) as of and for the periods ended"
"7006","October 31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the"
"7007","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"7008","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"7009","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"7010","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"7011","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"7012","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"7013","SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"7014","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"7015","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"7016","opinion."
"7017","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"7018","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"7019","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"7020","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"7021","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal"
"7022","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"7023","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"7024","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"7025","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"7026","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal"
"7027","control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"7028","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"7029","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"7030","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"7031","the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"7032","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"7033","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"7034","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"7035","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"7036","accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"7037","of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"7038","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"7039","use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a"
"7040","material effect on the financial statements."
"7041","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"7042","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"7043","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"7044","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"7045","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"7046","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"7047","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"7048","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"7049","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"7050","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"7051","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"7052","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"7053","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"7054","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"7055","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"7056","fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"7057","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"7058","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"7059","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"7060","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"7061","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"7062","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"7063","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"7064","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal"
"7065","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"7066","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"7067","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"7068","October 31, 2014."
"7069","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"7070","of management and the Board of Trustees of Aston Funds and"
"7071","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"

INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT

      INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (the Agreement) made this
30th day of May, 2014 by and between ASTON FUNDS, a Delaware
statutory trust (the Trust), on behalf of each series of the
Trust set forth on Schedule A hereto as may be amended from time
to time (each, a Fund and collectively, the Funds) and ASTON
ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the
Adviser).
      WHEREAS, the Trust is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as an open-end
management investment company; and
      WHEREAS, the Trust wishes to retain the Adviser to render
investment advisory services to each Fund, and the Adviser is
willing to furnish such services to each Fund.
      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual
covenants herein contained, it is agreed between the Trust and
the Adviser as follows:
      1.	Appointment.  The Trust hereby appoints the Adviser to
act as investment adviser to each Fund for the periods and on
the terms set forth in this Agreement.  The Adviser accepts such
appointment and agrees to furnish the services herein set forth,
for the compensation herein provided.
      2.	Duties of Adviser.  As investment adviser, the Adviser
shall: (i) manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets
of each Fund, (ii) continuously review, supervise and administer
the investment program of each Fund, (iii) determine in its
discretion, the assets to be held uninvested, (iv) provide the
Trust with records concerning the Adviser's activities which are
required to be maintained by the Trust and (v) render regular
reports to the Trust's officers and Board of Trustees concerning
the Adviser's discharge of the foregoing responsibilities.  The
Adviser shall discharge the foregoing responsibilities subject
to the oversight of the officers and the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and in compliance with the objectives, policies and
limitations set forth in each Fund's then effective prospectus
and statement of additional information.  The Adviser shall
determine from time to time what securities and other
investments will be purchased, retained, sold or exchanged by
each Fund and what portion of the assets of the Fund's portfolio
will be held in the various securities and other investments in
which the Fund invests, and shall implement those decisions, all
subject to the provisions of the Trust's Declaration of Trust
and By-Laws, as amended from time to time, the 1940 Act, and the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and interpretive
guidance issued thereunder by the SEC staff and any other
applicable federal and state law, as well as the investment
objectives, policies and restrictions of the Fund referred to
above, and any other specific policies adopted by the Board and
communicated to the Adviser.  Subject to applicable provisions
of the 1940 Act and direction from the Board, the investment
program to be provided hereunder may entail the investment of
all or substantially all of the assets of a Fund in one or more
investment companies.  The Adviser shall also provide advice and
recommendations with respect to other aspects of the business
and affairs of the Funds, shall exercise voting rights, rights
to consent to corporate action and any other rights pertaining
to a Fund's portfolio securities subject to such direction as
the Board may provide, and shall perform such other functions of
investment management and supervision as may be directed by the
Board.
      3.	Delegation of Duties.  Subject to the Board's
approval, the Adviser and/or a Fund may enter into contracts
with one or more investment subadvisers, including without
limitation, affiliates of the Adviser, in which the Adviser
delegates to such investment subadvisers any or all its duties
specified hereunder, on such terms as the Adviser will determine
to be necessary, desirable or appropriate, provided that in each
case the Adviser shall supervise the activities of each such
subadviser and further provided that such contracts are entered
into in accordance with and meet all applicable requirements of
the 1940 Act and rules thereunder.  Any such delegation shall
not relieve the Adviser of any of its duties hereunder.
      4.	Manager of Managers Structure.  The Adviser shall also
have the authority, upon the approval of the Board and subject
to applicable provisions of the 1940 Act and the regulations
thereunder, to select one or more subadvisers to provide day-to-
day portfolio management with respect to all or a portion of the
assets of any of the Funds and to allocate and reallocate the
assets of a Fund between and among any subadvisers so selected
pursuant to a manager of managers structure.  The Trust
acknowledges that the Adviser would have the authority to retain
and terminate subadvisers, engage new subadvisers and make
material revisions to the terms of the subadvisory agreements
subject to approval of the Board of Trustees, but not
shareholder approval, under this structure.
      5.	Portfolio Transactions.  The Adviser shall select and
monitor the selection of the brokers or dealers that will
execute the purchases and sales of securities for the Funds and
is directed to use its best efforts to ensure that the best
available price and most favorable execution of securities
transactions for the Funds is obtained.  Subject to policies
established by the Board of Trustees of the Trust and
communicated to the Adviser, it is understood that the Adviser
will not be deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to have breached
a fiduciary duty to the Trust or in respect of a Fund, or be in
breach of any obligation owing to the Trust or in respect of a
Fund under this Agreement, or otherwise, solely by reason of its
having caused a Fund to pay a member of a securities exchange, a
broker or a dealer a commission for effecting a securities
transaction for the Fund in excess of the amount of commission
another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have
charged if the Adviser determines in good faith that the
commission paid was reasonable in relation to the brokerage or
research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and interpretive guidance
issued by the SEC thereunder) provided by such member, broker or
dealer, viewed in terms of that particular transaction or the
Adviser's overall responsibilities with respect to the accounts,
including the Funds, as to which it exercises investment
discretion.  The Adviser will promptly communicate to the
officers and Trustees of the Trust such information relating to
Fund transactions as they may reasonably request.
      6.	Expenses.  The Adviser shall bear all expenses, and
shall furnish all necessary services, facilities and personnel,
in connection with its responsibilities under this Agreement.
Other than as herein specifically indicated, the Adviser shall
not be responsible for a Fund's expenses, including, without
limitation:  advisory fees; distribution fees; interest; taxes;
governmental fees; voluntary assessments and other expenses
incurred in connection with membership in investment company
organizations; organizational costs of the Fund; the cost
(including brokerage commissions, transaction fees or charges,
if any) in connection with the purchase or sale of the Fund's
securities and other investments and any losses in connection
therewith; fees and expenses of custodians, transfer agents,
administrators, registrars, independent pricing vendors or other
agents; legal expenses; loan commitment fees; expenses relating
to share certificates; expenses relating to the issuing and
redemption or repurchase of the Fund's shares and servicing
shareholder accounts; expenses of registering and qualifying the
Fund's shares for sale under applicable federal and state law;
expenses of preparing, setting in print, printing and
distributing prospectuses and statements of additional
information and any supplements thereto, reports, proxy
statements, notices and dividends to the Fund's shareholders;
costs of stationery; website costs; costs of meetings of the
Board or any committee thereof, meetings of shareholders and
other meetings of the Fund except as otherwise determined by the
Trustees; Board fees; audit fees; travel expenses of officers,
Trustees and employees of the Trust who are not officers,
employees or directors of the Adviser or its affiliates, if any;
and the Trust's pro rata portion of premiums on any fidelity
bond and other insurance covering the Trust and its officers,
Trustees and employees; litigation expenses and any non-
recurring or extraordinary expenses as may arise, including,
without limitation, those relating to actions, suits or
proceedings to which the Fund is a party and the legal
obligation which the Fund may have to indemnify the Trust's
Trustees and officers with respect thereto.
      The Adviser shall authorize and permit any of its
directors, officers and employees, who may be elected as
Trustees or officers of the Trust, to serve in the capacities in
which they are elected.  No officer or employee of the Trust or
a Fund shall receive from the Trust or a Fund any salary or
other compensation as such Trustee, officer or employee while he
is at the same time a director, officer, or employee of the
Adviser or any affiliated company of the Adviser, except as the
Board may decide.
      7.	Compensation of the Adviser.  For the services to be
rendered by the Adviser as provided in this Agreement, each Fund
shall pay to the Adviser within five business days after the end
of each calendar month a monthly fee of one-twelfth the annual
rate set forth opposite the Fund's name on Schedule B hereto
based on the Fund's average daily net assets for that month.
For the purposes of this Agreement, each Fund's net assets
shall be determined as provided in the Fund's then-current
Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information.
      In the event of termination of this Agreement, the fee
provided in this Section 7 shall be paid on a pro-rata basis,
based on the number of days during which this Agreement was in
effect.
      8.	Reports.  The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and the
Adviser agree to furnish to each other such information
regarding their operations with regard to their affairs as each
may reasonably request.  Information and reports furnished by
the Adviser to the Board and the officers of the Trust shall be
at the Adviser's expense.  In compliance with the requirements
of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Adviser hereby agrees that
any records that it maintains for a Fund are the property of the
Fund, and further agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any
of such records upon the Fund's request; provided, however, that
the Adviser may retain for its records copies of the records so
surrendered. The Adviser further agrees to arrange for the
preservation of any such records for the periods prescribed by
Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act.
      9.	Status of Adviser.  The services of the Adviser to the
Funds are not to be deemed exclusive, and the Adviser shall be
free to render similar services to others so long as its
services to the Funds are not impaired thereby.  In addition,
nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of
any director, officer or employee of the Adviser who may also be
a Trustee, officer or employee of the Trust or a Fund, to engage
in any other business or to devote his or her time and attention
in part to the management or other aspects of any other
business, whether of a similar nature or a dissimilar nature.
      10.	Liability of Adviser.  In the absence of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard
by the Adviser of its obligations and duties hereunder, the
Adviser shall not be subject to any liability whatsoever to a
Fund, or to any shareholder of a Fund, for any error of
judgment, mistake of law or any other act or omission in the
course of, or connected with, rendering services hereunder
including, without limitation, for any losses that may be
sustained in connection with the purchase, holding, redemption
or sale of any security on behalf of the Fund.
      11.	Duration and Termination.  The term of this Agreement
shall commence with respect to a Fund on the date set forth
opposite the Fund's name as set forth on Schedule A hereto (the
Effective Date), provided that first it is approved by the
Board of Trustees of the Trust, including a majority of those
Trustees who are not parties to this Agreement or interested
persons of any party hereto, in the manner provided in
Section 15(c) of the 1940 Act, and by the holders of a majority
of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, and shall
continue in effect for the initial term set forth in Schedule A.
This Agreement shall continue in effect with respect to a Fund
after its initial term, provided such continuance is approved at
least annually by (i) the Trust's Board of Trustees or (ii) the
vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the
Fund; and in either event by a vote of a majority of those
Trustees of the Trust who are not parties to this Agreement or
interested persons of any such party in the manner provided in
Section 15(c) of the 1940 Act.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this Agreement may be terminated with respect to a Fund: (a) at
any time without penalty by the Fund upon the vote of a majority
of the Trustees or by vote of the majority of the Fund's
outstanding voting securities, upon sixty (60) days' written
notice to the Adviser or (b) by the Adviser at any time without
penalty, upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the Fund.  This
Agreement will also terminate automatically in the event of its
assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).  Any notice under this
Agreement shall be given in writing, addressed and delivered or
mailed postpaid, to the other party at the principal office of
such party.
      As used in this Section 11, the terms assignment,
interested person and a vote of a majority of the outstanding"
"7121","voting securities shall have the respective meanings set forth
in Section 2(a)(4), Section 2(a)(19) and Section 2(a)(42) of the
1940 Act and Rule 18f-2 thereunder, subject to such exemptions
as may be granted by the SEC by any rule, regulation, order or
interpretive guidance.
      12.	Declaration of Trust.  The Adviser agrees that for
services rendered to a Fund, or for any claim by it in
connection with services rendered to a Fund, it shall look only
to assets of that Fund for satisfaction and that it shall have
no claim against the assets of any other portfolios of the
Trust.
      13.	Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be construed and
the provisions thereof interpreted under and in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware.
      14.	Severability.  If any provisions of this Agreement
shall be held or made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule
or otherwise, the remainder of this Agreement shall not be
affected thereby.
      15.	Amendments.  No provision of this Agreement may be
changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, but only by an
instrument in writing signed by the party against which
enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is
sought, and with such approvals as required by applicable law.

SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
BETWEEN ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC
AND BARING INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LIMITED
       SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (the Agreement) made
this 30th day of May, 2014 by
and between ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC (hereinafter referred to
as the Investment Adviser) and
BARING INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LIMITED (hereinafter referred to
as the Subadviser), which
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original, but all
of which together shall constitute but one instrument.
W I T N E S S E T H:
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser has been retained by
Aston Funds, a Delaware statutory trust (the
Trust), a registered management investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the 1940 Act) to provide investment advisory services to the
Trust with respect to certain series of the Trust set
forth in Schedule A hereto as may be amended from time to time
(hereinafter referred to as a Fund and
collectively, the Funds of the Trust);
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser wishes to enter into a
contract with the Subadviser to provide
research, analysis, advice and recommendations with respect to
the purchase and sale of securities, and make
investment commitments with respect to such portion of the
Funds' assets as shall be allocated to the Subadviser by
the Investment Adviser from time to time (the Allocated"
"7122","Assets), subject to oversight by the Trustees of the Trust
and the supervision of the Investment Adviser.
       NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein contained, and intending to be
bound, the parties agree as follows:
       1.	In accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement
between the Trust and the Investment
Adviser (Investment Advisory Agreement) with respect to the
Funds, the Investment Adviser hereby appoints the
Subadviser to act as subadviser with respect to the Allocated
Assets for the period and on the terms set forth in this
Agreement. The Subadviser accepts such appointment and agrees to
render the services set forth herein, for the
compensation provided herein.
       2.	As compensation for the services enumerated herein,
the Investment Adviser will pay the
Subadviser a fee with respect to the Allocated Assets, which
shall be calculated and payable monthly in arrears
based on the average daily net assets of the Fund, in an amount
equal to 50% of the positive difference, if any, of (x)
the advisory fee payable to the Investment Adviser with respect
to the Allocated Assets of the Fund (before
reduction of the fee payable to Subadviser) minus (y) the sum
of: (i) any investment advisory fees waived by the
Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense limitation or
reimbursement agreement with the Fund, (ii) any
reimbursement of expenses by the Investment Adviser pursuant to
an expense limitation or reimbursement
agreement with the Fund, and (iii) any payments made by the
Investment Adviser to third parties that provide
distribution, shareholder services or similar services on behalf
of the Fund.  The Investment Adviser shall furnish to
the Subadviser, in a form mutually agreed upon by the parties,
such information or reports as are necessary to
evidence the calculation of the fees pursuant to this Section.
       For the purposes of this Agreement, a Fund's net assets
shall be determined as provided in the Fund's
then-current Prospectus (as used herein this term includes the
related Statement of Additional Information).
       If this Agreement shall become effective subsequent to
the first day of a month, or shall terminate before
the last day of a month, the Subadviser's compensation for such
fraction of the month shall be prorated based on the
number of calendar days of such month during which the Agreement
is effective.
       3.	This Agreement shall become effective with respect to
a Fund as of the date set forth opposite the
Fund's name as set forth on Schedule A hereto (the Effective"
"7123","Date), provided that it has been approved by the
Trustees of the Trust in accordance with the provisions of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder and, if so required
by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, by the shareholders of
the Fund in accordance with the requirements of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
       4.	This Agreement shall continue in effect for the
initial term set forth in Schedule A.  It shall be
renewed automatically thereafter with respect to a Fund by the
Investment Adviser and the Subadviser for
successive periods not exceeding one year, if and only if such
renewal and continuance is specifically approved at
least annually by the Board of Trustees of the Trust or by a
vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities
of the Fund as prescribed by the 1940 Act and provided further
that such continuance is approved at least annually
thereafter by a vote of a majority of the Trust's Trustees, who
are not parties to such Agreement or interested
persons of such a party, cast in person at a meeting called for
the purpose of voting on such approval.  This
Agreement will terminate with respect to a Fund without the
payment of any penalty upon termination of the
Investment Advisory Agreement relating to a Fund by either party
thereto (accompanied by simultaneous notice to
the Subadviser) or upon sixty days' written notice to the
Subadviser that the Trustees of the Trust, the Investment
Adviser or the shareholders by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund, as provided by the
1940 Act, have terminated this Agreement.  This Agreement may
also be terminated by the Subadviser with respect
to a Fund without penalty upon sixty days' written notice to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust.
       This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect
to a Fund in the event of its assignment or, upon
notice thereof to the Subadviser, the assignment of the
Investment Advisory Agreement, unless its continuation
thereafter is approved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust and
the shareholders of the Fund if so required by the
1940 Act (in each case as the term assignment is defined in
Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, subject to such
exemptions as may be granted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) by any rule, regulation, order
or interpretive guidance).
       5.	Subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the Investment Adviser, the
Subadviser will provide an investment program for the Allocated
Assets, including investment research and
management with respect to securities and investments, including
cash and cash equivalents, and will determine
from time to time what securities and other investments will be
purchased, retained or sold.  The Subadviser will
provide the services under this Agreement in accordance with
each Fund's investment objective, policies and
restrictions as stated in the Prospectus, as provided to the
Subadviser by the Investment Adviser.  The Subadviser
further agrees that, in all matters relating to the performance
of this Agreement, it:
              (a)	shall act in conformity with the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and currently
effective registration statements under the 1940 Act and the
Securities Act of 1933 and any amendments or
supplements thereto (the Registration Statements) and with the
written policies, procedures and guidelines of each
Fund, and written instructions and directions of the Trustees of
the Trust and shall comply with the requirements of
the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the
rules thereunder, and all other applicable federal and
state laws and regulations.  The Trust agrees to provide
Subadviser with copies of the Trust's Declaration of Trust,
By-Laws, Registration Statements, written policies, procedures
and guidelines, and written instructions and
directions of the Trustees, and any amendments or supplements to
any of them at, or, if practicable, before the time
such materials, instructions or directives become effective;
              (b)	will pay expenses incurred by it in
connection with its activities under this Agreement
other than the cost of securities and other investments
(including brokerage commissions and other transaction
changes, if any) purchased for each Fund, provided that the
Subadviser will not pay for or provide a credit with
respect to any research provided to it in accordance with
Section 5(c).  The Subadviser shall not be responsible for
the Fund's or Adviser's expenses, which shall include, but not
be limited to, organizational and offering expenses;
expenses for legal, accounting and auditing services; taxes and
governmental fees; dues and expenses incurred in
connection with membership in investment company organizations;
costs of printing and distributing shareholder
reports, proxy materials, prospectuses, stock certificates and
distribution of dividends; charges of the Fund's
custodians and sub-custodians, administrators and sub-
administrators, registrars, transfer agents, dividend disbursing
agents and dividend reinvestment plan agents; payment for
portfolio pricing services to a pricing agent, if any;
registration and filing fees of the SEC; expenses of registering
or qualifying securities of the Fund for sale in the
various states; freight and other charges in connection with the
shipment of the Fund's portfolio securities; fees and
expenses of Trustees; salaries of shareholder relations
personnel; costs of shareholders meetings; insurance; interest;
brokerage costs; and litigation and other extraordinary or non-
recurring expenses;
              (c)	will place orders pursuant to its investment
determinations for the Allocated Assets either
directly with any broker or dealer, or with the issuer.  In
placing orders with brokers or dealers, the Subadviser will
attempt to obtain the best overall price and the most favorable
execution of its orders.  Subject to policies established
by the Trustees of the Trust and communicated to the Subadviser,
it is understood that the Subadviser will not be
deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to have breached a fiduciary
duty to the Trust or in respect of a Fund, or be in
breach of any obligation owing to the Investment Adviser or the
Trust or in respect of a Fund under this Agreement,
or otherwise, solely by reason of its having caused the Fund to
pay a member of a securities exchange, a broker or a
dealer a commission for effecting a securities transaction for
the Fund in excess of the amount of commission
another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have
charged if the Subadviser determines in good faith that
the commission paid was reasonable in relation to the brokerage
or research services (as those terms are defined in
Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
interpretive guidance issued by the SEC thereunder)
provided by such member, broker or dealer, viewed in terms of
that particular transaction or the Subadviser's overall
responsibilities with respect to the accounts, including the
Fund, as to which it exercises investment discretion;
              (d)	will periodically review the valuation of
securities comprising the Allocated Assets of
each Fund as obtained by the Fund's administrator and furnished
by it to Subadviser, and will promptly notify the
Trust and the Investment Adviser if the Subadviser believes that
any such valuations may not properly reflect the
market value of any securities owned by the Fund, provided,
however, that the Subadviser is not required by this
sub-paragraph to obtain valuations of any such securities from
brokers or dealers or otherwise, or to otherwise
independently verify valuations of any such securities;
              (e)	unless otherwise instructed, will be
responsible for voting all proxies of the Allocated
Assets in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Guidelines of Subadviser (the Proxy Policy), provided
that such Proxy Policy and any amendments thereto are furnished
to the Trust;
              (f)	will attend regular business and investment-
related meetings with the Trust's Board of
Trustees and the Investment Adviser if requested to do so by the
Trust and/or the Investment Adviser, and at its
expense, shall supply the Board, the officers of the Trust, and
the Investment Adviser with all information and
reports reasonably required by them and reasonably available to
the Subadviser relating to the services provided by
the Subadviser hereunder; and
              (g)	will maintain books and records with respect
to the securities transactions for the
Allocated Assets of each Fund and proxy voting record for the
Allocated Assets of the Fund, furnish to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust's Board of Trustees such
periodic and special reports as they may request with
respect to the Fund, and provide in advance to the Investment
Adviser all of the Subadviser's reports to the Trust's
Board of Trustees for examination and review within a reasonable
time prior to the Trust's Board meetings.
       6.	The Investment Adviser or its affiliates may, from
time to time, engage other subadvisers to advise
other series of the Trust (or portions thereof) or other
registered investment companies (or series or portions thereof)
that may be deemed to be under common control (each a Sub-"
"7124","Advised Fund).  The Subadviser agrees that it will
not consult with any other subadviser engaged by the Investment
Adviser or its affiliates with respect to transactions
in securities or other assets concerning a Fund or another Sub-
Advised Fund, except to the extent permitted by the
rules under the 1940 Act that permit certain transactions with a
subadviser or its affiliates.
       7.	Subadviser agrees with respect to the services
provided to each Fund that it:
              (a)	will promptly communicate to the Investment
Adviser such information relating to Fund
transactions as the officers and Trustees of the Trust may
reasonably request and as communicated to the
Subadviser; and
              (b)	will treat confidentially and as proprietary
information of the Trust all records and other
information relative to each Fund and its prior, present or
potential shareholders, and will not use such records and
information for any purpose other than performance of its
responsibilities and duties hereunder (except after prior
notification to and approval in writing by the Trust, which
approval may not be withheld where Subadviser is
advised by counsel that the Subadviser may be exposed to civil
or criminal contempt or other proceedings for failure
to comply, when requested to divulge such information by duly
constituted authorities, or when so requested by the
Trust).
       8.	In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, Subadviser acknowledges
that all records which it maintains for the Trust are the
property of the Trust and agrees to surrender promptly to the
Trust any of such records upon the Trust's request, provided,
that Subadviser may retain copies thereof at its own
expense.  Subadviser further agrees to preserve for the periods
prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the
records required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940
Act relating to transactions placed by Subadviser
for the Fund.  Subadviser further agrees to maintain each Fund's
proxy voting record with respect to the Allocated
Assets in a form mutually agreeable between the parties and
which contains the information required by Form N-PX
under the 1940 Act.
       9.	It is expressly understood and agreed that the
services to be rendered by the Subadviser to the
Investment Adviser under the provisions of this Agreement are
not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser
shall be free to provide similar or different services to others
so long as its ability to provide the services provided
for in this Agreement shall not be materially impaired thereby.
In addition, but without limiting any separate
agreement between the Subadviser and the Investment Adviser to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit
or restrict the right of any director, officer, or employee of
the Subadviser who may also be a Trustee, officer, or
employee of the Trust, to engage in any other business or to
devote his or her time and attention in part to the
management or other aspects of any other business, whether of a
similar nature or a dissimilar nature.
       10.	The Investment Adviser agrees that it will
furnish currently to the Subadviser all information with
reference to each Fund and the Trust that is reasonably
necessary to permit the Subadviser to carry out its
responsibilities under this Agreement, and the parties agree
that they will from time to time consult and make
appropriate arrangements as to specific information that is
required under this paragraph and the frequency and
manner with which it shall be supplied.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Investment Adviser will
furnish to Subadviser procedures consistent with the Trust's
contract with each Fund's custodian from time to time
(the Custodian), and reasonably satisfactory to Subadviser,
for consummation of portfolio transactions for each
Fund by payment to or delivery by the Custodian of all cash
and/or securities or other investments due to or from the
Fund, and Subadviser shall not have possession or custody
thereof or any responsibility or liability with respect to
such custody.  Upon giving proper instructions to the Custodian,
Subadviser shall have no responsibility or liability
with respect to custodial arrangements or the acts, omissions or
other conduct of the Custodian.
       11.	The Subadviser and its directors, officers,
stockholders, employees and agents shall not be liable
for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss
suffered by the Investment Adviser or the Trust in
connection with any matters to which this Agreement relates or
for any other act or omission in the performance by
the Subadviser of its duties under this Agreement except that
nothing herein contained shall be construed to protect
the Subadviser against any liability by reason of the
Subadviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence
in the performance of its duties or by reckless disregard of its
obligations or duties under this Agreement.
       12.	If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
or made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule
or otherwise, the remainder of the Agreement shall not be
affected thereby.  Except to the extent governed by federal
law including the 1940 Act, this Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Delaware, without applying the principles of conflicts
of law thereunder.
       13.	No provision of this Agreement may be changed,
discharged or terminated orally, but only by an
instrument in writing signed by the party against which
enforcement of the change, discharge or termination is
sought.  No amendment of this Agreement shall be effective with
respect to the Trust until approved as required by
applicable law.
       14.	Any notice to be given hereunder may be given by
personal notification or by facsimile
transmission, to the party specified at the address stated

SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
BETWEEN ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC
AND CORNERSTONE INVESTMENT PARTNERS, LLC
       SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (the Agreement) made
this 30th day of May, 2014 by
and between ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC (hereinafter referred to
as the Investment Adviser) and
CORNERSTONE INVESTMENT PARTNERS, LLC (hereinafter referred to as
the Subadviser), which
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original, but all
of which together shall constitute but one instrument.
W I T N E S S E T H:
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser has been retained by
Aston Funds, a Delaware statutory trust (the
Trust), a registered management investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the 1940 Act), to provide investment advisory services to the
Trust with respect to certain series of the Trust set
forth in Schedule A hereto as may be amended from time to time
(hereinafter referred to as a Fund and,
collectively, the Funds of the Trust);
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser wishes to enter into a
contract with the Subadviser to provide
research, analysis, advice and recommendations with respect to
the purchase and sale of securities, and make
investment commitments with respect to such portion of the
Funds' assets as shall be allocated to the Subadviser by
the Investment Adviser from time to time (the Allocated"
"7125","Assets), subject to oversight by the Trustees of the Trust
and the supervision of the Investment Adviser.
       NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein contained, and intending to be
bound, the parties agree as follows:
       1.	In accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement
between the Trust and the Investment
Adviser (Investment Advisory Agreement) with respect to the
Funds, the Investment Adviser hereby appoints the
Subadviser to act as subadviser with respect to the Allocated
Assets for the period and on the terms set forth in this
Agreement. The Subadviser accepts such appointment and agrees to
render the services set forth herein, for the
compensation provided herein.
       2.	As compensation for the services enumerated herein,
the Investment Adviser will pay the
Subadviser a fee with respect to the Allocated Assets, which
shall be calculated and payable monthly in arrears
based on the average daily net assets of the Fund, in an amount
equal to 50% of the positive difference, if any, of (x)
the advisory fee payable to the Investment Adviser with respect
to the Allocated Assets of the Fund (before
reduction of the fee payable to Subadviser) minus (y) the sum
of: (i) any investment advisory fees waived by the
Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense limitation or
reimbursement agreement with the Fund, (ii) any
reimbursement of expenses by the Investment Adviser pursuant to
an expense limitation or reimbursement
agreement with the Fund, and (iii) any payments made by the
Investment Adviser to third parties that provide
distribution, shareholder services or similar services on behalf
of the Fund.  If the foregoing calculation results in a
negative amount, such amount shall be payable by the Subadviser
within 30 days of receipt of notice from the
Investment Adviser, which notice shall include the basis for the
calculation.
       For the purposes of this Agreement, a Fund's net assets
shall be determined as provided in the Fund's
then-current Prospectus (as used herein, this term includes the
related Statement of Additional Information).
       If this Agreement shall become effective subsequent to
the first day of a month, or shall terminate before
the last day of a month, the Subadviser's compensation for such
fraction of the month shall be prorated based on the
number of calendar days of such month during which the Agreement
is effective.
       3.	This Agreement shall become effective with respect to
a Fund as of the date set forth opposite the
Fund's name as set forth on Schedule A hereto (the Effective"
"7126","Date), provided that it has been approved by the
Trustees of the Trust in accordance with the provisions of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder and, if so required
by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, by the shareholders of
the Fund in accordance with the requirements of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
       4.	This Agreement shall continue in effect for the
initial term set forth in Schedule A.  It shall be
renewed automatically thereafter with respect to a Fund by the
Investment Adviser and the Subadviser for
successive periods not exceeding one year, if and only if such
renewal and continuance is specifically approved at
least annually by the Board of Trustees of the Trust or by a
vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities
of the Fund as prescribed by the 1940 Act and provided further
that such continuance is approved at least annually
thereafter by a vote of a majority of the Trust's Trustees, who
are not parties to such Agreement or interested
persons of such a party, cast in person at a meeting called for
the purpose of voting on such approval.  This
Agreement will terminate with respect to a Fund without the
payment of any penalty upon termination of the
Investment Advisory Agreement relating to the Fund by either
party thereto (accompanied by simultaneous notice to
the Subadviser) or upon sixty days' written notice to the
Subadviser that the Trustees of the Trust, the Investment
Adviser or the shareholders by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund, as provided by the
1940 Act, have terminated this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated upon
less than sixty days' notice to the Subadviser upon a material
breach of this Agreement or if the Trustees determine
that other circumstances have, or likely will have, a material
adverse effect on the Subadviser's abilities to perform
its obligations hereunder, including without limitation,
notification of the departure of a portfolio manager of the
Fund or other key personnel change.  This Agreement may also be
terminated by the Subadviser with respect to a
Fund without penalty upon sixty days' written notice to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust.
       This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect
to a Fund in the event of its assignment or, upon
notice thereof to the Subadviser, the assignment of the
Investment Advisory Agreement, unless its continuation
thereafter is approved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust and
the shareholders of the Fund if so required by the
1940 Act (in each case as the term assignment is defined in
Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, subject to such
exemptions as may be granted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) by any rule, regulation, order
or interpretive guidance).
       5.	Subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the Investment Adviser, the
Subadviser will provide an investment program for the Allocated
Assets, including investment research and
management with respect to securities and investments, including
cash and cash equivalents, and will determine
from time to time what securities and other investments will be
purchased, retained or sold.  The Subadviser will
provide the services under this Agreement in accordance with
each Fund's investment objective, policies and
restrictions as stated in the Prospectus, as provided to the
Subadviser by the Investment Adviser.  The Subadviser
further agrees that, in all matters relating to the performance
of this Agreement, it:
              (a)	shall act in conformity with the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and currently
effective registration statements under the 1940 Act and the
Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act) and any
amendments or supplements thereto (the Registration"
"7127","Statements) and with the written policies, procedures and
guidelines of each Fund, and written instructions and directions
of the Trustees of the Trust and shall comply with
the requirements of the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940 (the Advisers Act) and the rules
thereunder, and all other applicable federal and state laws and
regulations.  The Trust agrees to provide Subadviser
with copies of the Trust's Declaration of Trust, By-Laws,
Registration Statements, written policies, procedures and
guidelines, and written instructions and directions of the
Trustees, and any amendments or supplements to any of
them at, or, if practicable, before the time such materials,
instructions or directives become effective;
              (b)	will maintain at all times during the term
of this Agreement, in full force and effect,
insurance, including without limitation errors and omissions
insurance, with reputable insurance carriers, in such
amounts, covering  such risks and liabilities, and with such
deductibles and self-insurance as are consistent with
customary industry practice;
              (c)	will pay expenses incurred by it in
connection with its activities under this Agreement
other than the cost of securities and other investments
(including brokerage commissions and other transaction
changes, if any) purchased for each Fund, provided that the
Subadviser will not pay for or provide a credit with
respect to any research provided to it in accordance with
Section 5(d);
              (d)	will place orders pursuant to its investment
determinations for the Allocated Assets either
directly with any broker or dealer, or with the issuer.  In
placing orders with brokers or dealers, the Subadviser will
attempt to obtain the best overall price and the most favorable
execution of its orders.  Subject to policies established
by the Trustees of the Trust and communicated to the Subadviser,
it is understood that the Subadviser will not be
deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to have breached a fiduciary
duty to the Trust or in respect of a Fund, or be in
breach of any obligation owing to the Investment Adviser or the
Trust or in respect of a Fund under this Agreement,
or otherwise, solely by reason of its having caused the Fund to
pay a member of a securities exchange, a broker or a
dealer a commission for effecting a securities transaction for
the Fund in excess of the amount of commission
another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have
charged if the Subadviser determines in good faith that
the commission paid was reasonable in relation to the brokerage
or research services (as those terms are defined in
Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
interpretive guidance issued by the SEC thereunder)
provided by such member, broker or dealer, viewed in terms of
that particular transaction or the Subadviser's overall
responsibilities with respect to the accounts, including the
Fund, as to which it exercises investment discretion;
              (e)	will review the daily valuation of
securities comprising the Allocated Assets of each
Fund as obtained on a daily basis by the Fund's administrator
and furnished by it to Subadviser, and will promptly
notify the Trust and the Investment Adviser if the Subadviser
believes that any such valuations may not properly
reflect the market value of any securities owned by the Fund,
provided, however, that the Subadviser is not required
by this subparagraph to obtain valuations of any such securities
from brokers or dealers or otherwise, or to otherwise
independently verify valuations of any such securities;
              (f)	unless otherwise instructed, will be
responsible for voting all proxies of the Allocated
Assets in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Guidelines of Subadviser (the Proxy Policy), provided
that such Proxy Policy and any amendments thereto are furnished
to the Trust;
              (g)	will attend regular business and investment-
related meetings with the Trust's Board of
Trustees and the Investment Adviser if requested to do so by the
Trust and/or the Investment Adviser, and at its
expense, shall supply the Board, the officers of the Trust, and
the Investment Adviser with all information and
reports reasonably required by them and reasonably available to
the Subadviser relating to the services provided by
the Subadviser hereunder;
              (h)	will maintain books and records with respect
to the securities transactions for the
Allocated Assets of each Fund and proxy voting record for the
Allocated Assets of the Fund, furnish to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust's Board of Trustees such
periodic and special reports as they may request with
respect to the Fund, and provide in advance to the Investment
Adviser all of the Subadviser's reports to the Trust's
Board of Trustees for examination and review within a reasonable
time prior to the Trust's Board meetings; and
              (i)	will pay expenses incurred by the Trust for
any matters related to any transaction or event
that is deemed to result in a change of control of the
Subadviser or otherwise result in the assignment of the Sub-
Investment Advisory Agreement under the 1940 Act.
       6.	The Investment Adviser or its affiliates may, from
time to time, engage other subadvisers to advise
other series of the Trust (or portions thereof) or other
registered investment companies (or series or portions thereof)
that may be deemed to be under common control (each a Sub-"
"7128","Advised Fund).  The Subadviser agrees that it will
not consult with any other  subadviser engaged by the Investment
Adviser or its affiliates with respect to
transactions in securities or other assets concerning a Fund or
another Sub-Advised Fund, except to the extent
permitted by the rules under the 1940 Act that permit certain
transactions with a subadviser or its affiliates.
       7.	Subadviser agrees with respect to the services
provided to each Fund that:
              (a)	it will promptly communicate to the
Investment Adviser such information relating to
Fund transactions as the officers and Trustees of the Trust may
reasonably request and as communicated to the
Subadviser;
              (b)	it will treat confidentially and as
proprietary information of the Trust all records and other
information relative to each Fund and its prior, present or
potential shareholders (Confidential Information), will
comply at all times with all applicable laws and regulations
relating to the confidentiality of nonpublic personal"
"7129","information including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or other
federal or state privacy laws and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, and will not use such Confidential
Information for any purpose other than the performance
of its responsibilities and duties hereunder (except after prior
notification to and approval in writing by the Trust,
which approval may not be withheld where Subadviser is advised
by counsel that the Subadviser may be exposed to
civil or criminal contempt or other proceedings for failure to
comply, when requested to divulge such information by
duly constituted authorities, or when so requested by the
Trust); and
              (c)	during the term of this Agreement and for a
period of eighteen (18) months following the
termination of this Agreement, Subadviser (and its directors,
officers, stockholders, employees, and agents) will not,
directly or indirectly, solicit or induce any of the Fund's
shareholders to be withdrawn from investment in any series
of the Trust.
       8.	Each party represents and warrants to the other party
that the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement is within its powers and have been duly
authorized by all necessary actions of its directors or
members, and no action by, or in respect of, or filing with, any
governmental body, agency or official is required on
the part of either party for execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement, and the execution, delivery and
performance by either party of this Agreement do not contravene
or constitute a violation of, or a material default
under, (i) any provision of applicable law, rule or regulation,
(ii) such party's governing instruments, or (iii) any
agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other
instrument binding upon such party.
       9.	In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, Subadviser acknowledges
that all records which it maintains for the Trust are the
property of the Trust and agrees to surrender promptly to the
Trust any of such records upon the Trust's request, provided
that Subadviser may retain copies thereof at its own
expense.  Subadviser further agrees to preserve for the periods
prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the
records required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940
Act relating to transactions placed by Subadviser
for the Fund.  Subadviser further agrees to maintain each Fund's
proxy voting record with respect to the Allocated
Assets in a form mutually agreeable between the parties and
which contains the information required by Form N-PX
under the 1940 Act.
       10.	It is expressly understood and agreed that the
services to be rendered by the Subadviser to the
Investment Adviser under the provisions of this Agreement are
not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser
shall be free to provide similar or different services to others
so long as its ability to provide the services provided
for in this Agreement shall not be materially impaired thereby.
In addition, but without limiting any separate
agreement between the Subadviser and the Investment Adviser to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit
or restrict the right of any director, officer, or employee of
the Subadviser who may also be a Trustee, officer, or
employee of the Trust, to engage in any other business or to
devote his or her time and attention in part to the
management or other aspects of any other business, whether of a
similar nature or a dissimilar nature.
       11.	The Investment Adviser agrees that it will
furnish currently to the Subadviser all information with
reference to each Fund and the Trust that is reasonably
necessary to permit the Subadviser to carry out its
responsibilities under this Agreement, and the parties agree
that they will from time to time consult and make
appropriate arrangements as to specific information that is
required under this paragraph and the frequency and
manner with which it shall be supplied.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Investment Adviser will
furnish to Subadviser procedures consistent with the Trust's
contract with each Fund's custodian from time to time
(the Custodian), and reasonably satisfactory to Subadviser,
for consummation of portfolio transactions for each
Fund by payment to or delivery by the Custodian of all cash
and/or securities or other investments due to or from the
Fund, and Subadviser shall not have possession or custody
thereof or any responsibility or liability with respect to
such custody.  Upon giving proper instructions to the Custodian,
Subadviser shall have no responsibility or liability
with respect to custodial arrangements or the acts, omissions or
other conduct of the Custodian.
       12.	The Subadviser and its directors, officers,
stockholders, employees and agents shall not be liable
for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss
suffered by the Investment Adviser or the Trust in
connection with any matters to which this Agreement relates or
for any other act or omission in the performance by
the Subadviser of its duties under this Agreement except that
nothing herein contained shall be construed to protect
the Subadviser against any liability by reason of the
Subadviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence
in the performance of its duties or by reckless disregard of its
obligations or duties under this Agreement.
       13.	Each party shall indemnify and hold harmless the
other party and its respective control persons (as
described in Section 15 of the 1933 Act) and their respective
directors, stockholders, members and employees
(collectively, Indemnitees) against any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (including
reasonable legal and other expenses of investigating or
defending any alleged loss, claim, damages or liabilities) to
which any of the Indemnitees may become subject under the 1933
Act, the 1940 Act, or the Advisers Act, or under
any other statute, at common law or otherwise, arising out of or
based on (i) any willful misfeasance, bad faith, or
gross negligence of the other party in the performance of, or
reckless disregard of, any of its duties or obligations
hereunder, or (ii) any material breach of this Agreement by the
other party.
       14.	If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
or made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule
or otherwise, the remainder of the Agreement shall not be
affected thereby.  Except to the extent governed by federal
law including the 1940 Act, this Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Delaware, without applying the principles of conflicts
of law thereunder.
       15.	No provision of this Agreement may be changed,
discharged or terminated orally, but only by an
instrument in writing signed by the party against which
enforcement of the change, discharge or termination is
sought.  No amendment of this Agreement shall be effective with
respect to the Trust until approved as required by
applicable law.
       16.	Any notice to be given hereunder may be given by

SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
BETWEEN ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC
AND FAIRPOINTE CAPITAL LLC
       SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (the Agreement) made
this 30th day of May, 2014 by
and between ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC (hereinafter referred to
as the Investment Adviser) and
FAIRPOINTE CAPITAL LLC (hereinafter referred to as the
Subadviser), which Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be
an original, but all of which together shall
constitute but one instrument.
W I T N E S S E T H:
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser has been retained by
Aston Funds, a Delaware statutory trust (the
Trust), a registered management investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the 1940 Act), to provide investment advisory services to the
Trust with respect to certain series of the Trust set
forth in Schedule A hereto as may be amended from time to time
(hereinafter referred to as a Fund and,
collectively, the Funds of the Trust);
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser wishes to enter into a
contract with the Subadviser to provide
research, analysis, advice and recommendations with respect to
the purchase and sale of securities, and make
investment commitments with respect to such portion of the
Funds' assets as shall be allocated to the Subadviser by
the Investment Adviser from time to time (the Allocated"
"7130","Assets), subject to oversight by the Trustees of the Trust
and the supervision of the Investment Adviser.
       NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein contained, and intending to be
bound, the parties agree as follows:
       1.	In accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement
between the Trust and the Investment
Adviser (Investment Advisory Agreement) with respect to the
Funds, the Investment Adviser hereby appoints the
Subadviser to act as subadviser with respect to the Allocated
Assets for the period and on the terms set forth in this
Agreement.  The Subadviser accepts such appointment and agrees
to render the services set forth herein, for the
compensation provided herein.
       2.	As compensation for the services enumerated herein,
the Investment Adviser will pay the
Subadviser a fee with respect to the Allocated Assets, which
shall be calculated and payable monthly in arrears
based on the average daily net assets of the Fund, as set forth
in Schedule B.  For the purposes of this Agreement, a
Fund's net assets shall be determined as provided in the
Fund's then-current Prospectus (as used herein, this term
includes the related Statement of Additional Information).
       If this Agreement shall become effective subsequent to
the first day of a month, or shall terminate before
the last day of a month, the Subadviser's compensation for such
fraction of the month shall be prorated based on the
number of calendar days of such month during which the Agreement
is effective.
       3.	This Agreement shall become effective with respect to
a Fund as of the date set forth opposite the
Fund's name as set forth on Schedule A hereto (the Effective"
"7131","Date), provided that it has been approved by the
Trustees of the Trust in accordance with the provisions of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder and, if so required
by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, by the shareholders of
the Fund in accordance with the requirements of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
       4.	This Agreement shall continue in effect for the
initial term set forth in Schedule A.  It shall be
renewed automatically thereafter with respect to a Fund by the
Investment Adviser and the Subadviser for
successive periods not exceeding one year, if and only if such
renewal and continuance is specifically approved at
least annually by the Board of Trustees of the Trust or by a
vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities
of the Fund as prescribed by the 1940 Act and provided further
that such continuance is approved at least annually
thereafter by a vote of a majority of the Trust's Trustees, who
are not parties to such Agreement or interested
persons of such a party, cast in person at a meeting called for
the purpose of voting on such approval.  This
Agreement will terminate with respect to a Fund without the
payment of any penalty upon termination of the
Investment Advisory Agreement relating to the Fund by either
party thereto (accompanied by simultaneous notice to
the Subadviser) or upon sixty days' written notice to the
Subadviser that the Trustees of the Trust, the Investment
Adviser or the shareholders by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund, as provided by the
1940 Act, have terminated this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated upon
less than sixty days' notice to the Subadviser upon a material
breach of this Agreement or if the Trustees determine
that other circumstances have, or likely will have, a material
adverse effect on the Subadviser's abilities to perform
its obligations hereunder, including without limitation,
notification of the departure of a portfolio manager of the
Fund or other key personnel change.  This Agreement may also be
terminated by the Subadviser with respect to a
Fund without penalty upon sixty days' written notice to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust.
       This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect
to a Fund in the event of its assignment or, upon
notice thereof to the Subadviser, the assignment of the
Investment Advisory Agreement, unless its continuation
thereafter is approved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust and
the shareholders of the Fund if so required by the
1940 Act (in each case as the term assignment is defined in
Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, subject to such
exemptions as may be granted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) by any rule, regulation, order
or interpretive guidance).
       5.	Subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the Investment Adviser, the
Subadviser will provide an investment program for the Allocated
Assets, including investment research and
management with respect to securities and investments, including
cash and cash equivalents, and will determine
from time to time what securities and other investments will be
purchased, retained or sold.  The Subadviser will
provide the services under this Agreement in accordance with
each Fund's investment objective, policies and
restrictions as stated in the Prospectus, as provided to the
Subadviser by the Investment Adviser.  The


Subadviser further agrees that, in all matters relating to the
performance of this Agreement, it:
              (a)	shall act in conformity with the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and currently

"7132","Statements) and with the written policies, procedures and
guidelines of each Fund, and written instructions and directions
of the Trustees of the Trust and shall comply with
the requirements of the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940 (the Advisers Act) and the rules
thereunder, and all other applicable federal and state laws and
regulations.  The Trust agrees to provide Subadviser
with copies of the Trust's Declaration of Trust, By-Laws,
Registration Statements, written policies, procedures and
guidelines, and written instructions and directions of the
Trustees, and any amendments or supplements to any of
them at, or, if practicable, before the time such materials,
instructions or directives become effective;
              (b)	will maintain at all times during the term
of this Agreement, in full force and effect,
insurance, including without limitation errors and omissions
insurance, with reputable insurance carriers, in such
amounts, covering  such risks and liabilities, and with such
deductibles and self-insurance as are consistent with
customary industry practice;
              (c)	will pay expenses incurred by it in
connection with its activities under this Agreement
other than the cost of securities and other investments
(including brokerage commissions and other transaction
changes, if any) purchased for each Fund, provided that the
Subadviser will not pay for or provide a credit with
respect to any research provided to it in accordance with
Section 5(d);
              (d)	will place orders pursuant to its investment
determinations for the Allocated Assets either
directly with any broker or dealer, or with the issuer.  In
placing orders with brokers or dealers, the Subadviser will
attempt to obtain the best overall price and the most favorable
execution of its orders.  Subject to policies established
by the Trustees of the Trust and communicated to the Subadviser,
it is understood that the Subadviser will not be
deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to have breached a fiduciary
duty to the Trust or in respect of a Fund, or be in
breach of any obligation owing to the Investment Adviser or the
Trust or in respect of a Fund under this Agreement,
or otherwise, solely by reason of its having caused the Fund to
pay a member of a securities exchange, a broker or a
dealer a commission for effecting a securities transaction for
the Fund in excess of the amount of commission
another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have
charged if the Subadviser determines in good faith that
the commission paid was reasonable in relation to the brokerage
or research services (as those terms are defined in
Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
interpretive guidance issued by the SEC thereunder)
provided by such member, broker or dealer, viewed in terms of
that particular transaction or the Subadviser's overall
responsibilities with respect to the accounts, including the
Fund, as to which it exercises investment discretion;
              (e)	will review the daily valuation of
securities comprising the Allocated Assets of each
Fund as obtained on a daily basis by the Fund's administrator
and furnished by it to Subadviser, and will promptly
notify the Trust and the Investment Adviser if the Subadviser
believes that any such valuations may not properly
reflect the market value of any securities owned by the Fund,
provided, however, that the Subadviser is not required
by this subparagraph to obtain valuations of any such securities
from brokers or dealers or otherwise, or to otherwise
independently verify valuations of any such securities;
              (f)	unless otherwise instructed, will be
responsible for voting all proxies of the Allocated
Assets in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and

time to time, engage other subadvisers to advise

Information for any purpose other than the performance
of its responsibilities and duties hereunder (except after prior
notification to and approval in writing by the Trust,
which approval may not be withheld where Subadviser is advised
by counsel that the Subadviser may be exposed to
civil or criminal contempt or other proceedings for failure to
comply, when requested to divulge such information by
duly constituted authorities, or when so requested by the

Act relating to transactions placed by Subadviser
for the Fund.  Subadviser further agrees to maintain each Fund's
proxy voting record with respect to the Allocated
Assets in a form mutually agreeable between the parties and
which contains the information required by Form N-PX
under the 1940 Act.
       9.	It is expressly understood and agreed that the
services to be rendered by the Subadviser to the
Investment Adviser under the provisions of this Agreement are
not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser
shall be free to provide similar or different services to others
so long as its ability to provide the services provided
for in this Agreement shall not be materially impaired thereby.
In addition, but without limiting any separate
agreement between the Subadviser and the Investment Adviser to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit
or restrict the right of any director, officer, or employee of
the Subadviser who may also be a Trustee, officer, or
employee of the Trust, to engage in any other business or to

required under this paragraph and the frequency and
manner with which it shall be supplied.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Investment Adviser will

(the Custodian), and reasonably satisfactory to Subadviser,
for consummation of portfolio transactions for each
Fund by payment to or delivery by the Custodian of all cash
and/or securities or other investments due to or from the
Fund, and Subadviser shall not have possession or custody
thereof or any responsibility or liability with respect to
such custody.  Upon giving proper instructions to the Custodian,
Subadviser shall have no responsibility or liability
with respect to custodial arrangements or the acts, omissions or
other conduct of the Custodian.
       11.	The Subadviser and its directors, officers,

for any other act or omission in the performance by
the Subadviser of its duties under this Agreement except that
nothing herein contained shall be construed to protect
the Subadviser against any liability by reason of the
Subadviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence
in the performance of its duties or by reckless disregard of its
obligations or duties under this Agreement.
       12.	Each party shall indemnify and hold harmless the
other party and its respective control persons (as
described in Section 15 of the 1933 Act) and their respective

defending any alleged loss, claim, damages or liabilities) to
which any of the Indemnitees may become subject under the 1933
Act, the 1940 Act, or the Advisers Act, or under
any other statute, at common law or otherwise, arising out of or
based on (i) any willful misfeasance, bad faith, or
gross negligence of the other party in the performance of, or
reckless disregard of, any of its duties or obligations

affected thereby.  Except to the extent governed by federal
law including the 1940 Act, this Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Delaware, without applying the principles of conflicts
of law thereunder.
       14.	No provision of this Agreement may be changed,
discharged or terminated orally, but only by an
instrument in writing signed by the party against which
enforcement of the change, discharge or termination is
sought.  No amendment of this Agreement shall be effective with
respect to the Trust until approved as required by
applicable law.

SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
BETWEEN ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC
AND GUARDIAN CAPITAL LP
       SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (the Agreement) made
this 30th day of May, 2014 by
and between ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC (hereinafter referred to
as the Investment Adviser) and
GUARDIAN CAPITAL LP (hereinafter referred to as the
Subadviser), which Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which together shall constitute
but one instrument.
W I T N E S S E T H:
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser has been retained by
Aston Funds, a Delaware statutory trust (the
Trust), a registered management investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the 1940 Act), to provide investment advisory services to the
Trust with respect to certain series of the Trust set
forth in Schedule A hereto as may be amended from time to time
(hereinafter referred to as a Fund and,
collectively, the Funds of the Trust);
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser wishes to enter into a
contract with the Subadviser to provide
research, analysis, advice and recommendations with respect to
the purchase and sale of securities, and make
investment commitments with respect to such portion of the
Funds' assets as shall be allocated to the Subadviser by
the Investment Adviser from time to time (the Allocated"
"7135","Assets), subject to oversight by the Trustees of the Trust
and the supervision of the Investment Adviser.
       NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein contained, and intending to be
bound, the parties agree as follows:
       1.	In accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement
between the Trust and the Investment
Adviser (Investment Advisory Agreement) with respect to the
Funds, the Investment Adviser hereby appoints the
Subadviser to act as subadviser with respect to the Allocated
Assets for the period and on the terms set forth in this
Agreement. The Subadviser accepts such appointment and agrees to
render the services set forth herein, for the
compensation provided herein.
       2.	As compensation for the services enumerated herein,
the Investment Adviser will pay the
Subadviser a fee with respect to the Allocated Assets, which
shall be calculated and payable monthly in arrears
based on the average daily net assets of the Fund, in an amount
equal to 50% of the positive difference, if any, of (x)
the advisory fee payable to the Investment Adviser with respect
to the Allocated Assets of the Fund (before
reduction of the fee payable to Subadviser) minus (y) the sum
of: (i) any investment advisory fees waived by the
Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense limitation or
reimbursement agreement with the Fund, (ii) any
reimbursement of expenses by the Investment Adviser pursuant to
an expense limitation or reimbursement
agreement with the Fund, and (iii) any payments made by the
Investment Adviser to third parties that provide
distribution, shareholder services or similar services on behalf
of the Fund.  If the foregoing calculation results in a
negative amount, such amount shall be payable by the Subadviser
within 30 days of receipt of notice from the
Investment Adviser, which notice shall include the basis for the
calculation.
       For the purposes of this Agreement, a Fund's net assets
shall be determined as provided in the Fund's
then-current Prospectus (as used herein, this term includes the
related Statement of Additional Information).
       If this Agreement shall become effective subsequent to
the first day of a month, or shall terminate before
the last day of a month, the Subadviser's compensation for such
fraction of the month shall be prorated based on the
number of calendar days of such month during which the Agreement
is effective.
       3.	This Agreement shall become effective with respect to
a Fund as of the date set forth opposite the
Fund's name as set forth on Schedule A hereto (the Effective"
"7136","Date), provided that it has been approved by the
Trustees of the Trust in accordance with the provisions of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder and, if so required
by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, by the shareholders of
the Fund in accordance with the requirements of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
       4.	This Agreement shall continue in effect for the
initial term set forth in Schedule A.  It shall be
renewed automatically thereafter with respect to a Fund by the
Investment Adviser and the Subadviser for
successive periods not exceeding one year, if and only if such
renewal and continuance is specifically approved at
least annually by the Board of Trustees of the Trust or by a
vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities
of the Fund as prescribed by the 1940 Act and provided further
that such continuance is approved at least annually
thereafter by a vote of a majority of the Trust's Trustees, who
are not parties to such Agreement or interested
persons of such a party, cast in person at a meeting called for
the purpose of voting on such approval.  This
Agreement will terminate with respect to a Fund without the
payment of any penalty upon termination of the
Investment Advisory Agreement relating to the Fund by either
party thereto (accompanied by simultaneous notice to
the Subadviser) or upon sixty days' written notice to the
Subadviser that the Trustees of the Trust, the Investment
Adviser or the shareholders by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund, as provided by the
1940 Act, have terminated this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated upon
less than sixty days' notice to the Subadviser upon a material
breach of this Agreement or if the Trustees determine
that other circumstances have, or likely will have, a material
adverse effect on the Subadviser's abilities to perform
its obligations hereunder, including without limitation,
notification of the departure of a portfolio manager of the
Fund or other key personnel change.  This Agreement may also be
terminated by the Subadviser with respect to a
Fund without penalty upon sixty days' written notice to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust.
       This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect
to a Fund in the event of its assignment or, upon
notice thereof to the Subadviser, the assignment of the
Investment Advisory Agreement, unless its continuation
thereafter is approved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust and
the shareholders of the Fund if so required by the
1940 Act (in each case as the term assignment is defined in
Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, subject to such
exemptions as may be granted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) by any rule, regulation, order
or interpretive guidance).
       5.	Subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the Investment Adviser, the
Subadviser will provide an investment program for the Allocated
Assets, including investment research and
management with respect to securities and investments, including
cash and cash equivalents, and will determine
from time to time what securities and other investments will be
purchased, retained or sold.  The Subadviser will
provide the services under this Agreement in accordance with
each Fund's investment objective, policies and
restrictions as stated in the Prospectus, as provided to the
Subadviser by the Investment Adviser.  The Subadviser
further agrees that, in all matters relating to the performance
of this Agreement, it:
              (a)	shall act in conformity with the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and currently
effective registration statements under the 1940 Act and the
Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act) and any
amendments or supplements thereto (the Registration"
"7137","Statements) and with the written policies, procedures and
guidelines of each Fund, and written instructions and directions
of the Trustees of the Trust and shall comply with
the requirements of the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940 (the Advisers Act) and the rules
thereunder, and all other applicable federal and state laws and
regulations.  The Trust agrees to provide Subadviser
with copies of the Trust's Declaration of Trust, By-Laws,
Registration Statements, written policies, procedures and
guidelines, and written instructions and directions of the
Trustees, and any amendments or supplements to any of
them at, or, if practicable, before the time such materials,
instructions or directives become effective;
              (b)	will maintain at all times during the term
of this Agreement, in full force and effect,
insurance, including without limitation errors and omissions
insurance, with reputable insurance carriers, in such
amounts, covering such risks and liabilities, and with such
deductibles and self-insurance as are consistent with
customary industry practice;
              (c)	will pay expenses incurred by it in
connection with its activities under this Agreement
other than the cost of securities and other investments
(including brokerage commissions and other transaction
changes, if any) purchased for each Fund, provided that the
Subadviser will not pay for or provide a credit with
respect to any research provided to it in accordance with
Section 5(d);
              (d)	will place orders pursuant to its investment
determinations for the Allocated Assets either
directly with any broker or dealer, or with the issuer.  In
placing orders with brokers or dealers, the Subadviser will
attempt to obtain the best overall price and the most favorable
execution of its orders.  Subject to policies established
by the Trustees of the Trust and communicated to the Subadviser,
it is understood that the Subadviser will not be
deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to have breached a fiduciary
duty to the Trust or in respect of a Fund, or be in
breach of any obligation owing to the Investment Adviser or the
Trust or in respect of a Fund under this Agreement,
or otherwise, solely by reason of its having caused the Fund to
pay a member of a securities exchange, a broker or a
dealer a commission for effecting a securities transaction for
the Fund in excess of the amount of commission
another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have
charged if the Subadviser determines in good faith that
the commission paid was reasonable in relation to the brokerage
or research services (as those terms are defined in
Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
interpretive guidance issued by the SEC thereunder)
provided by such member, broker or dealer, viewed in terms of
that particular transaction or the Subadviser's overall
responsibilities with respect to the accounts, including the
Fund, as to which it exercises investment discretion;
              (e)	will review the daily valuation of
securities comprising the Allocated Assets of each
Fund as obtained on a daily basis by the Fund's administrator
and furnished by it to Subadviser, and will promptly
notify the Trust and the Investment Adviser if the Subadviser
believes that any such valuations may not properly
reflect the market value of any securities owned by the Fund,
provided, however, that the Subadviser is not required
by this subparagraph to obtain valuations of any such securities
from brokers or dealers or otherwise, or to otherwise
independently verify valuations of any such securities;
              (f)	unless otherwise instructed, will be
responsible for voting all proxies of the Allocated
Assets in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Guidelines of Subadviser (the Proxy Policy), provided
that such Proxy Policy and any amendments thereto are furnished
to the Trust;
              (g)	will attend regular business and investment-
related meetings with the Trust's Board of
Trustees and the Investment Adviser if requested to do so by the
Trust and/or the Investment Adviser, and at its
expense, shall supply the Board, the officers of the Trust, and
the Investment Adviser with all information and
reports reasonably required by them and reasonably available to
the Subadviser relating to the services provided by
the Subadviser hereunder;
              (h)	will maintain books and records with respect
to the securities transactions for the
Allocated Assets of each Fund and proxy voting record for the
Allocated Assets of the Fund, furnish to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust's Board of Trustees such
periodic and special reports as they may reasonably
request with respect to the Fund, and provide in advance to the
Investment Adviser all of the Subadviser's reports to
the Trust's Board of Trustees for examination and review within
a reasonable time prior to the Trust's Board
meetings; and
              (i)	will pay expenses incurred by the Trust for
any matters related to any transaction or event
that is deemed to result in a change of control of the
Subadviser or otherwise result in the assignment of the Sub-
Investment Advisory Agreement under the 1940 Act.
       6.	The Investment Adviser or its affiliates may, from
time to time, engage other subadvisers to advise
other series of the Trust (or portions thereof) or other
registered investment companies (or series or portions thereof)
that may be deemed to be under common control (each a Sub-"
"7138","Advised Fund).  The Subadviser agrees that it will
not consult with any other  subadviser engaged by the Investment
Adviser or its affiliates with respect to
transactions in securities or other assets concerning a Fund or
another Sub-Advised Fund, except to the extent
permitted by the rules under the 1940 Act that permit certain
transactions with a subadviser or its affiliates.
       7.	Subadviser agrees with respect to the services
provided to each Fund that:
              (a)	it will promptly communicate to the
Investment Adviser such information relating to
Fund transactions as the officers and Trustees of the Trust may
reasonably request and as communicated to the
Subadviser;
              (b)	it will treat confidentially and as
proprietary information of the Trust all records and other
information relative to each Fund and its prior, present or
potential shareholders (Confidential Information), will
comply at all times with all applicable laws and regulations
relating to the confidentiality of nonpublic personal"
"7139","information including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or other
federal or state privacy laws and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, and will not use such Confidential
Information for any purpose other than the performance
of its responsibilities and duties hereunder (except after prior
notification to and approval in writing by the Trust,
which approval may not be withheld where Subadviser is advised
by counsel that the Subadviser may be exposed to
civil or criminal contempt or other proceedings for failure to
comply, when requested to divulge such information by
duly constituted authorities, or when so requested by the
Trust); and
              (c)	during the term of this Agreement and for a
period of eighteen (18) months following the
termination of this Agreement, Subadviser (and its directors,
officers, stockholders, employees, and agents) will not,
directly or indirectly, solicit or induce any of the Fund's
shareholders to be withdrawn from investment in any series
of the Trust.
       8.	Each party represents and warrants to the other party
that the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement is within its powers and have been duly
authorized by all necessary actions of its directors or
members, and no action by, or in respect of, or filing with, any
governmental body, agency or official is required on
the part of either party for execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement, and the execution, delivery and
performance by either party of this Agreement do not contravene
or constitute a violation of, or a material default
under, (i) any provision of applicable law, rule or regulation,
(ii) such party's governing instruments, or (iii) any
agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other
instrument binding upon such party.
       9.	In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, Subadviser acknowledges
that all records which it maintains for the Trust are the
property of the Trust and agrees to surrender promptly to the
Trust any of such records upon the Trust's request, provided
that Subadviser may retain copies thereof at its own
expense.  Subadviser further agrees to preserve for the periods
prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the
records required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940
Act relating to transactions placed by Subadviser
for the Fund.  Subadviser further agrees to maintain each Fund's
proxy voting record with respect to the Allocated
Assets in a form mutually agreeable between the parties and
which contains the information required by Form N-PX
under the 1940 Act.
       10.	It is expressly understood and agreed that the
services to be rendered by the Subadviser to the
Investment Adviser under the provisions of this Agreement are
not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser
shall be free to provide similar or different services to others
so long as its ability to provide the services provided
for in this Agreement shall not be materially impaired thereby.
In addition, but without limiting any separate
agreement between the Subadviser and the Investment Adviser to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit
or restrict the right of any director, officer, or employee of
the Subadviser who may also be a Trustee, officer, or
employee of the Trust, to engage in any other business or to
devote his or her time and attention in part to the
management or other aspects of any other business, whether of a
similar nature or a dissimilar nature.
       11.	The Investment Adviser agrees that it will
furnish currently to the Subadviser all information with
reference to each Fund and the Trust that is reasonably
necessary to permit the Subadviser to carry out its
responsibilities under this Agreement, and the parties agree
that they will from time to time consult and make
appropriate arrangements as to specific information that is
required under this paragraph and the frequency and
manner with which it shall be supplied.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Investment Adviser will

and/or securities or other investments due to or from the

with respect to custodial arrangements or the acts, omissions or

Subadviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence
in the performance of its duties or by reckless disregard of its
obligations or duties under this Agreement.
       13.	Each party shall indemnify and hold harmless the

SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
BETWEEN ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC
AND HARRISON STREET SECURITIES, LLC
       SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (the Agreement) made
this 30th day of May, 2014 by
and between ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC (hereinafter referred to
as the Investment Adviser) and
HARRISON STREET SECURITIES, LLC (hereinafter referred to as the
Subadviser), which Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to be an original, but all of which together
shall constitute but one instrument.
W I T N E S S E T H:
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser has been retained by
Aston Funds, a Delaware statutory trust (the
Trust), a registered management investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the 1940 Act), to provide investment advisory services to the
Trust with respect to certain series of the Trust set
forth in Schedule A hereto as may be amended from time to time
(hereinafter referred to as a Fund and,
collectively, the Funds of the Trust);
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser wishes to enter into a
contract with the Subadviser to provide
research, analysis, advice and recommendations with respect to
the purchase and sale of securities, and make
investment commitments with respect to such portion of the
Funds' assets as shall be allocated to the Subadviser by
the Investment Adviser from time to time (the Allocated"
"7140","Assets), subject to oversight by the Trustees of the Trust
and the supervision of the Investment Adviser.
       NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein contained, and intending to be
bound, the parties agree as follows:
       1.	In accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement
between the Trust and the Investment
Adviser (Investment Advisory Agreement) with respect to the
Funds, the Investment Adviser hereby appoints the
Subadviser to act as subadviser with respect to the Allocated
Assets for the period and on the terms set forth in this
Agreement. The Subadviser accepts such appointment and agrees to
render the services set forth herein, for the
compensation provided herein.
       2.	As compensation for the services enumerated herein,
the Investment Adviser will pay the
Subadviser a fee with respect to the Allocated Assets, which
shall be calculated and payable monthly in arrears
based on the average daily net assets of the Fund, in an amount
equal to 50% of the positive difference, if any, of (x)
the advisory fee payable to the Investment Adviser with respect
to the Allocated Assets of the Fund (before
reduction of the fee payable to Subadviser) minus (y) the sum
of: (i) any investment advisory fees waived by the
Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense limitation or
reimbursement agreement with the Fund, (ii) any
reimbursement of expenses by the Investment Adviser pursuant to
an expense limitation or reimbursement
agreement with the Fund, and (iii) any payments made by the
Investment Adviser to third parties that provide
distribution, shareholder services or similar services on behalf
of the Fund.  If the foregoing calculation results in a
negative amount, such amount shall be payable by the Subadviser
within 30 days of receipt of notice from the
Investment Adviser, which notice shall include the basis for the
calculation.
       For the purposes of this Agreement, a Fund's net assets
shall be determined as provided in the Fund's
then-current Prospectus (as used herein, this term includes the
related Statement of Additional Information).
       If this Agreement shall become effective subsequent to
the first day of a month, or shall terminate before
the last day of a month, the Subadviser's compensation for such
fraction of the month shall be prorated based on the
number of calendar days of such month during which the Agreement
is effective.
       3.	This Agreement shall become effective with respect to
a Fund as of the date set forth opposite the
Fund's name as set forth on Schedule A hereto (the Effective"
"7141","Date), provided that it has been approved by the
Trustees of the Trust in accordance with the provisions of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder and, if so required
by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, by the shareholders of
the Fund in accordance with the requirements of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
       4.	This Agreement shall continue in effect for the
initial term set forth in Schedule A.  It shall be
renewed automatically thereafter with respect to a Fund by the
Investment Adviser and the Subadviser for
successive periods not exceeding one year, if and only if such
renewal and continuance is specifically approved at
least annually by the Board of Trustees of the Trust or by a
vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities
of the Fund as prescribed by the 1940 Act and provided further
that such continuance is approved at least annually
thereafter by a vote of a majority of the Trust's Trustees, who
are not parties to such Agreement or interested
persons of such a party, cast in person at a meeting called for
the purpose of voting on such approval.  This
Agreement will terminate with respect to a Fund without the
payment of any penalty upon termination of the
Investment Advisory Agreement relating to the Fund by either
party thereto (accompanied by simultaneous notice to
the Subadviser) or upon sixty days' written notice to the
Subadviser that the Trustees of the Trust, the Investment
Adviser or the shareholders by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund, as provided by the
1940 Act, have terminated this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated upon
less than sixty days' notice to the Subadviser upon a material
breach of this Agreement or if the Trustees determine
that other circumstances have, or likely will have, a material
adverse effect on the Subadviser's abilities to perform
its obligations hereunder, including without limitation,
notification of the departure of a portfolio manager of the
Fund or other key personnel change.  This Agreement may also be
terminated by the Subadviser with respect to a
Fund without penalty upon sixty days' written notice to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust.
       This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect
to a Fund in the event of its assignment or, upon
notice thereof to the Subadviser, the assignment of the
Investment Advisory Agreement, unless its continuation
thereafter is approved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust and
the shareholders of the Fund if so required by the
1940 Act (in each case as the term assignment is defined in
Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, subject to such
exemptions as may be granted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) by any rule, regulation, order
or interpretive guidance).
       5.	Subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the Investment Adviser, the
Subadviser will provide an investment program for the Allocated
Assets, including investment research and
management with respect to securities and investments, including
cash and cash equivalents, and will determine
from time to time what securities and other investments will be
purchased, retained or sold.  The Subadviser will
provide the services under this Agreement in accordance with
each Fund's investment objective, policies and
restrictions as stated in the Prospectus, as provided to the
Subadviser by the Investment Adviser.  The Subadviser
further agrees that, in all matters relating to the performance
of this Agreement, it:
              (a)	shall act in conformity with the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and currently
effective registration statements under the 1940 Act and the
Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act) and any
amendments or supplements thereto (the Registration"
"7142","Statements) and with the written policies, procedures and
guidelines of each Fund, and written instructions and directions
of the Trustees of the Trust and shall comply with
the requirements of the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940 (the Advisers Act) and the rules
thereunder, and all other applicable federal and state laws and
regulations.  The Trust agrees to provide Subadviser
with copies of the Trust's Declaration of Trust, By-Laws,
Registration Statements, written policies, procedures and
guidelines, and written instructions and directions of the
Trustees, and any amendments or supplements to any of
them at, or, if practicable, before the time such materials,
instructions or directives become effective;
              (b)	will maintain at all times during the term
of this Agreement, in full force and effect,
insurance, including without limitation errors and omissions
insurance, with reputable insurance carriers, in such
amounts, covering  such risks and liabilities, and with such
deductibles and self-insurance as are consistent with
customary industry practice;
              (c)	will pay expenses incurred by it in
connection with its activities under this Agreement
other than the cost of securities and other investments
(including brokerage commissions and other transaction
changes, if any) purchased for each Fund, provided that the
Subadviser will not pay for or provide a credit with
respect to any research provided to it in accordance with
Section 5(d);
              (d)	will place orders pursuant to its investment
determinations for the Allocated Assets either
directly with any broker or dealer, or with the issuer.  In
placing orders with brokers or dealers, the Subadviser will
attempt to obtain the best overall price and the most favorable
execution of its orders.  Subject to policies established
by the Trustees of the Trust and communicated to the Subadviser,
it is understood that the Subadviser will not be
deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to have breached a fiduciary
duty to the Trust or in respect of a Fund, or be in
breach of any obligation owing to the Investment Adviser or the
Trust or in respect of a Fund under this Agreement,
or otherwise, solely by reason of its having caused the Fund to
pay a member of a securities exchange, a broker or a
dealer a commission for effecting a securities transaction for
the Fund in excess of the amount of commission
another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have
charged if the Subadviser determines in good faith that
the commission paid was reasonable in relation to the brokerage
or research services (as those terms are defined in
Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
interpretive guidance issued by the SEC thereunder)
provided by such member, broker or dealer, viewed in terms of
that particular transaction or the Subadviser's overall
responsibilities with respect to the accounts, including the
Fund, as to which it exercises investment discretion;
              (e)	will review the daily valuation of
securities comprising the Allocated Assets of each
Fund as obtained on a daily basis by the Fund's administrator
and furnished by it to Subadviser, and will promptly
notify the Trust and the Investment Adviser if the Subadviser
believes that any such valuations may not properly
reflect the market value of any securities owned by the Fund,
provided, however, that the Subadviser is not required
by this subparagraph to obtain valuations of any such securities
from brokers or dealers or otherwise, or to otherwise
independently verify valuations of any such securities;
              (f)	unless otherwise instructed, will be
responsible for voting all proxies of the Allocated
Assets in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Guidelines of Subadviser (the Proxy Policy), provided
that such Proxy Policy and any amendments thereto are furnished
to the Trust;
              (g)	will attend regular business and investment-
related meetings with the Trust's Board of
Trustees and the Investment Adviser if requested to do so by the
Trust and/or the Investment Adviser, and at its
expense, shall supply the Board, the officers of the Trust, and
the Investment Adviser with all information and
reports reasonably required by them and reasonably available to
the Subadviser relating to the services provided by
the Subadviser hereunder;
              (h)	will maintain books and records with respect
to the securities transactions for the
Allocated Assets of each Fund and proxy voting record for the
Allocated Assets of the Fund, furnish to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust's Board of Trustees such
periodic and special reports as they may request with
respect to the Fund, and provide in advance to the Investment
Adviser all of the Subadviser's reports to the Trust's
Board of Trustees for examination and review within a reasonable
time prior to the Trust's Board meetings; and
              (i)	will pay expenses incurred by the Trust for
any matters related to any transaction or event
that is deemed to result in a change of control of the
Subadviser or otherwise result in the assignment of the Sub-
Investment Advisory Agreement under the 1940 Act.
       6.	The Investment Adviser or its affiliates may, from
time to time, engage other subadvisers to advise
other series of the Trust (or portions thereof) or other
registered investment companies (or series or portions thereof)
that may be deemed to be under common control (each a Sub-"
"7143","Advised Fund).  The Subadviser agrees that it will
not consult with any other  subadviser engaged by the Investment
Adviser or its affiliates with respect to
transactions in securities or other assets concerning a Fund or
another Sub-Advised Fund, except to the extent
permitted by the rules under the 1940 Act that permit certain
transactions with a subadviser or its affiliates.
       7.	Subadviser agrees with respect to the services
provided to each Fund that:
              (a)	it will promptly communicate to the
Investment Adviser such information relating to
Fund transactions as the officers and Trustees of the Trust may
reasonably request and as communicated to the
Subadviser;
              (b)	it will treat confidentially and as
proprietary information of the Trust all records and other
information relative to each Fund and its prior, present or
potential shareholders (Confidential Information), will
comply at all times with all applicable laws and regulations
relating to the confidentiality of nonpublic personal"
"7144","information including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or other
federal or state privacy laws and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, and will not use such Confidential
Information for any purpose other than the performance
of its responsibilities and duties hereunder (except after prior
notification to and approval in writing by the Trust,
which approval may not be withheld where Subadviser is advised
by counsel that the Subadviser may be exposed to
civil or criminal contempt or other proceedings for failure to
comply, when requested to divulge such information by
duly constituted authorities, or when so requested by the
Trust); and
              (c)	during the term of this Agreement and for a
period of eighteen (18) months following the
termination of this Agreement, Subadviser (and its directors,
officers, stockholders, employees, and agents) will not,
directly or indirectly, solicit or induce any of the Fund's
shareholders to be withdrawn from investment in any series
of the Trust.
       8.	Each party represents and warrants to the other party
that the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement is within its powers and have been duly
authorized by all necessary actions of its directors or
members, and no action by, or in respect of, or filing with, any
governmental body, agency or official is required on
the part of either party for execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement, and the execution, delivery and
performance by either party of this Agreement do not contravene
or constitute a violation of, or a material default
under, (i) any provision of applicable law, rule or regulation,
(ii) such party's governing instruments, or (iii) any
agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other
instrument binding upon such party.
       9.	In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, Subadviser acknowledges
that all records which it maintains for the Trust are the
property of the Trust and agrees to surrender promptly to the
Trust any of such records upon the Trust's request, provided
that Subadviser may retain copies thereof at its own
expense.  Subadviser further agrees to preserve for the periods
prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the
records required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940
Act relating to transactions placed by Subadviser
for the Fund.  Subadviser further agrees to maintain each Fund's
proxy voting record with respect to the Allocated
Assets in a form mutually agreeable between the parties and
which contains the information required by Form N-PX
under the 1940 Act.
       10.	It is expressly understood and agreed that the
services to be rendered by the Subadviser to the
Investment Adviser under the provisions of this Agreement are
not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser
shall be free to provide similar or different services to others
so long as its ability to provide the services provided
for in this Agreement shall not be materially impaired thereby.
In addition, but without limiting any separate
agreement between the Subadviser and the Investment Adviser to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit
or restrict the right of any director, officer, or employee of
the Subadviser who may also be a Trustee, officer, or
employee of the Trust, to engage in any other business or to
devote his or her time and attention in part to the
management or other aspects of any other business, whether of a
similar nature or a dissimilar nature.
       11.	The Investment Adviser agrees that it will
furnish currently to the Subadviser all information with
reference to each Fund and the Trust that is reasonably
necessary to permit the Subadviser to carry out its
responsibilities under this Agreement, and the parties agree
that they will from time to time consult and make
appropriate arrangements as to specific information that is
required under this paragraph and the frequency and
manner with which it shall be supplied.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Investment Adviser will
furnish to Subadviser procedures consistent with the Trust's
contract with each Fund's custodian from time to time
(the Custodian), and reasonably satisfactory to Subadviser,
for consummation of portfolio transactions for each
Fund by payment to or delivery by the Custodian of all cash
and/or securities or other investments due to or from the
Fund, and Subadviser shall not have possession or custody
thereof or any responsibility or liability with respect to
such custody.  Upon giving proper instructions to the Custodian,
Subadviser shall have no responsibility or liability
with respect to custodial arrangements or the acts, omissions or
other conduct of the Custodian.
       12.	The Subadviser and its directors, officers,
stockholders, employees and agents shall not be liable
for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss
suffered by the Investment Adviser or the Trust in
connection with any matters to which this Agreement relates or
for any other act or omission in the performance by
the Subadviser of its duties under this Agreement except that
nothing herein contained shall be construed to protect
the Subadviser against any liability by reason of the
Subadviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence
in the performance of its duties or by reckless disregard of its
obligations or duties under this Agreement.
       13.	Each party shall indemnify and hold harmless the
other party and its respective control persons (as
described in Section 15 of the 1933 Act) and their respective
directors, stockholders, members and employees
(collectively, Indemnitees) against any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (including
reasonable legal and other expenses of investigating or
defending any alleged loss, claim, damages or liabilities) to
which any of the Indemnitees may become subject under the 1933
Act, the 1940 Act, or the Advisers Act, or under
any other statute, at common law or otherwise, arising out of or
based on (i) any willful misfeasance, bad faith, or
gross negligence of the other party in the performance of, or
reckless disregard of, any of its duties or obligations
hereunder, or (ii) any material breach of this Agreement by the
other party.
       14.	If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
or made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule
or otherwise, the remainder of the Agreement shall not be
affected thereby.  Except to the extent governed by federal
law including the 1940 Act, this Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Delaware, without applying the principles of conflicts
of law thereunder.
       15.	No provision of this Agreement may be changed,
discharged or terminated orally, but only by an
instrument in writing signed by the party against which
enforcement of the change, discharge or termination is
sought.  No amendment of this Agreement shall be effective with
respect to the Trust until approved as required by
applicable law.
       16.	Any notice to be given hereunder may be given by
personal notification or by facsimile

(the 1940 Act) to provide investment advisory services to the
Trust with respect to certain series of the Trust set
forth in Schedule A hereto as may be amended from time to time
(hereinafter referred to as a Fund and
collectively, the Funds of the Trust);
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser wishes to enter into a
contract with the Subadviser to provide
research, analysis, advice and recommendations with respect to
the purchase and sale of securities, and manage with
full discretion the investment commitments with respect to such
portion of the Funds' assets as shall be allocated to
the Subadviser by the Investment Adviser from time to time (the
Allocated Assets), subject to oversight by the
Trustees of the Trust and the supervision of the Investment
Adviser.
       NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein contained, and intending to be
bound, the parties agree as follows:
       1.	In accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement
between the Trust and the Investment
Adviser (Investment Advisory Agreement) with respect to the
Funds, the Investment Adviser hereby appoints the
Subadviser to act as subadviser with respect to the Allocated
Assets for the period and on the terms set forth in this
Agreement. The Subadviser accepts such appointment and agrees to
render the services set forth herein, for the
compensation provided herein.
       2.	As compensation for the services enumerated herein,
the Investment Adviser will pay the
Subadviser a fee with respect to the Allocated Assets, which
shall be calculated and payable monthly in arrears
based on the average daily net assets of the Fund, in an amount
equal to 50% of the positive difference, if any, of (x)
the advisory fee payable to the Investment Adviser with respect
to the Allocated Assets of the Fund (before
reduction of the fee payable to Subadviser) minus (y) the sum
of: (i) any investment advisory fees waived by the
Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense limitation or
reimbursement agreement with the Fund, (ii) any
reimbursement of expenses by the Investment Adviser pursuant to
an expense limitation or reimbursement
agreement with the Fund, and (iii) any payments made by the
Investment Adviser to third parties that provide
distribution, shareholder services or similar services on behalf
of the Fund.  If the foregoing calculation results in a
negative amount, such amount shall be payable by the Subadviser
within 30 days of receipt of notice from the
Investment Adviser, which notice shall include the basis for the
calculation.
       For the purposes of this Agreement, a Fund's net assets
shall be determined as provided in the Fund's
then-current Prospectus (as used herein this term includes the
related Statement of Additional Information).
       If this Agreement shall become effective subsequent to
the first day of a month, or shall terminate before
the last day of a month, the Subadviser's compensation for such
fraction of the month shall be prorated based on the
number of calendar days of such month during which the Agreement
is effective.
       3.	This Agreement shall become effective with respect to
a Fund as of the date set forth opposite the
Fund's name as set forth on Schedule A hereto (the Effective"
"7145","Date), provided that it has been approved by the
Trustees of the Trust in accordance with the provisions of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder and, if so required
by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, by the shareholders of
the Fund in accordance with the requirements of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
       4.	This Agreement shall continue in effect for the
initial term set forth in Schedule A.  It shall be
renewed automatically thereafter with respect to a Fund by the
Investment Adviser and the Subadviser for
successive periods not exceeding one year, if and only if such
renewal and continuance is specifically approved at
least annually by the Board of Trustees of the Trust or by a
vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities
of the Fund as prescribed by the 1940 Act and provided further
that such continuance is approved at least annually
thereafter by a vote of a majority of the Trust's Trustees, who
are not parties to such Agreement or interested
persons of such a party, cast in person at a meeting called for
the purpose of voting on such approval.  This
Agreement will terminate with respect to a Fund without the
payment of any penalty upon termination of the
Investment Advisory Agreement relating to a Fund by either party
thereto (accompanied by simultaneous notice to
the Subadviser) or upon sixty days' written notice to the
Subadviser that the Trustees of the Trust, the Investment
Adviser or the shareholders by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund, as provided by the
1940 Act, have terminated this Agreement.  This Agreement may
also be terminated by the Subadviser with respect
to a Fund without penalty upon sixty days' written notice to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust.
       This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect
to a Fund in the event of its assignment or, upon
notice thereof to the Subadviser, the assignment of the
Investment Advisory Agreement, unless its continuation
thereafter is approved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust and
the shareholders of the Fund if so required by the
1940 Act (in each case as the term assignment is defined in
Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, subject to such
exemptions as may be granted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) by any rule, regulation, order
or interpretive guidance).
       5.	Subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the Investment Adviser, the
Subadviser will provide an investment program for the Allocated
Assets, including investment research and
discretionary management with respect to securities and
investments, including cash and cash equivalents, and will
determine from time to time what securities and other
investments will be purchased, retained or sold.  The
Subadviser will provide the services under this Agreement in
accordance with each Fund's investment objective,
policies and restrictions as stated in the Prospectus, as
provided to the Subadviser by the Investment Adviser.  The
Subadviser further agrees that, in all matters relating to the
performance of this Agreement, it:
              (a)	shall act in conformity with the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and currently
effective registration statements under the 1940 Act and the
Securities Act of 1933 and any amendments or
supplements thereto (the Registration Statements) and with the
written policies, procedures and guidelines of each
Fund, and written instructions and directions of the Trustees of
the Trust and shall comply with the requirements of
the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the
rules thereunder, and all other applicable federal and
state laws and regulations.  The Trust agrees to provide
Subadviser with copies of the Trust's Declaration of Trust,
By-Laws, Registration Statements, written policies, procedures
and guidelines, and written instructions and
directions of the Trustees, and any amendments or supplements to
any of them at, or, if practicable, before the time
such materials, instructions or directives become effective;
              (b)	will pay expenses incurred by it in
connection with its activities under this Agreement
other than the cost of securities and other investments
(including brokerage commissions and other transaction
changes, if any) purchased for each Fund, provided that the
Subadviser will not pay for or provide a credit with
respect to any research provided to it in accordance with
Section 5(c);
              (c)	will place orders pursuant to its investment
determinations for the Allocated Assets either
directly with any broker or dealer, or with the issuer.  In
placing orders with brokers or dealers, the Subadviser will
attempt to obtain the best overall price and the most favorable
execution of its orders.  Subject to policies established
by the Trustees of the Trust and communicated to the Subadviser,
it is understood that the Subadviser will not be
deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to have breached a fiduciary
duty to the Trust or in respect of a Fund, or be in
breach of any obligation owing to the Investment Adviser or the
Trust or in respect of a Fund under this Agreement,
or otherwise, solely by reason of its having caused the Fund to
pay a member of a securities exchange, a broker or a
dealer a commission for effecting a securities transaction for
the Fund in excess of the amount of commission
another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have
charged if the Subadviser determines in good faith that
the commission paid was reasonable in relation to the brokerage
or research services (as those terms are defined in
Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
interpretive guidance issued by the SEC thereunder)
provided by such member, broker or dealer, viewed in terms of
that particular transaction or the Subadviser's overall
responsibilities with respect to the accounts, including the
Fund, as to which it exercises investment discretion;
              (d)	will review the daily valuation of
securities comprising the Allocated Assets of each
Fund as obtained on a daily basis by the Fund's administrator
and furnished by it to Subadviser, and will promptly
notify the Trust and the Investment Adviser if the Subadviser
believes that any such valuations may not properly
reflect the market value of any securities owned by the Fund,
provided, however, that the Subadviser is not required
by this sub-paragraph to obtain valuations of any such
securities from brokers or dealers or otherwise, or to
otherwise independently verify valuations of any such
securities;
              (e)	unless otherwise instructed, will be
responsible for voting all proxies of the Allocated
Assets in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Guidelines of Subadviser (the Proxy Policy), provided
that such Proxy Policy and any amendments thereto are furnished
to the Trust;
              (f)	will attend regular business and investment-
related meetings with the Trust's Board of
Trustees and the Investment Adviser if requested to do so by the
Trust and/or the Investment Adviser, and at its
expense, shall supply the Board, the officers of the Trust, and
the Investment Adviser with all information and
reports reasonably required by them and reasonably available to
the Subadviser relating to the services provided by
the Subadviser hereunder;
              (g)	will maintain books and records with respect
to the securities transactions for the
Allocated Assets of each Fund and proxy voting record for the
Allocated Assets of the Fund, furnish to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust's Board of Trustees such
periodic and special reports as they may request with
respect to the Fund, and provide in advance to the Investment
Adviser all of the Subadviser's reports to the Trust's
Board of Trustees for examination and review within a reasonable
time prior to the Trust's Board meetings; and
              (h)	will pay expenses incurred by the Trust for
any matters related to any transaction or event
that is deemed to result in change of control of the Subadviser
or otherwise result in the assignment of the Sub-
Investment Advisory Agreement under the 1940 Act.
       6.	The Investment Adviser or its affiliates may, from
time to time, engage other subadvisers to advise
other series of the Trust (or portions thereof) or other
registered investment companies (or series or portions thereof)
that may be deemed to be under common control (each a Sub-"
"7146","Advised Fund).  The Subadviser agrees that it will
not consult with any other  subadviser engaged by the Investment
Adviser or its affiliates with respect to
transactions in securities or other assets concerning a Fund or
another Sub-Advised Fund, except to the extent
permitted by the rules under the 1940 Act that permit certain
transactions with a subadviser or its affiliates.
       7.	Subadviser agrees with respect to the services
provided to each Fund that it:
              (a)	will promptly communicate to the Investment
Adviser such information relating to Fund
transactions as the officers and Trustees of the Trust may
reasonably request and as communicated to the
Subadviser; and
              (b)	will treat confidentially and as proprietary
information of the Trust all records and other
information relative to each Fund and its prior, present or
potential shareholders, and will not use such records and
information for any purpose other than performance of its
responsibilities and duties hereunder (except after prior
notification to and approval in writing by the Trust, which
approval may not be withheld where Subadviser is
advised by counsel that the Subadviser may be exposed to civil
or criminal contempt or other proceedings for failure
to comply, when requested to divulge such information by duly
constituted authorities, or when so requested by the
Trust).
       8.	In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, Subadviser acknowledges
that all records which it maintains for the Trust are the
property of the Trust and agrees to surrender promptly to the
Trust any of such records upon the Trust's request, provided,
that Subadviser may retain copies thereof at its own
expense.  Subadviser further agrees to preserve for the periods
prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the
records required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940
Act relating to transactions placed by Subadviser
for the Fund.  Subadviser further agrees to maintain each Fund's
proxy voting record with respect to the Allocated
Assets in a form mutually agreeable between the parties and
which contains the information required by Form N-PX
under the 1940 Act.
       9.	It is expressly understood and agreed that the
services to be rendered by the Subadviser to the
Investment Adviser under the provisions of this Agreement are
not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser
shall be free to provide similar or different services to others
so long as its ability to provide the services provided
for in this Agreement shall not be materially impaired thereby.
In addition, but without limiting any separate
agreement between the Subadviser and the Investment Adviser to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit
or restrict the right of any director, officer, or employee of
the Subadviser who may also be a Trustee, officer, or
employee of the Trust, to engage in any other business or to
devote his or her time and attention in part to the
management or other aspects of any other business, whether of a
similar nature or a dissimilar nature.
       10.	The Investment Adviser agrees that it will
furnish currently to the Subadviser all information with
reference to each Fund and the Trust that is reasonably
necessary to permit the Subadviser to carry out its
responsibilities under this Agreement, and the parties agree
that they will from time to time consult and make
appropriate arrangements as to specific information that is
required under this paragraph and the frequency and
manner with which it shall be supplied.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Investment Adviser will
furnish to Subadviser procedures consistent with the Trust's
contract with each Fund's custodian from time to time
(the Custodian), and reasonably satisfactory to Subadviser,
for consummation of portfolio transactions for each
Fund by payment to or delivery by the Custodian of all cash
and/or securities or other investments due to or from the
Fund, and Subadviser shall not have possession or custody
thereof or any responsibility or liability with respect to
such custody.  Upon giving proper instructions to the Custodian,
Subadviser shall have no responsibility or liability
with respect to custodial arrangements or the acts, omissions or
other conduct of the Custodian.
       11.	The Subadviser and its directors, officers,
stockholders, employees and agents shall not be liable
for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss
suffered by the Investment Adviser or the Trust in
connection with any matters to which this Agreement relates or
for any other act or omission in the performance by
the Subadviser of its duties under this Agreement except that
nothing herein contained shall be construed to protect
the Subadviser against any liability by reason of the
Subadviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence
in the performance of its duties or by reckless disregard of its
obligations or duties under this Agreement.
       12.	If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
or made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule
or otherwise, the remainder of the Agreement shall not be
affected thereby.  Except to the extent governed by federal
law including the 1940 Act, this Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Delaware, without applying the principles of conflicts
of law thereunder.
       13.	No provision of this Agreement may be changed,
discharged or terminated orally, but only by an
instrument in writing signed by the party against which
enforcement of the change, discharge or termination is
sought.  No amendment of this Agreement shall be effective with
respect to the Trust until approved as required by
applicable law.
       14.	Any notice to be given hereunder may be given by
personal notification or by facsimile
transmission, to the party specified at the address stated

SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
BETWEEN ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC
AND LEE MUNDER CAPITAL GROUP, LLC
       SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (the Agreement) made
this 30th day of May, 2014 by
and between ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC (hereinafter referred to
as the Investment Adviser) and LEE
MUNDER CAPITAL GROUP, LLC  (hereinafter referred to as the
Subadviser), which Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to be an original, but all of which together
shall constitute but one instrument.
W I T N E S S E T H:
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser has been retained by
Aston Funds, a Delaware statutory trust (the
Trust), a registered management investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the 1940 Act), to provide investment advisory services to the
Trust with respect to certain series of the Trust set
forth in Schedule A hereto as may be amended from time to time
(hereinafter referred to as a Fund and,
collectively, the Funds of the Trust);
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser wishes to enter into a
contract with the Subadviser to provide
research, analysis, advice and recommendations with respect to
the purchase and sale of securities, and make
investment commitments with respect to such portion of the
Funds' assets as shall be allocated to the Subadviser by
the Investment Adviser from time to time (the Allocated"
"7147","Assets), subject to oversight by the Trustees of the Trust
and the supervision of the Investment Adviser.
       NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein contained, and intending to be
bound, the parties agree as follows:
       1.	In accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement
between the Trust and the Investment
Adviser (Investment Advisory Agreement) with respect to the
Funds, the Investment Adviser hereby appoints the
Subadviser to act as subadviser with respect to the Allocated
Assets for the period and on the terms set forth in this
Agreement. The Subadviser accepts such appointment and agrees to
render the services set forth herein, for the
compensation provided herein.
       2.	As compensation for the services enumerated herein,
the Investment Adviser will pay the
Subadviser a fee with respect to the Allocated Assets, which
shall be calculated and payable monthly in arrears
based on the average daily net assets of the Fund, in an amount
equal to 50% of the positive difference, if any, of (x)
the advisory fee payable to the Investment Adviser with respect
to the Allocated Assets of the Fund (before
reduction of the fee payable to Subadviser) minus (y) the sum
of: (i) any investment advisory fees waived by the
Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense limitation or
reimbursement agreement with the Fund, (ii) any
reimbursement of expenses by the Investment Adviser pursuant to
an expense limitation or reimbursement
agreement with the Fund, and (iii) any payments made by the
Investment Adviser to third parties that provide
distribution, shareholder services or similar services on behalf
of the Fund.  If the foregoing calculation results in a
negative amount, such amount shall be payable by the Subadviser
within 30 days of receipt of notice from the
Investment Adviser, which notice shall include the basis for the
calculation.
       For the purposes of this Agreement, a Fund's net assets
shall be determined as provided in the Fund's
then-current Prospectus (as used herein, this term includes the
related Statement of Additional Information).
       If this Agreement shall become effective subsequent to
the first day of a month, or shall terminate before
the last day of a month, the Subadviser's compensation for such
fraction of the month shall be prorated based on the
number of calendar days of such month during which the Agreement
is effective.
       3.	This Agreement shall become effective with respect to
a Fund as of the date set forth opposite the
Fund's name as set forth on Schedule A hereto (the Effective"
"7148","Date), provided that it has been approved by the
Trustees of the Trust in accordance with the provisions of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder and, if so required
by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, by the shareholders of
the Fund in accordance with the requirements of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
       4.	This Agreement shall continue in effect for the
initial term set forth in Schedule A.  It shall be
renewed automatically thereafter with respect to a Fund by the
Investment Adviser and the Subadviser for
successive periods not exceeding one year, if and only if such
renewal and continuance is specifically approved at
least annually by the Board of Trustees of the Trust or by a
vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities
of the Fund as prescribed by the 1940 Act and provided further
that such continuance is approved at least annually
thereafter by a vote of a majority of the Trust's Trustees, who
are not parties to such Agreement or interested
persons of such a party, cast in person at a meeting called for
the purpose of voting on such approval.  This
Agreement will terminate with respect to a Fund without the
payment of any penalty upon termination of the
Investment Advisory Agreement relating to the Fund by either
party thereto (accompanied by simultaneous notice to
the Subadviser) or upon sixty days' written notice to the
Subadviser that the Trustees of the Trust, the Investment
Adviser or the shareholders by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund, as provided by the
1940 Act, have terminated this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated upon
less than sixty days' notice to the Subadviser upon a material
breach of this Agreement or if the Trustees determine
that other circumstances have, or likely will have, a material
adverse effect on the Subadviser's abilities to perform
its obligations hereunder, including without limitation,
notification of the departure of a portfolio manager of the
Fund or other key personnel change.  This Agreement may also be
terminated by the Subadviser with respect to a
Fund without penalty upon sixty days' written notice to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust.
       This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect
to a Fund in the event of its assignment or, upon
notice thereof to the Subadviser, the assignment of the
Investment Advisory Agreement, unless its continuation
thereafter is approved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust and
the shareholders of the Fund if so required by the
1940 Act (in each case as the term assignment is defined in
Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, subject to such
exemptions as may be granted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) by any rule, regulation, order
or interpretive guidance).
       5.	Subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the Investment Adviser, the
Subadviser will provide an investment program for the Allocated
Assets, including investment research and
management with respect to securities and investments, including
cash and cash equivalents, and will determine
from time to time what securities and other investments will be
purchased, retained or sold.  The Subadviser will
provide the services under this Agreement in accordance with
each Fund's investment objective, policies and
restrictions as stated in the Prospectus, as provided to the
Subadviser by the Investment Adviser.  The Subadviser
further agrees that, in all matters relating to the performance
of this Agreement, it:
              (a)	shall act in conformity with the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and currently
effective registration statements under the 1940 Act and the
Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act) and any
amendments or supplements thereto (the Registration"
"7149","Statements) and with the written policies, procedures and
guidelines of each Fund, and written instructions and directions
of the Trustees of the Trust and shall comply with
the requirements of the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940 (the Advisers Act) and the rules
thereunder, and all other applicable federal and state laws and
regulations.  The Trust agrees to provide Subadviser
with copies of the Trust's Declaration of Trust, By-Laws,
Registration Statements, written policies, procedures and
guidelines, and written instructions and directions of the
Trustees, and any amendments or supplements to any of
them at, or, if practicable, before the time such materials,
instructions or directives become effective;
              (b)	will maintain at all times during the term
of this Agreement, in full force and effect,
insurance, including without limitation errors and omissions
insurance, with reputable insurance carriers, in such
amounts, covering  such risks and liabilities, and with such
deductibles and self-insurance as are consistent with
customary industry practice;
              (c)	will pay expenses incurred by it in
connection with its activities under this Agreement
other than the cost of securities and other investments
(including brokerage commissions and other transaction
charges, if any) purchased for each Fund, provided that the
Subadviser will not pay for or provide a credit with
respect to any research provided to it in accordance with
Section 5(d);
              (d)	will place orders pursuant to its investment
determinations for the Allocated Assets either
directly with any broker or dealer, or with the issuer.  In
placing orders with brokers or dealers, the Subadviser will
attempt to obtain the best overall price and the most favorable
execution of its orders.  Subject to policies established
by the Trustees of the Trust and communicated to the Subadviser,
it is understood that the Subadviser will not be
deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to have breached a fiduciary
duty to the Trust or in respect of a Fund, or be in
breach of any obligation owing to the Investment Adviser or the
Trust or in respect of a Fund under this Agreement,
or otherwise, solely by reason of its having caused the Fund to
pay a member of a securities exchange, a broker or a
dealer a commission for effecting a securities transaction for
the Fund in excess of the amount of commission
another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have
charged if the Subadviser determines in good faith that
the commission paid was reasonable in relation to the brokerage
or research services (as those terms are defined in

securities comprising the Allocated Assets of each

provided, however, that the Subadviser is not required

from brokers or dealers or otherwise, or to otherwise

              (f)	unless otherwise instructed, will be

Trust for any matters related to any
transaction or event that is deemed to result in a change of
control of the Subadviser or otherwise result in the

       6.	The Investment Adviser or its affiliates may, from
time to time, engage other subadvisers to advise
other series of the Trust (or portions thereof) or other
registered investment companies (or series or portions thereof)
that may be deemed to be under common control (each a Sub-"
"7150","Advised Fund).  The Subadviser agrees that it will
not consult with any other  subadviser engaged by the Investment
Adviser or its affiliates with respect to
transactions in securities or other assets concerning a Fund or
another Sub-Advised Fund, except to the extent
permitted by the rules under the 1940 Act that permit certain
transactions with a subadviser or its affiliates.
       7.	Subadviser agrees with respect to the services
provided to each Fund that:
              (a)	it will promptly communicate to the
Investment Adviser such information relating to
Fund transactions as the officers and Trustees of the Trust may
reasonably request and as communicated to the
Subadviser;
              (b)	it will treat confidentially and as
proprietary information of the Trust all records and other
information relative to each Fund and its prior, present or
potential shareholders (Confidential Information), will
comply at all times with all applicable laws and regulations
relating to the confidentiality of nonpublic personal"
"7151","information including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or other
federal or state privacy laws and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, and will not use such Confidential
Information for any purpose other than the performance
of its responsibilities and duties hereunder (except after prior
notification to and approval in writing by the Trust,
which approval may not be withheld where Subadviser is advised
by counsel that the Subadviser may be exposed to
civil or criminal contempt or other proceedings for failure to
comply, when requested to divulge such information by
duly constituted authorities, or when so requested by the
Trust); and
              (c)	during the term of this Agreement and for a
period of eighteen (18) months following the
termination of this Agreement, Subadviser (and its directors,
officers, stockholders, employees, and agents) will not,
directly or indirectly, solicit or induce any of the Fund's
shareholders to be withdrawn from investment in any series
of the Trust.
       8.	Each party represents and warrants to the other party
that the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement is within its powers and have been duly
authorized by all necessary actions of its directors or
members, and no action by, or in respect of, or filing with, any
governmental body, agency or official is required on
the part of either party for execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement, and the execution, delivery and
performance by either party of this Agreement do not contravene
or constitute a violation of, or a material default
under, (i) any provision of applicable law, rule or regulation,
(ii) such party's governing instruments, or (iii) any
agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other
instrument binding upon such party.
       9.	In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, Subadviser acknowledges
that all records which it maintains for the Trust are the
property of the Trust and agrees to surrender promptly to the
Trust any of such records upon the Trust's request, provided
that Subadviser may retain copies thereof at its own
expense.  Subadviser further agrees to preserve for the periods
prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the
records required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940
Act relating to transactions placed by Subadviser
for the Fund.  Subadviser further agrees to maintain each Fund's
proxy voting record with respect to the Allocated
Assets in a form mutually agreeable between the parties and
which contains the information required by Form N-PX
under the 1940 Act.
       10.	It is expressly understood and agreed that the
services to be rendered by the Subadviser to the
Investment Adviser under the provisions of this Agreement are
not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser
shall be free to provide similar or different services to others
so long as its ability to provide the services provided
for in this Agreement shall not be materially impaired thereby.
In addition, but without limiting any separate
agreement between the Subadviser and the Investment Adviser to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit
or restrict the right of any director, officer, or employee of
the Subadviser who may also be a Trustee, officer, or
employee of the Trust, to engage in any other business or to
devote his or her time and attention in part to the
management or other aspects of any other business, whether of a
similar nature or a dissimilar nature.
       11.	The Investment Adviser agrees that it will
furnish currently to the Subadviser all information with
reference to each Fund and the Trust that is reasonably
necessary to permit the Subadviser to carry out its
responsibilities under this Agreement, and the parties agree
that they will from time to time consult and make
appropriate arrangements as to specific information that is
required under this paragraph and the frequency and
manner with which it shall be supplied.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Investment Adviser will
furnish to Subadviser procedures consistent with the Trust's
contract with each Fund's custodian from time to time
(the Custodian), and reasonably satisfactory to Subadviser,
for consummation of portfolio transactions for each
Fund by payment to or delivery by the Custodian of all cash
and/or securities or other investments due to or from the
Fund, and Subadviser shall not have possession or custody
thereof or any responsibility or liability with respect to
such custody.  Upon giving proper instructions to the Custodian,
Subadviser shall have no responsibility or liability
with respect to custodial arrangements or the acts, omissions or
other conduct of the Custodian.
       12.	The Subadviser and its directors, officers,
stockholders, employees and agents shall not be liable
for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss
suffered by the Investment Adviser or the Trust in
connection with any matters to which this Agreement relates or
for any other act or omission in the performance by
the Subadviser of its duties under this Agreement except that
nothing herein contained shall be construed to protect
the Subadviser against any liability by reason of the
Subadviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence
in the performance of its duties or by reckless disregard of its
obligations or duties under this Agreement.
       13.	Each party shall indemnify and hold harmless the
other party and its respective control persons (as
described in Section 15 of the 1933 Act) and their respective
directors, stockholders, members and employees
(collectively, Indemnitees) against any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (including
reasonable legal and other expenses of investigating or
defending any alleged loss, claim, damages or liabilities) to
which any of the Indemnitees may become subject under the 1933
Act, the 1940 Act, or the Advisers Act, or under
any other statute, at common law or otherwise, arising out of or
based on (i) any willful misfeasance, bad faith, or
gross negligence of the other party in the performance of, or
reckless disregard of, any of its duties or obligations
hereunder, or (ii) any material breach of this Agreement by the
other party.
       14.	If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
or made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule
or otherwise, the remainder of the Agreement shall not be
affected thereby.  Except to the extent governed by federal
law including the 1940 Act, this Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Delaware, without applying the principles of conflicts
of law thereunder.
       15.	No provision of this Agreement may be changed,
discharged or terminated orally, but only by an
instrument in writing signed by the party against which
enforcement of the change, discharge or termination is
sought.  No amendment of this Agreement shall be effective with
respect to the Trust until approved as required by
applicable law.
       16.	Any notice to be given hereunder may be given by
personal notification or by facsimile
transmission, to the party specified at the address stated

SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
BETWEEN ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC
AND PICTET ASSET MANAGEMENT LIMITED
       SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (the Agreement) made
this 30th day of May, 2014 by
and between ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC (hereinafter referred to
as the Investment Adviser) and
PICTET ASSET MANAGEMENT LIMITED (hereinafter referred to as the
Subadviser), which Agreement may
be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall
be deemed to be an original, but all of which
together shall constitute but one instrument.
W I T N E S S E T H:
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser has been retained by
Aston Funds, a Delaware statutory trust (the
Trust), a registered management investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the 1940 Act), to provide investment advisory services to the
Trust with respect to certain series of the Trust set
forth in Schedule A hereto as may be amended from time to time
(hereinafter referred to as a Fund and,
collectively, the Funds of the Trust);
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser wishes to enter into a
contract with the Subadviser to provide
research, analysis, advice and recommendations with respect to
the purchase and sale of securities, and make
investment commitments with respect to such portion of the
Funds' assets as shall be allocated to the Subadviser by
the Investment Adviser from time to time (the Allocated"
"7152","Assets), subject to oversight by the Trustees of the Trust
and the supervision of the Investment Adviser.
       NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein contained, and intending to be
bound, the parties agree as follows:
       1.	In accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement
between the Trust and the Investment
Adviser (Investment Advisory Agreement) with respect to the
Funds, the Investment Adviser hereby appoints the
Subadviser to act as subadviser with respect to the Allocated
Assets for the period and on the terms set forth in this
Agreement. The Subadviser accepts such appointment and agrees to
render the services set forth herein, for the
compensation provided herein.
       2.	As compensation for the services enumerated herein,
the Investment Adviser will pay the
Subadviser a fee with respect to the Allocated Assets, which
shall be calculated and payable monthly in arrears
based on the average daily net assets of the Fund, in an amount
equal to 50% of the positive difference, if any, of (x)
the advisory fee payable to the Investment Adviser with respect
to the Allocated Assets of the Fund (before
reduction of the fee payable to Subadviser) minus (y) the sum
of: (i) any investment advisory fees waived by the
Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense limitation or
reimbursement agreement with the Fund, and (ii) any
reimbursement of expenses by the Investment Adviser pursuant to
an expense limitation or reimbursement
agreement with the Fund.  If the foregoing calculation results
in a negative amount, such amount shall be payable by
the Subadviser within 30 days of receipt of notice from the
Investment Adviser, which notice shall include the basis
for the calculation.
       For the purposes of this Agreement, a Fund's net assets
shall be determined as provided in the Fund's
then-current Prospectus (as used herein, this term includes the
related Statement of Additional Information).
       If this Agreement shall become effective subsequent to
the first day of a month, or shall terminate before
the last day of a month, the Subadviser's compensation for such
fraction of the month shall be prorated based on the
number of calendar days of such month during which the Agreement
is effective.
       3.	This Agreement shall become effective with respect to
a Fund as of the date set forth opposite the
Fund's name as set forth on Schedule A hereto (the Effective"
"7153","Date), provided that it has been approved by the
Trustees of the Trust in accordance with the provisions of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder and, if so required
by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, by the shareholders of
the Fund in accordance with the requirements of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
       4.	This Agreement shall continue in effect for the
initial term set forth in Schedule A.  It shall be
renewed automatically thereafter with respect to a Fund by the
Investment Adviser and the Subadviser for
successive periods not exceeding one year, if and only if such
renewal and continuance is specifically approved at
least annually by the Board of Trustees of the Trust or by a
vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities
of the Fund as prescribed by the 1940 Act and provided further
that such continuance is approved at least annually
thereafter by a vote of a majority of the Trust's Trustees, who
are not parties to such Agreement or interested
persons of such a party, cast in person at a meeting called for
the purpose of voting on such approval.  This
Agreement will terminate with respect to a Fund without the
payment of any penalty upon termination of the
Investment Advisory Agreement relating to the Fund by either
party thereto (accompanied by simultaneous notice to
the Subadviser) or upon sixty days' written notice to the
Subadviser that the Trustees of the Trust, the Investment
Adviser or the shareholders by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund, as provided by the
1940 Act, have terminated this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated upon
less than sixty days' notice to the Subadviser upon a material
breach of this Agreement or if the Trustees determine
that other circumstances have, or likely will have, a material
adverse effect on the Subadviser's abilities to perform
its obligations hereunder, including without limitation,
notification of the departure of a portfolio manager of the
Fund or other key personnel change.  This Agreement may also be
terminated by the Subadviser with respect to a
Fund without penalty upon sixty days' written notice to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust.
       This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect
to a Fund in the event of its assignment or, upon
notice thereof to the Subadviser, the assignment of the
Investment Advisory Agreement, unless its continuation
thereafter is approved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust and
the shareholders of the Fund if so required by the
1940 Act (in each case as the term assignment is defined in
Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, subject to such
exemptions as may be granted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) by any rule, regulation, order
or interpretive guidance).
       5.	Subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the Investment Adviser, the
Subadviser will provide an investment program for the Allocated
Assets, including investment research and
management with respect to securities and investments, including
cash and cash equivalents, and will determine
from time to time what securities and other investments will be
purchased, retained or sold.  The Subadviser will
provide the services under this Agreement in accordance with
each Fund's investment objective, policies and
restrictions as stated in the Prospectus, as provided to the
Subadviser by the Investment Adviser.  The Subadviser
further agrees that, in all matters relating to the performance
of this Agreement, it:
              (a)	shall act in conformity with the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and currently
effective registration statements under the 1940 Act and the
Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act) and any
amendments or supplements thereto (the Registration"
"7154","Statements) and with the written policies, procedures and
guidelines of each Fund, and written instructions and directions
of the Trustees of the Trust and shall comply with
the requirements of the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940 (the Advisers Act) and the rules
thereunder, and all other applicable federal and state laws and
regulations.  The Trust agrees to provide Subadviser
with copies of the Trust's Declaration of Trust, By-Laws,
Registration Statements, written policies, procedures and
guidelines, and written instructions and directions of the
Trustees, and any amendments or supplements to any of
them at, or, if practicable, before the time such materials,
instructions or directives become effective;
              (b)	will maintain at all times during the term
of this Agreement, in full force and effect,
insurance, including without limitation errors and omissions
insurance, with reputable insurance carriers, in such
amounts, covering  such risks and liabilities, and with such
deductibles and self-insurance as are consistent with
customary industry practice;
              (c)	will pay expenses incurred by it in
connection with its activities under this Agreement
other than the cost of securities and other investments
(including brokerage commissions and other transaction
changes, if any) purchased for each Fund, provided that the
Subadviser will not pay for or provide a credit with
respect to any research provided to it in accordance with
Section 5(d);
              (d)	will place orders pursuant to its investment
determinations for the Allocated Assets either
directly with any broker or dealer, or with the issuer.  In
placing orders with brokers or dealers, the Subadviser will
attempt to obtain the best overall price and the most favorable
execution of its orders.  Subject to policies established
by the Trustees of the Trust and communicated to the Subadviser,
it is understood that the Subadviser will not be
deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to have breached a fiduciary
duty to the Trust or in respect of a Fund, or be in
breach of any obligation owing to the Investment Adviser or the
Trust or in respect of a Fund under this Agreement,
or otherwise, solely by reason of its having caused the Fund to
pay a member of a securities exchange, a broker or a
dealer a commission for effecting a securities transaction for
the Fund in excess of the amount of commission
another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have
charged if the Subadviser determines in good faith that
the commission paid was reasonable in relation to the brokerage
or research services (as those terms are defined in
Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
interpretive guidance issued by the SEC thereunder)
provided by such member, broker or dealer, viewed in terms of
that particular transaction or the Subadviser's overall
responsibilities with respect to the accounts, including the
Fund, as to which it exercises investment discretion;
              (e)	will review the daily valuation of
securities comprising the Allocated Assets of each
Fund as obtained on a daily basis by the Fund's administrator
and furnished by it to Subadviser, and will promptly
notify the Trust and the Investment Adviser if the Subadviser
believes that any such valuations may not properly
reflect the market value of any securities owned by the Fund,
provided, however, that the Subadviser is not required
by this subparagraph to obtain valuations of any such securities
from brokers or dealers or otherwise, or to otherwise
independently verify valuations of any such securities;
              (f)	unless otherwise instructed, will be
responsible for voting all proxies of the Allocated
Assets in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Guidelines of Subadviser (the Proxy Policy), provided
that such Proxy Policy and any amendments thereto are furnished
to the Trust;
              (g)	will attend regular business and investment-
related meetings with the Trust's Board of
Trustees and the Investment Adviser if requested to do so by the
Trust and/or the Investment Adviser, and at its
expense, shall supply the Board, the officers of the Trust, and
the Investment Adviser with all information and
reports reasonably required by them and reasonably available to
the Subadviser relating to the services provided by
the Subadviser hereunder;
              (h)	will maintain books and records with respect
to the securities transactions for the
Allocated Assets of each Fund and proxy voting record for the
Allocated Assets of the Fund in accordance with
regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission, furnish to
the Investment Adviser and the Trust's Board of
Trustees such periodic and special reports as they may request
with respect to the Fund, and provide in advance to
the Investment Adviser all of the Subadviser's reports to the
Trust's Board of Trustees for examination and review
within a reasonable time prior to the Trust's Board meetings;
and
              (i)	will pay expenses incurred by the Trust for
any matters related to any transaction or event
that is deemed to result in a change of control of the
Subadviser or otherwise result in the assignment of the Sub-
Investment Advisory Agreement under the 1940 Act.
       6.	The Investment Adviser or its affiliates may, from
time to time, engage other subadvisers to advise
other series of the Trust (or portions thereof) or other
registered investment companies (or series or portions thereof)
that may be deemed to be under common control (each a Sub-"
"7155","Advised Fund).  The Subadviser agrees that it will
not consult with any other  subadviser engaged by the Investment
Adviser or its affiliates with respect to
transactions in securities or other assets concerning a Fund or
another Sub-Advised Fund, except to the extent
permitted by the rules under the 1940 Act that permit certain
transactions with a subadviser or its affiliates.
       7.	The Subadviser may, but is not required, in its
discretion, to bunch or aggregate the securities to
be so sold or purchased on behalf of a Fund with orders of other
clients, and to allocate the aggregate amount of the
investment and the associated costs thereof among the accounts
in a manner over time which is no less favorable to
the Fund than other clients of the Subadviser.  Any such
aggregated trades will be made by the Subadviser
consistent with its written procedures.
       8.	Subadviser agrees with respect to the services
provided to each Fund that:
              (a)	it is registered as an investment adviser
under the Advisers Act, and will maintain such
registration for the term of this Agreement;
              (b)	it will promptly communicate to the
Investment Adviser such information relating to
Fund transactions as the officers and Trustees of the Trust may
reasonably request and as communicated to the
Subadviser;
              (c)	it will treat confidentially and as
proprietary information of the Trust all records and other
information relative to each Fund and its prior, present or
potential shareholders (Confidential Information), will
comply at all times with all applicable laws and regulations
relating to the confidentiality of nonpublic personal"
"7156","information including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or other
federal or state privacy laws and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, and will not use such Confidential
Information for any purpose other than the performance
of its responsibilities and duties hereunder (except after prior
notification to and approval in writing by the Trust,
which approval may not be withheld where Subadviser is advised
by counsel that the Subadviser may be exposed to
civil or criminal contempt or other proceedings for failure to
comply, when requested to divulge such information by
duly constituted authorities, or when so requested by the
Trust); and
              (d)	during the term of this Agreement and for a
period of eighteen (18) months following the
termination of this Agreement, Subadviser (and its directors,
officers, stockholders, employees, and agents) will not,
directly or indirectly, solicit or induce any of the Fund's
shareholders to be withdrawn from investment in any series
of the Trust.
       9.	Each party represents and warrants to the other party
that the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement is within its powers and have been duly
authorized by all necessary actions of its directors or
members, and no action by, or in respect of, or filing with, any
governmental body, agency or official is required on
the part of either party for execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement, and the execution, delivery and
performance by either party of this Agreement do not contravene
or constitute a violation of, or a material default
under, (i) any provision of applicable law, rule or regulation,
(ii) such party's governing instruments, or (iii) any
agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other
instrument binding upon such party.
       10.	In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, Subadviser acknowledges
that all records which it maintains for the Trust are the
property of the Trust and agrees to surrender promptly to the
Trust any of such records upon the Trust's request, provided
that Subadviser may retain copies thereof at its own
expense.  Subadviser further agrees to preserve for the periods
prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the
records required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940
Act relating to transactions placed by Subadviser
for the Fund.  Subadviser further agrees to maintain each Fund's
proxy voting record with respect to the Allocated
Assets in a form mutually agreeable between the parties and
which contains the information required by Form N-PX
under the 1940 Act.
       11.	It is expressly understood and agreed that the
services to be rendered by the Subadviser to the
Investment Adviser under the provisions of this Agreement are
not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser
shall be free to provide similar or different services to others
so long as its ability to provide the services provided
for in this Agreement shall not be materially impaired thereby.
In addition, but without limiting any separate
agreement between the Subadviser and the Investment Adviser to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit
or restrict the right of any director, officer, or employee of
the Subadviser who may also be a Trustee, officer, or
employee of the Trust, to engage in any other business or to
devote his or her time and attention in part to the
management or other aspects of any other business, whether of a
similar nature or a dissimilar nature.
       12.	The Investment Adviser agrees that it will
furnish to the Subadviser all information with reference
to each Fund and the Trust that is reasonably necessary to
permit the Subadviser to carry out its responsibilities
under this Agreement, and the parties agree that they will from
time to time consult and make appropriate
arrangements as to specific information that is required under
this paragraph and the frequency and manner with
which it shall be supplied.  Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Investment Adviser will furnish to
Subadviser procedures consistent with the Trust's contract with
each Fund's custodian from time to time (the
Custodian), and reasonably satisfactory to Subadviser, for
consummation of portfolio transactions for each Fund
by payment to or delivery by the Custodian of all cash and/or
securities or other investments due to or from the
Fund, and Subadviser shall not have possession or custody
thereof or any responsibility or liability with respect to
such custody.  Upon giving proper instructions to the Custodian,
Subadviser shall have no responsibility or liability
with respect to custodial arrangements or the acts, omissions or
other conduct of the Custodian.
       13.	The Subadviser and its directors, officers,
stockholders, employees and agents shall not be liable
for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss
suffered by the Investment Adviser or the Trust in
connection with any matters to which this Agreement relates or
for any other act or omission in the performance by
the Subadviser of its duties under this Agreement except that
nothing herein contained shall be construed to protect
the Subadviser against any liability by reason of the
Subadviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence
in the performance of its duties or by reckless disregard of its
obligations or duties under this Agreement.
       14.	Each party shall indemnify and hold harmless the
other party and its respective control persons (as
described in Section 15 of the 1933 Act) and their respective
directors, stockholders, members and employees
(collectively, Indemnitees) against any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (including
reasonable legal and other expenses of investigating or
defending any alleged loss, claim, damages or liabilities) to
which any of the Indemnitees may become subject under the 1933
Act, the 1940 Act, or the Advisers Act, or under
any other statute, at common law or otherwise, arising out of or
based on (i) any willful misfeasance, bad faith, or
gross negligence of the other party in the performance of, or
reckless disregard of, any of its duties or obligations
hereunder, or (ii) any material breach of this Agreement by the
other party.
       15.	In addition to its registration under the
Advisers Act, the Subadviser is authorised and regulated by
the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the conduct of its
designated investment business.   The FCA's address
is: 25 North Colonnade, Canary Wharf, London E14 5HS and its
website can be accessed at: www.fca.gov.uk. In
connection with such authorization, the parties acknowledge as
follows:
              (a)	The Investment Adviser, the Trust and the
Fund will be treated as a Professional Client
under the FCA conduct of business rules set out in the Handbook
of Rules and Guidance issued by the FCA (the
FCA Rules) solely for purposes of the Subadviser's
responsibilities under this Agreement as an FCA regulated
entity.  Terms defined in the FCA Rules shall have the same
meaning where used herein unless the context
otherwise dictates.  The Client may request to be categorised as
a Retail Client instead and benefit from the
applicability of a higher level of protection but the Subadviser
may decline to provide its services on that basis.
              (b)	If a complaint is of a serious nature
relating to the Subadviser's conduct, the Investment
Adviser may report it in writing to the Subadviser's Compliance
Officer.  Certain clients may have a right to refer a
complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service if the Subadviser
is unable to resolve it.  Where required by FCA
Rules, a copy of the Subadviser's complaints handling procedure
will be available on request.
              (c)	The Subadviser agrees that nothing in this
paragraph 15 shall constitute a waiver of any
rights of the Trust, the Fund or Investment Adviser under
applicable U.S. securities laws, including the Advisers Act
and 1940 Act.
       16.	If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
or made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule
or otherwise, the remainder of the Agreement shall not be
affected thereby.  Except to the extent governed by federal
law including the 1940 Act, this Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Delaware, without applying the principles of conflicts
of law thereunder.
       17.	No provision of this Agreement may be changed,
discharged or terminated orally, but only by an
instrument in writing signed by the party against which
enforcement of the change, discharge or termination is
sought.  No amendment of this Agreement shall be effective with
respect to the Trust until approved as required by
applicable law.
       18.	Any notice to be given hereunder may be given by
personal notification or by facsimile
transmission, to the party specified at the address stated

SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
BETWEEN ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC
AND SILVERCREST ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP LLC
       SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (the Agreement) made
this 30th day of May, 2014 by
and between ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC (hereinafter referred to
as the Investment Adviser) and
SILVERCREST ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP LLC (hereinafter referred to
as the Subadviser), which
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original, but all
of which together shall constitute but one instrument.
W I T N E S S E T H:
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser has been retained by
Aston Funds, a Delaware statutory trust (the
Trust), a registered management investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the 1940 Act), to provide investment advisory services to the
Trust with respect to certain series of the Trust set
forth in Schedule A hereto as may be amended from time to time
(hereinafter referred to as a Fund and,
collectively, the Funds of the Trust);
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser wishes to enter into a
contract with the Subadviser to provide
research, analysis, advice and recommendations with respect to
the purchase and sale of securities, and make
investment commitments with respect to all of the Funds' assets
(the Allocated Assets), which shall be allocated
to the Subadviser by the Investment Adviser pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, subject to oversight by the
Trustees of the Trust and the supervision of the Investment
Adviser.
       NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein contained, and intending to be
bound, the parties agree as follows:
       1.	In accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement
between the Trust and the Investment
Adviser (Investment Advisory Agreement) with respect to the
Funds, the Investment Adviser hereby appoints the
Subadviser to act as subadviser with respect to the Allocated
Assets for the period and on the terms set forth in this
Agreement.  The Subadviser accepts such appointment and agrees
to render the services set forth herein, for the
compensation provided herein.
       2.	As compensation for the services enumerated herein,
the Investment Adviser will pay the
Subadviser a fee with respect to the Allocated Assets, which
shall be calculated and payable monthly in arrears
based on the average daily net assets of the Fund, in an amount
equal to 50% of the positive difference, if any, of
(x) the advisory fee payable to the Investment Adviser with
respect to the Allocated Assets of the Fund (before
reduction of the fee payable to Subadviser) minus (y) the sum
of:  (i) any investment advisory fees waived by the
Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense limitation or
reimbursement agreement with the Fund, (ii) any
reimbursement of expenses by the Investment Adviser pursuant to
an expense limitation or reimbursement
agreement with the Fund, and (iii) any payments made by the
Investment Adviser to third parties that provide
distribution, shareholder services or similar services on behalf
of the Fund.  If the foregoing calculation results in a
negative amount, such amount shall be payable by the Subadviser
within 30 days of receipt of notice from the
Investment Adviser, which notice shall include the basis for the
calculation.  All payments to be made by Investment
Adviser will be due and payable within thirty (30) days of the
receipt of the advisory fee payable to the Investment
Adviser by the Fund.
       For the purposes of this Agreement, a Fund's net assets
shall be determined as provided in the Fund's
then-current Prospectus (as used herein, this term includes the
related Statement of Additional Information).
       If this Agreement shall become effective subsequent to
the first day of a month, or shall terminate before
the last day of a month, the Subadviser's compensation for such
fraction of the month shall be prorated based on the
number of calendar days of such month during which the Agreement
is effective.
       3.	This Agreement shall become effective with respect to
a Fund as of the date set forth opposite the
Fund's name as set forth on Schedule A hereto (the Effective"
"7157","Date), provided that it has been approved by the
Trustees of the Trust in accordance with the provisions of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder and, if so required
by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, by the shareholders of
the Fund in accordance with the requirements of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
       4.	This Agreement shall continue in effect for the
initial term set forth in Schedule A.  It shall be
renewed automatically thereafter with respect to a Fund by the
Investment Adviser and the Subadviser for
successive periods not exceeding one year, if and only if such
renewal and continuance is specifically approved at
least annually by the Board of Trustees of the Trust or by a
vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities
of the Fund as prescribed by the 1940 Act and provided further
that such continuance is approved at least annually
thereafter by a vote of a majority of the Trust's Trustees, who
are not parties to such Agreement or interested
persons of such a party, cast in person at a meeting called for
the purpose of voting on such approval.  This
Agreement will terminate with respect to a Fund without the
payment of any penalty upon termination of the
Investment Advisory Agreement relating to the Fund by either
party thereto (accompanied by simultaneous notice to
the Subadviser) or upon sixty days' written notice to the
Subadviser that the Trustees of the Trust, the Investment
Adviser or the shareholders by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund, as provided by the
1940 Act, have terminated this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated upon
less than sixty days' notice to the Subadviser upon a material
breach of this Agreement or if the Trustees determine
that other circumstances have, or likely will have, a material
adverse effect on the Subadviser's abilities to perform
its obligations hereunder, including without limitation,
notification of the departure of a portfolio manager of the
Fund or other key personnel change.  This Agreement may also be
terminated by the Subadviser with respect to a
Fund without penalty upon sixty days' written notice to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust.
       This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect
to a Fund in the event of its assignment or, upon
notice thereof to the Subadviser, the assignment of the
Investment Advisory Agreement, unless its continuation
thereafter is approved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust and
the shareholders of the Fund if so required by the
1940 Act (in each case as the term assignment is defined in
Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, subject to such
exemptions as may be granted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) by any rule, regulation, order
or interpretive guidance).
       5.	Subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the Investment Adviser, the
Subadviser will provide an investment program for the Allocated
Assets, including investment research and
management with respect to securities and investments, including
cash and cash equivalents, and will determine
from time to time what securities and other investments will be
purchased, retained or sold.  The Subadviser will
provide the services under this Agreement to each Fund in
accordance with such Fund's investment objective,
policies and restrictions as stated in the then-current
Prospectus.  The Subadviser further agrees that, in all matters
relating to the performance of this Agreement, it:
              (a)	shall act in conformity with the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and currently
effective registration statements under the 1940 Act and the
Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act) and any
amendments or supplements thereto (the Registration"
"7158","Statements) and with the written policies, procedures and
guidelines of each Fund, and written instructions and directions
of the Trustees of the Trust and shall comply with
the requirements of the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940 (the Advisers Act) and the rules
thereunder, and all other applicable federal and state laws and
regulations.  The Investment Adviser, on behalf of the
Trust, agrees to provide Subadviser with copies of the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws, Registration
Statements, written policies, procedures and guidelines, and
written instructions and directions of the Trustees, and
any amendments or supplements to any of them at, or, if
practicable, before the time such materials, instructions or
directives become effective;
              (b)	will maintain at all times during the term
of this Agreement, in full force and effect,
insurance, including without limitation errors and omissions
insurance, with reputable insurance carriers, in such
amounts, covering  such risks and liabilities, and with such
deductibles and self-insurance as are consistent with
customary industry practice;
              (c)	will pay expenses incurred by it in
connection with its activities under this Agreement
other than the cost of securities and other investments
(including brokerage commissions and other transaction
charges, if any) purchased for each Fund, provided that the
Subadviser will not pay for or provide a credit with
respect to any research provided to it in accordance with
Section 5(d);
              (d)	will place orders pursuant to its investment
determinations for the Allocated Assets either
directly with any broker or dealer, or with the issuer.  In
placing orders with brokers or dealers, the Subadviser will
attempt to obtain the best overall price and the most favorable
execution of its orders under the circumstances.
Subject to policies established by the Trustees of the Trust and
communicated to the Subadviser, it is understood that
the Subadviser will not be deemed to have acted unlawfully, or
to have breached a fiduciary duty to the Trust or in
respect of a Fund, or be in breach of any obligation owing to
the Investment Adviser or the Trust or in respect of a
Fund under this Agreement, or otherwise, solely by reason of its
having caused the Fund to pay a member of a
securities exchange, a broker or a dealer a commission for
effecting a securities transaction for the Fund in excess of
the amount of commission another member of an exchange, broker
or dealer would have charged if the Subadviser
determines in good faith that the commission paid was reasonable
in relation to the brokerage or research services
(as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and interpretive guidance issued
by the SEC thereunder) provided by such member, broker or
dealer, viewed in terms of that particular transaction or
the Subadviser's overall responsibilities with respect to the
accounts, including the Fund, as to which it exercises
investment discretion;
              (e)	will review the daily valuation of
securities comprising the Allocated Assets of each
Fund as obtained on a daily basis by the Fund's administrator
and furnished by it to Subadviser, and will promptly
notify the Trust and the Investment Adviser if the Subadviser
believes that any such valuations may not properly
reflect the market value of any securities owned by the Fund,
provided, however, that the Subadviser is not required
by this subparagraph to obtain valuations of any such securities
from brokers or dealers or otherwise, or to otherwise
independently verify valuations of any such securities;
              (f)	unless otherwise instructed, will be
responsible for voting all proxies of the Allocated
Assets in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Guidelines of Subadviser (the Proxy Policy), provided
that such Proxy Policy and any amendments thereto are furnished
to the Trust;
              (g)	will attend regular business and investment-
related meetings with the Trust's Board of
Trustees and the Investment Adviser if requested to do so by the
Trust and/or the Investment Adviser, and at its
expense, shall supply the Board, the officers of the Trust, and
the Investment Adviser with all information and
reports reasonably required by them and reasonably available to
the Subadviser relating to the services provided by
the Subadviser hereunder;
              (h)	will maintain books and records with respect
to the securities transactions for the
Allocated Assets of each Fund and proxy voting record for the
Allocated Assets of the Fund, furnish to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust's Board of Trustees such
periodic and special reports as they may request with
respect to the Fund, and provide in advance to the Investment
Adviser all of the Subadviser's reports to the Trust's
Board of Trustees for examination and review within a reasonable
time prior to the Trust's Board meetings; and
              (i)	will pay expenses incurred by the Trust for
any matters related to any transaction or event
that is deemed to result in a change of control of the
Subadviser or otherwise result in the assignment of the Sub-
Investment Advisory Agreement under the 1940 Act.
       6.	The Investment Adviser or its affiliates may, from
time to time, engage other subadvisers to advise
other series of the Trust (or portions thereof) or other
registered investment companies (or series or portions thereof)
that may be deemed to be under common control (each a Sub-"
"7159","Advised Fund).  The Subadviser agrees that it will
not consult with any other  subadviser engaged by the Investment
Adviser or its affiliates with respect to
transactions in securities or other assets concerning a Fund or
another Sub-Advised Fund, except to the extent
permitted by the rules under the 1940 Act that permit certain
transactions with a subadviser or its affiliates.
       7.	Subadviser agrees with respect to the services
provided to each Fund that:
              (a)	it will promptly communicate to the
Investment Adviser such information relating to
Fund transactions as the officers and Trustees of the Trust may
reasonably request and as communicated to the
Subadviser;
              (b)	it will treat confidentially and as
proprietary information of the Trust all records and other
information relative to each Fund and its prior, present or
potential shareholders (Confidential Information), will
comply at all times with all applicable laws and regulations
relating to the confidentiality of nonpublic personal"
"7160","information (including, to the extent that the Subadviser
receives nonpublic personal information with respect to
shareholders of the Fund, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or other
federal or state privacy laws and the regulations
promulgated thereunder), and will not use such Confidential
Information for any purpose other than the performance
of its responsibilities and duties hereunder (except after prior
notification to and approval in writing by the Trust,
which approval may not be withheld where Subadviser is advised
by internal or external counsel that the Subadviser
may be exposed to civil or criminal contempt or other
proceedings for failure to comply, when requested to divulge
such information by duly constituted authorities, or when so
requested by the Trust); and
              (c)	during the term of this Agreement and for a
period of eighteen (18) months following the
termination of this Agreement, Subadviser (and its directors,
officers, stockholders, employees, and agents) will not,
directly or indirectly, solicit or induce any person that the
Subadviser knows or reasonably should know to be a
shareholder of the Fund, to be withdrawn from investment in any
series of the Trust except to the extent the
Subadviser can demonstrate that those shareholders were, at the
time of their investment in the Fund, already
existing clients of Subadviser.
       8.	Each party represents and warrants to the other party
as follows:
              (a)	that the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement are within its powers and
have been duly authorized by all necessary actions of its
directors or members, and no action by, or in respect of, or
filing with, any governmental body, agency or official is
required on the part of such party for execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by such party, and the
execution, delivery and performance by such party of this
Agreement do not contravene or constitute a violation of, or a
material default under, (i) any provision of applicable
law, rule or regulation, (ii) such party's governing
instruments, or (iii) any agreement, judgment, injunction,
order,
decree or other instrument binding upon such party; and
              (b)	that it is registered as an investment
adviser with the SEC.
       9.	In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, Subadviser acknowledges
that all records which it maintains for the Trust are the
property of the Trust and agrees to surrender promptly to the
Trust any of such records upon the Trust's request, provided
that Subadviser may retain copies thereof at its own
expense.  Subadviser further agrees to preserve for the periods
prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the
records required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940
Act relating to transactions placed by Subadviser
for the Fund.  Subadviser further agrees to maintain each Fund's
proxy voting record with respect to the Allocated
Assets in a form mutually agreeable between the parties and
which contains the information required by Form N-PX
under the 1940 Act.
       10.	It is expressly understood and agreed that the
services to be rendered by the Subadviser to the
Investment Adviser under the provisions of this Agreement are
not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser
shall be free to provide similar or different services to others
so long as its ability to provide the services provided
for in this Agreement shall not be materially impaired thereby.
In addition, but without limiting any separate
agreement between the Subadviser and the Investment Adviser to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit
or restrict the right of any director, officer, or employee of
the Subadviser who may also be a Trustee, officer, or
employee of the Trust, to engage in any other business or to
devote his or her time and attention in part to the
management or other aspects of any other business, whether of a
similar nature or a dissimilar nature.
       11.	The Investment Adviser agrees that it will
furnish currently to the Subadviser all information with
reference to each Fund and the Trust that is reasonably
necessary to permit the Subadviser to carry out its
responsibilities under this Agreement, and the parties agree
that they will from time to time consult and make
appropriate arrangements as to specific information that is
required under this paragraph and the frequency and
manner with which it shall be supplied.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Investment Adviser will
furnish to Subadviser procedures consistent with the Trust's
contract with each Fund's custodian from time to time
(the Custodian), and reasonably satisfactory to Subadviser,
for consummation of portfolio transactions for each
Fund by payment to or delivery by the Custodian of all cash
and/or securities or other investments due to or from the
Fund, and Subadviser shall not have possession or custody
thereof or any responsibility or liability with respect to
such custody.  Upon giving proper instructions to the Custodian,
Subadviser shall have no responsibility or liability
with respect to custodial arrangements or the acts, omissions or
other conduct of the Custodian.
       12.	The Subadviser and its directors, officers,
stockholders, employees and agents shall not be liable
for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss
suffered by the Investment Adviser or the Trust
(including on behalf of a Fund) in connection with any matters
to which this Agreement relates or for any other act
or omission in the performance by the Subadviser of its duties
under this Agreement except that nothing herein
contained shall be construed to protect the Subadviser against
any liability by reason of the Subadviser's willful
misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance
of its duties or by reckless disregard of its obligations
or duties under this Agreement.

SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT BETWEEN
ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LP AND
TAMRO CAPITAL PARTNERS LLC
       SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (the Agreement) made
this 30th day of May, 2014 by
and between ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC (hereinafter referred to
as the Investment Adviser) and
TAMRO CAPITAL PARTNERS, LLC (hereinafter referred to as the
Subadviser), which Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to be an original, but all of which together
shall constitute but one instrument.
W I T N E S S E T H:
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser has been retained by
Aston Funds, a Delaware statutory trust (the
Trust), a registered management investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the 1940 Act) to provide investment advisory services to the
Trust with respect to certain series of the Trust set
forth in Schedule A hereto as may be amended from time to time
(hereinafter referred to as a Fund and
collectively, the Funds of the Trust);
       WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser wishes to enter into a
contract with the Subadviser to provide
research, analysis, advice and recommendations with respect to
the purchase and sale of securities, and make
investment commitments with respect to such portion of the
Funds' assets as shall be allocated to the Subadviser by
the Investment Adviser from time to time (the Allocated"
"7161","Assets), subject to oversight by the Trustees of the Trust
and the supervision of the Investment Adviser.
       NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein contained, and intending to be
bound, the parties agree as follows:
       1.	In accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement
between the Trust and the Investment
Adviser (Investment Advisory Agreement) with respect to the
Funds, the Investment Adviser hereby appoints the
Subadviser to act as subadviser with respect to the Allocated
Assets for the period and on the terms set forth in this
Agreement. The Subadviser accepts such appointment and agrees to
render the services set forth herein, for the
compensation provided herein.
       2.	As compensation for the services enumerated herein,
the Investment Adviser will pay the
Subadviser a fee with respect to the Allocated Assets, which
shall be calculated and payable monthly in arrears
based on the average daily net assets of the Fund as set forth
in Schedule B hereto.
	For the purposes of this Agreement, a Fund's net assets
shall be determined as provided in the Fund's
then-current Prospectus (as used herein this term includes the
related Statement of Additional Information).
       If this Agreement shall become effective subsequent to
the first day of a month, or shall terminate before
the last day of a month, the Subadviser's compensation for such
fraction of the month shall be prorated based on the
number of calendar days of such month during which the Agreement
is effective.
       3.	This Agreement shall become effective with respect to
a Fund as of the date set forth opposite the
Fund's name as set forth on Schedule A hereto (the Effective"
"7162","Date), provided that it has been approved by the
Trustees of the Trust in accordance with the provisions of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder and, if so required
by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, by the shareholders of
the Fund in accordance with the requirements of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
       4.	This Agreement shall continue in effect for the
initial term set forth in Schedule A.  It shall be
renewed automatically thereafter with respect to a Fund by the
Investment Adviser and the Subadviser for
successive periods not exceeding one year, if and only if such
renewal and continuance is specifically approved at
least annually by the Board of Trustees of the Trust or by a
vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities
of the Fund as prescribed by the 1940 Act and provided further
that such continuance is approved at least annually
thereafter by a vote of a majority of the Trust's Trustees, who
are not parties to such Agreement or interested
persons of such a party, cast in person at a meeting called for
the purpose of voting on such approval.  This
Agreement will terminate with respect to a Fund without the
payment of any penalty upon termination of the
Investment Advisory Agreement relating to a Fund by either party
thereto (accompanied by simultaneous notice to
the Subadviser) or upon sixty days' written notice to the
Subadviser that the Trustees of the Trust, the Investment
Adviser or the shareholders by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund, as provided by the
1940 Act, have terminated this Agreement.  This Agreement may
also be terminated by the Subadviser with respect
to a Fund without penalty upon sixty days' written notice to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust.
       This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect
to a Fund in the event of its assignment or, upon
notice thereof to the Subadviser, the assignment of the
Investment Advisory Agreement, unless its continuation
thereafter is approved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust and
the shareholders of the Fund if so required by the
1940 Act (in each case as the term assignment is defined in
Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, subject to such
exemptions as may be granted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) by any rule, regulation, order
or interpretive guidance).
       5.	Subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the Investment Adviser, the
Subadviser will provide an investment program for the Allocated
Assets, including investment research and
management with respect to securities and investments, including
cash and cash equivalents, and will determine
from time to time what securities and other investments will be
purchased, retained or sold.  The Subadviser will
provide the services under this Agreement in accordance with
each Fund's investment objective, policies and
restrictions as stated in the Prospectus, as provided to the
Subadviser by the Investment Adviser.  The Subadviser
further agrees that, in all matters relating to the performance
of this Agreement, it:
              (a)	shall act in conformity with the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and currently
effective registration statements under the 1940 Act and the
Securities Act of 1933 and any amendments or
supplements thereto (the Registration Statements) and with the
written policies, procedures and guidelines of each
Fund, and written instructions and directions of the Trustees of
the Trust and shall comply with the requirements of
the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the
rules thereunder, and all other applicable federal and
state laws and regulations.  The Trust agrees to provide
Subadviser with copies of the Trust's Declaration of Trust,
By-Laws, Registration Statements, written policies, procedures
and guidelines, and written instructions and
directions of the Trustees, and any amendments or supplements to
any of them at, or, if practicable, before the time
such materials, instructions or directives become effective;
              (b)	will pay expenses incurred by it in
connection with its activities under this Agreement
other than the cost of securities and other investments
(including brokerage commissions and other transaction
changes, if any) purchased for each Fund, provided that the
Subadviser will not pay for or provide a credit with
respect to any research provided to it in accordance with
Section 5(c);
              (c)	will place orders pursuant to its investment
determinations for the Allocated Assets either
directly with any broker or dealer, or with the issuer.  In
placing orders with brokers or dealers, the Subadviser will
attempt to obtain the best overall price and the most favorable
execution of its orders.  Subject to policies established
by the Trustees of the Trust and communicated to the Subadviser,
it is understood that the Subadviser will not be
deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to have breached a fiduciary
duty to the Trust or in respect of a Fund, or be in
breach of any obligation owing to the Investment Adviser or the
Trust or in respect of a Fund under this Agreement,
or otherwise, solely by reason of its having caused the Fund to
pay a member of a securities exchange, a broker or a
dealer a commission for effecting a securities transaction for
the Fund in excess of the amount of commission
another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have
charged if the Subadviser determines in good faith that
the commission paid was reasonable in relation to the brokerage
or research services (as those terms are defined in
Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
interpretive guidance issued by the SEC thereunder)
provided by such member, broker or dealer, viewed in terms of
that particular transaction or the Subadviser's overall
responsibilities with respect to the accounts, including the
Fund, as to which it exercises investment discretion;
              (d)	will review the daily valuation of
securities comprising the Allocated Assets of each
Fund as obtained on a daily basis by the Fund's administrator
and furnished by it to Subadviser, and will promptly
notify the Trust and the Investment Adviser if the Subadviser
believes that any such valuations may not properly
reflect the market value of any securities owned by the Fund,
provided, however, that the Subadviser is not required
by this sub-paragraph to obtain valuations of any such
securities from brokers or dealers or otherwise, or to
otherwise independently verify valuations of any such
securities;
              (e)	unless otherwise instructed, will be
responsible for voting all proxies of the Allocated
Assets in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Guidelines of Subadviser (the Proxy Policy), provided
that such Proxy Policy and any amendments thereto are furnished
to the Trust;
              (f)	will attend regular business and investment-
related meetings with the Trust's Board of
Trustees and the Investment Adviser if requested to do so by the
Trust and/or the Investment Adviser, and at its
expense, shall supply the Board, the officers of the Trust, and
the Investment Adviser with all information and
reports reasonably required by them and reasonably available to
the Subadviser relating to the services provided by
the Subadviser hereunder; and
              (g)	will maintain books and records with respect
to the securities transactions for the
Allocated Assets of each Fund and proxy voting record for the
Allocated Assets of the Fund, furnish to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust's Board of Trustees such
periodic and special reports as they may request with
respect to the Fund, and provide in advance to the Investment
Adviser all of the Subadviser's reports to the Trust's
Board of Trustees for examination and review within a reasonable
time prior to the Trust's Board meetings.
       6.	The Investment Adviser or its affiliates may, from
time to time, engage other subadvisers to advise
other series of the Trust (or portions thereof) or other
registered investment companies (or series or portions thereof)
that may be deemed to be under common control (each a Sub-"
"7163","Advised Fund).  The Subadviser agrees that it will
not consult with any other unaffiliated subadviser engaged by
the Investment Adviser or its affiliates with respect to
transactions in securities or other assets concerning a Fund or
another Sub-Advised Fund, except to the extent
permitted by the rules under the 1940 Act that permit certain
transactions with a subadviser or its affiliates.
       7.	Subadviser agrees with respect to the services
provided to each Fund that it:
              (a)	will promptly communicate to the Investment
Adviser such information relating to Fund
transactions as the officers and Trustees of the Trust may
reasonably request and as communicated to the
Subadviser; and
              (b)	will treat confidentially and as proprietary
information of the Trust all records and other
information relative to each Fund and its prior, present or
potential shareholders, and will not use such records and
information for any purpose other than performance of its
responsibilities and duties hereunder (except after prior
notification to and approval in writing by the Trust, which
approval may not be withheld where Subadviser is
advised by counsel that the Subadviser may be exposed to civil
or criminal contempt or other proceedings for failure
to comply, when requested to divulge such information by duly
constituted authorities, or when so requested by the
Trust).
       8.	In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, Subadviser acknowledges
that all records which it maintains for the Trust are the
property of the Trust and agrees to surrender promptly to the
Trust any of such records upon the Trust's request, provided,
that Subadviser may retain copies thereof at its own
expense.  Subadviser further agrees to preserve for the periods
prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the
records required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940
Act relating to transactions placed by Subadviser
for the Fund.  Subadviser further agrees to maintain each Fund's
proxy voting record with respect to the Allocated
Assets in a form mutually agreeable between the parties and
which contains the information required by Form N-PX
under the 1940 Act.
       9.	It is expressly understood and agreed that the
services to be rendered by the Subadviser to the
Investment Adviser under the provisions of this Agreement are
not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser
shall be free to provide similar or different services to others
so long as its ability to provide the services provided
for in this Agreement shall not be materially impaired thereby.
In addition, but without limiting any separate
agreement between the Subadviser and the Investment Adviser to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit
or restrict the right of any director, officer, or employee of
the Subadviser who may also be a Trustee, officer, or
employee of the Trust, to engage in any other business or to
devote his or her time and attention in part to the
management or other aspects of any other business, whether of a
similar nature or a dissimilar nature.
       10.	The Investment Adviser agrees that it will
furnish currently to the Subadviser all information with
reference to each Fund and the Trust that is reasonably
necessary to permit the Subadviser to carry out its
responsibilities under this Agreement, and the parties agree
that they will from time to time consult and make
appropriate arrangements as to specific information that is
required under this paragraph and the frequency and
manner with which it shall be supplied.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Investment Adviser will
furnish to Subadviser procedures consistent with the Trust's
contract with each Fund's custodian from time to time
(the Custodian), and reasonably satisfactory to Subadviser,
for consummation of portfolio transactions for each
Fund by payment to or delivery by the Custodian of all cash
and/or securities or other investments due to or from the
Fund, and Subadviser shall not have possession or custody
thereof or any responsibility or liability with respect to
such custody.  Upon giving proper instructions to the Custodian,
Subadviser shall have no responsibility or liability
with respect to custodial arrangements or the acts, omissions or
other conduct of the Custodian.
       11.	The Subadviser and its directors, officers,
stockholders, employees and agents shall not be liable
for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss
suffered by the Investment Adviser or the Trust in
connection with any matters to which this Agreement relates or
for any other act or omission in the performance by
the Subadviser of its duties under this Agreement except that
nothing herein contained shall be construed to protect
the Subadviser against any liability by reason of the
Subadviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence
in the performance of its duties or by reckless disregard of its
obligations or duties under this Agreement.
       12.	If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
or made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule
or otherwise, the remainder of the Agreement shall not be
affected thereby.  Except to the extent governed by federal
law including the 1940 Act, this Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Delaware, without applying the principles of conflicts
of law thereunder.
       13.	No provision of this Agreement may be changed,
discharged or terminated orally, but only by an
instrument in writing signed by the party against which
enforcement of the change, discharge or termination is
sought.  No amendment of this Agreement shall be effective with
respect to the Trust until approved as required by
applicable law.
       14.	Any notice to be given hereunder may be given by
personal notification or by facsimile
transmission, to the party specified at the address stated

then-current Prospectus (as used herein this term includes the
related Statement of Additional Information).
       If this Agreement shall become effective subsequent to
the first day of a month, or shall terminate before
the last day of a month, the Subadviser's compensation for such
fraction of the month shall be prorated based on the
number of calendar days of such month during which the Agreement
is effective.
       3.	This Agreement shall become effective with respect to
a Fund as of the date set forth opposite the
Fund's name as set forth on Schedule A hereto (the Effective"
"7165","Date), provided that it has been approved by the
Trustees of the Trust in accordance with the provisions of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder and, if so required
by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, by the shareholders of
the Fund in accordance with the requirements of the
1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
       4.	This Agreement shall continue in effect for the
initial term set forth in Schedule A.  It shall be
renewed automatically thereafter with respect to a Fund by the
Investment Adviser and the Subadviser for
successive periods not exceeding one year, if and only if such
renewal and continuance is specifically approved at
least annually by the Board of Trustees of the Trust or by a
vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities
of the Fund as prescribed by the 1940 Act and provided further
that such continuance is approved at least annually
thereafter by a vote of a majority of the Trust's Trustees, who
are not parties to such Agreement or interested
persons of such a party, cast in person at a meeting called for
the purpose of voting on such approval.  This
Agreement will terminate with respect to a Fund without the
payment of any penalty upon termination of the
Investment Advisory Agreement relating to a Fund by either party
thereto (accompanied by simultaneous notice to
the Subadviser) or upon sixty days' written notice to the
Subadviser that the Trustees of the Trust, the Investment
Adviser or the shareholders by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund, as provided by the
1940 Act, have terminated this Agreement.  This Agreement may
also be terminated by the Subadviser with respect
to a Fund without penalty upon sixty days' written notice to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust.
       This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect
to a Fund in the event of its assignment or, upon
notice thereof to the Subadviser, the assignment of the
Investment Advisory Agreement, unless its continuation
thereafter is approved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust and
the shareholders of the Fund if so required by the
1940 Act (in each case as the term assignment is defined in
Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, subject to such
exemptions as may be granted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) by any rule, regulation, order
or interpretive guidance).
       5.	Subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the Investment Adviser, the
Subadviser will provide an investment program for the Allocated
Assets, including investment research and
management with respect to securities and investments, including
cash and cash equivalents, and will determine
from time to time what securities and other investments will be
purchased, retained or sold.  The Subadviser will
provide the services under this Agreement in accordance with
each Fund's investment objective, policies and
restrictions as stated in the Prospectus, as provided to the
Subadviser by the Investment Adviser.  The Subadviser
further agrees that, in all matters relating to the performance
of this Agreement, it:
              (a)	shall act in conformity with the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and currently
effective registration statements under the 1940 Act and the
Securities Act of 1933 and any amendments or
supplements thereto (the Registration Statements) and with the
written policies, procedures and guidelines of each
Fund, and written instructions and directions of the Trustees of
the Trust and shall comply with the requirements of
the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the
rules thereunder, and all other applicable federal and
state laws and regulations.  The Trust agrees to provide
Subadviser with copies of the Trust's Declaration of Trust,
By-Laws, Registration Statements, written policies, procedures
and guidelines, and written instructions and
directions of the Trustees, and any amendments or supplements to
any of them at, or, if practicable, before the time
such materials, instructions or directives become effective;
              (b)	will pay expenses incurred by it in
connection with its activities under this Agreement
other than the cost of securities and other investments
(including brokerage commissions and other transaction
changes, if any) purchased for each Fund, provided that the
Subadviser will not pay for or provide a credit with
respect to any research provided to it in accordance with
Section 5(c);
              (c)	will place orders pursuant to its investment
determinations for the Allocated Assets either
directly with any broker or dealer, or with the issuer.  In
placing orders with brokers or dealers, the Subadviser will
attempt to obtain the best overall price and the most favorable
execution of its orders.  Subject to policies established
by the Trustees of the Trust and communicated to the Subadviser,
it is understood that the Subadviser will not be
deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to have breached a fiduciary
duty to the Trust or in respect of a Fund, or be in
breach of any obligation owing to the Investment Adviser or the
Trust or in respect of a Fund under this Agreement,
or otherwise, solely by reason of its having caused the Fund to
pay a member of a securities exchange, a broker or a
dealer a commission for effecting a securities transaction for
the Fund in excess of the amount of commission
another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have
charged if the Subadviser determines in good faith that
the commission paid was reasonable in relation to the brokerage
or research services (as those terms are defined in
Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
interpretive guidance issued by the SEC thereunder)
provided by such member, broker or dealer, viewed in terms of
that particular transaction or the Subadviser's overall
responsibilities with respect to the accounts, including the
Fund, as to which it exercises investment discretion;
              (d)	will review the daily valuation of
securities comprising the Allocated Assets of each
Fund as obtained on a daily basis by the Fund's administrator
and furnished by it to Subadviser, and will promptly
notify the Trust and the Investment Adviser if the Subadviser
believes that any such valuations may not properly
reflect the market value of any securities owned by the Fund,
provided, however, that the Subadviser is not required
by this sub-paragraph to obtain valuations of any such
securities from brokers or dealers or otherwise, or to
otherwise independently verify valuations of any such
securities;
              (e)	unless otherwise instructed, will be
responsible for voting all proxies of the Allocated
Assets in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Guidelines of Subadviser (the Proxy Policy), provided
that such Proxy Policy and any amendments thereto are furnished
to the Trust;
              (f)	will attend regular business and investment-
related meetings with the Trust's Board of
Trustees and the Investment Adviser if requested to do so by the
Trust and/or the Investment Adviser, and at its
expense, shall supply the Board, the officers of the Trust, and
the Investment Adviser with all information and
reports reasonably required by them and reasonably available to
the Subadviser relating to the services provided by
the Subadviser hereunder; and
              (g)	will maintain books and records with respect
to the securities transactions for the
Allocated Assets of each Fund and proxy voting record for the
Allocated Assets of the Fund, furnish to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust's Board of Trustees such
periodic and special reports as they may request with
respect to the Fund, and provide in advance to the Investment
Adviser all of the Subadviser's reports to the Trust's
Board of Trustees for examination and review within a reasonable
time prior to the Trust's Board meetings.
       6.	The Investment Adviser or its affiliates may, from
time to time, engage other subadvisers to advise
other series of the Trust (or portions thereof) or other
registered investment companies (or series or portions thereof)
that may be deemed to be under common control (each a Sub-"
"7166","Advised Fund).  The Subadviser agrees that it will
not consult with any other subadviser engaged by the Investment
Adviser or its affiliates with respect to transactions
in securities or other assets concerning a Fund or another Sub-
Advised Fund, except to the extent permitted by the
rules under the 1940 Act that permit certain transactions with a
subadviser or its affiliates.
       7.	Subadviser agrees with respect to the services
provided to each Fund that it:
              (a)	will promptly communicate to the Investment
Adviser such information relating to Fund
transactions as the officers and Trustees of the Trust may
reasonably request and as communicated to the
Subadviser; and
              (b)	will treat confidentially and as proprietary
information of the Trust all records and other
information relative to each Fund and its prior, present or
potential shareholders, and will not use such records and
information for any purpose other than performance of its
responsibilities and duties hereunder (except after prior
notification to and approval in writing by the Trust, which
approval may not be withheld where Subadviser is
advised by counsel that the Subadviser may be exposed to civil
or criminal contempt or other proceedings for failure
to comply, when requested to divulge such information by duly
constituted authorities, or when so requested by the
Trust).
       8.	In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, Subadviser acknowledges
that all records which it maintains for the Trust are the
property of the Trust and agrees to surrender promptly to the
Trust any of such records upon the Trust's request, provided,
that Subadviser may retain copies thereof at its own
expense.  Subadviser further agrees to preserve for the periods
prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the
records required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940
Act relating to transactions placed by Subadviser
for the Fund.  Subadviser further agrees to maintain each Fund's
proxy voting record with respect to the Allocated
Assets in a form mutually agreeable between the parties and
which contains the information required by Form N-PX
under the 1940 Act.
       9.	It is expressly understood and agreed that the
services to be rendered by the Subadviser to the
Investment Adviser under the provisions of this Agreement are
not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser
shall be free to provide similar or different services to others
so long as its ability to provide the services provided
for in this Agreement shall not be materially impaired thereby.
In addition, but without limiting any separate
agreement between the Subadviser and the Investment Adviser to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit
or restrict the right of any director, officer, or employee of
the Subadviser who may also be a Trustee, officer, or
employee of the Trust, to engage in any other business or to
devote his or her time and attention in part to the
management or other aspects of any other business, whether of a
similar nature or a dissimilar nature.
       10.	The Investment Adviser agrees that it will
furnish currently to the Subadviser all information with
reference to each Fund and the Trust that is reasonably
necessary to permit the Subadviser to carry out its
responsibilities under this Agreement, and the parties agree
that they will from time to time consult and make
appropriate arrangements as to specific information that is
required under this paragraph and the frequency and
manner with which it shall be supplied.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Investment Adviser will
furnish to Subadviser procedures consistent with the Trust's
contract with each Fund's custodian from time to time
(the Custodian), and reasonably satisfactory to Subadviser,
for consummation of portfolio transactions for each
Fund by payment to or delivery by the Custodian of all cash
and/or securities or other investments due to or from the
Fund, and Subadviser shall not have possession or custody
thereof or any responsibility or liability with respect to
such custody.  Upon giving proper instructions to the Custodian,
Subadviser shall have no responsibility or liability
with respect to custodial arrangements or the acts, omissions or
other conduct of the Custodian.
       11.	The Subadviser and its directors, officers,
stockholders, employees and agents shall not be liable
for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss
suffered by the Investment Adviser or the Trust in
connection with any matters to which this Agreement relates or
for any other act or omission in the performance by
the Subadviser of its duties under this Agreement except that
nothing herein contained shall be construed to protect
the Subadviser against any liability by reason of the
Subadviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence
in the performance of its duties or by reckless disregard of its
obligations or duties under this Agreement.
       12.	If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
or made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule
or otherwise, the remainder of the Agreement shall not be
affected thereby.  Except to the extent governed by federal
law including the 1940 Act, this Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Delaware, without applying the principles of conflicts
of law thereunder.
       13.	No provision of this Agreement may be changed,
discharged or terminated orally, but only by an
instrument in writing signed by the party against which
enforcement of the change, discharge or termination is
sought.  No amendment of this Agreement shall be effective with
respect to the Trust until approved as required by
applicable law.
       14.	Any notice to be given hereunder may be given by
personal notification or by facsimile
transmission, to the party specified at the address stated

SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
BETWEEN ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC
AND RIVER ROAD ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC
      SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (the Agreement) made
this 30th day of June, 2014 by and between ASTON ASSET
MANAGEMENT, LLC (hereinafter referred to as the Investment"
"7167","Adviser) and RIVER ROAD ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC (hereinafter
referred to as the Subadviser), which Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall
constitute but one instrument.
W I T N E S S E T H:
      WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser has been retained by Aston
Funds, a Delaware statutory trust (the Trust), a registered
management investment company under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act) to provide investment
advisory services to the Trust with respect to certain series of
the Trust set forth in Schedule A hereto as may be amended from
time to time (hereinafter referred to as a Fund and
collectively, the Funds of the Trust);
      WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser wishes to enter into a
contract with the Subadviser to provide research, analysis,
advice and recommendations with respect to the purchase and sale
of securities, and make investment commitments with respect to
such portion of the Funds' assets as shall be allocated to the
Subadviser by the Investment Adviser from time to time (the
Allocated Assets), subject to oversight by the Trustees of the
Trust and the supervision of the Investment Adviser.
      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein contained, and intending to be bound, the parties agree
as follows:
      1.	In accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement
between the Trust and the Investment Adviser (Investment"
"7168","Advisory Agreement) with respect to the Funds, the Investment
Adviser hereby appoints the Subadviser to act as subadviser with
respect to the Allocated Assets for the period and on the terms
set forth in this Agreement. The Subadviser accepts such
appointment and agrees to render the services set forth herein,
for the compensation provided herein.
      2.	As compensation for the services enumerated herein,
the Investment Adviser will pay the Subadviser a fee with
respect to the Allocated Assets, which shall be calculated and
payable monthly in arrears based on the average daily net assets
of the Fund, in an amount equal to 50% of the positive
difference, if any, of (x) the advisory fee payable to the
Investment Adviser with respect to the Allocated Assets of the
Fund (before reduction of the fee payable to Subadviser) minus
(y) the sum of: (i) any investment advisory fees waived by the
Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense limitation or
reimbursement agreement with the Fund, (ii) any reimbursement of
expenses by the Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense
limitation or reimbursement agreement with the Fund, and (iii)
any payments made by the Investment Adviser to third parties
that provide distribution, shareholder services or similar
services on behalf of the Fund.  If the foregoing calculation
results in a negative amount, such amount shall be payable by
the Subadviser within 30 days of receipt of notice from the
Investment Adviser, which notice shall include the basis for the
calculation.
      For the purposes of this Agreement, a Fund's net assets
shall be determined as provided in the Fund's then-current
Prospectus (as used herein this term includes the related
Statement of Additional Information).
      If this Agreement shall become effective subsequent to the
first day of a month, or shall terminate before the last day of
a month, the Subadviser's compensation for such fraction of the
month shall be prorated based on the number of calendar days of
such month during which the Agreement is effective.
      3.	This Agreement shall become effective with respect to
a Fund as of the date set forth opposite the Fund's name as set
forth on Schedule A hereto (the Effective Date), provided that
it has been approved by the Trustees of the Trust in accordance
with the provisions of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder
and, if so required by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, by
the shareholders of the Fund in accordance with the requirements
of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
      4.	This Agreement shall continue in effect for the
initial term set forth in Schedule A.  It shall be renewed
automatically thereafter with respect to a Fund by the
Investment Adviser and the Subadviser for successive periods not
exceeding one year, if and only if such renewal and continuance
is specifically approved at least annually by the Board of
Trustees of the Trust or by a vote of the majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund as prescribed by the
1940 Act and provided further that such continuance is approved
at least annually thereafter by a vote of a majority of the
Trust's Trustees, who are not parties to such Agreement or
interested persons of such a party, cast in person at a meeting
called for the purpose of voting on such approval.  This
Agreement will terminate with respect to a Fund without the
payment of any penalty upon termination of the Investment
Advisory Agreement relating to a Fund by either party thereto
(accompanied by simultaneous notice to the Subadviser) or upon
ten days' written notice to the Subadviser that the Trustees of
the Trust, the Investment Adviser or the shareholders by vote of
a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, as
provided by the 1940 Act, have terminated this Agreement.  This
Agreement may also be terminated by the Subadviser with respect
to a Fund without penalty upon sixty days' written notice to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust.
      This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect
to a Fund in the event of its assignment or, upon notice thereof
to the Subadviser, the assignment of the Investment Advisory
Agreement, unless its continuation thereafter is approved by the
Board of Trustees of the Trust and the shareholders of the Fund
if so required by the 1940 Act (in each case as the term
assignment is defined in Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act,
subject to such exemptions as may be granted by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) by any rule, regulation, order
or interpretive guidance).
      5.	Subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the supervision of the Investment Adviser, the
Subadviser will provide an investment program for the Allocated
Assets, including investment research and management with
respect to securities and investments, including cash and cash
equivalents, and will determine from time to time what
securities and other investments will be purchased, retained or
sold.  The Subadviser will provide the services under this
Agreement in accordance with each Fund's investment objective,
policies and restrictions as stated in the Prospectus, as
provided to the Subadviser by the Investment Adviser.  The
Subadviser further agrees that, in all matters relating to the
performance of this Agreement, it:
            (a)	shall act in conformity with the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and currently effective
registration statements under the 1940 Act and the Securities
Act of 1933 and any amendments or supplements thereto (the
Registration Statements) and with the written policies,
procedures and guidelines of each Fund, and written instructions
and directions of the Trustees of the Trust and shall comply
with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 and the rules thereunder, and all other
applicable federal and state laws and regulations.  The Trust
agrees to provide Subadviser with copies of the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws, Registration Statements, written
policies, procedures and guidelines, and written instructions
and directions of the Trustees, and any amendments or
supplements to any of them at, or, if practicable, before the
time such materials, instructions or directives become
effective;
            (b)	will pay expenses incurred by it in connection
with its activities under this Agreement other than the cost of
securities and other investments (including brokerage
commissions and other transaction changes, if any) purchased for
each Fund, provided that the Subadviser will not pay for or
provide a credit with respect to any research provided to it in
accordance with Section 5(c);
            (c)	will place orders pursuant to its investment
determinations for each Fund either directly with any broker or
dealer, or with the issuer.  In placing orders with brokers or
dealers, the Subadviser will attempt to obtain the best overall
price and the most favorable execution of its orders.  Subject
to policies established by the Trustees of the Trust and
communicated to the Subadviser, it is understood that the
Subadviser will not be deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to
have breached a fiduciary duty to the Trust or in respect of a
Fund, or be in breach of any obligation owing to the Investment
Adviser or the Trust or in respect of a Fund under this
Agreement, or otherwise, solely by reason of its having caused
the Fund to pay a member of a securities exchange, a broker or a
dealer a commission for effecting a securities transaction for
the Fund in excess of the amount of commission another member of
an exchange, broker or dealer would have charged if the
Subadviser determines in good faith that the commission paid was
reasonable in relation to the brokerage or research services (as
those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and interpretive guidance issued by the SEC
thereunder) provided by such member, broker or dealer, viewed in
terms of that particular transaction or the Subadviser's overall
responsibilities with respect to the accounts, including the
Fund, as to which it exercises investment discretion;
            (d)	will review the daily valuation of securities
comprising the Allocated Assets of each Fund as obtained on a
daily basis by the Fund's administrator and furnished by it to
Subadviser, and will promptly notify the Trust and the
Investment Adviser if the Subadviser believes that any such
valuations may not properly reflect the market value of any
securities owned by the Fund, provided, however, that the
Subadviser is not required by this sub-paragraph to obtain
valuations of any such securities from brokers or dealers or
otherwise, or to otherwise independently verify valuations of
any such securities;
            (e)	unless otherwise instructed, will be responsible
for voting all proxies of each Fund in accordance with the Proxy
Voting Policies and Guidelines of Subadviser (the Proxy"
"7169","Policy), provided that such Proxy Policy and any amendments
thereto are furnished to the Trust;
            (f)	will attend regular business and investment-
related meetings with the Trust's Board of Trustees and the
Investment Adviser if requested to do so by the Trust and/or the
Investment Adviser, and at its expense, shall supply the Board,
the officers of the Trust, and the Investment Adviser with all
information and reports reasonably required by them and
reasonably available to the Subadviser relating to the services
provided by the Subadviser hereunder; and
            (g)	will maintain books and records with respect to
the securities transactions for the Allocated Assets of each
Fund and proxy voting record for the Allocated Assets of the
Fund, furnish to the Investment Adviser and the Trust's Board of
Trustees such periodic and special reports as they may request
with respect to the Fund, and provide in advance to the
Investment Adviser all of the Subadviser's reports to the
Trust's Board of Trustees for examination and review within a
reasonable time prior to the Trust's Board meetings.
      6.	The Investment Adviser or its affiliates may, from
time to time, engage other subadvisers to advise other series of
the Trust (or portions thereof) or other registered investment
companies (or series or portions thereof) that may be deemed to
be under common control (each a Sub-Advised Fund).  The
Subadviser agrees that it will not consult with any other
unaffiliated subadviser engaged by the Investment Adviser or its
affiliates with respect to transactions in securities or other
assets concerning a Fund or another Sub-Advised Fund, except to
the extent permitted by the rules under the 1940 Act that permit
certain transactions with a subadviser or its affiliates.
      7.	Subadviser agrees with respect to the services
provided to each Fund that it:
            (a)	will promptly communicate to the Investment
Adviser such information relating to Fund transactions as the
officers and Trustees of the Trust may reasonably request and as
communicated to the Subadviser; and
            (b)	will treat confidentially and as proprietary
information of the Trust all records and other information
relative to each Fund and its prior, present or potential
shareholders, and will not use such records and information for
any purpose other than performance of its responsibilities and
duties hereunder (except after prior notification to and
approval in writing by the Trust, which approval may not be
withheld where Subadviser is advised by counsel that the
Subadviser may be exposed to civil or criminal contempt or other
proceedings for failure to comply, when requested to divulge
such information by duly constituted authorities, or when so
requested by the Trust).
      8.	In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, Subadviser acknowledges that all records
which it maintains for the Trust are the property of the Trust
and agrees to surrender promptly to the Trust any of such
records upon the Trust's request, provided, that Subadviser may
retain copies thereof at its own expense.  Subadviser further
agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2
under the 1940 Act the records required to be maintained by Rule
31a-1 under the 1940 Act relating to transactions placed by
Subadviser for the Fund.  Subadviser further agrees to maintain
each Fund's proxy voting record with respect to the Allocated
Assets in a form mutually agreeable between the parties and
which contains the information required by Form N-PX under the
1940 Act.
      9.	It is expressly understood and agreed that the
services to be rendered by the Subadviser to the Investment
Adviser under the provisions of this Agreement are not to be
deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser shall be free to
provide similar or different services to others so long as its
ability to provide the services provided for in this Agreement
shall not be materially impaired thereby.  In addition, but
without limiting any separate agreement between the Subadviser
and the Investment Adviser to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any director,
officer, or employee of the Subadviser who may also be a
Trustee, officer, or employee of the Trust, to engage in any
other business or to devote his or her time and attention in
part to the management or other aspects of any other business,
whether of a similar nature or a dissimilar nature.
      10.	The Investment Adviser agrees that it will furnish
currently to the Subadviser all information with reference to
each Fund and the Trust that is reasonably necessary to permit
the Subadviser to carry out its responsibilities under this
Agreement, and the parties agree that they will from time to
time consult and make appropriate arrangements as to specific
information that is required under this paragraph and the
frequency and manner with which it shall be supplied.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Investment Adviser
will furnish to Subadviser procedures consistent with the
Trust's contract with each Fund's custodian from time to time
(the Custodian), and reasonably satisfactory to Subadviser,
for consummation of portfolio transactions for each Fund by
payment to or delivery by the Custodian of all cash and/or
securities or other investments due to or from the Fund, and
Subadviser shall not have possession or custody thereof or any
responsibility or liability with respect to such custody.  Upon
giving proper instructions to the Custodian, Subadviser shall
have no responsibility or liability with respect to custodial
arrangements or the acts, omissions or other conduct of the
Custodian.
      11.	The Subadviser and its directors, officers,
stockholders, employees and agents shall not be liable for any
error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by
the Investment Adviser or the Trust in connection with any
matters to which this Agreement relates or for any other act or
omission in the performance by the Subadviser of its duties
under this Agreement except that nothing herein contained shall
be construed to protect the Subadviser against any liability by
reason of the Subadviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or
gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reckless
disregard of its obligations or duties under this Agreement.
      12.	If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or
made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or otherwise,
the remainder of the Agreement shall not be affected thereby.
Except to the extent governed by federal law including the 1940
Act, this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
applying the principles of conflicts of law thereunder.
      13.	No provision of this Agreement may be changed,
discharged or terminated orally, but only by an instrument in
writing signed by the party against which enforcement of the
change, discharge or termination is sought.  No amendment of
this Agreement shall be effective with respect to the Trust
until approved as required by applicable law.

SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
BETWEEN ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC
AND RIVER ROAD ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC
      SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (the Agreement) made
this 30th day of June, 2014 by and between ASTON ASSET
MANAGEMENT, LLC (hereinafter referred to as the Investment"
"7170","Adviser) and RIVER ROAD ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC (hereinafter
referred to as the Subadviser), which Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall
constitute but one instrument.
W I T N E S S E T H:
      WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser has been retained by Aston
Funds, a Delaware statutory trust (the Trust), a registered
management investment company under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), to provide investment
advisory services to the Trust with respect to certain series of
the Trust set forth in Schedule A hereto as may be amended from
time to time (hereinafter referred to as a Fund and,
collectively, the Funds of the Trust);
      WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser wishes to enter into a
contract with the Subadviser to provide research, analysis,
advice and recommendations with respect to the purchase and sale
of securities, and make investment commitments with respect to
such portion of the Funds' assets as shall be allocated to the
Subadviser by the Investment Adviser from time to time (the
Allocated Assets), subject to oversight by the Trustees of the
Trust and the supervision of the Investment Adviser.
      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein contained, and intending to be bound, the parties agree
as follows:
      1.	In accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement
between the Trust and the Investment Adviser (Investment"
"7171","Advisory Agreement) with respect to the Funds, the Investment
Adviser hereby appoints the Subadviser to act as subadviser with
respect to the Allocated Assets for the period and on the terms
set forth in this Agreement. The Subadviser accepts such
appointment and agrees to render the services set forth herein,
for the compensation provided herein.
      2.	As compensation for the services enumerated herein,
the Investment Adviser will pay the Subadviser a fee with
respect to the Allocated Assets, which shall be calculated and
payable monthly in arrears based on the average daily net assets
of the Fund, in an amount equal to 50% of the positive
difference, if any, of (x) the advisory fee payable to the
Investment Adviser with respect to the Allocated Assets of the
Fund (before reduction of the fee payable to Subadviser) minus
(y) the sum of: (i) any investment advisory fees waived by the
Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense limitation or
reimbursement agreement with the Fund, (ii) any reimbursement of
expenses by the Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense
limitation or reimbursement agreement with the Fund, and (iii)
any payments made by the Investment Adviser to third parties
that provide distribution, shareholder services or similar
services on behalf of the Fund; provided that, if average daily
net assets for a particular calendar month exceed $250 million,
the Subadviser's compensation with respect to such month shall
equal 50% of the positive difference, if any, of (x) the
advisory fee payable to the Investment Adviser with respect to
the Allocated Assets of the Fund (before reduction of the fee
payable to Subadviser) minus (y) the sum of: (i) any investment
advisory fees waived by the Investment Adviser pursuant to an
expense limitation or reimbursement agreement with the Fund and
(ii) any reimbursement of expenses by the Investment Adviser
pursuant to an expense limitation or reimbursement agreement
with the Fund.  If the foregoing calculation results in a
negative amount, such amount shall be payable by the Subadviser
within 30 days of receipt of notice from the Investment Adviser,
which notice shall include the basis for the calculation.
      For the purposes of this Agreement, a Fund's net assets
shall be determined as provided in the Fund's then-current
Prospectus (as used herein, this term includes the related
Statement of Additional Information).
      If this Agreement shall become effective subsequent to the
first day of a month, or shall terminate before the last day of
a month, the Subadviser's compensation for such fraction of the
month shall be prorated based on the number of calendar days of
such month during which the Agreement is effective.
      3.	This Agreement shall become effective with respect to
a Fund as of the date set forth opposite the Fund's name as set
forth on Schedule A hereto (the Effective Date), provided that
it has been approved by the Trustees of the Trust in accordance
with the provisions of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder
and, if so required by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, by
the shareholders of the Fund in accordance with the requirements
of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
      4.	This Agreement shall continue in effect for the
initial term set forth in Schedule A.  It shall be renewed
automatically thereafter with respect to a Fund by the
Investment Adviser and the Subadviser for successive periods not
exceeding one year, if and only if such renewal and continuance
is specifically approved at least annually by the Board of
Trustees of the Trust or by a vote of the majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund as prescribed by the
1940 Act and provided further that such continuance is approved
at least annually thereafter by a vote of a majority of the
Trust's Trustees, who are not parties to such Agreement or
interested persons of such a party, cast in person at a meeting
called for the purpose of voting on such approval.  This
Agreement will terminate with respect to a Fund without the
payment of any penalty upon termination of the Investment
Advisory Agreement relating to the Fund by either party thereto
(accompanied by simultaneous notice to the Subadviser) or upon
sixty days' written notice to the Subadviser that the Trustees
of the Trust, the Investment Adviser or the shareholders by vote
of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund,
as provided by the 1940 Act, have terminated this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated
upon less than sixty days' notice to the Subadviser upon a
material breach of this Agreement or if the Trustees determine
that other circumstances have, or likely will have, a material
adverse effect on the Subadviser's abilities to perform its
obligations hereunder, including without limitation,
notification of the departure of a portfolio manager of the Fund
or other key personnel change.  This Agreement may also be
terminated by the Subadviser with respect to a Fund without
penalty upon sixty days' written notice to the Investment
Adviser and the Trust.
      This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect
to a Fund in the event of its assignment or, upon notice thereof
to the Subadviser, the assignment of the Investment Advisory
Agreement, unless its continuation thereafter is approved by the
Board of Trustees of the Trust and the shareholders of the Fund
if so required by the 1940 Act (in each case as the term
assignment is defined in Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act,
subject to such exemptions as may be granted by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) by any rule, regulation, order
or interpretive guidance).
      5.	Subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the Investment Adviser, the Subadviser will
provide an investment program for the Allocated Assets,
including investment research and management with respect to
securities and investments, including cash and cash equivalents,
and will determine from time to time what securities and other
investments will be purchased, retained or sold.  The Subadviser
will provide the services under this Agreement in accordance
with each Fund's investment objective, policies and restrictions
as stated in the Prospectus, as provided to the Subadviser by
the Investment Adviser.  The Subadviser further agrees that, in
all matters relating to the performance of this Agreement, it:
            (a)	shall act in conformity with the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and currently effective
registration statements under the 1940 Act and the Securities
Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act) and any amendments or supplements
thereto (the Registration Statements) and with the written
policies, procedures and guidelines of each Fund, and written
instructions and directions of the Trustees of the Trust and
shall comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act) and the
rules thereunder, and all other applicable federal and state
laws and regulations.  The Trust agrees to provide Subadviser
with copies of the Trust's Declaration of Trust, By-Laws,
Registration Statements, written policies, procedures and
guidelines, and written instructions and directions of the
Trustees, and any amendments or supplements to any of them at,
or, if practicable, before the time such materials, instructions
or directives become effective;
            (b)	will maintain at all times during the term of
this Agreement, in full force and effect, insurance, including
without limitation errors and omissions insurance, with
reputable insurance carriers, in such amounts, covering  such
risks and liabilities, and with such deductibles and self-
insurance as are consistent with customary industry practice;
            (c)	will pay expenses incurred by it in connection
with its activities under this Agreement other than the cost of
securities and other investments (including brokerage
commissions and other transaction changes, if any) purchased for
each Fund, provided that the Subadviser will not pay for or
provide a credit with respect to any research provided to it in
accordance with Section 5(d);
            (d)	will place orders pursuant to its investment
determinations for the Allocated Assets either directly with any
broker or dealer, or with the issuer.  In placing orders with
brokers or dealers, the Subadviser will attempt to obtain the
best overall price and the most favorable execution of its
orders.  Subject to policies established by the Trustees of the
Trust and communicated to the Subadviser, it is understood that
the Subadviser will not be deemed to have acted unlawfully, or
to have breached a fiduciary duty to the Trust or in respect of
a Fund, or be in breach of any obligation owing to the
Investment Adviser or the Trust or in respect of a Fund under
this Agreement, or otherwise, solely by reason of its having
caused the Fund to pay a member of a securities exchange, a
broker or a dealer a commission for effecting a securities
transaction for the Fund in excess of the amount of commission
another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have
charged if the Subadviser determines in good faith that the
commission paid was reasonable in relation to the brokerage or
research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and interpretive guidance
issued by the SEC thereunder) provided by such member, broker or
dealer, viewed in terms of that particular transaction or the
Subadviser's overall responsibilities with respect to the
accounts, including the Fund, as to which it exercises
investment discretion;
            (e)	will review the daily valuation of securities
comprising the Allocated Assets of each Fund as obtained on a
daily basis by the Fund's administrator and furnished by it to
Subadviser, and will promptly notify the Trust and the
Investment Adviser if the Subadviser believes that any such
valuations may not properly reflect the market value of any
securities owned by the Fund, provided, however, that the
Subadviser is not required by this subparagraph to obtain
valuations of any such securities from brokers or dealers or
otherwise, or to otherwise independently verify valuations of
any such securities;
            (f)	unless otherwise instructed, will be responsible
for voting all proxies of the Allocated Assets in accordance
with the Proxy Voting Policies and Guidelines of Subadviser (the
Proxy Policy), provided that such Proxy Policy and any
amendments thereto are furnished to the Trust;
            (g)	will attend regular business and investment-
related meetings with the Trust's Board of Trustees and the
Investment Adviser if requested to do so by the Trust and/or the
Investment Adviser, and at its expense, shall supply the Board,
the officers of the Trust, and the Investment Adviser with all
information and reports reasonably required by them and
reasonably available to the Subadviser relating to the services
provided by the Subadviser hereunder;
            (h)	will maintain books and records with respect to
the securities transactions for the Allocated Assets of each
Fund and proxy voting record for the Allocated Assets of the
Fund, furnish to the Investment Adviser and the Trust's Board of
Trustees such periodic and special reports as they may request
with respect to the Fund, and provide in advance to the
Investment Adviser all of the Subadviser's reports to the
Trust's Board of Trustees for examination and review within a
reasonable time prior to the Trust's Board meetings; and
            (i)	will pay reasonable expenses incurred by the
Trust for any matters related to any transaction or event
relating to the Subadviser that is deemed to result in a change
of control of the Subadviser or otherwise result in the
assignment of the Sub-Investment Advisory Agreement under the
1940 Act.
      6.	The Investment Adviser or its affiliates may, from
time to time, engage other subadvisers to advise other series of
the Trust (or portions thereof) or other registered investment
companies (or series or portions thereof) that may be deemed to
be under common control (each a Sub-Advised Fund).  The
Subadviser agrees that it will not consult with any other
subadviser engaged by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates
with respect to transactions in securities or other assets
concerning a Fund or another Sub-Advised Fund, except to the
extent permitted by the rules under the 1940 Act that permit
certain transactions with a subadviser or its affiliates.
      7.	Subadviser agrees with respect to the services
provided to each Fund that:
            (a)	it will promptly communicate to the Investment
Adviser such information relating to Fund transactions as the
officers and Trustees of the Trust may reasonably request and as
communicated to the Subadviser; and
            (b)	it will treat confidentially and as proprietary
information of the Trust all records and other information
relative to each Fund and its prior, present or potential
shareholders (Confidential Information), will comply at all
times with all applicable laws and regulations relating to the
confidentiality of nonpublic personal information including
the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or other federal or state privacy
laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and will not
use such Confidential Information for any purpose other than the
performance of its responsibilities and duties hereunder (except
after prior notification to and approval in writing by the
Trust, which approval may not be withheld where Subadviser is
advised by counsel that the Subadviser may be exposed to civil
or criminal contempt or other proceedings for failure to comply,
when requested to divulge such information by duly constituted
authorities, or when so requested by the Trust).
      8.	Each party represents and warrants to the other party
that the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
is within its powers and have been duly authorized by all
necessary actions of its directors or members, and no action by,
or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency
or official is required on the part of either party for
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and the
execution, delivery and performance by either party of this
Agreement do not contravene or constitute a violation of, or a
material default under, (i) any provision of applicable law,
rule or regulation, (ii) such party's governing instruments, or
(iii) any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or
other instrument binding upon such party.
      9.	In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, Subadviser acknowledges that all records
which it maintains for the Trust are the property of the Trust
and agrees to surrender promptly to the Trust any of such
records upon the Trust's request, provided that Subadviser may
retain copies thereof at its own expense.  Subadviser further
agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2
under the 1940 Act the records required to be maintained by Rule
31a-1 under the 1940 Act relating to transactions placed by
Subadviser for the Fund.  Subadviser further agrees to maintain
each Fund's proxy voting record with respect to the Allocated
Assets in a form mutually agreeable between the parties and
which contains the information required by Form N-PX under the
1940 Act.
      10.	It is expressly understood and agreed that the
services to be rendered by the Subadviser to the Investment
Adviser under the provisions of this Agreement are not to be
deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser shall be free to
provide similar or different services to others so long as its
ability to provide the services provided for in this Agreement
shall not be materially impaired thereby.  In addition, but
without limiting any separate agreement between the Subadviser
and the Investment Adviser to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any director,
officer, or employee of the Subadviser who may also be a
Trustee, officer, or employee of the Trust, to engage in any
other business or to devote his or her time and attention in
part to the management or other aspects of any other business,
whether of a similar nature or a dissimilar nature.
      11.	The Investment Adviser agrees that it will furnish
currently to the Subadviser all information with reference to
each Fund and the Trust that is reasonably necessary to permit
the Subadviser to carry out its responsibilities under this
Agreement, and the parties agree that they will from time to
time consult and make appropriate arrangements as to specific
information that is required under this paragraph and the
frequency and manner with which it shall be supplied.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Investment Adviser
will furnish to Subadviser procedures consistent with the
Trust's contract with each Fund's custodian from time to time
(the Custodian), and reasonably satisfactory to Subadviser,
for consummation of portfolio transactions for each Fund by
payment to or delivery by the Custodian of all cash and/or
securities or other investments due to or from the Fund, and
Subadviser shall not have possession or custody thereof or any
responsibility or liability with respect to such custody.  Upon
giving proper instructions to the Custodian, Subadviser shall
have no responsibility or liability with respect to custodial
arrangements or the acts, omissions or other conduct of the
Custodian.
      12.	The Subadviser and its directors, officers,
stockholders, employees and agents shall not be liable for any
error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by
the Investment Adviser or the Trust in connection with any
matters to which this Agreement relates or for any other act or
omission in the performance by the Subadviser of its duties
under this Agreement except that nothing herein contained shall
be construed to protect the Subadviser against any liability by
reason of the Subadviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or
gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reckless
disregard of its obligations or duties under this Agreement.
      13.	Each party shall indemnify and hold harmless the other
party and its respective control persons (as described in
Section 15 of the 1933 Act) and their respective directors,
stockholders, members and employees (collectively,
Indemnitees) against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses (including reasonable legal and other
expenses of investigating or defending any alleged loss, claim,
damages or liabilities) to which any of the Indemnitees may
become subject under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or the Advisers
Act, or under any other statute, at common law or otherwise,
arising out of or based on (i) any willful misfeasance, bad
faith, or gross negligence of the other party in the performance
of, or reckless disregard of, any of its duties or obligations
hereunder, or (ii) any material breach of this Agreement by the
other party.
      14.	If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or
made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or otherwise,
the remainder of the Agreement shall not be affected thereby.
Except to the extent governed by federal law including the 1940
Act, this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
applying the principles of conflicts of law thereunder.
      15.	No provision of this Agreement may be changed,
discharged or terminated orally, but only by an instrument in
writing signed by the party against which enforcement of the
change, discharge or termination is sought.  No amendment of
this Agreement shall be effective with respect to the Trust
until approved as required by applicable law.
      16.	Any notice to be given hereunder may be given by
personal notification or by facsimile transmission, to the party

SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
BETWEEN ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC
AND RIVER ROAD ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC
      SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (the Agreement) made
this 30th day of June, 2014 by and between ASTON ASSET
MANAGEMENT, LLC (hereinafter referred to as the Investment"
"7172","Adviser) and RIVER ROAD ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC (hereinafter
referred to as the Subadviser), which Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall
constitute but one instrument.
W I T N E S S E T H:
      WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser has been retained by Aston
Funds, a Delaware statutory trust (the Trust), a registered
management investment company under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act) to provide investment
advisory services to the Trust with respect to certain series of
the Trust set forth in Schedule A hereto as may be amended from
time to time (hereinafter referred to as a Fund and
collectively, the Funds of the Trust);
      WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser wishes to enter into a
contract with the Subadviser to provide research, analysis,
advice and recommendations with respect to the purchase and sale
of securities, and make investment commitments with respect to
such portion of the Funds' assets as shall be allocated to the
Subadviser by the Investment Adviser from time to time (the
Allocated Assets), subject to oversight by the Trustees of the
Trust and the supervision of the Investment Adviser.
      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein contained, and intending to be bound, the parties agree
as follows:
      1.	In accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement
between the Trust and the Investment Adviser (the Investment"
"7173","Advisory Agreement) with respect to the Funds, the Investment
Adviser hereby appoints the Subadviser to act as subadviser with
respect to the Allocated Assets for the period and on the terms
set forth in this Agreement. The Subadviser accepts such
appointment and agrees to render the services set forth herein,
for the compensation provided herein.
      2.	As compensation for the services enumerated herein,
the Investment Adviser will pay the Subadviser a fee with
respect to the Allocated Assets, which shall be calculated and
payable monthly in arrears based on the average daily net assets
of the Fund, in an amount equal to 60% of the positive
difference, if any, of (x) the advisory fee payable to the
Investment Adviser with respect to the Allocated Assets of the
Fund (before reduction of the fee payable to Subadviser) minus
(y) the sum of: (i) any investment advisory fees waived by the
Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense limitation or
reimbursement agreement with the Fund, (ii) any reimbursement of
expenses by the Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense
limitation or reimbursement agreement with the Fund, and (iii)
any payments made by the Investment Adviser to third parties
that provide distribution, shareholder services or similar
services on behalf of the Fund.  If the foregoing calculation
results in a negative amount, such amount shall be payable by
the Subadviser within 30 days of receipt of notice from the
Investment Adviser, which notice shall include the basis for the
calculation.
      For the purposes of this Agreement, a Fund's net assets
shall be determined as provided in the Fund's then-current
Prospectus (as used herein this term includes the related
Statement of Additional Information).
      If this Agreement shall become effective subsequent to the
first day of a month, or shall terminate before the last day of
a month, the Subadviser's compensation for such fraction of the
month shall be prorated based on the number of calendar days of
such month during which the Agreement is effective.
      3.	This Agreement shall become effective with respect to
a Fund as of the date set forth opposite the Fund's name as set
forth on Schedule A hereto (the Effective Date), provided that
it has been approved by the Trustees of the Trust in accordance
with the provisions of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder
and, if so required by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, by
the shareholders of the Fund in accordance with the requirements
of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
      4.	This Agreement shall continue in effect for the
initial term set forth in Schedule A.  It shall be renewed
automatically thereafter with respect to a Fund by the
Investment Adviser and the Subadviser for successive periods not
exceeding one year, if and only if such renewal and continuance
is specifically approved at least annually by the Board of
Trustees of the Trust or by a vote of the majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund as prescribed by the
1940 Act and provided further that such continuance is approved
at least annually thereafter by a vote of a majority of the
Trust's Trustees, who are not parties to such Agreement or
interested persons of such a party, cast in person at a meeting
called for the purpose of voting on such approval.  This
Agreement will terminate with respect to a Fund without the
payment of any penalty upon termination of the Investment
Advisory Agreement relating to a Fund by either party thereto
(accompanied by simultaneous notice to the Subadviser) or upon
sixty days' written notice to the Subadviser that the Trustees
of the Trust, the Investment Adviser or the shareholders by vote
of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund,
as provided by the 1940 Act, have terminated this Agreement.
This Agreement may also be terminated by the Subadviser with
respect to a Fund without penalty upon sixty days' written
notice to the Investment Adviser and the Trust.
      This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect
to a Fund in the event of its assignment or, upon notice thereof
to the Subadviser, the assignment of the Investment Advisory
Agreement, unless its continuation thereafter is approved by the
Board of Trustees of the Trust and the shareholders of the Fund
if so required by the 1940 Act (in each case as the term
assignment is defined in Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act,
subject to such exemptions as may be granted by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) by any rule, regulation, order
or interpretive guidance).
      5.	Subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the Investment Adviser, the Subadviser will
provide an investment program for the Allocated Assets,
including investment research and management with respect to
securities and investments, including cash and cash equivalents,
and will determine from time to time what securities and other
investments will be purchased, retained or sold.  The Subadviser
will provide the services under this Agreement in accordance
with each Fund's investment objective, policies and restrictions
as stated in the Prospectus, as provided to the Subadviser by
the Investment Adviser.  The Subadviser further agrees that, in
all matters relating to the performance of this Agreement, it:
            (a)	shall act in conformity with the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and currently effective
registration statements under the 1940 Act and the Securities
Act of 1933 and any amendments or supplements thereto (the
Registration Statements) and with the written policies,
procedures and guidelines of each Fund, and written instructions
and directions of the Trustees of the Trust and shall comply
with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 and the rules thereunder, and all other
applicable federal and state laws and regulations.  The Trust
agrees to provide Subadviser with copies of the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws, Registration Statements, written
policies, procedures and guidelines, and written instructions
and directions of the Trustees, and any amendments or
supplements to any of them at, or, if practicable, before the
time such materials, instructions or directives become
effective;
            (b)	will pay expenses incurred by it in connection
with its activities under this Agreement other than the cost of
securities and other investments (including brokerage
commissions and other transaction changes, if any) purchased for
each Fund, provided that the Subadviser will not pay for or
provide a credit with respect to any research provided to it in
accordance with Section 5(c);
            (c)	will place orders pursuant to its investment
determinations for the Allocated Assets either directly with any
broker or dealer, or with the issuer.  In placing orders with
brokers or dealers, the Subadviser will attempt to obtain the
best overall price and the most favorable execution of its
orders.  Subject to policies established by the Trustees of the
Trust and communicated to the Subadviser, it is understood that
the Subadviser will not be deemed to have acted unlawfully, or
to have breached a fiduciary duty to the Trust or in respect of
a Fund, or be in breach of any obligation owing to the
Investment Adviser or the Trust or in respect of a Fund under
this Agreement, or otherwise, solely by reason of its having
caused the Fund to pay a member of a securities exchange, a
broker or a dealer a commission for effecting a securities
transaction for the Fund in excess of the amount of commission
another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have
charged if the Subadviser determines in good faith that the
commission paid was reasonable in relation to the brokerage or
research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and interpretive guidance
issued by the SEC thereunder) provided by such member, broker or
dealer, viewed in terms of that particular transaction or the
Subadviser's overall responsibilities with respect to the
accounts, including the Fund, as to which it exercises
investment discretion;
            (d)	will review the daily valuation of securities
comprising the Allocated Assets of each Fund as obtained on a
daily basis by the Fund's administrator and furnished by it to
Subadviser, and will promptly notify the Trust and the
Investment Adviser if the Subadviser believes that any such
valuations may not properly reflect the market value of any
securities owned by the Fund, provided, however, that the
Subadviser is not required by this sub-paragraph to obtain
valuations of any such securities from brokers or dealers or
otherwise, or to otherwise independently verify valuations of
any such securities;
            (e)	unless otherwise instructed, will be responsible
for voting all proxies of the Allocated Assets in accordance
with the Proxy Voting Policies and Guidelines of Subadviser (the
Proxy Policy), provided that such Proxy Policy and any
amendments thereto are furnished to the Trust;
            (f)	will attend regular business and investment-
related meetings with the Trust's Board of Trustees and the
Investment Adviser if requested to do so by the Trust and/or the
Investment Adviser, and at its expense, shall supply the Board,
the officers of the Trust, and the Investment Adviser with all
information and reports reasonably required by them and
reasonably available to the Subadviser relating to the services
provided by the Subadviser hereunder;
            (g)	will maintain books and records with respect to
the securities transactions for the Allocated Assets of each
Fund and proxy voting record for the Allocated Assets of the
Fund, furnish to the Investment Adviser and the Trust's Board of
Trustees such periodic and special reports as they may request
with respect to the Fund, and provide in advance to the
Investment Adviser all of the Subadviser's reports to the
Trust's Board of Trustees for examination and review within a
reasonable time prior to the Trust's Board meetings; and
            (h)	will pay reasonable expenses incurred by the
Trust for any matters related to any transaction or event
relating to the Subadviser that is deemed to result in a change
of control of the Subadviser or otherwise result in the
assignment of the Sub-Investment Advisory Agreement under the
1940 Act.
      6.	The Investment Adviser or its affiliates may, from
time to time, engage other subadvisers to advise other series of
the Trust (or portions thereof) or other registered investment
companies (or series or portions thereof) that may be deemed to
be under common control (each a Sub-Advised Fund).  The
Subadviser agrees that it will not consult with any other
subadviser engaged by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates
with respect to transactions in securities or other assets
concerning a Fund or another Sub-Advised Fund, except to the
extent permitted by the rules under the 1940 Act that permit
certain transactions with a subadviser or its affiliates.
      7.	Subadviser agrees with respect to the services
provided to each Fund that it:
            (a)	will promptly communicate to the Investment
Adviser such information relating to Fund transactions as the
officers and Trustees of the Trust may reasonably request and as
communicated to the Subadviser; and
            (b)	will treat confidentially and as proprietary
information of the Trust all records and other information
relative to each Fund and its prior, present or potential
shareholders, and will not use such records and information for
any purpose other than performance of its responsibilities and
duties hereunder (except after prior notification to and
approval in writing by the Trust, which approval may not be
withheld where Subadviser is advised by counsel that the
Subadviser may be exposed to civil or criminal contempt or other
proceedings for failure to comply, when requested to divulge
such information by duly constituted authorities, or when so
requested by the Trust).
      8.	In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, Subadviser acknowledges that all records
which it maintains for the Trust are the property of the Trust
and agrees to surrender promptly to the Trust any of such
records upon the Trust's request, provided, that Subadviser may
retain copies thereof at its own expense.  Subadviser further
agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2
under the 1940 Act the records required to be maintained by Rule
31a-1 under the 1940 Act relating to transactions placed by
Subadviser for the Fund.  Subadviser further agrees to maintain
each Fund's proxy voting record with respect to the Allocated
Assets in a form mutually agreeable between the parties and
which contains the information required by Form N-PX under the
1940 Act.
      9.	It is expressly understood and agreed that the
services to be rendered by the Subadviser to the Investment
Adviser under the provisions of this Agreement are not to be
deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser shall be free to
provide similar or different services to others so long as its
ability to provide the services provided for in this Agreement
shall not be materially impaired thereby.  In addition, but
without limiting any separate agreement between the Subadviser
and the Investment Adviser to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any director,
officer, or employee of the Subadviser who may also be a
Trustee, officer, or employee of the Trust, to engage in any
other business or to devote his or her time and attention in
part to the management or other aspects of any other business,
whether of a similar nature or a dissimilar nature.
      10.	The Investment Adviser agrees that it will furnish
currently to the Subadviser all information with reference to
each Fund and the Trust that is reasonably necessary to permit
the Subadviser to carry out its responsibilities under this
Agreement, and the parties agree that they will from time to
time consult and make appropriate arrangements as to specific
information that is required under this paragraph and the
frequency and manner with which it shall be supplied.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Investment Adviser
will furnish to Subadviser procedures consistent with the
Trust's contract with each Fund's custodian from time to time
(the Custodian), and reasonably satisfactory to Subadviser,
for consummation of portfolio transactions for each Fund by
payment to or delivery by the Custodian of all cash and/or
securities or other investments due to or from the Fund, and
Subadviser shall not have possession or custody thereof or any
responsibility or liability with respect to such custody.  Upon
giving proper instructions to the Custodian, Subadviser shall
have no responsibility or liability with respect to custodial
arrangements or the acts, omissions or other conduct of the
Custodian.
      11.	The Subadviser and its directors, officers,
stockholders, employees and agents shall not be liable for any
error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by
the Investment Adviser or the Trust in connection with any
matters to which this Agreement relates or for any other act or
omission in the performance by the Subadviser of its duties
under this Agreement except that nothing herein contained shall
be construed to protect the Subadviser against any liability by
reason of the Subadviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or
gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reckless
disregard of its obligations or duties under this Agreement.
      12.	If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or
made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or otherwise,
the remainder of the Agreement shall not be affected thereby.
Except to the extent governed by federal law including the 1940
Act, this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
applying the principles of conflicts of law thereunder.
      13.	No provision of this Agreement may be changed,
discharged or terminated orally, but only by an instrument in
writing signed by the party against which enforcement of the
change, discharge or termination is sought.  No amendment of
this Agreement shall be effective with respect to the Trust
until approved as required by applicable law.
      14.	Any notice to be given hereunder may be given by
personal notification or by facsimile transmission, to the party

SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
BETWEEN ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC
AND ANCHOR CAPITAL ADVISORS LLC
      SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (the Agreement) made
this 30th day of May, 2014 by and between ASTON ASSET
MANAGEMENT, LLC (hereinafter referred to as the Investment"
"7174","Adviser) and ANCHOR CAPITAL ADVISORS LLC (hereinafter referred
to as the Subadviser), which Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which together shall constitute but one
instrument.
W I T N E S S E T H:
      WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser has been retained by Aston
Funds, a Delaware statutory trust (the Trust), a registered
management investment company under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), to provide investment
advisory services to the Trust with respect to certain series of
the Trust set forth in Schedule A hereto as may be amended from
time to time (hereinafter referred to as a Fund and,
collectively, the Funds of the Trust);
      WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser wishes to enter into a
contract with the Subadviser to provide research, analysis,
advice and recommendations with respect to the purchase and sale
of securities, and make investment commitments with respect to
such portion of the Funds' assets as shall be allocated to the
Subadviser by the Investment Adviser from time to time (the
Allocated Assets), subject to oversight by the Trustees of the
Trust and the supervision of the Investment Adviser.
      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein contained, and intending to be bound, the parties agree
as follows:
      1.	In accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement
between the Trust and the Investment Adviser (Investment"
"7175","Advisory Agreement) with respect to the Funds, the Investment
Adviser hereby appoints the Subadviser to act as subadviser with
respect to the Allocated Assets for the period and on the terms
set forth in this Agreement. The Subadviser accepts such
appointment and agrees to render the services set forth herein,
for the compensation provided herein.
      2.	As compensation for the services enumerated herein,
the Investment Adviser will pay the Subadviser a fee with
respect to the Allocated Assets, which shall be calculated and
payable monthly in arrears based on the average daily net assets
of the Fund, in an amount equal to 50% of the positive
difference, if any, of (x) the advisory fee payable to the
Investment Adviser with respect to the Allocated Assets of the
Fund (before reduction of the fee payable to Subadviser) minus
(y) the sum of: (i) any investment advisory fees waived by the
Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense limitation or
reimbursement agreement with the Fund, (ii) any reimbursement of
expenses by the Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense
limitation or reimbursement agreement with the Fund, and (iii)
any payments made by the Investment Adviser to third parties
that provide distribution, shareholder services or similar
services on behalf of the Fund.  If the foregoing calculation
results in a negative amount, such amount shall be payable by
the Subadviser within 30 days of receipt of notice from the
Investment Adviser, which notice shall include the basis for the
calculation.
      For the purposes of this Agreement, a Fund's net assets
shall be determined as provided in the Fund's then-current
Prospectus (as used herein, this term includes the related
Statement of Additional Information).
      If this Agreement shall become effective subsequent to the
first day of a month, or shall terminate before the last day of
a month, the Subadviser's compensation for such fraction of the
month shall be prorated based on the number of calendar days of
such month during which the Agreement is effective.
      3.	This Agreement shall become effective with respect to
a Fund as of the date set forth opposite the Fund's name as set
forth on Schedule A hereto (the Effective Date), provided that
it has been approved by the Trustees of the Trust in accordance
with the provisions of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder
and, if so required by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, by
the shareholders of the Fund in accordance with the requirements
of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
      4.	This Agreement shall continue in effect for the
initial term set forth in Schedule A.  It shall be renewed
automatically thereafter with respect to a Fund by the
Investment Adviser and the Subadviser for successive periods not
exceeding one year, if and only if such renewal and continuance
is specifically approved at least annually by the Board of
Trustees of the Trust or by a vote of the majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund as prescribed by the
1940 Act and provided further that such continuance is approved
at least annually thereafter by a vote of a majority of the
Trust's Trustees, who are not parties to such Agreement or
interested persons of such a party, cast in person at a meeting
called for the purpose of voting on such approval.  This
Agreement will terminate with respect to a Fund without the
payment of any penalty upon termination of the Investment
Advisory Agreement relating to the Fund by either party thereto
(accompanied by simultaneous notice to the Subadviser) or upon
sixty days' written notice to the Subadviser that the Trustees
of the Trust, the Investment Adviser or the shareholders by vote
of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund,
as provided by the 1940 Act, have terminated this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated
upon less than sixty days' notice to the Subadviser upon a
material breach of this Agreement or if the Trustees determine
that other circumstances have, or likely will have, a material
adverse effect on the Subadviser's abilities to perform its
obligations hereunder, including without limitation,
notification of the departure of a portfolio manager of the Fund
or other key personnel change.  This Agreement may also be
terminated by the Subadviser with respect to a Fund without
penalty upon sixty days' written notice to the Investment
Adviser and the Trust.
      This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect
to a Fund in the event of its assignment or, upon notice thereof
to the Subadviser, the assignment of the Investment Advisory
Agreement, unless its continuation thereafter is approved by the
Board of Trustees of the Trust and the shareholders of the Fund
if so required by the 1940 Act (in each case as the term
assignment is defined in Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act,
subject to such exemptions as may be granted by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) by any rule, regulation, order
or interpretive guidance).
      5.	Subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the Investment Adviser, the Subadviser will
provide an investment program for the Allocated Assets,
including investment research and management with respect to
securities and investments, including cash and cash equivalents,
and will, on a discretionary basis, determine from time to time
what securities and other investments will be purchased,
retained or sold.  The Subadviser will provide the services
under this Agreement in accordance with each Fund's investment
objective, policies and restrictions as stated in the
Prospectus, as provided to the Subadviser by the Investment
Adviser.  The Subadviser further agrees that, in all matters
relating to the performance of this Agreement, it:
            (a)	shall act in conformity with the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and currently effective
registration statements under the 1940 Act and the Securities
Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act) and any amendments or supplements
thereto (the Registration Statements) and with the written
policies, procedures and guidelines of each Fund, and written
instructions and directions of the Trustees of the Trust and
shall comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act) and the
rules thereunder, and all other applicable federal and state
laws and regulations.  The Trust agrees to provide Subadviser
with copies of the Trust's Declaration of Trust, By-Laws,
Registration Statements, written policies, procedures and
guidelines, and written instructions and directions of the
Trustees, and any amendments or supplements to any of them at,
or, if practicable, before the time such materials, instructions
or directives become effective.  The Subadviser shall act in
conformity with any amendments or supplements to the foregoing
as soon as practicable after receipt thereof;
            (b)	will maintain at all times during the term of
this Agreement, in full force and effect, insurance, including
without limitation errors and omissions insurance, with
reputable insurance carriers, in such amounts, covering  such
risks and liabilities, and with such deductibles and self-
insurance as are consistent with customary industry practice;
            (c)	will pay expenses incurred by it in connection
with its activities under this Agreement other than the cost of
securities and other investments (including brokerage
commissions and other transaction changes, if any) purchased for
each Fund, provided that the Subadviser will not pay for or
provide a credit with respect to any research provided to it in
accordance with Section 5(d);
            (d)	will place orders pursuant to its investment
determinations for the Allocated Assets either directly with any
broker or dealer, or with the issuer.  In placing orders with
brokers or dealers, the Subadviser will attempt to obtain the
best execution of its orders.  Subject to policies established
by the Trustees of the Trust and communicated to the Subadviser,
it is understood that the Subadviser will not be deemed to have
acted unlawfully, or to have breached a fiduciary duty to the
Trust or in respect of a Fund, or be in breach of any obligation
owing to the Investment Adviser or the Trust or in respect of a
Fund under this Agreement, or otherwise, solely by reason of its
having caused the Fund to pay a member of a securities exchange,
a broker or a dealer a commission for effecting a securities
transaction for the Fund in excess of the amount of commission
another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have
charged if the Subadviser determines in good faith that the
commission paid was reasonable in relation to the brokerage or
research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and interpretive guidance
issued by the SEC thereunder) provided by such member, broker or
dealer, viewed in terms of that particular transaction or the
Subadviser's overall responsibilities with respect to the
accounts, including the Fund, as to which it exercises
investment discretion;
            (e)	will review the daily valuation of securities
comprising the Allocated Assets of each Fund as obtained on a
daily basis by the Fund's administrator and furnished by it to
Subadviser, and will promptly notify the Trust and the
Investment Adviser if the Subadviser believes that any such
valuations may not properly reflect the market value of any
securities owned by the Fund, provided, however, that the
Subadviser is not required by this subparagraph to obtain
valuations of any such securities from brokers or dealers or
otherwise, or to otherwise independently verify valuations of
any such securities;
            (f)	unless otherwise instructed, will be responsible
for voting all proxies of the Allocated Assets in accordance
with the Proxy Voting Policies and Guidelines of Subadviser (the
Proxy Policy), provided that such Proxy Policy and any
amendments thereto are furnished to the Trust;
            (g)	will attend regular business and investment-
related meetings with the Trust's Board of Trustees and the
Investment Adviser if requested to do so by the Trust and/or the
Investment Adviser, and at its expense, shall supply the Board,
the officers of the Trust, and the Investment Adviser with all
information and reports reasonably required by them and
reasonably available to the Subadviser relating to the services
provided by the Subadviser hereunder;
            (h)	will maintain books and records with respect to
the securities transactions for the Allocated Assets of each
Fund and proxy voting record for the Allocated Assets of the
Fund, furnish to the Investment Adviser and the Trust's Board of
Trustees such periodic and special reports as they may
reasonably request with respect to services provided by the
Subadviser to the Fund, and provide in advance to the Investment
Adviser all of the Subadviser's reports to the Trust's Board of
Trustees for examination and review within a reasonable time
prior to the Trust's Board meetings; and
            (i)	will pay expenses incurred by the Trust for any
matters related to any transaction or event that is deemed to
result in a change of control of the Subadviser or otherwise
result in the assignment of the Sub-Investment Advisory
Agreement under the 1940 Act.
      6.	The Investment Adviser or its affiliates may, from
time to time, engage other subadvisers to advise other series of
the Trust (or portions thereof) or other registered investment
companies (or series or portions thereof) that may be deemed to
be under common control (each a Sub-Advised Fund).  The
Subadviser agrees that it will not consult with any other
subadviser engaged by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates
with respect to transactions in securities or other assets
concerning a Fund or another Sub-Advised Fund, except to the
extent permitted by the rules under the 1940 Act that permit
certain transactions with a subadviser or its affiliates.
      7.	Subadviser agrees with respect to the services
provided to each Fund that:
            (a)	it will promptly communicate to the Investment
Adviser such information relating to Fund transactions as the
officers and Trustees of the Trust may reasonably request and as
communicated to the Subadviser;
            (b)	it will treat confidentially and as proprietary
information of the Trust all records and other information
relative to each Fund and its prior, present or potential
shareholders (Confidential Information), will comply at all
times with all applicable laws and regulations relating to the
confidentiality of nonpublic personal information including
the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or other federal or state privacy
laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and will not
use such Confidential Information for any purpose other than the
performance of its responsibilities and duties hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Subadviser may divulge
Confidential Information when so requested by the Trust in
writing or when requested to divulge Confidential Information
pursuant to statute, law, rule, regulation, subpoena, court
order or other similar requirement (each, a Legal"
"7176","Requirement); provided, however, that if such disclosure is
requested pursuant to a Legal Requirement, Subadviser will
provide, unless otherwise prohibited by law, the Trust with
notice of such request so that the Trust may seek, at its sole
expense, to prevent such disclosure, and Subadviser shall
cooperate, at the Trust's expense, with the Trust's efforts to
prevent disclosure.  In the event that the Trust is unable to
prevent such disclosure prior to the date such disclosure is
required, the Subadviser may disclose such portion of the
Confidential Information that it is legally required to
disclose; and
            (c)	during the term of this Agreement and for a
period of eighteen (18) months following the termination of this
Agreement, Subadviser (and its directors, officers,
stockholders, employees, and agents) will not, directly or
indirectly, solicit or induce any of the Fund's shareholders to
be withdrawn from investment in any series of the Trust, except
to the extent the Subadviser (and its directors, officers,
stockholders, employees, and agents) can demonstrate that those
shareholders were, at the time of their initial investment in
the Fund, already existing clients of the Subadviser or of its
affiliated entities.
      8.	Each party represents and warrants to the other party
that the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
is within its powers and have been duly authorized by all
necessary actions of its directors, partners or members, and no
action by, or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental
body, agency or official is required on the part of either party
for execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and
the execution, delivery and performance by either party of this
Agreement do not contravene or constitute a violation of, or a
material default under, (i) any provision of applicable law,
rule or regulation, (ii) such party's governing instruments, or
(iii) any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or
other instrument binding upon such party.
      9.	In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, Subadviser acknowledges that all records
which it maintains for the Trust are the property of the Trust
and agrees to surrender promptly to the Trust any of such
records upon the Trust's request, provided that Subadviser may
retain copies thereof at its own expense.  Subadviser further
agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2
under the 1940 Act the records required to be maintained by Rule
31a-1 under the 1940 Act relating to transactions placed by
Subadviser for the Fund.  Subadviser further agrees to maintain
each Fund's proxy voting record with respect to the Allocated
Assets in a form mutually agreeable between the parties and
which contains the information required by Form N-PX under the
1940 Act.
      10.	It is expressly understood and agreed that the
services to be rendered by the Subadviser to the Investment
Adviser under the provisions of this Agreement are not to be
deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser shall be free to
provide similar or different services to others so long as its
ability to provide the services provided for in this Agreement
shall not be materially impaired thereby.  In addition, but
without limiting any separate agreement between the Subadviser
and the Investment Adviser to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any director,
officer, or employee of the Subadviser who may also be a
Trustee, officer, or employee of the Trust to engage in any
other business or to devote his or her time and attention in
part to the management or other aspects of any other business,
whether of a similar nature or a dissimilar nature.
      11.	The Investment Adviser agrees that it will furnish
currently to the Subadviser all information with reference to
each Fund and the Trust that is reasonably necessary to permit
the Subadviser to carry out its responsibilities under this
Agreement, and the parties agree that they will from time to
time consult and make appropriate arrangements as to specific
information that is required under this paragraph and the
frequency and manner with which it shall be supplied.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Investment Adviser
will furnish to Subadviser procedures consistent with the
Trust's contract with each Fund's custodian from time to time
(the Custodian), and reasonably satisfactory to Subadviser,
for consummation of portfolio transactions for each Fund by
payment to or delivery by the Custodian of all cash and/or
securities or other investments due to or from the Fund, and
Subadviser shall not have possession or custody thereof or any
responsibility or liability with respect to such custody.  Upon
giving proper instructions to the Custodian, Subadviser shall
have no responsibility or liability with respect to custodial
arrangements or the acts, omissions or other conduct of the
Custodian.
      12.	The Subadviser and its directors, officers,
stockholders, employees and agents shall not be liable for any
error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by
the Investment Adviser or the Trust in connection with any
matters to which this Agreement relates or for any other act or
omission in the performance by the Subadviser of its duties
under this Agreement except that nothing herein contained shall
be construed to protect the Subadviser against any liability by
reason of the Subadviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or
gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reckless
disregard of its obligations or duties under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the
provisions of this Section 12 shall not be construed so as to
relieve (or attempt to relieve) the Subadviser of any liability,
to the extent (but only to the extent) that such liability may
not be waived, modified or limited under applicable law, but
shall be construed so as to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 12 to the fullest extent permitted by law.
      13.	Each party shall indemnify and hold harmless the other
party and its respective control persons (as described in
Section 15 of the 1933 Act) and their respective directors,
stockholders, members and employees (collectively,
Indemnitees) against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses (including reasonable legal and other
expenses of investigating or defending any alleged loss, claim,
damages or liabilities) to which any of the Indemnitees may
become subject under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or the Advisers
Act, or under any other statute, at common law or otherwise,
arising out of or based on (i) any willful misfeasance, bad
faith, or gross negligence of the other party in the performance
of, or reckless disregard of, any of its duties or obligations
hereunder, or (ii) any material breach of this Agreement by the
other party.
      14.	If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or
made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or otherwise,
the remainder of the Agreement shall not be affected thereby.
Except to the extent governed by federal law including the 1940
Act, this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
applying the principles of conflicts of law thereunder.
      15.	No provision of this Agreement may be changed,
discharged or terminated orally, but only by an instrument in
writing signed by the party against which enforcement of the
change, discharge or termination is sought.  No amendment of
this Agreement shall be effective with respect to the Trust
until approved as required by applicable law.
      16.	Any notice to be given hereunder may be given by
personal notification or by facsimile transmission, to the party

SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
BETWEEN ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC
AND LAKE PARTNERS, INC.
      SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (the Agreement) made
this 30th day of May, 2014 by and between ASTON ASSET
MANAGEMENT, LLC (hereinafter referred to as the Investment"
"7177","Adviser) and LAKE PARTNERS, INC. (hereinafter referred to as
the Subadviser), which Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which together shall constitute but one
instrument.
W I T N E S S E T H:
      WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser has been retained by Aston
Funds, a Delaware statutory trust (the Trust), a registered
management investment company under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act) to provide investment
advisory services to the Trust with respect to certain series of
the Trust set forth in Schedule A hereto as may be amended from
time to time (hereinafter referred to as a Fund and
collectively, the Funds of the Trust);
      WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser wishes to enter into a
contract with the Subadviser to provide research, analysis,
advice and recommendations with respect to the purchase and sale
of securities, and make investment commitments with respect to
such portion of the Funds' assets as shall be allocated to the
Subadviser by the Investment Adviser from time to time (the
Allocated Assets), subject to oversight by the Trustees of the
Trust and the supervision of the Investment Adviser.
      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein contained, and intending to be bound, the parties agree
as follows:
      1.	In accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement
between the Trust and the Investment Adviser (Investment"
"7178","Advisory Agreement) with respect to the Funds, the Investment
Adviser hereby appoints the Subadviser to act as subadviser with
respect to the Allocated Assets for the period and on the terms
set forth in this Agreement. The Subadviser accepts such
appointment and agrees to render the services set forth herein,
for the compensation provided herein.
      2.	As compensation for the services enumerated herein,
the Investment Adviser will pay the Subadviser a fee with
respect to the Allocated Assets, which shall be calculated and
payable monthly in arrears within ten (10) business days after
the end of each month based on the average daily net assets of
the Fund, in an amount equal to 50% of the positive difference,
if any, of (x) the advisory fee payable to the Investment
Adviser with respect to the Allocated Assets of the Fund (before
deduction of the fee payable to Subadviser) minus (y) the sum
of: (i) any investment advisory fees waived by the Investment
Adviser pursuant to an expense limitation or reimbursement
agreement with the Fund, (ii) any reimbursement of Fund expenses
by the Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense limitation or
reimbursement agreement with the Fund, and (iii) any payments
made by the Investment Adviser to third parties that provide
distribution, shareholder services or similar services on behalf
of the Fund.  If the foregoing calculation results in a negative
amount, such amount shall be payable by the Subadviser to the
Investment Adviser within 30 days of receipt of notice from the
Investment Adviser, which notice shall include the basis for the
calculation.
      For the purposes of this Agreement, a Fund's net assets
shall be determined as provided in the Fund's then-current
Prospectus (as used herein this term includes the related
Statement of Additional Information).
      If this Agreement shall become effective subsequent to the
first day of a month, or shall terminate before the last day of
a month, the Subadviser's compensation or the amount payable by
the Subadviser to the Investment Adviser (in the event the
calculation of the Subadviser's compensation results in a
negative amount) for such fraction of the month shall be
prorated based on the number of calendar days of such month
during which the Agreement is effective.
      3.	This Agreement shall become effective with respect to
a Fund as of the date set forth opposite the Fund's name as set
forth on Schedule A hereto (the Effective Date), provided that
it has been approved by the Trustees of the Trust in accordance
with the provisions of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder
and, if so required by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, by
the shareholders of the Fund in accordance with the requirements
of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
      4.	This Agreement shall continue in effect for the
initial term set forth in Schedule A.  It shall be renewed
automatically thereafter with respect to a Fund by the
Investment Adviser and the Subadviser for successive periods not
exceeding one year, if and only if such renewal and continuance
is specifically approved at least annually by the Board of
Trustees of the Trust or by a vote of the majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund as prescribed by the
1940 Act and provided further that such continuance is approved
at least annually thereafter by a vote of a majority of the
Trust's Trustees, who are not parties to such Agreement or
interested persons of such a party, cast in person at a meeting
called for the purpose of voting on such approval.  This
Agreement will terminate with respect to a Fund without the
payment of any penalty upon termination of the Investment
Advisory Agreement relating to a Fund by either party thereto
(accompanied by simultaneous notice to the Subadviser) or upon
sixty days' written notice to the Subadviser that the Trustees
of the Trust, the Investment Adviser or the shareholders by vote
of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund,
as provided by the 1940 Act, have terminated this Agreement.
This Agreement may also be terminated by the Subadviser with
respect to a Fund without penalty upon sixty days' written
notice to the Investment Adviser and the Trust.
      This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect
to a Fund in the event of its assignment by the Subadviser or,
upon notice thereof to the Subadviser, the assignment of the
Investment Advisory Agreement, unless its continuation
thereafter is approved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust and
the shareholders of the Fund if so required by the 1940 Act (in
each case as the term assignment is defined in Section 2(a)(4)
of the 1940 Act, subject to such exemptions as may be granted by
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by any rule,
regulation, order or interpretive guidance).
      5.	In performing its services under this Agreement, the
Investment Adviser shall comply in all material respects with
the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act of
1940 and the rules thereunder (the Advisers Act), and all
other applicable federal and state laws and regulations, and
shall act in conformity with the Trust's Declaration of Trust,
By-Laws and currently effective registration statements under
the 1940 Act and the Securities Act of 1933 and any amendments
or supplements thereto (the Registration Statements) and with
the written policies, procedures and guidelines of each Fund,
and written instructions and directions of the Trustees of the
Trust.
      6.	Subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the Investment Adviser, the Subadviser will
provide an investment program for the Allocated Assets,
including investment research and management with respect to
securities and investments, including cash and cash equivalents,
and will determine from time to time what securities and other
investments will be purchased, retained or sold.  The Subadviser
will provide the services under this Agreement in accordance
with each Fund's investment objective, policies and restrictions
as stated in the Prospectus, as provided to the Subadviser by
the Investment Adviser.  The Subadviser further agrees that, in
all matters relating to the performance of this Agreement, it:
            (a)	shall act in conformity with the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and Registration Statements and
with the written policies, procedures and guidelines of each
Fund, and written instructions and directions of the Trustees of
the Trust and shall comply with the requirements of the 1940
Act, the Advisers Act, and all other applicable federal and
state laws and regulations.  The Investment Adviser agrees to
provide Subadviser with copies of the Trust's Declaration of
Trust, By-Laws, Registration Statements, written policies,
procedures and guidelines, and written instructions and
directions of the Trustees, and any amendments or supplements to
any of them at, or, if practicable, before the time such
materials, instructions or directives become effective;
            (b)	will pay expenses incurred by it in connection
with its activities under this Agreement other than the cost of
securities and other investments (including brokerage
commissions and other transaction changes, if any) purchased for
each Fund, provided that the Subadviser will not pay for or
provide a credit with respect to any research provided to it in
accordance with Section 6(c);
            (c)	will place orders pursuant to its investment
determinations for the Allocated Assets either directly with any
broker or dealer, or with the issuer.  In placing orders with
brokers or dealers, the Subadviser will attempt to obtain the
best overall price and the most favorable execution of its
orders.  Subject to written policies established by the Trustees
of the Trust and communicated to the Subadviser, it is
understood that the Subadviser will not be deemed to have acted
unlawfully, or to have breached a fiduciary duty to the Trust or
in respect of a Fund, or be in breach of any obligation owing to
the Investment Adviser or the Trust or in respect of a Fund
under this Agreement, or otherwise, solely by reason of its
having caused the Fund to pay a member of a securities exchange,
a broker or a dealer a commission for effecting a securities
transaction for the Fund in excess of the amount of commission
another member of an exchange, broker or dealer would have
charged if the Subadviser determines in good faith that the
commission paid was reasonable in relation to the brokerage or
research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and interpretive guidance
issued by the SEC thereunder) provided by such member, broker or
dealer, viewed in terms of that particular transaction or the
Subadviser's overall responsibilities with respect to the
accounts, including the Fund, as to which it exercises
investment discretion;
            (d)	will review the daily valuation of securities
comprising the Allocated Assets of each Fund as obtained on a
daily basis by the Fund's administrator and furnished by it to
Subadviser, and will promptly notify the Trust and the
Investment Adviser if the Subadviser believes that any such
valuations may not properly reflect the market value of any
securities owned by the Fund, provided, however, that the
Subadviser is not required by this sub-paragraph to obtain
valuations of any such securities from brokers or dealers or
otherwise, or to otherwise independently verify valuations of
any such securities;
            (e)	unless otherwise instructed by the Investment
Adviser, will be responsible for voting all proxies of the
Allocated Assets in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies
and Guidelines of Subadviser (the Proxy Policy), provided that
such Proxy Policy and any amendments thereto are furnished to
the Trust;
            (f)	will attend regular business and investment-
related meetings  with the Trust's Board of Trustees and the
Investment Adviser if requested to do so by the Trust and/or the
Investment Adviser, and at its expense, shall supply the Board,
the officers of the Trust, and the Investment Adviser with all
information and reports reasonably required by them and
reasonably available to the Subadviser relating to the services
provided by the Subadviser hereunder;
            (g)	will maintain books and records with respect to
the securities transactions for the Allocated Assets of each
Fund and proxy voting records for the Allocated Assets of the
Fund, furnish to the Investment Adviser and the Trust's Board of
Trustees such periodic and special reports as they may
reasonably request with respect to the Fund, and provide in
advance to the Investment Adviser all of the Subadviser's
reports to the Trust's Board of Trustees for examination and
review within a reasonable time prior to the Trust's Board
meetings; and
            (h)	will pay expenses incurred by the Trust for any
matters related to any transaction or event that is deemed under
the 1940 Act to result in a change of control of the Subadviser.
	7.	The Investment Adviser or its affiliates may, from
time to time, engage other subadvisers to advise other series of
the Trust (or portions thereof) or other registered investment
companies (or series or portions thereof) that may be deemed to
be under common control (each a Sub-Advised Fund).  The
Subadviser agrees that it will not consult with any other
subadviser engaged by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates
with respect to transactions in securities or other assets
concerning a Fund or another Sub-Advised Fund, except to the
extent permitted by the rules under the 1940 Act that permit
certain transactions with a subadviser or its affiliates.

	8.	Subadviser agrees with respect to the services
provided to each Fund that it:

            (a)	will promptly communicate to the Investment
Adviser such information relating to Fund transactions as the
officers and Trustees of the Trust may reasonably request and as
communicated to the Subadviser; and
            (b)	will treat confidentially and as proprietary
information of the Trust all records and other information
relative to each Fund and its prior, present or potential
shareholders, and will not use such records and information
(collectively, Confidential Information) for any purpose other
than performance of its responsibilities and duties hereunder
(except after prior notification to and approval in writing by
the Trust, which approval may not be withheld where Subadviser
is advised by counsel that the Subadviser may be exposed to
civil or criminal contempt or other proceedings for failure to
comply, when requested to divulge such information by duly
constituted authorities, or when so requested by the Trust).
      The term Confidential Information shall not include
information that (a) is or becomes publicly available without
violation of this Agreement, including the track record of each
Fund, (b) is or becomes lawfully available from a third party,
or (c) is approved for disclosure by written authorization of
the Trust.  The names of clients or potential clients of the
Subadviser are not proprietary information of the Trust, but the
Subadviser shall treat an investment in the Fund by such clients
or potential clients of the Subadviser as confidential;
provided, however, all shareholder account information of such
persons who become investors in the Fund is subject to the
privacy policies of the Trust.
      9.	In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, Subadviser acknowledges that all records
that it maintains for the Trust are the property of the Trust
and agrees to surrender promptly to the Trust any of such
records upon the Trust's request, provided, that Subadviser may
retain copies thereof at its own expense.  Subadviser further
agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2
under the 1940 Act the records required to be maintained by Rule
31a-1 under the 1940 Act relating to transactions placed by
Subadviser for the Fund.  Subadviser further agrees to maintain
each Fund's proxy voting record with respect to the Allocated
Assets in a form mutually agreeable between the parties and
which contains the information required by Form N-PX under the
1940 Act.
      10.	It is expressly understood and agreed that the
services to be rendered by the Subadviser to the Investment
Adviser under the provisions of this Agreement are not to be
deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser shall be free to
provide similar or different services to others so long as its
ability to provide the services provided for in this Agreement
shall not be materially impaired thereby.  Nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any director,
officer, or employee of the Subadviser to engage in any other
business or to devote his or her time and attention in part to
the management or other aspects of any other business, whether
of a similar nature or a dissimilar nature.
      11.	The Investment Adviser agrees that it will furnish
currently to the Subadviser all information with reference to
each Fund and the Trust that is reasonably necessary to permit
the Subadviser to carry out its responsibilities under this
Agreement, and the parties agree that they will from time to
time consult and make appropriate arrangements as to specific
information that is required under this paragraph and the
frequency and manner with which it shall be supplied.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Investment Adviser
will furnish to Subadviser procedures consistent with the
Trust's contract with each Fund's custodian from time to time
(the Custodian), and reasonably satisfactory to Subadviser,
for consummation of portfolio transactions for each Fund by
payment to or delivery by the Custodian of all cash and/or
securities or other investments due to or from the Fund, and
Subadviser shall not have possession or custody thereof or any
responsibility or liability with respect to such custody.  Upon
giving proper instructions to the Custodian, Subadviser shall
have no responsibility or liability with respect to custodial
arrangements or the acts, omissions or other conduct of the
Custodian.
      12.	The Subadviser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
the Investment Adviser, any affiliated person within the meaning
of Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act (affiliated person) of the
Investment Adviser and each person, if any, who, within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933"
"7179","Act), controls (controlling person) the Investment Adviser,
against any and all losses, claims damages, liabilities or
litigation (including reasonable legal and other expenses), to
which the Investment Adviser, such affiliated person or such
controlling person may become subject under the 1933 Act, the
1940 Act, the Advisers Act, under any other statute, at common
law or otherwise, arising out of Subadviser's responsibilities
hereunder (1) to the extent of, and as a result of, the willful
misconduct, bad faith, or gross negligence by the Subadviser,
any of the Subadviser's employees or representatives or any
affiliate of or any person acting on behalf of the Subadviser,
or (2) as a result of Subadviser's material breach of this
Agreement, or its reckless disregard of its obligations
hereunder.
      The Investment Adviser agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Subadviser, any affiliated person within the
meaning of Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act (affiliated person)
of the Subadviser and each person, if any, who, within the
meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, controls (controlling"
"7180","person) the Subadviser, against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or litigation (including reasonable legal
and other expenses), to which the Subadviser, such affiliated
person, or such controlling person may become subject under the
1933 Act, the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, under any other
statute, at common law or otherwise, arising out of the
Investment Adviser's responsibilities as investment adviser
(1) to the extent of and as a result of the willful misconduct,
bad faith, or gross negligence by the Investment Adviser, any of
the Investment Adviser's employees or representatives or any
affiliate of or any person acting on behalf of the Investment
Adviser, or (2) as a result of the Investment Adviser's material
breach of this Agreement, or its reckless disregard of its
obligations hereunder.
      In no case shall the indemnity provided hereunder be deemed
to protect any person against any liability to which any such
person would otherwise be subject by reason of willful
misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of
its duties or by reason of its reckless disregard of its
obligations and duties under this Agreement.
      13.	If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or
made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or otherwise,
the remainder of the Agreement shall not be affected thereby.
Except to the extent governed by federal law including the 1940
Act, this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without

discharged or terminated orally, but only by an instrument in
writing signed by the party against which enforcement of the
change, discharge or termination is sought.  No amendment of
this Agreement shall be effective with respect to the Trust
until approved as required by applicable law.

SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
BETWEEN ASTON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC
AND MONTAG & CALDWELL, INC.
      SUB-INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (the Agreement) made
this 30th day of May, 2014 by and between ASTON ASSET
MANAGEMENT, LLC (hereinafter referred to as the Investment"
"7181","Adviser) and MONTAG & CALDWELL, INC. (hereinafter referred to
as the Subadviser), which Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which together shall constitute but one
instrument.
W I T N E S S E T H:
      WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser has been retained by Aston
Funds, a Delaware statutory trust (the Trust), a registered
management investment company under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act) to provide investment
advisory services to the Trust with respect to certain series of
the Trust set forth in Schedule A hereto as may be amended from
time to time (hereinafter referred to as a Fund and
collectively, the Funds of the Trust);
      WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser wishes to enter into a
contract with the Subadviser to provide research, analysis,
advice and recommendations with respect to the purchase and sale
of securities, and make investment commitments with respect to
such portion of the Funds' assets as shall be allocated to the
Subadviser by the Investment Adviser from time to time (the
Allocated Assets), subject to oversight by the Trustees of the
Trust and the supervision of the Investment Adviser.
      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein contained, and intending to be bound, the parties agree
as follows:
      1.	In accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement
between the Trust and the Investment Adviser (Investment"
"7182","Advisory Agreement) with respect to the Funds, the Investment
Adviser hereby appoints the Subadviser to act as subadviser with
respect to the Allocated Assets for the period and on the terms
set forth in this Agreement. The Subadviser accepts such
appointment and agrees to render the services set forth herein,
for the compensation provided herein.
      2.	As compensation for the services enumerated herein,
the Investment Adviser will pay the Subadviser a fee with
respect to the Allocated Assets, which shall be calculated and
payable monthly in arrears based on the average daily net assets
of the Fund, in an amount equal to 50% of the positive
difference, if any, of (x) the advisory fee payable to the
Investment Adviser with respect to the Allocated Assets of the
Fund (before reduction of the fee payable to Subadviser) minus
(y) the sum of: (i) any investment advisory fees waived by the
Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense limitation or
reimbursement agreement with the Fund, (ii) any reimbursement of
expenses by the Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense
limitation or reimbursement agreement with the Fund, and (iii)
any payments made by the Investment Adviser to third parties
that provide distribution, shareholder services or similar
services on behalf of the Fund.  If the foregoing calculation
results in a negative amount, such amount shall be payable by
the Subadviser within 30 days of receipt of notice from the
Investment Adviser, which notice shall include the basis for the
calculation.
      For the purposes of this Agreement, a Fund's net assets
shall be determined as provided in the Fund's then-current
Prospectus (as used herein this term includes the related
Statement of Additional Information).
      If this Agreement shall become effective subsequent to the
first day of a month, or shall terminate before the last day of
a month, the Subadviser's compensation for such fraction of the
month shall be prorated based on the number of calendar days of
such month during which the Agreement is effective.
      3.	This Agreement shall become effective with respect to
a Fund as of the date set forth opposite the Fund's name as set
forth on Schedule A hereto (the Effective Date), provided that
it has been approved by the Trustees of the Trust in accordance
with the provisions of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder
and, if so required by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, by
the shareholders of the Fund in accordance with the requirements
of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
      4.	This Agreement shall continue in effect for the
initial term set forth in Schedule A.  It shall be renewed
automatically thereafter with respect to a Fund by the
Investment Adviser and the Subadviser for successive periods not
exceeding one year, if and only if such renewal and continuance
is specifically approved at least annually by the Board of
Trustees of the Trust or by a vote of the majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund as prescribed by the
1940 Act and provided further that such continuance is approved
at least annually thereafter by a vote of a majority of the
Trust's Trustees, who are not parties to such Agreement or
interested persons of such a party, cast in person at a meeting
called for the purpose of voting on such approval.  This
Agreement will terminate with respect to a Fund without the
payment of any penalty upon termination of the Investment
Advisory Agreement relating to a Fund by either party thereto
(accompanied by simultaneous notice to the Subadviser) or upon
ten days' written notice to the Subadviser that the Trustees of
the Trust, the Investment Adviser or the shareholders by vote of
a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, as
provided by the 1940 Act, have terminated this Agreement.  This
Agreement may also be terminated by the Subadviser with respect
to a Fund without penalty upon sixty days' written notice to the
Investment Adviser and the Trust.
      This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect
to a Fund in the event of its assignment or, upon notice thereof
to the Subadviser, the assignment of the Investment Advisory
Agreement, unless its continuation thereafter is approved by the
Board of Trustees of the Trust and the shareholders of the Fund
if so required by the 1940 Act (in each case as the term
assignment is defined in Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act,
subject to such exemptions as may be granted by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) by any rule, regulation, order
or interpretive guidance).
      5.	Subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the Investment Adviser, the Subadviser will
provide an investment program for the Allocated Assets,
including investment research and management with respect to
securities and investments, including cash and cash equivalents,
and will determine from time to time what securities and other
investments will be purchased, retained or sold.  The Subadviser
will provide the services under this Agreement in accordance
with each Fund's investment objective, policies and restrictions
as stated in the Prospectus, as provided to the Subadviser by
the Investment Adviser.  The Subadviser further agrees that, in
all matters relating to the performance of this Agreement, it:
            (a)	shall act in conformity with the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and currently effective
registration statements under the 1940 Act and the Securities
Act of 1933 and any amendments or supplements thereto (the
Registration Statements) and with the written policies,
procedures and guidelines of each Fund, and written instructions
and directions of the Trustees of the Trust and shall comply
with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 and the rules thereunder, and all other
applicable federal and state laws and regulations.  The Trust
agrees to provide Subadviser with copies of the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws, Registration Statements, written
policies, procedures and guidelines, and written instructions
and directions of the Trustees, and any amendments or
supplements to any of them at, or, if practicable, before the
time such materials, instructions or directives become
effective;
            (b)	will pay expenses incurred by it in connection
with its activities under this Agreement other than the cost of
securities and other investments (including brokerage
commissions and other transaction changes, if any) purchased for
each Fund, provided that the Subadviser will not pay for or
provide a credit with respect to any research provided to it in
accordance with Section 5(c);
            (c)	will place orders pursuant to its investment
determinations for each Fund either directly with any broker or
dealer, or with the issuer.  In placing orders with brokers or
dealers, the Subadviser will attempt to obtain the best overall
price and the most favorable execution of its orders.  Subject
to policies established by the Trustees of the Trust and
communicated to the Subadviser, it is understood that the
Subadviser will not be deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to
have breached a fiduciary duty to the Trust or in respect of a
Fund, or be in breach of any obligation owing to the Investment
Adviser or the Trust or in respect of a Fund under this
Agreement, or otherwise, solely by reason of its having caused
the Fund to pay a member of a securities exchange, a broker or a
dealer a commission for effecting a securities transaction for
the Fund in excess of the amount of commission another member of
an exchange, broker or dealer would have charged if the
Subadviser determines in good faith that the commission paid was
reasonable in relation to the brokerage or research services (as
those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and interpretive guidance issued by the SEC
thereunder) provided by such member, broker or dealer, viewed in
terms of that particular transaction or the Subadviser's overall
responsibilities with respect to the accounts, including the
Fund, as to which it exercises investment discretion;
            (d)	will review the daily valuation of securities
comprising the Allocated Assets of each Fund as obtained on a
daily basis by the Fund's administrator and furnished by it to
Subadviser, and will promptly notify the Trust and the
Investment Adviser if the Subadviser believes that any such
valuations may not properly reflect the market value of any
securities owned by the Fund, provided, however, that the
Subadviser is not required by this sub-paragraph to obtain
valuations of any such securities from brokers or dealers or
otherwise, or to otherwise independently verify valuations of
any such securities;
            (e)	unless otherwise instructed, will be responsible
for voting all proxies of each Fund in accordance with the Proxy
Voting Policies and Guidelines of Subadviser (the Proxy"
"7183","Policy), provided that such Proxy Policy and any amendments
thereto are furnished to the Trust;
            (f)	will attend regular business and investment-
related meetings with the Trust's Board of Trustees and the
Investment Adviser if requested to do so by the Trust and/or the
Investment Adviser, and at its expense, shall supply the Board,
the officers of the Trust, and the Investment Adviser with all
information and reports reasonably required by them and
reasonably available to the Subadviser relating to the services
provided by the Subadviser hereunder; and
            (g)	will maintain books and records with respect to
the securities transactions for the Allocated Assets of each
Fund and proxy voting record for the Allocated Assets of the
Fund, furnish to the Investment Adviser and the Trust's Board of
Trustees such periodic and special reports as they may request
with respect to the Fund, and provide in advance to the
Investment Adviser all of the Subadviser's reports to the
Trust's Board of Trustees for examination and review within a
reasonable time prior to the Trust's Board meetings.
      6.	The Investment Adviser or its affiliates may, from
time to time, engage other subadvisers to advise other series of
the Trust (or portions thereof) or other registered investment
companies (or series or portions thereof) that may be deemed to
be under common control (each a Sub-Advised Fund).  The
Subadviser agrees that it will not consult with any other
unaffiliated subadviser engaged by the Investment Adviser or its
affiliates with respect to transactions in securities or other
assets concerning a Fund or another Sub-Advised Fund, except to
the extent permitted by the rules under the 1940 Act that permit
certain transactions with a subadviser or its affiliates.
      7.	Subadviser agrees with respect to the services
provided to each Fund that it:
            (a)	will promptly communicate to the Investment
Adviser such information relating to Fund transactions as the
officers and Trustees of the Trust may reasonably request and as
communicated to the Subadviser; and
            (b)	will treat confidentially and as proprietary
information of the Trust all records and other information
relative to each Fund and its prior, present or potential
shareholders, and will not use such records and information for
any purpose other than performance of its responsibilities and
duties hereunder (except after prior notification to and
approval in writing by the Trust, which approval may not be
withheld where Subadviser is advised by counsel that the
Subadviser may be exposed to civil or criminal contempt or other
proceedings for failure to comply, when requested to divulge
such information by duly constituted authorities, or when so
requested by the Trust).
      8.	In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, Subadviser acknowledges that all records
which it maintains for the Trust are the property of the Trust
and agrees to surrender promptly to the Trust any of such
records upon the Trust's request, provided, that Subadviser may
retain copies thereof at its own expense.  Subadviser further
agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2
under the 1940 Act the records required to be maintained by Rule
31a-1 under the 1940 Act relating to transactions placed by
Subadviser for the Fund.  Subadviser further agrees to maintain
each Fund's proxy voting record with respect to the Allocated
Assets in a form mutually agreeable between the parties and
which contains the information required by Form N-PX under the
1940 Act.
      9.	It is expressly understood and agreed that the
services to be rendered by the Subadviser to the Investment
Adviser under the provisions of this Agreement are not to be
deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser shall be free to
provide similar or different services to others so long as its
ability to provide the services provided for in this Agreement
shall not be materially impaired thereby.  In addition, but
without limiting any separate agreement between the Subadviser
and the Investment Adviser to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any director,
officer, or employee of the Subadviser who may also be a
Trustee, officer, or employee of the Trust, to engage in any
other business or to devote his or her time and attention in
part to the management or other aspects of any other business,
whether of a similar nature or a dissimilar nature.
      10.	The Investment Adviser agrees that it will furnish
currently to the Subadviser all information with reference to
each Fund and the Trust that is reasonably necessary to permit
the Subadviser to carry out its responsibilities under this
Agreement, and the parties agree that they will from time to
time consult and make appropriate arrangements as to specific
information that is required under this paragraph and the
frequency and manner with which it shall be supplied.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Investment Adviser
will furnish to Subadviser procedures consistent with the
Trust's contract with each Fund's custodian from time to time
(the Custodian), and reasonably satisfactory to Subadviser,
for consummation of portfolio transactions for each Fund by
payment to or delivery by the Custodian of all cash and/or
securities or other investments due to or from the Fund, and
Subadviser shall not have possession or custody thereof or any
responsibility or liability with respect to such custody.  Upon
giving proper instructions to the Custodian, Subadviser shall
have no responsibility or liability with respect to custodial
arrangements or the acts, omissions or other conduct of the
Custodian.
      11.	The Subadviser and its directors, officers,
stockholders, employees and agents shall not be liable for any
error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by
the Investment Adviser or the Trust in connection with any
matters to which this Agreement relates or for any other act or
omission in the performance by the Subadviser of its duties
under this Agreement except that nothing herein contained shall
be construed to protect the Subadviser against any liability by
reason of the Subadviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or
gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reckless
disregard of its obligations or duties under this Agreement.
      12.	If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or
made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or otherwise,
the remainder of the Agreement shall not be affected thereby.
Except to the extent governed by federal law including the 1940
Act, this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
applying the principles of conflicts of law thereunder.
      13.	No provision of this Agreement may be changed,
discharged or terminated orally, but only by an instrument in
writing signed by the party against which enforcement of the
change, discharge or termination is sought.  No amendment of
this Agreement shall be effective with respect to the Trust
until approved as required by applicable law.
      14.	Any notice to be given hereunder may be given by
personal notification or by facsimile transmission, to the party

of securities, and make investment commitments with respect to
such portion of the Funds' assets as shall be allocated to the
Subadviser by the Investment Adviser from time to time (the
Allocated Assets), subject to oversight by the Trustees of the
Trust and the supervision of the Investment Adviser.
      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements
herein contained, and intending to be bound, the parties agree
as follows:
      1.	In accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement
between the Trust and the Investment Adviser (the Investment"
"7185","Advisory Agreement) with respect to the Funds, the Investment
Adviser hereby appoints the Subadviser to act as subadviser with
respect to the Allocated Assets for the period and on the terms
set forth in this Agreement.  The Subadviser accepts such
appointment and agrees to render the services set forth herein,
for the compensation provided herein.
      2.	As compensation for the services enumerated herein,
the parties agree as follows:
            (a)	Investment Adviser will pay the Subadviser a fee
with respect to the Allocated Assets, which shall be calculated
and payable monthly in arrears based on the average daily net
assets of the Fund, in an amount equal to 50% of the positive
difference, if any, of (x) the advisory fee payable to the
Investment Adviser with respect to the Allocated Assets of the
Fund (before reduction of the fee payable to Subadviser) minus
(y) the sum of:  (i) any investment advisory fees waived by the
Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense limitation or
reimbursement agreement with the Fund, (ii) any reimbursement of
expenses by the Investment Adviser pursuant to an expense
limitation or reimbursement agreement with the Fund, and (iii)
any payments made by the Investment Adviser to third parties
that provide distribution, shareholder services or similar
services on behalf of the Fund.  The Investment Adviser
acknowledges that it shall not be entitled to accrue any
cumulative negative amounts resulting from the foregoing
calculation as a catch up reimbursement.
            (b)	The basis for the calculations made under this
paragraph, including such detail as may be reasonably requested
by Subadviser, shall be provided to Subadviser within twenty
days of the last day of each month.
            (c)	For the purposes of this Agreement, a Fund's net"
"7186","assets shall be determined as provided in the Fund's then-
current Prospectus (as used herein, this term includes the
related Statement of Additional Information).
            (d)	If this Agreement shall become effective
subsequent to the first day of a month, or shall terminate
before the last day of a month, the Subadviser's compensation
for such fraction of the month shall be prorated based on the
number of calendar days of such month during which the Agreement
is effective.
      3.	This Agreement shall become effective with respect to
a Fund as of the date set forth opposite the Fund's name as set
forth on Schedule A hereto (the Effective Date), provided that
it has been approved by the Trustees of the Trust in accordance
with the provisions of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder
and, if so required by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, by
the shareholders of the Fund in accordance with the requirements
of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
      4.	This Agreement shall continue in effect for the
initial term set forth in Schedule A.  It shall be renewed
automatically thereafter with respect to a Fund by the
Investment Adviser and the Subadviser for successive periods not
exceeding one year, if and only if such renewal and continuance
is specifically approved at least annually by the Board of
Trustees of the Trust or by a vote of the majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund as prescribed by the
1940 Act and provided further that such continuance is approved
at least annually thereafter by a vote of a majority of the
Trust's Trustees, who are not parties to such Agreement or
interested persons of such a party, cast in person at a meeting
called for the purpose of voting on such approval.  This
Agreement will terminate with respect to a Fund without the
payment of any penalty upon termination of the Investment
Advisory Agreement relating to the Fund by either party thereto
(accompanied by simultaneous notice to the Subadviser) or upon
sixty days' written notice to the Subadviser that the Trustees
of the Trust, the Investment Adviser or the shareholders by vote
of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund,
as provided by the 1940 Act, have terminated this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated
upon less than sixty days' notice to the Subadviser upon a
material breach of this Agreement or if the Trustees determine
that other circumstances have, or likely will have, a material
adverse effect on the Subadviser's abilities to perform its
obligations hereunder, including without limitation,
notification of the departure of a portfolio manager of the Fund
or other key personnel change.  This Agreement may also be
terminated by the Subadviser with respect to a Fund without
penalty upon sixty days' written notice to the Investment
Adviser and the Trust.
      This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect
to a Fund in the event of its assignment or, upon notice thereof
to the Subadviser, the assignment of the Investment Advisory
Agreement, unless its continuation thereafter is approved by the
Board of Trustees of the Trust and the shareholders of the Fund
if so required by the 1940 Act (in each case as the term
assignment is defined in Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act,
subject to such exemptions as may be granted by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) by any rule, regulation, order
or interpretive guidance).
      5.	Subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of
the Trust and the Investment Adviser, the Subadviser will
provide an investment program for the Allocated Assets,
including investment research and management with respect to
securities and investments, including cash and cash equivalents,
and will determine from time to time what securities and other
investments will be purchased, retained or sold.  The Subadviser
will provide the services under this Agreement in accordance
with each Fund's investment objective, policies and restrictions
as stated in the Prospectus, as provided to the Subadviser by
the Investment Adviser.  The Subadviser further agrees that, in
all matters relating to the performance of this Agreement, it:
            (a)	shall act in conformity with the Trust's
Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and currently effective
registration statements under the 1940 Act and the Securities
Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act) and any amendments or supplements
thereto (the Registration Statements) and with the written
policies, procedures and guidelines of each Fund, and written
instructions and directions of the Trustees of the Trust and
shall comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act) and the
rules thereunder, and all other applicable federal and state
laws and regulations.  The Trust agrees to provide Subadviser
with copies of the Trust's Declaration of Trust, By-Laws,
Registration Statements, the Investment Advisory Agreement,
written policies, procedures and guidelines, and written
instructions and directions of the Trustees, and any amendments
or supplements to any of them at, or, if practicable, before the
time such materials, instructions or directives become
effective;
            (b)	will maintain at all times during the term of
this Agreement, in full force and effect, insurance, including
without limitation errors and omissions insurance, with
reputable insurance carriers, in such amounts, covering such
risks and liabilities, and with such deductibles and self-
insurance as are consistent with customary industry practice;
            (c)	will pay expenses incurred by it in connection
with its activities under this Agreement other than the cost of
securities and other investments (including brokerage
commissions and other transaction changes, if any) purchased for
each Fund, provided that the Subadviser will not pay for or
provide a credit with respect to any research provided to it in
accordance with Section 6;
            (d)	will review the daily valuation of securities
comprising the Allocated Assets of each Fund as obtained on a
daily basis by the Fund's administrator and furnished by it to
Subadviser, and will promptly notify the Trust and the
Investment Adviser if the Subadviser believes that any such
valuations may not properly reflect the market value of any
securities owned by the Fund, provided, however, that the
Subadviser is not required by this subparagraph to obtain
valuations of any such securities from brokers or dealers or
otherwise, or to otherwise independently verify valuations of
any such securities;
            (e)	unless otherwise instructed, will be responsible
for voting all proxies of the Allocated Assets in accordance
with the Proxy Voting Policies and Guidelines of Subadviser (the
Proxy Policy), provided that such Proxy Policy and any
amendments thereto are furnished to the Trust;
            (f)	will attend regular business and investment-
related meetings with the Trust's Board of Trustees and the
Investment Adviser if requested to do so by the Trust and/or the
Investment Adviser, and at its expense, shall supply the Board,
the officers of the Trust, and the Investment Adviser with all
information and reports reasonably required by them and
reasonably available to the Subadviser relating to the services
provided by the Subadviser hereunder;
            (g)	will maintain books and records with respect to
the securities transactions for the Allocated Assets of each
Fund and proxy voting record for the Allocated Assets of the
Fund, furnish to the Investment Adviser and the Trust's Board of
Trustees such periodic and special reports as they may request
with respect to the Fund, and provide in advance to the
Investment Adviser all of the Subadviser's reports to the
Trust's Board of Trustees for examination and review within a
reasonable time prior to the Trust's Board meetings; and
            (h)	will pay expenses incurred by the Trust for any
matters related to any transaction or event that is deemed to
result in a change of control of the Subadviser or otherwise
result in the assignment of the Sub-Investment Advisory
Agreement under the 1940 Act.
      6.	In executing Fund transactions and selecting brokers
or dealers, the Subadviser will use reasonable efforts to seek
on behalf of a Fund the best overall terms available under the
circumstances.  In assessing the best overall terms available
for any transaction, the Subadviser shall consider all factors
that it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the
breadth of the market in the security, execution quality in
light of order size, difficulty of execution and other relevant
factors, the quality, reliability, responsiveness and value of
the provided services, and the operational compatibility between
the broker-dealer and Subadviser, the price of the security, the
financial condition and execution capability of the broker or
dealer, and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, both
for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis.  In
evaluating the best overall terms available, and in selecting
the broker-dealer to execute a particular transaction, the
Subadviser also may consider brokerage and research services
provided (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)).  Subject
to any guidelines established by the Board of Trustees of the
Trust and the provisions of Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act
and interpretations thereunder, the Subadviser is authorized to
pay to a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and
research services a commission for executing a portfolio
transaction for a Fund which is in excess of the amount of
commission another broker or dealer would have charged for
effecting that transaction if the Subadviser determines in good
faith that such commission was reasonable in relation to the
value of the brokerage and research services provided by such
broker or dealer, viewed in terms of that particular transaction
or in terms of the overall responsibilities of the Subadviser to
its discretionary clients, including a Fund.  In addition, the
Subadviser is authorized to allocate purchase and sale orders
for securities to brokers or dealers (including brokers and
dealers that are affiliated with the Investment Adviser, the
Subadviser or the Trust's principal underwriter) if the
Subadviser reasonably believes that the quality of the
transaction and the commission are comparable to what they would
be with other qualified firms.  In no instance, however, will a
Fund's assets be purchased from or sold to the Investment
Adviser, the Subadviser, the Trust's principal underwriter, or
any affiliated person of either the Trust, the Investment
Adviser, the Subadviser or the principal underwriter, acting as
principal in the transaction, except to the extent permitted by
the SEC and the 1940 Act, including any rules issued under the
1940 Act.
      7.	The Investment Adviser or its affiliates may, from
time to time, engage other subadvisers to advise other series of
the Trust (or portions thereof) or other registered investment
companies (or series or portions thereof) that may be deemed to
be under common control (each a Sub-Advised Fund).  The
Subadviser agrees that it will not consult with any other
subadviser engaged by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates
with respect to transactions in securities or other assets
concerning a Fund or another Sub-Advised Fund, except to the
extent permitted by the rules under the 1940 Act that permit
certain transactions with a subadviser or its affiliates.
Subadviser shall not provide investment advice with respect to
any assets of a Fund other than the Allocated Assets.
Subadviser shall be the exclusive subadviser to all Funds listed
in Schedule A.
      8.	Subadviser agrees with respect to the services
provided to each Fund that:
            (a)	it will promptly communicate to the Investment
Adviser such information relating to Fund transactions as the
officers and Trustees of the Trust may reasonably request and as
communicated to the Subadviser;
            (b)	it will treat confidentially and as proprietary
information of the Trust all records and other information
relative to each Fund and its prior, present or potential
shareholders (Confidential Information), it will comply at all
times with all applicable laws and regulations relating to the
confidentiality of nonpublic personal information including
the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or other federal or state privacy
laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and will not
use such Confidential Information for any purpose other than the
performance of its responsibilities and duties hereunder (except
after prior notification to and approval in writing by the
Trust, which approval may not be withheld where Subadviser is
advised by counsel that the Subadviser may be exposed to civil
or criminal contempt or other proceedings for failure to comply,
when requested to divulge such information by duly constituted
authorities, or when so requested by the Trust); and
            (c)	it has disclosed any litigation or governmental
investigation that could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on its ability to perform the services
hereunder to the Investment Adviser and the Trust.
      9.	Each party represents and warrants to the other party
that the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
is within its powers and have been duly authorized by all
necessary actions of its directors or members, and no action by,
or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency
or official is required on the part of either party for
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and the
execution, delivery and performance by either party of this
Agreement does not contravene or constitute a violation of, or a
material default under, (i) any provision of applicable law,
rule or regulation, (ii) such party's governing instruments, or
(iii) any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or
other instrument binding upon such party.
      10.	In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, Subadviser acknowledges that all records
which it maintains for the Trust are the property of the Trust
and agrees to surrender promptly to the Trust any of such
records upon the Trust's request, provided that Subadviser may
retain copies thereof at its own expense.  Subadviser further
agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2
under the 1940 Act the records required to be maintained by Rule
31a-1 under the 1940 Act relating to transactions placed by
Subadviser for the Fund.  Subadviser further agrees to maintain
each Fund's proxy voting record with respect to the Allocated
Assets in a form mutually agreeable between the parties and
which contains the information required by Form N-PX under the
1940 Act.
      11.	It is expressly understood and agreed that the
services to be rendered by the Subadviser to the Investment
Adviser under the provisions of this Agreement are not to be
deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser shall be free to
provide similar or different services to others so long as its
ability to provide the services provided for in this Agreement
shall not be materially impaired thereby.  In addition, but
without limiting any separate agreement between the Subadviser
and the Investment Adviser to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any director,
officer, or employee of the Subadviser who may also be a
Trustee, officer, or employee of the Trust, to engage in any
other business or to devote his or her time and attention in
part to the management or other aspects of any other business,
whether of a similar nature or a dissimilar nature.
      12.	The Investment Adviser agrees that it will furnish
currently to the Subadviser all information with reference to
each Fund and the Trust that is reasonably necessary to permit
the Subadviser to carry out its responsibilities under this
Agreement, and the parties agree that they will from time to
time consult and make appropriate arrangements as to specific
information that is required under this paragraph and the
frequency and manner with which it shall be supplied.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Investment Adviser
will furnish to Subadviser procedures consistent with the
Trust's contract with each Fund's custodian from time to time
(the Custodian), and reasonably satisfactory to Subadviser,
for consummation of portfolio transactions for each Fund by
payment to or delivery by the Custodian of all cash and/or
securities or other investments due to or from the Fund, and
Subadviser shall not have possession or custody thereof or any
responsibility or liability with respect to such custody.  Upon
giving proper instructions to the Custodian, Subadviser shall
have no responsibility or liability with respect to custodial
arrangements or the acts, omissions or other conduct of the
Custodian.
      13.	The Subadviser and its directors, officers,
stockholders, employees and agents shall not be liable for any
error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by
the Investment Adviser or the Trust in connection with any
matters to which this Agreement relates or for any other act or
omission in the performance by the Subadviser of its duties
under this Agreement except that nothing herein contained shall
be construed to protect the Subadviser against any liability by
reason of the Subadviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or
gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reckless
disregard of its obligations or duties under this Agreement.
      14.	Each party shall indemnify and hold harmless the other
party and its respective control persons (as described in
Section 15 of the 1933 Act) and their respective directors,
stockholders, members and employees (collectively,
Indemnitees) against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses (including reasonable legal and other
expenses of investigating or defending any alleged loss, claim,
damages or liabilities) to which any of the Indemnitees may
become subject under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or the Advisers
Act, or under any other statute, at common law or otherwise,
arising out of or based on (i) any willful misfeasance, bad
faith, or gross negligence of the other party in the performance
of any of its duties or obligations hereunder or reckless
disregard of its obligation or duties, or (ii) any material
breach of this Agreement by the other party.
      15.	If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or
made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or otherwise,
the remainder of the Agreement shall not be affected thereby.
Except to the extent governed by federal law including the 1940
Act, this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
applying the principles of conflicts of law thereunder.
      16.	No provision of this Agreement may be changed,
discharged or terminated orally, but only by an instrument in
writing signed by the party against which enforcement of the
change, discharge or termination is sought.  No amendment of
this Agreement shall be effective with respect to the Trust
until approved as required by applicable law.
      17.	Any notice to be given hereunder may be given by
personal notification or by facsimile transmission, to the party
