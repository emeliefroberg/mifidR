"1988","	If the Trustees elect to follow the"

"1990","this Section 3, the Trustees, upon the written"

Commission), together with a copy of the"
"2000","material to be mailed, a written statement"
"2001","signed by at least a majority of the Trustees to"
"2002","the effect that in their opinion either such"
"2003","material contains untrue statements of fact or"
"2004","omits to state facts necessary to make the"
"2005","statements contained therein not misleading,"
"2006","or would violate applicable law, and"
"2007","specifying the basis of such opinion."
"2008","	After the Commission has had an"

"2010","specified in the written statement so filed by"
"2011","the Trustees, the Trustees or such applicants"
"2012","may demand that the Commission enter an"
"2013","order either sustaining one or more of such"
"2014","objections or refusing to sustain any of such"
"2015","objections.  If the Commission shall enter an"

"2017","objections, or if, after the entry of an order"
"2018","sustaining one or more of such objections,"
"2019","the Commission shall find, after notice and"
"2020","opportunity for hearing, that all objections so"
"2021","sustained have been met, and shall enter an"

"2030","may not be amended or repealed without the"
"2031","vote of a majority of the Trustees and a"
"2032","majority of the outstanding shares of the"
"2033","Trust.  These same provisions shall be"
"2034","deemed null, void, inoperative and removed"
"2035","from these By-Laws upon the effectiveness of"
"2036","any amendment to the Act which eliminates"
"2037","them from Section 16 of the Act or the"

"2045","incompetence, or other incapacity to perform"
"2046","the duties of the office, or removal, of a"
"2047","Trustee. No such vacancy shall operate to"
"2048","annul these By-Laws or to revoke any existing"
"2049","agency created pursuant to the terms of"
"2050","these By-Laws.  In the case of a vacancy,"
"2051","including a vacancy resulting from an increase"
"2052","in the number of Trustees, such vacancy may"
"2053","be filled by (i) holders of a plurality of the"
"2054","Shares entitled to vote, acting at any meeting"

"2056","Laws, or (ii) to the extent permitted by the"
"2057","1940 Act, the vote of a majority of the"
"2058","Trustees. As soon as any Trustee so appointed"
"2059","shall have accepted this trust, the trust estate"
"2060","shall vest in the new Trustee or Trustees,"
"2061","together with the continuing Trustees,"
"2062","without any further act or conveyance, and he"
"2063","shall be deemed a Trustee hereunder and"
"2064","under the Declaration of Trust. The power of"
"2065","appointment is subject to the provisions of"
"2066","Section l6(a) of the Act. Any Trustee so"
"2067","elected by the holders or appointed by the"
"2068","Trustees shall hold office as provided in these"
"2069","By-Laws."
"2070","SECTION 5.  Temporary Absence of Trustee."
"2071","Any Trustee may, by power of attorney,"
"2072","delegate his power for a period not"
"2073","exceeding six months at an one time to any"
"2074","other Trustee or Trustees, provided that in no"
"2075","case shall less than two Trustees personally"
"2076","exercise the other powers hereunder except"
"2077","as herein otherwise expressly provided."
"2078","SECTION 6.  Effect of Death, Resignation,"
"2079","Removal, Etc. of a Trustee.  The death,"
"2080","declination, resignation, retirement, removal,"
"2081","or incapacity of the Trustees, or anyone of"
"2082","them, shall not operate to annul the Trust or"
"2083","to revoke any existing agency created"
"2084","pursuant to the terms of the Declaration of"
"2085","Trust or these By-Laws."
"2086","ARTICLE II"

"2094","SECTION 2.  Election of Officers.  The"
"2095","President, Treasurer and Secretary shall be"
"2096","chosen annually by the Trustees."

"2099","a single person.  The officers shall hold office"
"2100","until their successors are chosen and"

"2102","SECTION 3.  Resignations and Removals.  Any"

"2106","take effect on being so filed or at such time as"
"2107","may otherwise be specified therein.  The"

"2110","ARTICLE III"
"2111","Powers and Duties of Trustees and Officers"

"2982","REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"2983","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"2984","To the Trustees of Eaton Vance Municipals"
"2985","Trust and Shareholders of Eaton Vance"
"2986","Municipal Opportunities Fund:"
"2987","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"2988","financial statements of Eaton Vance"
"2989","Municipal Opportunities Fund (the Fund)"
"2990","(one of the funds constituting Eaton Vance"
"2991","Municipals Trust) as of and for the year"
"2992","ended July 31, 2012, in accordance with the"
"2993","standards of the Public Company"
"2994","Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"2995","States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"2996","control over financial reporting, including"
"2997","controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"2998","basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"2999","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"3000","the financial statements and to comply with"
"3001","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"3002","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"3003","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"3004","control over financial reporting."
"3005","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3006","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"3007","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"3008","internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"3009","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"3010","judgments by management are required to"
"3011","assess the expected benefits and related"
"3012","costs of controls.  A fund's internal control"
"3013","over financial reporting is a process designed"
"3014","to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"3015","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"3016","preparation of financial statements for"
"3017","external purposes in accordance with"
"3018","generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"3019","fund's internal control over financial"
"3020","reporting includes those policies and"
"3021","procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"3022","maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"3023","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"3024","transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"3025","the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"3026","that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"3027","permit preparation of financial statements in"
"3028","accordance with generally accepted"
"3029","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"3030","expenditures of the fund are being made"
"3031","only in accordance with authorizations of"
"3032","management of the fund and trustees of the"
"3033","trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"3034","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"3035","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition"
"3036","of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"3037","effect on the financial statements."
"3038","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"3039","control over financial reporting may not"
"3040","prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"3041","projections of any evaluation of"
"3042","effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"3043","the risk that controls may become"
"3044","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"3045","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"3046","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3047","A deficiency in internal control over"
"3048","financial reporting exists when the design or"
"3049","operation of a control does not allow"
"3050","management or employees, in the normal"
"3051","course of performing their assigned"
"3052","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"3053","on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"3054","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"3055","in internal control over financial reporting,"
"3056","such that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"3057","a material misstatement of a fund's annual or"
"3058","interim financial statements will not be"
"3059","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3060","Our consideration of the Fund's internal"
"3061","control over financial reporting was for the"
"3062","limited purpose described in the first"
"3063","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"3064","disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"3065","that might be material weaknesses under"
"3066","standards established by the Public"
"3067","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"3068","(United States).  However, we noted no"
"3069","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control"
"3070","over financial reporting and its operation,"
"3071","including controls for safeguarding securities"
"3072","that we consider to be a material weakness,"
"3073","as defined above, as of July 31, 2012."

"3102","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"3103","financial statements of Eaton Vance Arizona"
"3104","Municipal Income Fund, Eaton Vance"
"3105","Connecticut Municipal Income Fund, Eaton"
"3106","Vance Minnesota Municipal Income Fund,"
"3107","Eaton Vance New Jersey Municipal Income"
"3108","Fund and Eaton Vance Pennsylvania"
"3109","Municipal Income Fund (collectively the"
"3110","Funds) (certain of the funds constituting"
"3111","Eaton Vance Municipals Trust) as of and for"
"3112","the year ended July 31, 2012, in accordance"
"3113","with the standards of the Public Company"
"3114","Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"3115","States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"3116","control over financial reporting, including"
"3117","controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"3118","basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"3119","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"3120","the financial statements and to comply with"
"3121","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"3122","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"3123","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"3124","control over financial reporting."
"3125","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3126","The management of the Funds is responsible"
"3127","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"3128","internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"3129","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"3130","judgments by management are required to"
"3131","assess the expected benefits and related"
"3132","costs of controls.  A fund's internal control"
"3133","over financial reporting is a process designed"
"3134","to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"3135","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"3136","preparation of financial statements for"
"3137","external purposes in accordance with"
"3138","generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"3139","fund's internal control over financial"
"3140","reporting includes those policies and"
"3141","procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"3142","maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"3143","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"3144","transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"3145","the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"3146","that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"3147","permit preparation of financial statements in"
"3148","accordance with generally accepted"
"3149","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"3150","expenditures of the fund are being made"
"3151","only in accordance with authorizations of"
"3152","management and trustees of the trust; and"
"3153","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"3154","prevention or timely detection of"
"3155","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition"
"3156","of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"3157","effect on the financial statements."
"3158","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"3159","control over financial reporting may not"
"3160","prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"3161","projections of any evaluation of"
"3162","effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"3163","the risk that controls may become"
"3164","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"3165","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"3166","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3167","A deficiency in internal control over"
"3168","financial reporting exists when the design or"
"3169","operation of a control does not allow"
"3170","management or employees, in the normal"
"3171","course of performing their assigned"
"3172","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"3173","on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"3174","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"3175","in internal control over financial reporting,"
"3176","such that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"3177","a material misstatement of a fund's annual or"
"3178","interim financial statements will not be"
"3179","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3180","Our consideration of the Funds' internal"
"3181","control over financial reporting was for the"
"3182","limited purpose described in the first"
"3183","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"3184","disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"3185","that might be material weaknesses under"
"3186","standards established by the Public"
"3187","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"3188","(United States).  However, we noted no"
"3189","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control"
"3190","over financial reporting and their operation,"
"3191","including controls for safeguarding securities"
"3192","that we consider to be a material weakness,"
"3193","as defined above, as of July 31, 2012."
"3194","This report is intended solely for the"
"3195","information and use of management and the"
"3196","Trustees of Eaton Vance Municipals Trust"

"3198","Commission and is not intended to be and"
"3199","should not be used by anyone other than"
