"2792","Management a fee, which is paid quarterly and is a percentage of average"
"2793","daily net assets under management by Wellington Management during the"

"2811","provide investment advisory services to the GNMA Fund, and may provide"

"2813","Fund, on an at-cost basis, at any time. Vanguard may also recommend to the"
"2814","board of trustees that an advisor be hired, terminated, or replaced, or"
"2815","that terms of an existing advisory agreement be revised."
