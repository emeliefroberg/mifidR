"865","(collectively, the"

"867","the year ended"

"869","in accordance with"
"870","the standards of the"
"871","Public Company"
"872","Accounting"
"873","Oversight Board"
"874","(United States), we"

"876","internal control over"

"879","over safeguarding"
"880","securities, as a basis"
"881","for designing our"
"882","auditing procedures"
"883","for the purpose of"
"884","expressing our"
"885","opinion on the"
"886","financial statements"
"887","and to comply with"
"888","the requirements of"
"889","Form N-SAR, but not"
"890","for the purpose of"
"891","expressing an opinion"
"892","on the effectiveness"
"893","of the Funds? internal"
"894","control over financial"
"895","reporting."
"896","Accordingly, we"
"897","express no such"
"898","opinion."
"899","Management of the"
"900","Funds is responsible"
"901","for establishing and"
"902","maintaining effective"
"903","internal control over"
"904","financial reporting. In"
"905","fulfilling this"
"906","responsibility,"
"907","estimates and"
"908","judgments by"
"909","management are"
"910","required to assess the"
"911","expected benefits and"
"912","related costs of"
"913","controls. A"
"914","company?s internal"
"915","control over financial"
"916","reporting is a process"
"917","designed to provide"
"918","reasonable assurance"
"919","regarding the"
"920","reliability of financial"
"921","reporting and the"
"922","preparation of"
"923","financial statements"
"924","for external purposes"
"925","in accordance with"
"926","generally accepted"
"927","accounting principles."
"928","A company?s internal"
"929","control over financial"
"930","reporting includes"
"931","those policies and"
"932","procedures that (1)"
"933","pertain to the"
"934","maintenance of"
"935","records that, in"
"936","reasonable detail,"
"937","accurately and fairly"
"938","reflect the"
"939","transactions and"
"940","dispositions of the"
"941","assets of the"
"942","company; (2) provide"
"943","reasonable assurance"
"944","that transactions are"
"945","recorded as necessary"
"946","to permit preparation"
"947","of financial"
"948","statements in"
"949","accordance with"
"950","generally accepted"
"951","accounting principles,"
"952","and that receipts and"
"953","expenditures of the"
"954","company are being"
"955","made in accordance"
"956","with authorizations of"
"957","management and"
"958","directors of the"
"959","company; and (3)"
"960","provide reasonable"
"961","assurance regarding"
"962","prevention or timely"
"963","detection of the"
"964","unauthorized"
"965","acquisition, use, or"
"966","disposition of the"
"967","company?s assets that"
"968","could have a material"
"969","effect on the financial"
"970","statements."
"971","Because of its"
"972","inherent limitations,"
"973","internal control over"
"974","financial reporting"
"975","may not prevent or"
"976","detect misstatements."
"977","Also, projections of"
"978","any evaluation of"
"979","effectiveness to"
"980","future periods are"
"981","subject to the risk that"
"982","controls may become"
"983","inadequate because of"
"984","changes in"
"985","conditions, or that the"
"986","degree of compliance"
"987","with the policies or"
"988","procedures may"
"989","deteriorate."
"990","A deficiency in"
"991","internal control over"
"992","financial reporting"
"993","exists when the"
"994","design or operation of"
"995","a control does not"
"996","allow management or"
"997","employees, in the"
"998","normal course of"
"999","performing their"
"1000","assigned functions, to"
"1001","prevent or detect"
"1002","misstatements on a"
"1003","timely basis. A"
"1004","material weakness is"
"1005","a deficiency, or a"
"1006","combination of"
"1007","deficiencies, in"
"1008","internal control over"
"1009","financial reporting,"
"1010","such that there is a"
"1011","reasonable possibility"
"1012","that a material"
"1013","misstatement of the"
"1014","Funds? annual or"
"1015","interim financial"
"1016","statements will not be"
"1017","prevented or detected"
"1018","on a timely basis."
"1019","Our consideration of"
"1020","the Funds? internal"
"1021","control over financial"
"1022","reporting was for the"
"1023","limited purpose"
"1024","described in the first"
"1025","paragraph and would"
"1026","not necessarily"
"1027","disclose all"
"1028","deficiencies in"
"1029","internal control that"
"1030","might be material"
"1031","weaknesses under"

"1033","by the Public"
"1034","Company Accounting"
"1035","Oversight Board"
"1036","(United States)."
"1037","However, we noted"
"1038","no deficiencies in the"
"1039","Funds? internal"
"1040","control over financial"
"1041","reporting and its"
"1042","operation, including"
"1043","controls over"
"1044","safeguarding"
"1045","securities that we"
