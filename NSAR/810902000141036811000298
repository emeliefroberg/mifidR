"1498","================================================================================"
"1499","DISCLOSURE REGARDING THE APPROVAL OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENTS FOR"
"1500","BARON ASSET FUND, BARON GROWTH FUND, BARON SMALL CAP FUND, BARON OPPORTUNITY"
"1501","FUND AND BARON FIFTH AVENUE GROWTH FUND, BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES (Unaudited)"
"1502","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
"1503","The Board of Trustees (the Board) of Baron Investment Funds Trust (the"
"1504","Trust) met on May 17, 2011 to discuss the selection of BAMCO, Inc. (the"
"1505","Adviser) as the investment adviser and the approval of the investment advisory"
"1506","agreements for Baron Asset Fund, Baron Growth Fund, Baron Small Cap Fund, Baron"
"1507","Opportunity Fund and Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund, (each a Fund and"
"1508","collectively, the Funds). The members of the Board who are not affiliated with"
"1509","the Trust (the Independent Trustees) met in a separate session to discuss and"
"1510","consider the renewal of the advisory contract for the Funds. An independent"
"1511","consultant provided reports to the Board and attended the Board meeting. The"
"1512","Trustees received a substantial amount of information from the Adviser and from"
"1513","the consultant, and were advised by independent counsel. Based on its evaluation"
"1514","of this and other information, the Board, including a majority of the"
"1515","Independent Trustees, approved the continuation of the advisory agreements for"
"1516","the Funds for an additional one-year period."
"1517","In reaching its determination, the Board considered various factors that it"
"1518","deemed relevant, including the factors listed below."
"1519","1. NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES"
"1520","As part of their consideration of the nature, extent and quality of services"
"1521","provided by the Adviser, the Independent Trustees relied on the information they"
"1522","received at the Board meeting, as well as on the information they had considered"
"1523","in past years. In particular, the Board considered the following:"
"1524","   o Their confidence in the Adviser's senior personnel, portfolio management,"
"1525","     the financial condition of the Adviser and its affiliates and the Adviser's"
"1526","     available resources;"
"1527","   o The nature, quality and the level of long-term performance of the services"
"1528","     provided by the Adviser, including: intensive devotion to research,"
"1529","     selection of broker/dealers for Fund portfolio transactions, relationships"
"1530","     with and supervision of third party service providers, such as the Funds'"
"1531","     custodian and transfer agent, the quality of shareholder reports, the"
"1532","     ability to monitor adherence to investment guidelines and restrictions,"
"1533","     the legal, accounting and compliance services provided to the Funds and"
"1534","     the support services provided to the Board;"
"1535","   o The Adviser's investment principles and processes and the historical"
"1536","     performance of the Funds as compared to similar funds managed by other"
"1537","     advisers and other funds managed by the Adviser over comparable periods;"
"1538","   o The total expense ratio of the Funds and comparisons to similar funds"
"1539","     managed by other advisers over comparable periods;"
"1540","   o The costs of portfolio management, including the types of investments made"
"1541","     for the Funds, the personnel and systems necessary for implementation of"
"1542","     investment strategies, and the pre-tax profits realized by the Adviser and"
"1543","     its affiliates from their relationship with the Funds; and"
"1544","   o Any additional services provided by the Adviser."
"1545","The Board concluded that the nature, extent and quality of the services provided"
"1546","by the Adviser to each Fund was appropriate and that each Fund was likely to"
"1547","continue to benefit from those services provided under the relevant advisory"
"1548","agreement with the Adviser."
"1549","2. INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF THE FUNDS AND THE ADVISER"
"1550","As part of its consideration of the investment performance of the Funds and the"
"1551","Adviser, the Board took into account the analyses performed by and discussed"
"1552","with the independent consultant. The Board considered for each Fund, among other"
"1553","information, the independent consultant's comparisons of the expense ratio and"
"1554","contractual advisory fee with those of peer group funds. The Board also"
"1555","considered the independent consultant's risk-adjusted performance comparisons"
"1556","with comparable funds and comparisons of each Fund's annualized total return"
"1557","over one-, three-, five- and ten-year periods, where applicable, against peer"
"1558","group funds and performance of peer group funds' averages. After considering all"
"1559","the information, the Board concluded that the Adviser continued to invest in"
"1560","accordance with its long-standing principles and that each Fund's more recent"
"1561","relative performance was consistent with expectations for the Adviser's"
"1562","investment style under recent market conditions. The Board noted the Funds'"
"1563","absolute performance in the most recent one-year period and the risk-adjusted"
"1564","performance comparisons. The Board also concluded that the Funds and their"
"1565","shareholders had benefited over the long- term from the Adviser's investment"
"1566","management of the Funds."
"1567","3. COSTS OF SERVICES PROVIDED AND PROFITS TO BE REALIZED BY THE ADVISER"
"1568","The Board was provided with information from the Adviser and the independent"
"1569","consultant regarding the fees charged by the Adviser as compared to the fees"
"1570","charged by comparable funds. This information compared various fees and"
"1571","expenses, as well as the total expense ratios, of the Funds against the same"
"1572","fees, expenses and total expense ratios of other funds of similar size,"
"1573","character and investment strategies. The total expense ratios of the Funds were"
"1574","generally competitive with the total expense ratios of the funds against which"
"1575","they were compared."
"1576","The Board considered comparisons of the advisory fees charged and services"
"1577","provided by the Adviser and its investment adviser affiliate to the Funds,"
"1578","sub-advised accounts and separately managed accounts. The Board considered that,"
"1579","while the advisory fees for the other clients are the same as, or lower than,"
"1580","the fees for the Funds, the Adviser or its affiliate performs significantly"
"1581","fewer services for those clients compared with those provided by the Adviser to"
"1582","the Funds."
"1583","4. ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND BENEFITS TO INVESTORS"
"1584","The Board considered the extent to which each Fund's management fee reflected"
"1585","economies of scale for the benefit of Fund shareholders. The Board considered"
"1586","that, except for Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund, the Funds' fee schedules do not"
"1587","have break points. The Board considered that the small- and mid-cap investment"
"1588","strategies require more attention by the Adviser than a strategy that involves"
"1589","large-cap equities, particularly as the size of the assets under management"
"1590","increases. The Board considered that the Adviser was continuing to grow and"
"1591","upgrade its staff and invest in its business even during this recent period of"
"1592","declining assets and reduced revenues. The Board reiterated its intention to"
"1593","continue to scrutinize the extent of economies of scale, asset growth and the"
"1594","Adviser's plans to reinvest further to support the Funds. The Board concluded"
"1595","that the management fee for each Fund was reasonable in light of the services"
"1596","provided as discussed at the meeting, including the Adviser's investments in"
"1597","resources to support the Funds."
"1598","After due consideration of the above-enumerated factors and other factors, the"
"1599","Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, concluded that approval"
"1600","of each Fund's investment advisory agreement was in the best interests of the"
"1601","respective Fund and its shareholders."

"1610","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1611","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"1612","Baron Investment Funds Trust"
"1613","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Baron"
"1614","Asset Fund, Baron Growth Fund, Baron Small Cap Fund, Baron Opportunity Fund"
"1615","and Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund (five of the portfolios constituting the"
"1616","Baron Investment Funds Trust, hereafter referred to as the Funds) as of and"
"1617","for the year ended September 30, 2011, in accordance with the standards of the"
"1618","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1619","Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1620","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"1621","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"1622","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1623","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"1624","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"1625","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"1626","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1627","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1628","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1629","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal"
"1630","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1631","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1632","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1633","accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"1634","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1635","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1636","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"1637","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"1638","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1639","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"1640","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1641","trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1642","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1643","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1644","statements."
"1645","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1646","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1647","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1648","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1649","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1650","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1651","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1652","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1653","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1654","deficiency, or a"
"1655","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1656","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"1657","the Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1658","detected on a timely basis."
"1659","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"1660","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1661","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"1662","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established"
"1663","by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"1664","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1665","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"1666","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of September"
"1667","30, 2011."
"1668","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"1669","the Board of Trustees of Baron Investment Funds Trust and the Securities and"
"1670","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
"1671","other than these specified parties."
