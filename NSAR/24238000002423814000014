"3128","investment objective, policies and limitations as provided in the Portfolio's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as"

"3132","the investments of the Portfolio; and shall pay the salaries and fees of all officers of the Fund, of all Trustees of the Fund who"
"3133","are &quot;interested persons&quot; of the Fund or of the Adviser and of all personnel of the Fund or the Adviser performing services"
"3134","relating to research, statistical and investment activities.  The Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with the Portfolio, to buy, sell, lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment"
"3135","instruments on behalf of the Portfolio.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times"
"3136","be subject to the control and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."
"3137","</P>"
"3138","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(b)	Management Services.  The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for the performance by its affiliates of) the"
"3139","management and administrative services necessary for the operation of the Fund.  The Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees, perform various services for the Portfolio, including but not limited to: (i) providing the Portfolio with office space, equipment and facilities (which may be its own) for maintaining its organization; (ii) on behalf of the"
"3140","Portfolio, supervising relations with, and monitoring the performance of, custodians, depositories, transfer and pricing agents,"

"3142","or desirable; (iii) preparing all general shareholder communications, including shareholder reports; (iv) conducting shareholder relations; (v) maintaining the Fund's existence and its records; (vi) during such times as shares are publicly offered, maintaining the registration and qualification of the Portfolio's shares under federal and state law; and (vii) investigating the development of and developing and implementing, if appropriate, management and shareholder services designed to enhance the"
"3143","value or convenience of the Portfolio as an investment vehicle."
"3144","</P>"
"3145","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	The Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations, information or analyses to the Fund as the Fund's Board of"
"3146","Trustees may request from time to time or as the Adviser may deem to be desirable.  The Adviser shall make recommendations to the Fund's Board of Trustees with respect to Fund policies, and shall carry out such policies as are adopted by the"
"3147","Trustees.  The Adviser shall, subject to review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other services as the Adviser shall from"
"3148","time to time determine to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under this Contract."
"3149","</P>"
"3150","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(c)	The Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's account with brokers or dealers selected by the Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the Adviser.  The"
"3151","Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Portfolio and"
"3152","at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to"
"3153","execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as"
"3154","those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts"
"3155","over which the Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer"
"3156","who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which"
"3157","is in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the"
"3158","Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"3159","research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular"
"3160","transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they"
"3161","exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to"
"3162","determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio."
"3163","</P>"
"3164","<P ID=C__\desktop\P.\q77q1act.doc.html.2 ALIGN=LEFT>	The Adviser shall, in acting hereunder, be an independent contractor.  The Adviser shall not be an agent of the Portfolio."
"3165","</P>"
"3166","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	2.	It is understood that the Trustees, officers and shareholders of the Fund are or may be or become interested in"
"3167","the Adviser as directors, officers or otherwise and that directors, officers and stockholders of the Adviser are or may be or"
"3168","become similarly interested in the Fund, and that the Adviser may be or become interested in the Fund as a shareholder or"
"3169","otherwise."
"3170","</P>"
"3171","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	3.	The Adviser will be compensated on the following basis for the services and facilities to be furnished hereunder.  The"
"3172","Adviser shall receive a monthly management fee, payable monthly as soon as practicable after the last day of each month, composed"
"3173","of a Basic Fee and a Performance Adjustment.  Except as otherwise provided in sub-paragraph (e) of this paragraph 3, the Performance Adjustment is added to or subtracted from the Basic Fee depending on whether the Portfolio experienced better or worse performance than an appropriate index (the &quot;Index&quot;).  The Performance Adjustment is not cumulative.  An increased fee will result even"
"3174","though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been behind that of the"
"3175","Index, and, conversely, a reduction in the fee will be made for a month even though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been ahead of that of the Index.  The Basic Fee and the Performance Adjustment"
"3176","will be computed as follows:"
"3177","</P>"
"3178","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(a)	Basic Fee Rate:  The annual Basic Fee Rate shall be the sum of the Group Fee Rate and the Individual Fund Fee Rate"
"3179","calculated to the nearest millionth decimal place as follows:"
"3180","</P>"
"3181","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(i) Group Fee Rate.  The Group Fee Rate shall be based upon the monthly average of the net assets of the registered"
"3182","investment companies having Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser (computed in the manner set forth in"
"3183","the fund's Declaration of Trust or other organizational document) determined as of the close of business on each business day"
"3184","throughout the month. For this purpose, the monthly average net assets of registered investment companies that previously had Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser and currently have Advisory and Service or Management Contracts"
"3185","with Fidelity SelectCo, LLC are included. The Group Fee Rate shall be determined on a cumulative basis pursuant to the following"
"3186","schedule:"

"3928","instruments on behalf of the Portfolio.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times"
"3929","be subject to the control and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."

"3947","those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts"
"3948","over which the Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer"

"3952","research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular"
"3953","transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they"
"3954","exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to"

"3962","otherwise."
"3963","</P>"

"3965","month, composed of a Basic Fee and a Performance Adjustment.  Except as otherwise provided in sub-paragraph (e) of this"
"3966","paragraph 3, the Performance Adjustment is added to or subtracted from the Basic Fee depending on whether the Portfolio"
"3967","experienced better or worse performance than an appropriate index (the &quot;Index&quot;).  The Performance Adjustment is not cumulative.  An increased fee will result even though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the"
"3968","performance period has been behind that of the Index, and, conversely, a reduction in the fee will be made for a month even"
"3969","though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been ahead of that"
"3970","of the Index.  The Basic Fee and the Performance Adjustment will be computed as follows:"
"3971","</P>"
"3972","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(a)	Basic Fee Rate:  The annual Basic Fee Rate shall be the sum of the Group Fee Rate and the Individual Fund"
"3973","Fee Rate calculated to the nearest millionth decimal place as follows:"

"3975","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(i) Group Fee Rate.  The Group Fee Rate shall be based upon the monthly average of the net assets of the"

"3977","manner set forth in the fund's Declaration of Trust or other organizational document) determined as of the close of business"
"3978","on each business day throughout the month. For this purpose, the monthly average net assets of registered investment companies that previously had Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser and currently have Advisory and"
"3979","Service or Management Contracts with Fidelity SelectCo, LLC are included. The Group Fee Rate shall be determined on a"
"3980","cumulative basis pursuant to the following schedule:"

"4712","trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment instruments on behalf of the Portfolio. The investment policies and"
"4713","all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times be subject to the control and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."

"4715","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>	(b)	Management Services. The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for the performance by its affiliates of) the management"
"4716","and administrative services necessary for the operation of the Fund. The Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Board of"
"4717","Trustees, perform various services for the Portfolio, including but not limited to: (i) providing the Portfolio with office space,"
"4718","equipment and facilities (which may be its own) for maintaining its organization; (ii) on behalf of the Portfolio, supervising relations with, and monitoring the performance of, custodians, depositories, transfer and pricing agents, accountants, attorneys, underwriters, brokers and dealers, insurers and other persons in any capacity deemed to be necessary or desirable; (iii) preparing all"
"4719","general shareholder communications, including shareholder reports; (iv) conducting shareholder relations; (v) maintaining the"
"4720","Fund's existence and its records; (vi) during such times as shares are publicly offered, maintaining the registration and qualification of the Portfolio's shares under federal and state law; and (vii) investigating the development of and developing and implementing, if appropriate, management and shareholder services designed to enhance the value or convenience of the Portfolio as an"

"4722","</P>"
"4723","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>	The Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations, information or analyses to the Fund as the Fund's Board of Trustees may request from time to time or as the Adviser may deem to be desirable. The Adviser shall make recommendations to the"

"4725","be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under this Contract."
"4726","</P>"
"4727","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>	(c)	The Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's account with brokers or dealers selected by the Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the Adviser. The Adviser shall use its"
"4728","best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission rates"
"4729","which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received. In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section"
"4730","28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Adviser or its affiliates"
"4731","exercise investment discretion. The Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research"
"4732","services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of"
"4733","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer. This"
"4734","determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Adviser and its"
"4735","affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically"
"4736","review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio."
"4737","</P>"
"4738","<P ID=C__\desktop\P.\q77q1a_3.doc.html.2 ALIGN=JUSTIFY>	The Adviser shall, in acting hereunder, be an independent contractor. The Adviser shall not be an agent of the Portfolio."

"4740","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>2.	It is understood that the Trustees, officers and shareholders of the Fund are or may be or become interested in the Adviser as"
"4741","directors, officers or otherwise and that directors, officers and stockholders of the Adviser are or may be or become similarly interested in the Fund, and that the Adviser may be or become interested in the Fund as a shareholder or otherwise."
"4742","</P>"
"4743","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>3.	The Adviser will be compensated on the following basis for the services and facilities to be furnished hereunder. The Adviser shall receive a monthly management fee, payable monthly as soon as practicable after the last day of each month, composed"
"4744","of a Basic Fee and a Performance Adjustment. Except as otherwise provided in sub-paragraph (e) of this paragraph 3, the Performance Adjustment is added to or subtracted from the Basic Fee depending on whether the Portfolio experienced better or worse"
"4745","performance than &quot;an appropriate index&quot; (the &quot;Index&quot;). The Performance Adjustment is not cumulative. An increased fee will"
"4746","result even though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been behind"
"4747","that of the Index, and, conversely, a reduction in the fee will be made for a month even though the performance of the Portfolio over"
"4748","some period of time shorter than the performance period has been ahead of that of the Index. The Basic Fee and the Performance"
"4749","Adjustment will be computed as follows:"
"4750","</P>"
"4751","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>	(a)	Basic Fee Rate: The annual Basic Fee Rate shall be the sum of the Group Fee Rate and the Individual Fund Fee Rate"
"4752","calculated to the nearest millionth decimal place as follows:"
"4753","</P>"
"4754","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>		(i) Group Fee Rate. The Group Fee Rate shall be based upon the monthly average of the net assets of the registered"
"4755","investment companies having Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser (computed in the manner set forth"
"4756","in the Fund's Declaration of Trust or other organizational document) determined as of the close of business on each business day"
"4757","throughout the month. For this purpose, the monthly average net assets of registered investment companies that previously had"
"4758","Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser and currently have Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with Fidelity SelectCo, LLC are included. The Group Fee Rate shall be determined on a cumulative basis pursuant to the"
"4759","following schedule:"

"5492","trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment instruments on behalf of the Portfolio. The investment policies and"
"5493","all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times be subject to the control and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."

"5495","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>		(b)	Management Services. The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for the performance by its affiliates of) the management"
"5496","and administrative services necessary for the operation of the Fund. The Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Board of"
"5497","Trustees, perform various services for the Portfolio, including but not limited to: (i) providing the Portfolio with office space,"
"5498","equipment and facilities (which may be its own) for maintaining its organization; (ii) on behalf of the Portfolio, supervising relations with, and monitoring the performance of, custodians, depositories, transfer and pricing agents, accountants, attorneys, underwriters, brokers and dealers, insurers and other persons in any capacity deemed to be necessary or desirable; (iii) preparing all"
"5499","general shareholder communications, including shareholder reports; (iv) conducting shareholder relations; (v) maintaining the"

"5502","</P>"
"5503","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>	The Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations, information or analyses to the Fund as the Fund's Board of Trustees"

"5507","</P>"
"5508","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>		(c)	The Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's account with brokers or dealers selected by the Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the Adviser. The Adviser shall use its"
"5509","best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission rates"
"5510","which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received. In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section"
"5511","28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Adviser or its affiliates"
"5512","exercise investment discretion. The Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research"
"5513","services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of"
"5514","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer. This"
"5515","determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Adviser and its"
"5516","affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically"
"5517","review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio."

"5522","directors, officers or otherwise and that directors, officers and stockholders of the Adviser are or may be or become similarly interested in the Fund, and that the Adviser may be or become interested in the Fund as a shareholder or otherwise."
"5523","</P>"
"5524","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>	3.	The Adviser will be compensated on the following basis for the services and facilities to be furnished hereunder. The Adviser"
"5525","shall receive a monthly management fee, payable monthly as soon as practicable after the last day of each month, composed of a"
"5526","Basic Fee and a Performance Adjustment. The Performance Adjustment is added to or subtracted from the Basic Fee depending on"
"5527","whether the Portfolio experienced better or worse performance than the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index (the &quot;Index&quot;). The Performance"
"5528","Adjustment is not cumulative. An increased fee will result even though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time"
"5529","shorter than the performance period has been behind that of the Index, and, conversely, a reduction in the fee will be made for a month"
"5530","even though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been ahead of that of"
"5531","the Index. The Basic Fee and the Performance Adjustment will be computed as follows:"
"5532","</P>"
"5533","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>		(a)	Basic Fee Rate: The annual Basic Fee Rate shall be the sum of the Group Fee Rate and the Individual Fund Fee Rate"
"5534","calculated to the nearest millionth decimal place as follows:"

"5536","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>			(i)	Group Fee Rate. The Group Fee Rate shall be based upon the monthly average of the net assets of the registered"
"5537","investment companies having Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser (computed in the manner set forth in"
"5538","the fund's Declaration of Trust or other organizational document) determined as of the close of business on each business day"
"5539","throughout the month. For this purpose, the monthly average net assets of registered investment companies that previously had Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser and currently have Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with"
"5540","Fidelity SelectCo, LLC are included. The Group Fee Rate shall be determined on a cumulative basis pursuant to the following schedule:"

"6236","<P ALIGN=LEFT>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Fidelity Contrafund: Fidelity Contrafund as of"
"6237","and for the year ended December 31, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"6238","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust's internal control over financial reporting, including"
"6239","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"6240","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,  but not for the"

"6246","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"6247","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"6248","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"6249","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"6250","company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"6251","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"6252","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"6253","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"

"6264","allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"6265","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"6266","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Trust's"
"6267","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
