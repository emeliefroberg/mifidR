"1149","accordance with the"

"1151","Company Accounting"
"1152","Oversight Board (United"

"1157","controls over"
"1158","safeguarding securities,"
"1159","as a basis for designing"
"1160","our auditing procedures"
"1161","for the purpose of"
"1162","expressing our opinion"
"1163","on the financial"
"1164","statements and to"
"1165","comply with the"
"1166","requirements of Form"
"1167","N-SAR, but not for the"

"1169","an opinion on the"

"1173","Accordingly, we express"
"1174","no such opinion."
"1175","The management of the"
"1176","Fund is responsible for"
"1177","establishing and"

"1180","financial reporting. In"
"1181","fulfilling this"
"1182","responsibility, estimates"
"1183","and judgments by"
"1184","management are"
"1185","required to assess the"
"1186","expected benefits and"
"1187","related costs of"
"1188","controls. A fund's"

"1201","(GAAP). A fund's"
"1202","internal control over"

"1206","pertain to the"
"1207","maintenance of records"
"1208","that, in reasonable"

"1210","fairly reflect the"

"1217","recorded as necessary"
"1218","to permit preparation of"
"1219","financial statements in"
"1220","accordance with GAAP,"

"1238","Because of inherent"
"1239","limitations, internal"

"1251","changes in conditions,"
"1252","or that the degree of"
"1253","compliance with the"
"1254","policies or procedures"
"1255","may deteriorate."
"1256","A deficiency in internal"
"1257","control over financial"
"1258","reporting exists when"
"1259","the design or operation"
"1260","of a control does not"

"1263","normal course of"
"1264","performing their"
"1265","assigned functions, to"
"1266","prevent or detect"

"1272","deficiencies, in internal"
"1273","control over financial"
"1274","reporting, such that"
