"2250","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2251","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"2252","of PIMCO Equity Series:"
"2253","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"2254","statements of PIMCO Equity Series (the Funds) as of and"
"2255","for the year ended June 30, 2013, in accordance with the"
"2256","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"2257","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control"
"2258","over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"2259","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"2260","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"2261","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"2262","SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"2263","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2264","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"2265","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2266","reporting."
"2267","The management of the Funds are responsible for"
"2268","establishing and maintaining effective internal control over"
"2269","financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"2270","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"2271","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's"
"2272","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed"
"2273","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"2274","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"2275","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2276","accounting principles.  A company's internal control over"
"2277","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"2278","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"2279","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2280","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"2281","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2282","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2283","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"2284","and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being"
"2285","made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"2286","and trustees of the company; and (3)  provide reasonable"
"2287","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"2288","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"2289","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2290","statements."
"2291","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2292","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2293","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"2294","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2295","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"2296","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"2297","deteriorate."
"2298","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2299","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"2300","management or employees, in the normal course of"
"2301","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2302","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"2303","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"2304","over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"2305","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds' annual"
"2306","or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"2307","detected on a timely basis."
"2308","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2309","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2310","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"2311","in internal control over financial reporting that might be"
"2312","material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"2313","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"2314","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal"
"2315","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"2316","controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be"
"2317","material weaknesses as defined above as of June 30, 2013."
"2318","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"2319","management and the Board of Trustees of PIMCO Equity"
"2320","Series and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"2321","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"2322","than these specified parties."

"2358","zoning laws, regulatory limitations on rents, property taxes and"
"2359","operating expenses. A Fund's investments in REITs or real"
"2360","estate-linked derivative instruments subject it to management"
"2361","and tax risks"
"2362","	Further, effective immediately, the following disclosure"

"2372","rents, property taxes and operating expenses. An investment in a"
"2373","REIT or a real estate-linked derivative instrument that is linked"
"2374","to the value of a REIT will also be subject to additional risks,"
"2375","such as poor performance by the manager of the REIT, adverse"
"2376","changes to the tax laws or failure by the REIT to qualify for tax-"
"2377","free pass-through of income under the Internal Revenue Code of"
"2378","1986 as amended (the Code). In addition, some REITs have"
"2379","limited diversification because they invest in a limited number of"
"2380","properties, a narrow geographic area, or a single type of"
"2381","property. Also, the organizational documents of a REIT may"
"2382","contain provisions that make changes in control of the REIT"

"2499","material nonpublic information pertinent to investment"
"2500","decisions undertaken in connection with this Contract that"
"2501","may be in its possession or in the possession of any of its"
"2502","affiliates."
"2503","(b) The Adviser also shall provide to the officers of the"
"2504","Trust administrative assistance in connection with the"
"2505","operation of the Trust and the Funds, which shall include"
"2506","(i) compliance with all reasonable requests of the Trust for"
"2507","information, including information required in connection"
"2508","with the Trust's filings with the Securities and Exchange"
"2509","Commission and state securities commissions, and (ii) such"
"2510","other services as the Adviser shall from time to time"
"2511","determine to be necessary or useful to the administration of"
"2512","the Trust and Funds."
"2513","(c) As manager of the assets of the Funds, the Adviser shall"
"2514","make investments for the account of the Funds in"
"2515","accordance with the Adviser's best judgment and within the"

"2525","additional reports and information as the Trust's officers or"
"2526","Board of Trustees shall reasonably request."
"2527","(e) On occasions when the Adviser deems the purchase or"
"2528","sale of a security to be in the best interest of a Fund as well"
"2529","as other of its clients, the Adviser, to the extent permitted"
"2530","by applicable law, may aggregate the securities to be so"
"2531","sold or purchased in order to obtain the best execution of"
"2532","the order or lower brokerage commissions, if any. The"
"2533","Adviser may also on occasion purchase or sell a particular"
"2534","security for one or more clients in different amounts. On"
"2535","either occasion, and to the extent permitted by applicable"
"2536","law and regulations, allocation of the securities so"
"2537","purchased or sold, as well as the expenses incurred in the"
"2538","transaction, will be made by the Adviser in the manner it"

"2540","fiduciary obligations to the Trust and to such other"
"2541","customers."
"2542","(f) The Adviser may cause a Fund to pay a broker which"
"2543","provides brokerage and research services to the Adviser a"
"2544","commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess"
"2545","of the amount another broker might have charged. Such"
"2546","higher commissions may not be paid unless the Adviser"
"2547","determines in good faith that the amount paid is reasonable"
"2548","in relation to the services received in terms of the particular"
"2549","transaction or the Adviser's overall responsibilities to the"

"2553","recapitalization, consolidation, sale, merger, foreclosure,"
"2554","liquidation or readjustment of the finances of any person or"
"2555","the securities or other property thereof, and to deposit any"

"2557","reorganization or similar committee.  Without limiting the"
"2558","generality of the foregoing, the Adviser may represent a"
"2559","Fund on a creditors' (or similar) committee."
"2560","(h) The Adviser shall have sole authority to exercise"
"2561","whatever powers the Trust may possess with respect to any"
"2562","of the assets of a Fund, including, but not limited to, the"
"2563","right to vote proxies, the power to exercise rights, options,"
"2564","warrants, conversion privileges and redemption privileges,"
"2565","and to tender securities pursuant to a tender offer."
"2566","(i) The Adviser shall have the authority to enter into any"
"2567","agreements and execute any documents (e.g., any"
"2568","derivatives documentation such as exchange traded and"
"2569","over-the-counter, as applicable) required to meet the"
"2570","obligations of a Fund with respect to any investments made"
"2571","for the Fund which shall include any market and/or"
"2572","industry standard documentation and the standard"
"2573","representations and/or indemnifications contained therein."
"2574","5.  The Adviser shall give the Trust the benefit of the"
"2575","Adviser's best judgment and efforts in rendering services"
"2576","under this Contract. The Adviser may rely on information"
"2577","reasonably believed by it to be accurate and reliable. As an"
"2578","inducement for the Adviser's undertaking to render"
"2579","services under this Contract, the Trust agrees that neither"
"2580","the Adviser nor its members, officers, directors, or"
"2581","employees shall be subject to any liability for, or any"
"2582","damages, expenses or losses incurred in connection with,"
"2583","any act or omission or mistake in judgment connected with"
"2584","or arising out of any services rendered under this Contract,"
"2585","except by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross"
"2586","negligence in performance of the Adviser's duties, or by"
"2587","reason of reckless disregard of the Adviser's obligations"
"2588","and duties under this Contract. This provision shall govern"
"2589","only the liability to the Trust of the Adviser and that of its"
"2590","members, officers, directors, and employees, and shall in"
"2591","no way govern the liability to the Trust or the Adviser or"
"2592","provide a defense for any other person including persons"
"2593","that provide services for the Funds as described in this"
"2594","Contract."
"2595","6.  In consideration of the services to be rendered by the"
"2596","Adviser under this Contract, each Fund shall pay the"
"2597","Adviser a monthly fee on the first business day of each"
"2598","month, based upon the average daily value (as determined"
"2599","on each business day at the time set forth in the Prospectus"
"2600","for determining net asset value per share) of the net assets"
"2601","of the Fund, during the preceding month, at the annual rates"
"2602","provided for in Exhibit A, as such Exhibit A may be"
"2603","amended from time to time."
"2604","If the fees payable to the Adviser pursuant to this Section 6"
"2605","begin to accrue before the end of any month or if this"
"2606","Contract terminates before the end of any month, the fees"
"2607","for the period from that date to the end of that month or"
"2608","from the beginning of that month to the date of termination,"
"2609","as the case may be, shall be prorated according to the"
"2610","proportion which the period bears to the full month in"
"2611","which the effectiveness or termination occurs. For purposes"
"2612","of calculating the monthly fees, the value of the net assets"
"2613","of each Fund shall be computed in the manner specified in"
"2614","the Prospectus for the computation of net asset value. For"
"2615","purposes of this Contract, a business day is any day a"
"2616","Fund is open for business or as otherwise provided in the"
"2617","Trust's Prospectus."
"2618","7.  (a) This Contract shall become effective with respect to"
"2619","the Funds on March 30, 2010 (and, with respect to any"
"2620","amendment, or with respect to any additional fund, the date"
"2621","of the amendment or Supplement hereto) and shall continue"
"2622","in effect with respect to a Fund for a period of more than"
"2623","two years from that date (or, with respect to any additional"
"2624","fund, the date of the Supplement) and shall continue"
"2625","thereafter only so long as the continuance is specifically"
"2626","approved at least annually (i) by the vote of a majority of"
"2627","the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940"
"2628","Act) of the Fund or by the Trust's Board of Trustees and"
"2629","(ii) by the vote, cast in person at a meeting called for such"
"2630","purpose, of a majority of the Trust's trustees who are not"
"2631","parties to this Contract or interested persons (as defined"
"2632","in the 1940 Act) of any such party."
"2633","(b) This Contract may be terminated with respect to a Fund"
"2634","(or any additional fund) at any time, without the payment"
"2635","of any penalty, by a vote of a majority of the outstanding"
"2636","voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund or"
"2637","by a vote of a majority of the Trust's entire Board of"
"2638","Trustees on 60 days' written notice to the Adviser or by the"
"2639","Adviser on 60 days' written notice to the Trust. This"
"2640","Contract (or any Supplement hereto) shall terminate"
"2641","automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in"
"2642","the 1940 Act)."
"2643","8.  Except to the extent necessary to perform the Adviser's"
"2644","obligations under this Contract, nothing herein shall be"
"2645","deemed to limit or restrict the right of the Adviser, or any"
"2646","affiliate of the Adviser, or any employee of the Adviser, to"

"2650","services of any kind to any other corporation, firm,"
"2651","individual or association."
