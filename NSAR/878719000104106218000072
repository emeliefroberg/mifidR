"1073","Bond and Sarofim Equity Fund (two of the funds"
"1074","constituting The Advisors Inner Circle Fund)"
"1075","(collectively referred to as the Funds) as of and"
"1076","for the year ended December 31, 2017, in accordance"
"1077","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1078","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1079","Funds internal control over financial reporting,"
"1080","including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"1081","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"1082","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"

"1084","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"1085","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1086","Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"1087","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"1088","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"1089","financial reporting."
"1090","The management of the Funds are responsible for"
"1091","establishing and maintaining effective internal"

"1096","internal control over financial reporting is a"

"1123","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
