"3474","Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"3475","First Investors Tax Exempt Funds"
"3476","40 Wall Street"
"3477","New York, New York 10005"
"3478","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of First"
"3479","Investors Tax Exempt Funds (comprising, respectively, the Tax Exempt Income"
"3480","Fund, Tax Exempt Opportunities Fund, California Fund, Connecticut Fund,"
"3481","Massachusetts Fund, Michigan Fund, Minnesota Fund, New Jersey Fund, New York"
"3482","Fund, North Carolina Fund, Ohio Fund, Oregon Fund, Pennsylvania Fund"
"3483","and Virginia Fund) (the Funds) for the year ended December 31, 2015, in"
"3484","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"3485","Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"3486","financial reporting, including control activities for safeguarding"
"3487","securities, as a basis for designing our audit procedures for the purpose"
"3488","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"3489","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"3490","on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3491","reporting.   Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3492","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"3493","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"3494","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"3495","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"3496","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"3497","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"3498","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"3499","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal"
"3500","control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"3501","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"3502","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"3503","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"3504","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"3505","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"3506","and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"3507","authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"3508","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"3509","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"3510","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3511","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"3512","may not prevent or detect misstatements.   Also, projections of any"
"3513","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"3514","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"3515","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3516","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"3517","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"3518","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"3519","detect misstatements on a timely basis.   A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"3520","or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"3521","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"3522","the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented"
"3523","or detected on a timely basis."
"3524","Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"3525","First Investors Tax Exempt Funds"
"3526","Page Two"
"3527","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"3528","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3529","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"3530","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"3531","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).   However, we noted no"
"3532","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"3533","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider"
"3534","to be material weaknesses, as defined above, as of December 31, 2015."
"3535","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management,"
"3536","Shareholders, the Board of Trustees of the First Investors Tax Exempt Funds"
"3537","and the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not intended to be and"
"3538","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"4095","      Section 2.	Contracts and Instruments; How Executed.  The"
"4096","Trustees, except as otherwise provided in these By-laws, may authorize"
"4097","any officer or officers, agent or agents, to enter into any contract or"
"4098","execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the Trust and this"
"4099","authority may be general or confined to specific instances; and unless"
"4100","so authorized or ratified by the Trustees or within the agency power of"
"4101","an officer, no officer, agent, or employee shall have any power or"
"4102","authority to bind the Trust by any contract or engagement or to pledge"
"4103","its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount."
"4104","      Section 3.	Advance Payment of Indemnifiable Expenses."
"4105","Expenses incurred by an agent in connection with the preparation and"
"4106","presentation of a defense to any proceeding may be paid by the Trust from"
"4107","time to time prior to final disposition thereof upon receipt of an"
"4108","undertaking by, or on behalf of, such agent that such amount will be paid"
"4109","over by him or her to the Trust if it is ultimately determined that he or"
"4110","she is not entitled to indemnification; provided, however, that (a) such"
"4111","agent shall have provided appropriate security for such undertaking,"
"4112","(b) the Trust is insured against losses arising out of any such advance"
"4113","payments, or (c) either a majority of the Trustees who are neither"
"4114","Interested Persons of the Trust nor parties to the proceeding, or"
"4115","independent legal counsel in a written opinion, shall have determined,"
"4116","based upon a review of the readily available facts (as opposed to a"
"4117","trial-type inquiry or full investigation), that there is"
"4118","reason to believe that such agent will be found entitled to"
"4119","indemnification."
"4120","      Section 4.	Severability.    The provisions of these By-laws"
"4121","are severable.  If the Board of Trustees determines, with the advice of"
"4122","counsel, that any provision hereof conflicts with the 1940 Act, the"
"4123","regulated investment company provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of"
"4124","1986, as amended, or other applicable laws and regulations, the"
"4125","conflicting provision shall be deemed never to have constituted a part of"
"4126","these By-laws; provided, however, that such determination shall not"
"4127","affect any of the remaining provisions of these By-laws or render invalid"
"4128","or improper any action taken or omitted prior to such determination.  If"
"4129","any provision hereof shall be held invalid or unenforceable in any"
"4130","jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforceability shall attach only to"
"4131","such provision only in such jurisdiction and shall not affect any other"
"4132","provision of these By-laws."
"4133","      Section 5.	Headings.  Headings are placed in these By-laws"
"4134","for convenience of reference only and in case of any conflict, the text"
"4135","of these By-laws rather than the headings shall control."

"4624","				SERIES; CLASSES; SHARES"

"4626","shall consist of one or more separate and distinct Series created and"
"4627","maintained in accordance with Article III, Section 1(o), and this Article"
"4628","IV.  As of the date hereof, the Series listed in Schedule A attached"
"4629","hereto and made a part hereof have already been designated by the Trustees."
"4630","The Trustees may designate the rights and preferences of the Shares of each"
"4631","Series relative to the Shares of any other Series.  The Trustees may"
"4632","divide the Shares of any Series into any number of Classes representing"
"4633","interests in the Assets belonging to that Series, each Share of each such"
"4634","Class having an equal beneficial interest in such assets and identical"
"4635","voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights and subject to the same"
"4636","terms and conditions, except that (a) expenses allocated to a Class may be"
"4637","borne solely by that Class as determined by the Trustees and (b) a Class"
"4638","may have exclusive voting rights with respect to matters affecting only"
"4639","that Class.  The establishment and designation of each additional Series or"

"4641","majority of the then Trustees of a resolution that sets forth such"
"4642","establishment and designation and the relative rights and preferences of"
"4643","such Series or Class of the Trust, whether directly in such resolution or"
"4644","by reference to another document including, without limitation, any"
"4645","registration statement of the Trust, or as otherwise provided in such"
"4646","resolution."
"4647","Separate and distinct records shall be maintained for each Series and the"
"4648","assets of such Series shall be held and accounted for separately from the"
"4649","other assets of the Trust or Assets belonging to any other Series.  A"
"4650","Series may issue any number of Shares and need not issue Shares.  Each"
"4651","holder of Shares of a Series shall be entitled to receive his pro rata"
"4652","share of all distributions made with respect to such Series.  Upon"
"4653","redemption of Shares of a Series, the redeeming Shareholder shall be paid"
"4654","solely out of the Assets belonging to that Series.  The Trustees may"
"4655","change the name of any Series or Class in their sole discretion."
"4656","      Section 2.	SHARES.  The beneficial interest in each Series may"
"4657","be divided into Shares of one or more Classes.  The number of Shares of"
"4658","each Series and Class shall be unlimited, and each Share shall have no par"
"4659","value.  All Shares issued hereunder, including Shares issued in connection"

"4662","no preemptive or other right to subscribe to any additional Shares or other"

"4666","times and on such terms"

"4673","materially adverse to the Shareholders of such Shares), (4) to divide or"
"4674","combine the Shares of any Series or Classes into a greater or lesser"
"4675","number, (5) to classify or reclassify any unissued Shares of any Series or"
"4676","Classes into one or more Series or Classes, (6) to abolish any one or more"
"4677","Series or Classes, (7) to issue Shares to acquire other assets (including"
"4678","assets subject to, and in connection with, the assumption of liabilities)"
"4679","and businesses and (8) to take such other action with respect to the Shares"
"4680","as the Trustees may deem desirable.  Shares held in the Trust's treasury"
"4681","shall not confer any voting rights on the Trustees and shall not be"
"4682","entitled to any dividends or other distributions declared with respect to"
"4683","the Shares."

"4687","property or a combination thereof, as they may from time to time authorize."
"4688","At the Trustees' sole discretion, such investments in a Series, subject to"
"4689","applicable law, may be in the form of cash or securities in which that"
"4690","Series is authorized to invest, valued as provided in Article V, Section 3."
"4691","Investment in a Series shall be credited to the investing Shareholder's"
"4692","account in the form of full Shares at the Net Asset Value per Share next"
"4693","determined after the investment is received or accepted as may be"
"4694","determined by the Trustees; provided, however, that the Trustees may, in"
"4695","their sole discretion, (a) impose a sales charge upon investments in any"
"4696","Series or Class, (b) issue fractional Shares or (c) determine the Net Asset"
"4697","Value per Share of the initial capital contribution for any Series.  The"
"4698","Trustees shall have the right to refuse to accept investments in any Series"
"4699","or by any person at any time without any cause or reason therefor"

"4708","(collectively Assets belonging to that Series), shall be recorded, held"
"4709","and accounted for separately from the other assets of the Trust and Assets"
"4710","belonging to every other Series.  The Assets belonging to a Series shall"
"4711","belong only to that Series for all purposes and to no other Series, subject"
"4712","only to the rights of creditors of that Series.  Any assets, income,"
"4713","earnings, profits and proceeds thereof, funds and/or payments that are not"
"4714","readily identifiable as belonging to any particular Series shall be"
"4715","allocated by the Trustees between or among one or more Series as the"
"4716","Trustees, in their sole discretion, deem fair and equitable.  Each such"
"4717","allocation shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders of all"
"4718","Series for all purposes, and the assets, income, earnings, profits,"
"4719","proceeds, funds and payments so allocated to a Series shall be treated for"
"4720","all purposes as Assets belonging to that Series.  The Assets belonging to"
"4721","a Series shall be charged with all Liabilities with respect to that Series"
"4722","and/or attributable to that Series, except that Liabilities allocated"
"4723","solely to a particular Class shall be borne by that Class.  Any Liabilities"
"4724","of the Trust that are not readily identifiable as chargeable to any"
"4725","particular Series or Class shall be allocated and charged by the Trustees"
"4726","between or among any one or more Series or Classes in such manner as the"
"4727","Trustees, in"
"4728","					-10-"
"4729","their sole discretion, deem fair and equitable.  Each such allocation shall"
"4730","be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders of all Series and Classes"
"4731","for all purposes."
"4732","      Without limiting the foregoing, but subject to the right of the"
"4733","Trustees to allocate Liabilities as herein provided, the Liabilities"
"4734","incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to a"
"4735","particular Series shall be enforceable only against the Assets belonging"
"4736","to that Series and not against the assets of the Trust generally or the"
"4737","Assets belonging to any other Series.  Notice of this contractual"
"4738","limitation on Liabilities among Series shall be set forth in the Trust's"
"4739","certificate of trust (whether originally or by amendment) as filed or to"
"4740","be filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware"
"4741","pursuant to the Delaware Act, and upon the giving of such notice in the"
"4742","certificate of trust, the provisions of Section 3804(a) of the Delaware"
"4743","Act relating to limitations on Liabilities among Series (and the statutory"
"4744","effect under Section 3804 of setting forth such notice in the certificate"
"4745","of trust) shall become applicable to the Trust and each Series.  Any person"
"4746","extending credit to, contracting with or having any claim against any"
"4747","Series may look only to the Assets belonging to that Series to satisfy or"
"4748","enforce any Liability with respect to that Series.  No Shareholder or"
"4749","former Shareholder of any Series shall have a claim on or any right to any"
"4750","Assets belonging to any other Series."
"4751","      Section 5.	OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER OF SHARES.  The ownership of"
"4752","Shares shall be recorded on the books of the related Series or those of a"
"4753","transfer or similar agent for such Series, which books shall be maintained"
"4754","separately for the Shares of each Series or Class of the Trust.  No"
"4755","certificates certifying the ownership of Shares shall be issued except as"
"4756","the Trustees may otherwise determine from time to time.  The Trustees may"
"4757","make such rules as they consider appropriate for the issuance of Share"
"4758","certificates, the transfer of Shares (whether or not represented by"
"4759","certificates) of each Series or Class of the Trust and similar matters."
"4760","The record books of each Series as kept by the Trustees or any transfer or"
"4761","similar agent, as the case may be, shall be conclusive as to the identity"
"4762","of the Shareholders of each Series or Class of the Trust and as to the"
"4763","number of Shares of each Series or Class of the Trust held from time to"
"4764","time by each Shareholder."
"4765","      Section 6.	STATUS OF SHARES; LIMITATION OF SHAREHOLDER"
"4766","LIABILITY.  Shares shall be deemed to be personal property giving"
"4767","Shareholders only the rights provided in this Trust Instrument.  Every"
"4768","Shareholder, by virtue of having acquired a Share, shall be held expressly"
"4769","to have assented to and agreed to be bound by the terms of this Trust"
"4770","Instrument and to have become a party hereto.  The death, incapacity,"
"4771","dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a Shareholder during the"
"4772","existence of the Trust shall not operate to terminate the Trust, any"
"4773","Series or Class, nor entitle the representative of any such Shareholder to"
"4774","an accounting or to take any action in court or elsewhere against the"
"4775","Trust, any Series or Class or the Trustees, but entitles such"
"4776","representative only to the rights of such Shareholder under this Trust"
"4777","Instrument.  Ownership of Shares shall not entitle the Shareholder to any"
"4778","title in or to the whole or any part of the Assets of the related Series or"
"4779","right to call for a participation or division of the same or for an"
"4780","accounting, nor shall the ownership of Shares constitute the Shareholders"
"4781","as partners.  No Shareholder shall be personally liable for the Liabilities"
"4782","incurred by, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to the Trust"
"4783","or any Series or Class thereof.  None of the Trust, Series or the Trustees,"
"4784","nor any officer, employee, or agent of any of the foregoing shall have any"
"4785","power to bind any Shareholder personally or to demand payment from any"
"4786","Shareholder for anything, other than as agreed by the Shareholder."
"4787","Shareholders shall have the same limitation"
"4788","					-11-"
"4789","of personal liability as is extended to shareholders of a private"
"4790","corporation for profit incorporated in the State of Delaware.  Any note,"
"4791","bond, contract or other written obligation of the Trust or any Series may"
"4792","contain a statement to the effect that such obligation may be enforced only"
"4793","against the assets of the Trust or Assets belonging to one or more Series;"
"4794","however, the omission of such statement shall not operate to bind, or"
"4795","create personal liability for, any Shareholder or Trustee."

"5279","(a) the provisions of Section 3540 of Title 12 of the Delaware Code or (b)"
"5280","any provisions of the laws (statutory or common) of the State of Delaware"

"5297","without limiting the provisions hereof, the Trust and the Series may"
"5298","exercise all powers that are ordinarily exercised by such a trust under"
"5299","Delaware law.  The Trust and the Series specifically reserve the right to"

"5301","may be engaged in by trusts under the Delaware Act, and the absence of a"
"5302","specific reference herein to any such power, privilege or action shall not"
"5303","imply that the Trust or a Series may not exercise such power or privilege"

"5305","	Any suit, action or proceeding brought by or in the right of any"
"5306","Shareholder or any person claiming any interest in any Shares seeking to"
"5307","enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of, related"

"5313","jurisdiction over the action and/or claims asserted and otherwise in the"
"5314","courts of the State of Delaware to the extent there is subject matter"
"5315","jurisdiction in those courts for the claims asserted."
"5316","      Section 6.	DERIVATIVE ACTIONS."
"5317","      (a) To the maximum extent permitted by law, no Shareholder or group"
"5318","of Shareholders shall have the right to bring or maintain any court action,"
"5319","proceeding or claim on behalf of the"
"5320","					-21-"
"5321","Trust or any Series or Class without first making demand on the Trustees"
"5322","requesting the Trustees to bring or maintain such action, proceeding or"
"5323","claim. To the maximum extent permitted by law, such demand shall not be"
"5324","excused under any circumstances, including claims of alleged interest"
"5325","on the part of the Trustees, unless the plaintiff makes a specific showing"
"5326","that such demand is not likely to succeed and irreparable nonmonetary"
"5327","injury to the Trust or Series or Class that the plaintiff could not"
"5328","reasonably have prevented would otherwise result. To the maximum extent"
"5329","permitted by law, for purposes of this Article X, Section 6, a demand on"
"5330","the Trustees shall only be deemed not likely to succeed if a majority of"
"5331","the Trustees, or a majority of any committee established to consider the"
"5332","merits of the action, are Interested Persons.  Such demand shall be mailed"
"5333","to the Secretary of the Trust at the Trust's principal office and shall set"
"5334","forth with particularity the nature of the proposed court action,"
"5335","proceeding or claim and the essential facts relied upon by the"
"5336","Shareholder(s) to support the allegations made in the demand.  Such demand"
"5337","shall also be executed by or on behalf of no fewer than three complaining"
"5338","Shareholders, each of which shall be unaffiliated and unrelated to an other"
"5339","complaining Shareholder executing such demand. The Trustees shall consider"
"5340","such demand within a time frame that the Trustees in their discretion"
"5341","consider reasonable and appropriate. In their sole discretion, the Trustees"
"5342","may submit the matter to a vote of Shareholders of the Trust or a Series or"
"5343","Class, as appropriate. To the maximum extent permitted by law, any decision"
"5344","by the Trustees to bring, maintain or settle (or not to bring, maintain or"
"5345","settle) such action, proceeding or claim, or to submit the matter to a"
"5346","vote of Shareolders, shall be final and binding upon the Shareholders, and"
"5347","judicially unreviewable. Any such derivative actions are subject to the"
"5348","provisions of Article X, Section 6 herein."
"5349","      (b) To the maximum extent permitted by law, no Shareholder or group"
"5350","of Shareholders shall have the right to bring or maintain a direct action"
"5351","or claim for monetary damages against the Trust or any Series or Class or"
"5352","the Trustees predicated upon an express or implied right of action under"
"5353","this Trust Instrument or the 1940 Act (excepting rights of action permitted"
"5354","under section 36(b) of the 1940 Act), nor shall any Shareholder, who is"
"5355","similarly situated to one or more other Shareholders with respect to the"
"5356","alleged injury, have the right to bring such an action, unless such group"
"5357","of Shareholders or such Shareholder has obtained authorization from the"
"5358","Trustees to bring the action. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the"
"5359","requirement of authorization shall not be excused under any circumstances,"
"5360","including claims of alleged interest on the part of the Trustees. A request"
"5361","for authorization shall be mailed to the Secretary of the Trust at the"
"5362","Trust's principal office and shall set forth with particularity the nature"
"5363","of the proposed court action, proceeding or claim and the essential facts"
"5364","relied upon by the group of Shareholders or Shareholder to support the"
"5365","allegations made in the request. The Trustees shall consider such request"
"5366","within a time frame that the Trustees in their discretion consider"
"5367","reasonable and appropriate. In their sole discretion, the Trustees may"
"5368","submit the matter to a vote of Shareholders of the Trust or Series or"
"5369","Class, as appropriate. Any decision by the Trustees to settle or to"
"5370","authorize (or not to settle or to authorize) such court action,"
"5371","proceeding or claim, or to submit the matter to a vote of Shareholders,"
"5372","shall be binding upon the applicable group of Shareholders or Shareholder."
"5373","      In addition to the foregoing and to the maximum extent permitted by"
"5374","law, no Shareholder may bring a direct action or claim claiming injury as"
"5375","a Shareholder of the Trust, or any Series or Class thereof, where the"
"5376","matters alleged (if true) would give rise to a claim by the Trust or by"
"5377","the Trust on behalf of a Series or Class, unless the Shareholder has"
"5378","suffered an injury distinct from"
"5379","					-22-"
"5380","that suffered by Shareholders of the Trust, or the Series or Class,"
"5381","generally.  A Shareholder bringing a direct claim must be a Shareholder of"
"5382","the Series or Class against which the direct action is brought at the time"
"5383","of the injury complained of, or acquire the Shares afterwards by operation"
"5384","of law from a person who was a Shareholder at that time."
"5385","      (c) To the maximum extent permitted by law, each Shareholder"
"5386","acknowledges and agrees that any alleged injury to Trust Property or Assets"
"5387","belonging to a Series, as the case may be, any diminution in the value of"
"5388","the Shareholder's shares, or any other claim arising out of or relating"
"5389","to an allegation regarding the actions, inaction, or omissions of or by"
"5390","the Trustees, the Trust's officers, or a service provider is a legal claim"
"5391","belonging only to the Trust and not to the Shareholders individually."
"5392","Accordingly, all Shareholders agree to bring any and all such claims"
"5393","pursuant only to the provisions of this Article X, Section 6."
"5394","      (d) In addition to satisfying the requirements set forth in this"
"5395","Trust Instrument and any requirements applicable to shareholders of"
"5396","Delaware statutory trusts that are not inconsistent with the terms of this"
"5397","Trust Instrument, a Shareholder or Shareholders may bring a derivative"
"5398","action on behalf of the Trust only if the following conditions are met:"
"5399","            (i) A Shareholder or Shareholders eligible to bring such"
"5400","derivative action must collectively hold Shares representing ten percent"
"5401","(10%) or more of the all Shares issued and outstanding or of the Series or"
"5402","Classes to which such action relates if it does not relate to all Series"
"5403","and Classes, to join in the request for the Trustees to commence such"
"5404","action; and"
"5405","            (ii) The Trustees shall be entitled to retain counsel or other"
"5406","advisers in considering the merits of the request and shall require an"
"5407","undertaking by the Shareholder(s) making such request to reimburse the"
"5408","Trust for the expense of any such advisers in the event that the Trustees"
"5409","determine not to bring such action."
"5410","      (e) For purposes of this Article X, Section 6, the Trustees may"
"5411","designate a committee to consider a Shareholder demand. Such committee"
"5412","shall be entitled to retain counsel or other advisers in considering the"
"5413","merits of the request and shall require an undertaking by the"
"5414","Shareholder(s) making such request to reimburse the Trust for the expense"
"5415","of any such advisers in the event that the committee determines not to"
"5416","bring such action."
"5417","      Section 7.	AMENDMENTS.  The Trustees may, without any"
"5418","Shareholder vote, amend or otherwise supplement this Trust Instrument by"
"5419","making an amendment, a Trust Instrument supplemental hereto or an amended"
"5420","and restated trust instrument; provided, that Shareholders shall have the"
"5421","right to vote on any amendment (a) that would affect the voting rights of"
"5422","Shareholders granted in Article VI, Section 1, (b) to this Section, (c)"
"5423","required to be approved by Shareholders by law or by the Trust's"
"5424","registration statement(s) filed with the Commission and (d) that is"
"5425","submitted to them by the Trustees in their sole discretion.  Any amendment"
"5426","submitted to Shareholders that the Trustees determine would affect the"
"5427","Shareholders of any Series shall be authorized by vote of the Shareholders"
"5428","of such Series, and no vote shall be required of Shareholders of Series not"
"5429","affected.  Notwithstanding anything else herein, any amendment to Article"
"5430","IX that would have the effect of reducing the indemnification and other"
"5431","rights provided thereby to Covered Persons of the Trust or to Shareholders"
"5432","or former"
"5433","					-23-"
"5434","Shareholders, and any repeal or amendment of` this sentence, shall each"
"5435","require the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the"
"5436","Outstanding Shares of the Trust entitled to vote thereon."
"5437","      Section 8.	FISCAL YEAR.  The fiscal year of the Trust and"
"5438","each Series of the Trust shall end on a specified date as set forth in the"
"5439","By-laws or by resolution.  The Trustees may change the fiscal year of the"
"5440","Trust or any Series without Shareholder approval.  Different Series may"
"5441","have different fiscal years."
"5442","      Section 9.	SEVERABILITY.  The provisions of this Trust"
"5443","Instrument are severable.  If the Trustees determine, with the advice of"
"5444","counsel, that any provision hereof conflicts with the 1940 Act, the"
"5445","regulated investment company provisions of the Tax Code or other applicable"
"5446","laws and regulations, the conflicting provision shall be deemed never to"
"5447","have constituted a part of this Trust Instrument; provided, however, that"
"5448","such determination shall not affect any of the remaining provisions of this"
"5449","Trust Instrument or render invalid or improper any action taken or omitted"
"5450","prior to such determination.  If any provision hereof is held invalid or"
"5451","unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforceability"
"5452","shall attach only to such provision only in such jurisdiction and shall"
"5453","not affect any other provision of this Trust Instrument."
"5454","      Section 10.	INTERPRETATION.  As used herein, the masculine"
"5455","gender includes all genders, and the singular includes the plural and vice"
"5456","versa.  Headings herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the"
"5457","construction of this Trust Instrument."
