"717","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"718","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"719","Federated Fixed Income Securities, Inc.:"
"720","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"721","financial statements of Federated Strategic Income"
"722","Fund (one of the portfolios constituting Federated"
"723","Fixed Income Securities, Inc.) (the Fund) as"
"724","of and for the year ended November 30, 2009,"
"725","in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"726","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"727","we considered the Fund's internal control"
"728","over financial reporting, including controls over"
"729","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"730","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"731","our opinion on the financial statements and"
"732","to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"733","but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"734","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"735","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"736","we express no such opinion."
"737","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"738","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"739","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"740","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"741","management are required to assess the expected"
"742","benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"743","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"744","is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"745","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"746","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"747","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"748","generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"749","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"750","includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"751","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"752","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"753","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"754","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"755","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"756","preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"757","with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"758","that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"759","are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"760","of management and directors of the"
"761","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"762","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"763","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of"
"764","a company's assets that could have a material"
"765","effect on the financial statements."
"766","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"767","control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"768","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"769","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"770","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"771","because of changes in conditions, or that"
"772","the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"773","procedures may deteriorate."
"774","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"775","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"776","control does not allow management or employees,"
"777","in the normal course of performing their"
"778","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"779","on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"780","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"781","internal control over financial reporting, such that"
"782","there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"783","misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"784","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"785","detected on a timely basis."
"786","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control"
"787","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"788","purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"789","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"790","internal control that might be material weaknesses"
"791","under standards established by the Public"
"792","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"793","However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"794","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"795","and its operation, including controls over"
"796","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"797","material weakness as defined above as of"
"798","November 30, 2009."

"816","LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"817","Since October 2003, Federated and related entities"
"818","(collectively, Federated), and various Federated funds"
"819","(Funds), have been named as defendants in several class"
"820","action lawsuits now pending in the United States District"
"821","Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuits were"
"822","purportedly filed on behalf of people who purchased, owned"
"823","and/or redeemed shares of Federated-sponsored mutual funds"
"824","during specified periods beginning November 1, 1998."
"825","The suits are generally similar in alleging that Federated"
"826","engaged in illegal and improper trading practices including"
"827","market timing and late trading in concert with certain"
"828","institutional traders, which allegedly caused financial injury to"
"829","the mutual fund shareholders. These lawsuits began to be"
"830","filed shortly after Federated's first public announcement"
"831","that it had received requests for information on shareholder"
"832","trading activities in the Funds from the SEC, the Office"
"833","of the New York State Attorney General (NYAG), and"
"834","other authorities. In that regard, on November 28, 2005,"
"835","Federated announced that it had reached final settlements"
"836","with the SEC and the NYAG with respect to those matters."
"837","Specifically, the SEC and NYAG settled proceedings against"
"838","three Federated subsidiaries involving undisclosed"
"839","market timing arrangements and late trading. The SEC"
"840","made findings: that Federated Investment Management"
"841","Company (FIMC), an SEC-registered investment adviser"
"842","to various Funds, and Federated Securities Corp., an"
"843","SEC-registered broker-dealer and distributor for the Funds,"
"844","violated provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and"
"845","Investment Company Act by approving, but not disclosing,"
"846","three market timing arrangements, or the associated"
"847","conflict of interest between FIMC and the funds involved"
"848","in the arrangements, either to other fund shareholders or to"
"849","the funds' board; and that Federated Shareholder Services"
"850","Company, formerly an SEC-registered transfer agent,"
"851","failed to prevent a customer and a Federated employee"
"852","from late trading in violation of provisions of the Investment"
"853","Company Act. The NYAG found that such conduct violated"
"854","provisions of New York State law. Federated entered"
"855","into the settlements without admitting or denying the"
"856","regulators' findings. As Federated previously reported in 2004,"
"857","it has already paid approximately $8.0 million to certain"
"858","funds as determined by an independent consultant. As part"
"859","of these settlements, Federated agreed to pay disgorgement"
"860","and a civil money penalty in the aggregate amount of an"
"861","additional $72 million and, among other things, agreed"
"862","that it would not serve as investment adviser to any"
"863","registered investment company unless (i) at least 75%"
"864","of the fund's directors are independent of Federated, (ii) the"
"865","chairman of each such fund is independent of Federated,"
"866","(iii) no action may be taken by the fund's board or any"
"867","committee thereof unless approved by a majority of the"
"868","independent trustees of the fund or committee, respectively,"
"869","and (iv) the fund appoints a senior officer who reports"
"870","to the independent trustees and is responsible for"
"871","monitoring compliance by the fund with applicable laws and"
"872","fiduciary duties and for managing the process by which"
"873","management fees charged to a fund are approved. The"
"874","settlements are described in Federated's announcement"
"875","which, along with previous press releases and related"
"876","communications on those matters, is available in the About
Us section of Federated's website at FederatedInvestors.com."
"877","Federated entities have also been named as defendants in"
"878","several additional lawsuits that are now pending in the"
"879","United States District Court for the Western District of"
"880","Pennsylvania, alleging, among other things, excessive"
"881","advisory and Rule 12b-1 fees."
"882","The Board of the Funds retained the law firm of Dickstein"
"883","Shapiro LLP to represent the Funds in each of the"
"884","lawsuits described in the preceding two paragraphs."
"885","Federated and the Funds, and their respective counsel, have"
"886","been defending this litigation, and none of the Funds"
"887","remains a defendant in any of the lawsuits (though some could"
"888","potentially receive any recoveries as nominal defendants)."
"889","Additional lawsuits based upon similar allegations may"
"890","be filed in the future. The potential impact of these"
"891","lawsuits, all of which seek unquantified damages, attorneys'"
"892","fees, and expenses, and future potential similar suits"
"893","is uncertain. Although we do not believe that these lawsuits will"
"894","have a material adverse effect on the Funds, there can"
"895","be no assurance that these suits, ongoing adverse publicity"
"896","and/or other developments resulting from the regulatory"
"897","investigations will not result in increased Fund"
"898","redemptions, reduced sales of Fund shares, or other"
"899","adverse consequences for the Funds."
