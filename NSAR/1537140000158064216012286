"491","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT"
"492","REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"493","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"494","To the Shareholders of"
"495","Marathon Value Portfolio"
"496","and Board of Trustees of"
"497","Northern Lights Trust Fund"
"498","Ill"
"499","In planning and performing"
"500","our audit of the financial"
"501","statements of Marathon"
"502","Value Portfolio (the Fund),"
"503","a series    of Northern Lights"
"504","Fund Trust Ill, as of and for"
"505","the period ended September"
"506","30, 2016, in accordance with"
"507","the standards of the Public"
"508","Company Accounting"
"509","Oversight Board (United"
"510","States), we considered the"
"511","Fund's internal control over"
"512","financial reporting, including"
"513","controls over safeguarding"
"514","securities, as a basis for"
"515","designing our    auditing"
"516","procedures for the purpose"
"517","of expressing our opinion on"
"518","the financial statements and"
"519","to comply with the"
"520","requirements of Form N-"
"521","SAR, but not for the purpose"
"522","of expressing an opinion on"
"523","the effectiveness of the"
"524","Fund's internal control over"
"525","financial reporting."
"526","Accordingly, we express no"
"527","such opinion."
"528","The management of the"
"529","Fund is responsible for"
"530","establishing and"
"531","maintaining effective"
"532","internal control over"
"533","financial reporting. In"
"534","fulfilling this responsibility,"
"535","estimates and judgments by"
"536","management are required"
"537","to assess the expected"
"538","benefits and related costs of"
"539","controls. A fund's internal"
"540","control over financial"
"541","reporting is a process"
"542","designed to provide"
"543","reasonable assurance"
"544","regarding the reliability of"
"545","financial reporting and the"
"546","preparation of financial"
"547","statements for external"
"548","purposes in accordance"
"549","with generally accepted"
"550","accounting principles"
"551","(GAAP). A fund's internal"
"552","control over financial"
"553","reporting includes those"
"554","policies and procedures"
"555","that (1) pertain to the"
"556","maintenance of records"
"557","that, in reasonable detail,"
"558","accurately and fairly reflect"
"559","the transactions and"
"560","dispositions of the assets of"
"561","the fund; (2) provide"
"562","reasonable assurance that"
"563","transactions are recorded"
"564","as necessary to permit"
"565","preparation of financial"
"566","statements in accordance"
"567","with GAAP, and that"
"568","receipts and expenditures"
"569","of the fund are being made"
"570","only in accordance with"
"571","authorizations of"
"572","management and trustees"
"573","of the fund; and (3) provide"
"574","reasonable assurance"
"575","regarding prevention or"
"576","timely detection of"
"577","unauthorized acquisition,"
"578","use or disposition of a"
"579","fund's assets that could"
"580","have a material effect on the"
"581","financial statements."
"582","Because of its inherent"
"583","limitations, internal control"
"584","over financial reporting"
"585","may not prevent or detect"
"586","misstat ements. Also,"
"587","projections of any evaluation"
"588","of effectiveness to future"
"589","periods are subject to the"
"590","risk that controls may"
"591","become inadequate because"
"592","of changes in conditions, or"
"593","that the degree of"
"594","compliance with the policies"
"595","or procedures may deteriorat"
"596","e."
"597","A deficiency in internal"
"598","control over financial"
"599","reporting exists when the"
"600","design or operation of a"
"601","control does not  allow"
"602","management  or employees,"
"603","in the normal course of"
"604","performing their assigned"
"605","functions, to  prevent or"
"606","detect misstatements on a"
"607","timely basis. A material"
"608","weakness is a deficiency, or"
"609","combination of deficiencies,"
"610","in internal control over"
"611","financial reporting, such that"
"612","there is a reasonable"
"613","possibility that a material"
"614","misstatement  of  the Fund's"
"615","annual or interim financial"
"616","statements will not be"
"617","prevented or detected on a"
"618","timely basis."
"619","Our consideration of the"
"620","Fund's internal control over"
"621","financial reporting was for"
"622","the limited purpose"
"623","described in  the first"
"624","paragraph and would not"
"625","necessarily disclose all"
"626","deficiencies in internal"
"627","control that might be"
"628","material weaknesses under"
"629","standards established by the"
"630","Public Company Accounting"
"631","Oversight Board (United"
"632","States)."
"633","However, we noted no"
"634","deficiencies in the Fund's"
"635","internal control over financial"
"636","reporting and its operation,"
"637","including controls over"
"638","safeguarding securities, that"
"639","we consider to be a material"
"640","weakness as defined above"
"641","as of September 30, 2016."
"642","This report is intended solely"
"643","for the information and use"
"644","of management and the"
"645","Board of Trustees of the"
"646","Fund and the Securities and"
"647","Exchange Commission and"
"648","is not intended to be and"
