"3103","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED"
"3104","PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"3105","To the Board of Trustees of MFS Series Trust X and the Shareholders of MFS"
"3106","International Diversification Fund:"
"3107","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of MFS"
"3108","International Diversification Fund (the Fund) (one of the"
"3109","portfolios comprising MFS Series Trust X) as of and for the year ended"
"3110","May 31, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"3111","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds"
"3112","internal control over financial reporting, including"
"3113","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"3114","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"3115","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"3116"," not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"3117","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"3118","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3119","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"3120","effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"3121","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"3122","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs"
"3123","of controls. A funds internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"3124","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"3125","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"3126","for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"3127","accepted accounting principles. A funds internal control over financial"
"3128","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"3129","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"3130","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"3131","the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"3132"," recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"3133","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"3134","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"3135","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"3136","of the trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"3137","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"3138","disposition of a funds assets that could have a"
"3139","material effect on the financial statements."
"3140","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"3141"," may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"3142","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"3143"," the risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"3144","of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"3145"," procedures may deteriorate."
"3146","<PAGE>"
"3147","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"3148"," design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"3149","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to"
"3150"," prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"3151","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"3152","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is"
"3153","a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the funds annual or"
"3154","interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"3155","detected on a timely basis."
"3156","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial reporting was"

"3191","2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"3192","Oversight Board (United States),"
"3193","we considered the Funds internal control over financial reporting, including"
"3194"," controls over safeguarding"
"3195","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"3196","of expressing our opinion"
"3197","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"3198"," but not for the purpose"
"3199","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control"
"3200","over financial reporting."
"3201","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3202","The management of the Funds is responsible for  establishing  and maintaining"
"3203"," effective  internal control"
"3204","over financial  reporting.  In fulfilling this  responsibility,  estimates and"
"3205"," judgments by management are"
"3206","required to assess the expected  benefits  and related  costs of controls.  A"
"3207","companys  internal  control"
"3208","over financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"3209","assurance regarding the reliability"
"3210","of financial  reporting and the  preparation of financial  statements for"
"3211","external  purposes in accordance"
"3212","with generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A companys  internal"
"3213","control over financial  reporting"
"3214","includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that (1)  pertain  to the"
"3215"," maintenance  of  records  that,  in"
"3216","reasonable  detail,  accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions and"
"3217","dispositions of the assets of the"
"3218","company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are"
"3219","recorded  as  necessary  to permit"
"3220","preparation of financial  statements in accordance  with generally  accepted"
"3221"," accounting  principles,  and"
"3222","that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are being made only in"
"3223","accordance with  authorizations  of"
"3224","management and directors of the company;  and (3) provide  reasonable"
"3225","assurance  regarding  prevention or"
"3226","timely detection of unauthorized  acquisition,  use or disposition of a"
"3227","companys assets that could have a"
"3228","material effect on the financial statements."
"3229","Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial"
"3230","reporting may not prevent or detect"
"3231","misstatements.  Also,  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"3232","future periods are subject to the"
"3233","risk that  controls  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in"
"3234","conditions,  or that the degree of"
"3235","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3236","A  deficiency  in internal  control  over  financial  reporting  exists when"
"3237","the design or  operation of a"
"3238","control  does not allow  management  or  employees,  in the normal  course of"
"3239"," performing  their  assigned"
"3240","functions,  to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"3241"," weakness is a deficiency,  or"
"3242","a  combination  of  deficiencies,  in internal  control  over  financial"
"3243"," reporting,  such that there is a"
"3244","reasonable  possibility  that a  material  misstatement  of the  companys"
"3245","annual  or  interim  financial"
"3246","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3247","Our  consideration  of the Funds  internal  control over financial  reporting"
"3248"," was for the limited purpose"
"3249","described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily  disclose all"
"3250","deficiencies in internal control"
"3251","that might be material weaknesses under standards  established by the Public"
