"272","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman,serif; margin: 0>&nbsp;</P>"
"273","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman,serif; margin: 0>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Nationwide"
"274","Long/Short Equity Fund (the &ldquo;Fund&rdquo;) as of and for the year ended April 30, 2018, in accordance with the standards"
"275","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;), we considered the Fund&rsquo;s internal"
"276","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"277","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"278","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"279","we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting.</P>"
"280","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman,serif; margin: 0>&nbsp;</P>"
"281","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman,serif; margin: 0>The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"282","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"283","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting"
"284","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"285","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A fund&rsquo;s internal control over"
"286","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"287","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"288","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"289","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"290","and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"291","use or disposition of a fund&rsquo;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
"292","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman,serif; margin: 0>&nbsp;</P>"
"293","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman,serif; margin: 0>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"294","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"295","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"296","or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"
"297","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman,serif; margin: 0>&nbsp;</P>"
"298","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman,serif; margin: 0>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"299","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"300","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"301","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the fund&rsquo;s"
"302","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</P>"
"303","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman,serif; margin: 0>&nbsp;</P>"
"304","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman,serif; margin: 0>Our consideration of the Fund&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting"
"305","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"306","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB. However, we noted no deficiencies"
"307","in the Fund&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"308","that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of April 30, 2018.</P>"

"414","In re Tribune Company Fraudulent Conveyance Litigation, No. 11-MD-2296-RJS (the &ldquo;MDL&rdquo;). The MDL arises from the 2007"

"421","on behalf of the committee of unsecured creditors of Tribune (the &ldquo;Committee Action&rdquo;). These lawsuits seek to unwind"
"422","the LBO stock repurchases as fraudulent transfers and recover the stock repurchase proceeds paid to the Tribune shareholders who"
"423","participated in the LBO. The Funds were named as defendants in the Committee Action and one of the Individual Creditor Actions;"
"424","NMF and Nationwide Fund Advisors (&ldquo;NFA&rdquo;) were previously named as defendants in the Committee Action, but NMF and NFA"
"425","have since been dismissed from the lawsuits. According to the most recent amended complaint filed in the Committee Action, the"
"426","Nationwide S&amp;P 500 Index Fund is alleged to have received $1,329,720 in exchange for the shares it tendered in the LBO, and"

"432","One Motions, the District Court entered an order dismissing the Individual Creditor Actions in their entirety on the grounds that"
"433","the individual creditor plaintiffs lack standing to pursue their claims. The parties appealed the District Court&rsquo;s dismissal"

"435","the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal, albeit on the grounds that the individual creditor plaintiffs&rsquo; claims are preempted"
"436","by the Bankruptcy Code&rsquo;s safe harbor for securities transactions. The individual creditor plaintiffs petitioned the United"
"437","States Supreme Court for review of the Second Circuit&rsquo;s decision, and that petition is pending. The individual creditor plaintiffs"
"438","also have moved the Second Circuit to review its prior ruling in light of a recent decision by the Supreme Court (in an unrelated"

"444","Order for appeal to the Second Circuit after it disposes of additional pending motions to dismiss in the MDL (unrelated to the"
