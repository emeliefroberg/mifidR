"1622","Legal Proceedings"
"1623","Tribune Company"
"1624","Rydex Series Funds has been named as a defendant and a putative member"
"1625","of the proposed defendant class of shareholders in the case entitled"
"1626","Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Tribune Co. v. FitzSimons,"
"1627","No. 12-2652 (S.D.N.Y.) (formerly Adv. Pro. No. 10-54010 (Bankr. D. Del.))"
"1628","(the FitzSimons Action), as a result of ownership of shares in the Tribune"
"1629","Company (Tribune) in 2007 by certain series of the Rydex Series Funds"
"1630","when Tribune effected a leveraged buyout transaction (LBO) by which"
"1631","Tribune converted to a privately-held company. In its complaint, the"
"1632","Unsecured Creditors Committee (the UCC) has alleged that, in connection"
"1633","with the LBO, insiders and shareholders were overpaid for their Tribune"
"1634","stock using financing that the insiders knew would, and ultimately did,"
"1635","leave the Tribune insolvent. The UCC has asserted claims against certain"
"1636","insiders, shareholders, professional advisers, and others involved in"
"1637","the LBO, and is attempting to obtain from these individuals and entities"
"1638","the proceeds paid out in connection with the LBO."
"1639","Rydex Series Funds also has been named as a defendant in one or more of"
"1640","a group of lawsuits filed by a group of Tribune creditors that allege"
"1641","state law constructive fraudulent conveyance claims against former"
"1642","Tribune shareholders (the SLCFC actions)."
"1643","The FitzSimons action and the SLCFC actions have been consolidated with"
"1644","the majority of the other Tribune LBO-related lawsuits in a multidistrict"
"1645","litigation proceeding captioned In re Tribune Company Fraudulent Conveyance"
"1646","Litig., No. 11-md-2696 (S.D.N.Y.) (the MDL Proceeding). On November 6,"
"1647","2012, the defendants moved to dismiss the SLCFC actions. On December 21,"
"1648","2012, the plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion to"
"1649","dismiss. On February 4, 2013, the defendants filed a reply in support of"
"1650","the motion to dismiss. The Court has not yet issued a decision on the motion."
"1651","None of these lawsuits allege any wrongdoing on the part of Rydex Series"
"1652","Funds. The following series of Rydex Series Funds held shares of Tribune"
"1653","and tendered these shares as part of Tribunes LBO Nova Fund, S&P 500"
"1654","Pure Value Fund, Multi-Cap Core Equity Fund, S&P 500 Fund, Multi-Hedge"
"1655","Strategies Fund and Hedged Equity Fund (the Funds). The value of the"
"1656","proceeds received by the foregoing Funds was $28,220, $109,242, $9,860,"
"1657","$3,400, $1,181,160, and $10,880, respectively. At this stage of the"
"1658","proceedings, Rydex Series Funds is not able to make a reliable predication"
"1659","as to the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect, if any, on a Funds net"
"1660","asset value."
"1661","Lyondell Chemical Company"
"1662","In December 2011, Rydex Series Funds was named as a defendant in"
"1663","Weisfelner, as Trustee of the LB Creditor Trust, v. Fund 1 (In re"
"1664","Lyondell Chemical Co.), Adv. Pro. No. 10-4609 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.)."
"1665","Similar to the claims made in the Tribune matter, the Weisfelner complain"
"1666","seeks to have set aside and recovered as fraudulent transfers from former"
"1667","Lyondell Chemical Company (Lyondell) shareholders the consideration paid"
"1668","to them pursuant to the cash out merger of Lyondell shareholders in"
"1669","connection with the combination of Lyondell and Basell AF in 2007."
"1670","Lyondell filed for bankruptcy in 2008."
"1671","A motion to dismiss is currently pending before the Bankruptcy Court."
"1672","This lawsuit does not allege any wrongdoing on the part of Rydex Series"
"1673","Funds. The following series of Rydex Series Funds received cash proceeds"
"1674","from the cash out merger in the following amounts Basic Materials Fund"
"1675","$ 1,725,168, U.S. Long Short Momentum Fund - $2,193,600, Global 130/30"
"1676","Strategy Fund - $37,920, Hedged Equity Fund - $1,440, and Multi-Hedge"
"1677","Strategies Fund - $1,116,480. At this stage of the proceedings, Rydex Series"

"1688","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1689","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"1690","Rydex Series Funds"
"1691","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Rydex"
"1692","Series Funds (the Trust) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012,"
"1693","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1694","Board (United States), we considered the Trusts internal control over"
"1695","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"1696","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"1697","our opinions on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"1698","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1699","effectiveness of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting."
"1700","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1701","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1702","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1703","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1704","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A companys internal"
"1705","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1706","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1707","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1708","accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial"
"1709","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1710","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1711","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company,"
"1712","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"1713","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1714","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1715","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1716","and directors of the company, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1717","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"1718","disposition of a companys assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1719","financial statements."
"1720","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1721","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1722","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1723","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
