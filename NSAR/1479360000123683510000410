"872","       Section 1. Declaration of Trust. These By-Laws shall be subject to the"
"873","Declaration of Trust, as amended from time to time (Declaration of Trust), of"
"874","PIMCO Equity Series, a Delaware statutory trust (Trust). In the event of any"
"875","inconsistency between the terms hereof and the terms of the Declaration of"
"876","Trust, the terms of the Declaration of Trust shall control."
"877","       Section 2. Definitions. Capitalized terms used herein and not herein"
"878","defined are used as defined in the Declaration of Trust."
"879","                                  ARTICLE II"
"880","                                    OFFICES"
"881","       Section 1. Principal Office. The principal executive office of the Trust"
"882","shall be located in Newport Beach, California, until such time as the Trustees"
"883","may change the location of the principal executive office of the Trust to any"
"884","other place."
"885","       Section 2. Delaware Office. The Trustees shall establish a registered"
"886","office in the State of Delaware and shall appoint as the Trust's registered"
"887","agent for service of process in the State of Delaware an individual who is a"
"888","resident of the State of Delaware or a Delaware corporation or a corporation"
"889","authorized to transact business in the State of Delaware; in each case the"
"890","business office of such registered agent for service of process shall be"
"891","identical with the registered Delaware office of the Trust. The Trustees may"
"892","designate a successor resident agent, provided, however, that such appointment"
"893","shall not become effective until written notice thereof is delivered to the"
"894","Office of the Secretary of the State of Delaware."
"895","       Section 3. Other Offices. The Trustees may at any time establish branch"
"896","or subordinate offices at any place or places within or outside the State of"
"897","Delaware as the Trustees may from time to time determine."
"898","                                  ARTICLE III"
"899","                           MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS"
"900","       Section 1. Place of Meetings. Meetings of Shareholders shall be held at"
"901","any place designated by the Trustees. In the absence of any such designation,"
"902","Shareholders' meetings shall be held at the principal executive office of the"
"903","Trust."
"904","       Section 2. Call of Meetings. There shall be no annual meetings of"
"905","Shareholders except as required by law. Special meetings of the Shareholders of"
"906","the Trust or of any Series or Class may be called at any time by the Trustees"
"907","or by the President or the Secretary for the purpose of taking action upon any"
"908","matter requiring the vote or authority of the Shareholders of the Trust or of"
"909","any Series or Class as herein provided or provided in the Declaration of Trust"
"910","or upon any other matter as to which such vote"
"911","                                       1"
"912","or authority is deemed by the Trustees or the President to be necessary or"
"913","desirable. Meetings of the Shareholders of the Trust or of any Series or Class"
"914","may be called for any purpose deemed necessary or desirable upon the written"
"915","request of the Shareholders holding at least ten percent (10%) of the"
"916","Outstanding Shares of the Trust entitled to vote at such meeting, provided that"
"917","(1) such request shall state the purposes of such meeting and the matters"
"918","proposed to be acted on, and (2) the Shareholders requesting such meeting shall"
"919","have paid to the Trust the reasonably estimated cost of preparing and mailing"
"920","the notice thereof, which the Secretary shall determine and specify to such"
"921","Shareholders. If the Secretary fails for more than thirty (30) days to call a"
"922","special meeting, the Trustees or the Shareholders requesting such a meeting"
"923","may, in the name of the Secretary, call the meeting by giving the required"
"924","notice. If the meeting is a meeting of Shareholders of any Series or Class, but"
"925","not a meeting of all Shareholders of the Trust, then only a special meeting of"
"926","Shareholders of such Series or Class need be called and, in such case, only"
"927","Shareholders of such Series or Class shall be entitled to notice of and to vote"
"928","at such meeting."
"929","       Section 3. Notice of Meetings of Shareholders. All notices of meetings"
"930","of Shareholders shall be sent or otherwise given to Shareholders in accordance"
"931","with Section 4 of this Article III not less than ten (10) nor more than ninety"
"932","(90) days before the date of the meeting. The notice shall specify (i) the"
"933","place, date and hour of the meeting, and (ii) the general nature of the"
"934","business to be transacted."
"935","       Section 4. Manner of Giving Notice; Affidavit of Notice."
"936","      (a) Notice of any meeting of Shareholders shall be (i) given either by"
"937","   hand delivery, first-class mail, telegraphic or other written or electronic"
"938","   communication, charges prepaid, and (ii) addressed to the Shareholder at the"
"939","   address of that Shareholder appearing on the books of the Trust or its"
"940","   transfer agent or given by the Shareholder to the Trust for the purpose of"
"941","   notice. If no such address appears on the Trust's books or is not given to"
"942","   the Trust, or to the Trust's transfer or similar agent, notice shall be"
"943","   deemed to be waived and therefore unnecessary, unless and until the"
"944","   Shareholder provides the Trust, or the Trust's transfer or similar agent,"
"945","   with his or her address. Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the"
"946","   time when delivered personally or deposited in the mail or sent by telegram"
"947","   or other means of written or electronic communication or, where notice is"
"948","   given by publication, on the date of publication. Without limiting the"
"949","   manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to Shareholders,"
"950","   any notice to Shareholders given by the Trust shall be effective if given by"
"951","   a single written notice to Shareholders who share an address if consented to"
"952","   by the Shareholders at that address."
"953","      (b) If any notice addressed to a Shareholder at the address of that"
"954","   Shareholder appearing on the books of the Trust is returned to the Trust by"
"955","   the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the Postal Service"
"956","   is unable to deliver the notice to the Shareholder at that address, all"
"957","   future notices or reports shall be deemed to have been duly given without"
"958","   further mailing if such future notices or reports shall be kept available to"
"959","   the Shareholder, upon written demand of the Shareholder, at the principal"
"960","   executive office of the Trust for a period of one year from the date of the"
"961","   giving of the notice."
"962","      (c) An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of"
"963","   any meeting of Shareholders shall be filed and maintained in the minute book"
"964","   of the Trust."
"965","       Section 5. Conduct of Meetings of Shareholders. The meetings of"
"966","Shareholders shall be presided over by the President, or if he or she is not"
"967","present, by any Vice President, unless there is an Executive Vice President, or"
"968","if none of them is present, then any officer of the Trust appointed by the"
"969","President to act on his or her behalf shall preside over such meetings. The"
"970","Secretary, if present, shall act as a Secretary of such meetings, or if he or"
"971","she is not present or is otherwise presiding over the meeting in another"
"972","capacity, an Assistant Secretary, if any, shall so act. If neither the"
"973","Secretary nor the Assistant Secretary is present or, if present, the Secretary"
"974","is otherwise presiding over the meeting in another capacity, then any such"
"975","person appointed by the Secretary to act on his or her behalf shall act as"
"976","Secretary of such meetings."
"977","                                       2"
"978","       Section 6. Adjourned Meeting; Notice. Any meeting of Shareholders,"
"979","whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the"
"980","vote of a majority of the Shares represented at the meeting, either in person"
"981","or by proxy. Notwithstanding the above, broker non-votes will be excluded from"
"982","the denominator of the calculation of the number of votes required to approve"
"983","any proposal to adjourn a meeting. Notice of adjournment of a Shareholders'"
"984","meeting to another time or place need not be given, if such time and place are"
"985","announced at the meeting at which adjournment is taken and the adjourned"
"986","meeting is held within a reasonable time after the date set for the original"
"987","meeting. If the adjournment is for more than sixty (60) days from the date set"
"988","for the original meeting or a new record date is fixed for the adjourned"
"989","meeting, notice of any such adjourned meeting shall be given to each"
"990","Shareholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance"
"991","with the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this Article III. At any adjourned"
"992","meeting, the Trust may transact any business which might have been transacted"
"993","at the original meeting."
"994","       Section 7. Voting. The Shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of"
"995","Shareholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the"
"996","Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as in effect as of such time. The"
"997","Shareholders' vote may be by voice vote or by ballot; provided, however, that"
"998","any election for Trustees must be by ballot if demanded by any Shareholder"
"999","before the voting has begun. On any matter other than election of Trustees, any"
"1000","Shareholder may cast part of the votes that such Shareholder is entitled to"
"1001","cast in favor of the proposal and refrain from casting and/or cast the"
"1002","remaining part of such votes against the proposal; but if such Shareholder"
"1003","fails to specify the number of votes that such Shareholder is casting in favor"
"1004","of the proposal, it will be conclusively presumed that such Shareholder is"
"1005","casting all of the votes that such Shareholder is entitled to cast in favor of"
"1006","such proposal."
"1007","       Section 8. Waiver of Notice; Consent of Absent Shareholders."
"1008","      (a) The transaction of business and any actions taken at a meeting of"
"1009","   Shareholders, however called and noticed and wherever held, shall be as"
"1010","   valid as though taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice"
"1011","   provided a quorum is present either in person or by proxy at the meeting of"
"1012","   Shareholders and if either before or after the meeting, each Shareholder"
"1013","   entitled to vote who was not present in person or by proxy at the meeting of"
"1014","   the Shareholders signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to a holding"
"1015","   of the meeting or an approval of the minutes. The waiver of notice or"
"1016","   consent need not specify either the business to be transacted or the purpose"
"1017","   of any meeting of Shareholders."
"1018","      (b) Attendance by a Shareholder at a meeting of Shareholders shall also"
"1019","   constitute a waiver of notice of that meeting, except if the Shareholder"
"1020","   objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business"
"1021","   because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that"
"1022","   attendance at a meeting of Shareholders is not a waiver of any right to"
"1023","   object to the consideration of matters not included in the notice of the"
"1024","   meeting of Shareholders if that objection is expressly made at the beginning"
"1025","   of the meeting."
"1026","       Section 9. Shareholder Action by Written Consent Without a Meeting."
"1027","      (a) Except as provided in the Declaration of Trust, any action that may"
"1028","   be taken at any meeting of Shareholders may be taken without a meeting and"
"1029","   without prior notice if a consent or consents in writing setting forth the"
"1030","   action to be taken is signed by the holders of Outstanding Shares having not"
"1031","   less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize"
"1032","   or take that action at a meeting at which all Shares entitled to vote on"
"1033","   that action were present and voted"
"1034","                                       3"
"1035","   provided, however, that the Shareholders receive any necessary Information"
"1036","   Statement or other necessary documentation in conformity with the"
"1037","   requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the rules or"
"1038","   regulations thereunder. Any such written consent may be executed and given"
"1039","   by facsimile or other electronic means. All such consents shall be filed"
"1040","   with the Secretary of the Trust and shall be maintained in the Trust's"
"1041","   records. Any Shareholder giving a written consent, a transferee of the"
"1042","   Shares, a personal representative of the Shareholder, or their respective"
"1043","   proxy holders may revoke the Shareholder's written consent by a writing"
"1044","   received by the Secretary of the Trust before written consents of the number"
"1045","   of Outstanding Shares required to authorize the proposed action have been"
"1046","   filed with the Secretary."
"1047","      (b) If the consents of all Shareholders entitled to vote have not been"
"1048","   solicited in writing and if the unanimous written consent of all such"
"1049","   Shareholders shall not have been received, the Secretary shall give prompt"
"1050","   notice of the action approved by the Shareholders without a meeting. This"
"1051","   notice shall be given in the manner specified in Section 4 of this Article"
"1052","   III to each Shareholder entitled to vote who did not execute such written"
"1053","   consent."
"1054","       Section 10. Record Date for Shareholder Notice, Voting and Giving"
"1055","Consents."
"1056","      (a) For purposes of determining the Shareholders entitled to vote or act"
"1057","   at any meeting or adjournment or postponement thereof, the Trustees may fix"
"1058","   in advance a record date which shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor"
"1059","   less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting. Without fixing"

"1061","   close the register or transfer books for one or more Series (or Classes) for"
"1062","   all or any part of the period between the earliest date on which a record"
"1063","   date for such meeting could be set in accordance herewith and the date of"
"1064","   such meeting. If the Trustees do not so fix a record date or close the"
"1065","   register or transfer books of the affected Series or Classes, the record"
"1066","   date for determining Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a"
"1067","   meeting of Shareholders shall be the close of business on the business day"
"1068","   next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at"

"1073","   Trustees has been taken, shall be the day on which the first written consent"
"1074","   is given, or (b) when prior action of the Trustees has been taken, shall be"
"1075","   (i) such date as determined for that purpose by the Trustees, which record"
"1076","   date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing it is"
"1077","   adopted by the Trustees and shall not be more than twenty (20) days after"
"1078","   the date of such resolution, or (ii) if no record date is fixed by the"
"1079","   Trustees, the record date shall be the close of business on the day on which"
"1080","   the Trustees adopt the resolution relating to that action."
"1081","      (c) Nothing in this Section shall be construed as precluding the Trustees"
"1082","   from setting different record dates for different Series or Classes. Only"
"1083","   Shareholders of record on the record date, as herein determined, shall have"
"1084","   any right to vote or to act at any meeting or give consent to any action"
"1085","   relating to such record date, notwithstanding any transfer of Shares on the"
"1086","   books of the Trust after such record date."
"1087","       Section 11. Proxies. Subject to the provisions of the Declaration of"
"1088","Trust, Shareholders entitled to vote for Trustees or on any other matter shall"
"1089","have the right to do so either in person or by proxy, provided that either"
"1090","(i) a written instrument authorizing such a proxy to act is executed by the"
"1091","Shareholder or his or her duly authorized attorney-in-fact and dated not more"
"1092","than eleven (11) months before the meeting, unless the instrument specifically"
"1093","provides for a longer period, or (ii) the Trustees adopt an electronic,"
"1094","telephonic, computerized or other alternative to the execution of a written"
"1095","instrument authorizing the proxy to act, and such authorization is received not"
"1096","more than eleven (11) months before the meeting. A proxy shall be deemed"
"1097","executed by a Shareholder if the Shareholder's name is placed on"
"1098","                                       4"
"1099","the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission"
"1100","or otherwise) by the Shareholder or the Shareholder's attorney-in-fact. A valid"
"1101","proxy which does not state that it is irrevocable shall continue in full force"
"1102","and effect unless (i) revoked by the Person executing it before the vote"
"1103","pursuant to that proxy is taken, (a) by a writing delivered to the Trust"
"1104","stating that the proxy is revoked, or (b) by a subsequent proxy executed by"
"1105","such Person, or (c) attendance at the meeting and voting in person by the"
"1106","Person executing that proxy, or (d) revocation by such Person using any"
"1107","electronic, telephonic, computerized or other alternative means authorized by"
"1108","the Trustees for authorizing the proxy to act; or (ii) written notice of the"
"1109","death or incapacity of the maker of that proxy is received by the Trust before"
"1110","the vote pursuant to that proxy is counted. A proxy with respect to Shares held"
"1111","in the name of two or more Persons shall be valid if executed by any one of"
"1112","them unless at or prior to exercise of the proxy the Trust receives a specific"
"1113","written notice to the contrary from any one of the two or more Persons. A proxy"
"1114","purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Shareholder shall be deemed"
"1115","valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise and the burden of proving"
"1116","invalidity shall rest on the challenger. Unless otherwise specifically limited"
"1117","by their terms, proxies shall entitle the Shareholder to vote at any"
"1118","adjournment or postponement of a Shareholders' meeting. At every meeting of"
"1119","Shareholders, unless the voting is conducted by inspectors, all questions"
"1120","concerning the qualifications of voters, the validity of proxies, and the"
"1121","acceptance or rejection of votes, shall be decided by the chairman of the"
"1122","meeting. Subject to the provisions of the Declaration of Trust or these"
"1123","By-Laws, all matters concerning the giving, voting or validity of proxies shall"
"1124","be governed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware relating to"
"1125","proxies, and judicial interpretations thereunder, as if the Trust were a"
"1126","Delaware corporation and the Shareholders were shareholders of a Delaware"
"1127","corporation."

"1129","the Trustees may appoint any persons other than nominees for office to act as"
"1130","inspectors of election at the meeting or its adjournment or postponement. If no"
"1131","inspectors of election are so appointed, the chairman of the meeting may"
"1132","appoint inspectors of election at the meeting. If any person appointed as"
"1133","inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the chairman of the"
"1134","meeting may appoint a person to fill the vacancy."
"1135","       These inspectors shall:"
"1136","      (a) Determine the number of Shares outstanding and the voting power of"
"1137","   each, the Shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum and"
"1138","   the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies."
"1139","      (b) Receive votes, ballots or consents."
"1140","      (c) Hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in"
"1141","   connection with the right to vote."
"1142","      (d) Count and tabulate all votes or consents."
"1143","      (e) Determine when the polls shall close."
"1144","      (f) Determine the result."

"1603","<TEXT>"
"1604","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1605","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"1606","of PIMCO Equity Series:"
"1607","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of PIMCO"
"1608","Equity Series (the Fund) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2010, in"
"1609","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1610","(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1611","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1612","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1613","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"1614","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"1615","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"1616","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1617","reporting."
"1618","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1619","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1620","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1621","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"1622","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1623","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1624","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1625","accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial"
"1626","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1627","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1628","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"1629","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1630","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1631","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1632","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1633","trustees of the company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1634","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1635","of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1636","statements."
"1637","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1638","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1639","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1640","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1641","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1642","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1643","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"1644","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1645","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1646","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1647","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1648","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"1649","on a timely basis."
"1650","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"1651","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1652","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"1653","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1654","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"1655","no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1656","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to"
"1657","be material weaknesses as defined above as of June 30, 2010."

"1672","<TEXT>"
"1673","PIMCO, a subsidiary of Allianz Global Investors of America L.P., and PIMCO"
"1674","Funds, are the subject of a lawsuit in the Northern District of Illinois"
"1675","Eastern Division, in which the complaint alleges that the plaintiffs each"
"1676","purchased and sold a 10-year Treasury note futures contract and suffered"
"1677","damages from an alleged shortage when PIMCO held both physical and futures"
"1678","positions in 10-year Treasury notes for its client accounts in violation of"
"1679","the federal Commodity Exchange Act provisions on market manipulation. In July"
"1680","2007, the District Court granted class certification of a class consisting of"
"1681","those persons who purchased futures contracts to offset short positions"
"1682","between May 9, 2005 and June 30, 2005. Management believes the complaint is"
"1683","without merit and PIMCO and PIMCO Funds intend to vigorously defend against"
"1684","this action.  The outcome of this action cannot be predicted at this time."
"1685","In April 2006, certain registered investment companies and other funds managed"
"1686","by PIMCO were served in an adversary proceeding brought by the Official"
"1687","Committee of Asbestos Claimants of G-I Holdings, Inc. in G-I Holdings, Inc.'s"
"1688","bankruptcy in the District of New Jersey. In July 2004, PIMCO was named in"
"1689","this lawsuit and remains a defendant. The plaintiff seeks to recover for the"
"1690","bankruptcy estate assets that were transferred by the predecessor entity of"
"1691","G-I Holdings, Inc. to a wholly-owned subsidiary in 1994. The subsidiary has"
"1692","since issued notes, of which certain registered investment companies and other"
"1693","funds managed by PIMCO are alleged to be holders. The complaint alleges that"
"1694","in 2000, more than two hundred noteholders - including certain registered"
"1695","investment companies and other funds managed by PIMCO - were granted a second"
"1696","priority lien on the assets of the subsidiary in exchange for their consent to"
"1697","a refinancing transaction and the granting of a first priority lien to the"
"1698","lending banks. The plaintiff is seeking invalidation of the lien in favor of"
"1699","the noteholders and/or the value of the lien.  On November 12, 2009, the"
"1700","District Court and Bankruptcy Court issued an order confirming a Plan of"
"1701","Reorganization (the Plan) in the underlying bankruptcy case.   As part of"
"1702","the Plan, the adversary proceeding to which PIMCO and other funds managed by"
"1703","PIMCO (PIMCO Entities) are parties will be dismissed.  In confirming the"
"1704","Plan, the Courts overruled certain objections (unrelated to the dismissal of"
"1705","claims against PIMCO and PIMCO Entities) made by the IRS.  The IRS sought a"
"1706","stay pending appeal to the Third Circuit, the stay was granted and"
"1707","G-I Holdings, Inc. has asked the Third Circuit to dismiss the stay.  This"
"1708","matter is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the relevant PIMCO"
"1709","Entities."

"1777","Trustees and employees; insurance premiums; brokerage and other expenses of"

"1782","the foregoing expenses of this Section 3(b) shall be the responsibility of the"
"1783","other party or parties to that agreement."
"1784","4.  (a) The Adviser shall provide to the Trust investment guidance and policy"
"1785","direction in connection with the management of the Funds, including oral and"
"1786","written research, analysis, advice, and statistical and economic data and"
"1787","information."
"1788","Consistent with the investment objectives, policies and restrictions applicable"
"1789","to the Trust and the Funds, the Adviser will determine the securities and other"
"1790","assets to be purchased or sold or the other techniques to be utilized"
"1791","(including, but not limited to, securities lending) by each Fund and will"
"1792","determine what portion of each Fund shall be invested in securities or other"
"1793","assets, and what portion, if any, should be held uninvested."
"1794","The Trust will have the benefit of the investment analysis and research, the"
"1795","review of current economic conditions and trends and the consideration of"
"1796","long-range investment policy generally available to investment advisory"
"1797","clients of the Adviser. It is understood that the Adviser will not, to the"
"1798","extent inconsistent with applicable law, use any material nonpublic information"
"1799","pertinent to investment decisions undertaken in connection with this Contract"
"1800","that may be in its possession or in the possession of any of its affiliates."
"1801","(b) The Adviser also shall provide to the officers of the Trust administrative"
"1802","assistance in connection with the operation of the Trust and the Funds, which"
"1803","shall include (i) compliance with all reasonable requests of the Trust for"
"1804","information, including information required in connection with the Trust's"
"1805","filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and state securities"
"1806","commissions, and (ii) such other services as the Adviser shall from time to"
"1807","time determine to be necessary or useful to the administration of the Trust and"
"1808","Funds."
"1809","(c) As manager of the assets of the Funds, the Adviser shall make investments"
"1810","for the account of the Funds in accordance with the Adviser's best judgment and"
"1811","within the investment objectives, policies, and restrictions set forth in the"
"1812","Prospectus, the 1940 Act and the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code"
"1813","relating to regulated investment companies, subject to policy decisions adopted"
"1814","by the Trust's Board of Trustees."
"1815","(d) The Adviser shall furnish to the Trust's Board of Trustees periodic reports"
"1816","on the investment performance of the Trust and its Funds and on the performance"
"1817","of its obligations under this Contract and shall supply such additional reports"
"1818","and information as the Trust's officers or Board of Trustees shall reasonably"
"1819","request."
"1820","(e) On occasions when the Adviser deems the purchase or sale of a security to"
"1821","be in the best interest of a Fund as well as other of its clients, the Adviser,"
"1822","to the extent permitted by applicable law, may aggregate the securities to be"
"1823","so sold or purchased in order to obtain the best execution of the order or"
"1824","lower brokerage commissions, if any. The Adviser may also on occasion purchase"
"1825","or sell a particular security for one or more clients in different amounts. On"
"1826","either occasion, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and regulations,"
"1827","allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the expenses"
"1828","incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Adviser in the manner it"
"1829","considers to be the most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary"
"1830","obligations to the Trust and to such other customers."
"1831","(f) The Adviser may cause a Fund to pay a broker which provides brokerage and"
"1832","research services to the Adviser a commission for effecting a securities"
"1833","transaction in excess of the amount another broker might have charged. Such"
"1834","higher commissions may not be paid unless the Adviser determines in good faith"
"1835","that the amount paid is reasonable in relation to the services received in"
"1836","terms of the particular transaction or the Adviser's overall responsibilities"
"1837","to the Trust and any other of the Adviser's clients."
"1838","(g) The Adviser may itself, or may cause a Fund to, commence, join in, consent"
"1839","to or oppose the reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, sale, merger,"
"1840","foreclosure, liquidation or readjustment of the finances of any person or the"
"1841","securities or other property thereof, and to deposit any securities or other"
"1842","property with any protective, reorganization or similar committee.  Without"
"1843","limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Adviser may represent a Fund on a"
"1844","creditors' (or similar) committee."
"1845","(h) The Adviser shall have sole authority to exercise whatever powers the Trust"
"1846","may possess with respect to any of the assets of a Fund, including, but not"
"1847","limited to, the right to vote proxies, the power to exercise rights, options,"
"1848","warrants, conversion privileges and redemption privileges, and to tender"
"1849","securities pursuant to a tender offer."
"1850","(i) The Adviser shall have the authority to enter into any agreements and"
"1851","execute any documents (e.g., any derivatives documentation such as exchange"
"1852","traded and over-the-counter, as applicable) required to meet the obligations of"
"1853","a Fund with respect to any investments made for the Fund which shall include"
"1854","any market and/or industry standard documentation and the standard"
"1855","representations and/or indemnifications contained therein."
"1856","5.  The Adviser shall give the Trust the benefit of the Adviser's best judgment"
"1857","and efforts in rendering services under this Contract. The Adviser may rely on"
"1858","information reasonably believed by it to be accurate and reliable. As an"
"1859","inducement for the Adviser's undertaking to render services under this"
"1860","Contract, the Trust agrees that neither the Adviser nor its members, officers,"
"1861","directors, or employees shall be subject to any liability for, or any damages,"
"1862","expenses or losses incurred in connection with, any act or omission or mistake"
"1863","in judgment connected with or arising out of any services rendered under this"
"1864","Contract, except by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross"
"1865","negligence in performance of the Adviser's duties, or by reason of reckless"
"1866","disregard of the Adviser's obligations and duties under this Contract. This"
"1867","provision shall govern only the liability to the Trust of the Adviser and that"
"1868","of its members, officers, directors, and employees, and shall in no way govern"
"1869","the liability to the Trust or the Adviser or provide a defense for any other"
"1870","person including persons that provide services for the Funds as described in"
"1871","this Contract."
"1872","6.  In consideration of the services to be rendered by the Adviser under this"
"1873","Contract, each Fund shall pay the Adviser a monthly fee on the first business"
"1874","day of each month, based upon the average daily value (as determined on each"
"1875","business day at the time set forth in the Prospectus for determining net asset"
"1876","value per share) of the net assets of the Fund, during the preceding month, at"
"1877","the annual rates provided for in Exhibit A, as such Exhibit A may be amended"
"1878","from time to time."
"1879","If the fees payable to the Adviser pursuant to this Section 6 begin to accrue"
"1880","before the end of any month or if this Contract terminates before the end of"
"1881","any month, the fees for the period from that date to the end of that month or"
"1882","from the beginning of that month to the date of termination, as the case may"
"1883","be, shall be prorated according to the proportion which the period bears to the"
"1884","full month in which the effectiveness or termination occurs. For purposes of"
"1885","calculating the monthly fees, the value of the net assets of each Fund shall be"
"1886","computed in the manner specified in the Prospectus for the computation of net"
"1887","asset value. For purposes of this Contract, a business day is any day a Fund"
"1888","is open for business or as otherwise provided in the Trust's Prospectus."
"1889","7.  (a) This Contract shall become effective with respect to the Funds on March"
"1890","30, 2010 (and, with respect to any amendment, or with respect to any additional"
"1891","fund, the date of the amendment or Supplement hereto) and shall continue in"

"1908","8.  Except to the extent necessary to perform the Adviser's obligations under"

"2253","Administrator and/or AGID from their own resources (which may include"
"2254","legitimate profits from serving as investment adviser and/or administrator) and"

"2264","below; (b) the Administrator shall provide to the Trustees of the Trust, and"
"2265","all such Trustees shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the"
"2266","amounts expended by the Trust for Special Class D Services and the purposes for"
"2267","which such expenditures were made; and (c) this Agreement may be terminated as"

"2272","provided in Section 10 below; and (b) this Agreement may also terminate in the"
"2273","circumstances described in Section 15(d) below. This Agreement may not be"
"2274","amended to increase materially the maximum amount specified in Section 5 (i.e.,"

"2276","Services without approval by a majority of the outstanding Class D Shares (as"
"2277","defined in Section 2(a)(42) of the 1940 Act in respect of voting securities) of"
"2278","a Fund. All material amendments to this Agreement (insofar as the relevant"
"2279","provision constitutes a part of a distribution plan) must be approved by a"
"2280","majority of the Qualified Trustees. Insofar as this Agreement constitutes a"
"2281","distribution plan for Class D Shares, its provisions are severable for that"
"2282","Class."
"2283","       It is acknowledged and agreed that classes of Shares other than Class D"
"2284","may have separately documented distribution plans and related agreements."

"2287","to render similar services to other investment companies and other clients."
