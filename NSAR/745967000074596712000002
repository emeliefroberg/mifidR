"584","the Public"
"585","Company"
"586","Accounting"
"587","Oversight Board"
"588","(United States),"
"589","we considered the"
"590","Fund?s internal"
"591","control over"
"592","financial"
"593","reporting,"
"594","including controls"
"595","over safeguarding"
"596","securities, as a"
"597","basis for"
"598","designing our"
"599","auditing"
"600","procedures for the"
"601","purpose of"
"602","expressing our"
"603","opinion on the"
"604","financial"
"605","statements and to"
"606","comply with the"
"607","requirements of"
"608","Form N-SAR, but"
"609","not for the"

"612","opinion on the"
"613","effectiveness of"
"614","the Fund?s"
"615","internal control"

"617","reporting."
"618","Accordingly, we"
"619","express no such"

"621","The management"
"622","of the Fund is"
"623","responsible for"
"624","establishing and"
"625","maintaining"
"626","effective internal"
"627","control over"
"628","financial"
"629","reporting. In"
"630","fulfilling this"
"631","responsibility,"
"632","estimates and"

"634","management are"
"635","required to assess"

"638","related costs of"
"639","controls. A"
"640","company?s"
"641","internal control"
"642","over financial"
"643","reporting is a"
"644","process designed"
"645","to provide"
"646","reasonable"
"647","assurance"
"648","regarding the"
"649","reliability of"
"650","financial reporting"
"651","and the"
"652","preparation of"
"653","financial"
"654","statements for"
"655","external purposes"
"656","in accordance"
"657","with generally"
"658","accepted"
"659","accounting"
"660","principles.  A"
"661","company?s"
"662","internal control"
"663","over financial"
"664","reporting includes"
"665","those policies and"
"666","procedures that"
"667","(1) pertain to the"
"668","maintenance of"
"669","records that,  in"
"670","reasonable detail,"
"671","accurately and"
"672","fairly reflect the"
"673","transactions and"
"674","dispositions of the"
"675","assets of the"
"676","company; (2)"
"677","provide"
"678","reasonable"
"679","assurance that"
"680","transactions are"
"681","recorded as"
"682","necessary to"
"683","permit preparation"
"684","of financial"
"685","statements in"
"686","accordance with"
"687","generally accepted"
"688","accounting"
"689","principles, and"
"690","that receipts and"
"691","expenditures of"
"692","the company are"

"694","in accordance"
"695","with"
"696","authorizations of"
"697","management and"
"698","directors of the"
"699","company; and (3)"
"700","provide"
"701","reasonable"
"702","assurance"
"703","regarding"
"704","prevention or"
"705","timely detection"
"706","of unauthorized"
"707","acquisition, use or"
"708","disposition of a"
"709","company?s assets"
"710","that could have a"
"711","material effect on"
"712","the financial"
"713","statements."
"714","Because of its"
"715","inherent"
"716","limitations,"
"717","internal control"
"718","over financial"
"719","reporting may not"
"720","prevent or detect"
"721","misstatements."
"722","Also, projections"
"723","of any evaluation"
"724","of effectiveness to"
"725","future periods are"
"726","subject to the risk"
"727","that controls may"
"728","become"
"729","inadequate"
"730","because of"
"731","changes in"
"732","conditions, or that"
"733","the degree of"
"734","compliance with"
"735","the policies or"
"736","procedures may"
"737","deteriorate."
"738","A deficiency in"
"739","internal control"
"740","over financial"
"741","reporting exists"
"742","when the design"
"743","or operation of a"
"744","control does not"
"745","allow"
"746","management or"
"747","employees, in the"
"748","normal course of"
"749","performing their"
"750","assigned"
"751","functions, to"
"752","prevent or detect"
"753","misstatements on"
"754","a timely basis.  A"
"755","material weakness"
"756","is a deficiency, or"
"757","a combination of"
"758","deficiencies, in"
"759","internal control"
"760","over financial"
"761","reporting, such"
"762","that there is a"
"763","reasonable"
"764","possibility that a"
"765","material"
"766","misstatement of"
"767","the company?s"
"768","annual or interim"
"769","financial"
"770","statements will"
"771","not be prevented"
"772","or detected on a"
"773","timely basis."
"774","Our consideration"
"775","of the Fund?s"
"776","internal control"
"777","over financial"
"778","reporting was for"
"779","the limited"
"780","purpose described"
"781","in the first"
"782","paragraph and"
"783","would not"
"784","necessarily"
"785","disclose all"
"786","deficiencies in"
"787","internal control"
"788","that might be"
"789","material"
"790","weaknesses under"
"791","standards"
"792","established by the"
"793","Public Company"
"794","Accounting"
"795","Oversight Board"
"796","(United States)."
"797","However, we"
"798","noted no"
"799","deficiencies in the"
"800","Fund?s internal"
"801","control over"
"802","financial reporting"
"803","and its operation,"
"804","including controls"
"805","over safeguarding"
"806","securities that we"
