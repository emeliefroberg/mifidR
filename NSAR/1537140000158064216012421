"515","REPORT OF"
"516","INDEPENDENT"
"517","REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"518","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"519","To the Shareholders and"
"520","Board of Trustees of"
"521","Persimmon Long/Short"
"522","Fund a Series of the"
"523","Northern Lights Fund Trust"
"524","III"
"525","In planning and performing"
"526","our audit of the financial"
"527","statements of Persimmon"
"528","Long/Short fund (one of a"
"529","series of funds constituting"
"530","the Northern Lights Fund"
"531","Trust lll) (the Fund) as of"
"532","and for the year ended"
"533","September 30, 2016, in"
"534","accordance with the"
"535","standards of the Public"
"536","Company Accounting"
"537","Oversight Board (United"
"538","States), we considered the"
"539","Fund's internal control over"
"540","financial reporting, including"
"541","controls over safeguarding"
"542","securities, as a basis for"
"543","designing our auditing"
"544","procedures for the purpose"
"545","of expressing our opinion on"
"546","the financial statements and"
"547","to comply with the"
"548","requirements of Form N-"
"549","SAR, but not for the"
"550","purpose of expressing an"
"551","opinion on the effectiveness"
"552","of the Fund's internal"
"553","control over financial"
"554","reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"555","express no such opinion."
"556","The management of the"
"557","Fund is responsible for"
"558","establishing and"
"559","maintaining effective"
"560","internal control over"
"561","financial reporting.  In"
"562","fulfilling this responsibility,"
"563","estimates and judgments by"
"564","management are required"
"565","to assess the expected"
"566","benefits and related costs of"
"567","controls.  A fund's internal"
"568","control over financial"
"569","reporting is a process"
"570","designed to provide"
"571","reasonable assurance"
"572","regarding the reliability of"
"573","financial reporting and the"
"574","preparation of financial"
"575","statements for external"
"576","purposes in accordance"
"577","with generally accepted"
"578","accounting principles"
"579","(GAAP).  A fund's internal"
"580","control over financial"
"581","reporting includes those"
"582","policies and procedures that"
"583","(1) pertain to the"
"584","maintenance of records"
"585","that, in reasonable detail,"
"586","accurately and fairly reflect"
"587","the transactions and"
"588","dispositions of the assets of"
"589","the fund; (2) provide"
"590","reasonable assurance that"
"591","transactions are recorded"
"592","as necessary to permit"
"593","preparation of financial"
"594","statements in accordance"
"595","with GAAP, and that"
"596","receipts and expenditures of"
"597","the fund are being made"
"598","only in accordance with"
"599","authorizations of"
"600","management and directors"
"601","of the fund; and (3) provide"
"602","reasonable assurance"
"603","regarding prevention or"
"604","timely detection of"
"605","unauthorized acquisition,"
"606","use or disposition of a"
"607","fund's assets that could"
"608","have a material effect on"
"609","the financial statements."
"610","Because of its inherent"
"611","limitations, internal control"
"612","over financial reporting may"
"613","not prevent or detect"
"614","misstatements.  Also,"
"615","projections of any"
"616","evaluation of effectiveness"
"617","to future periods are subject"
"618","to the risk that controls may"
"619","become inadequate"
"620","because of changes in"
"621","conditions, or that the"
"622","degree of compliance with"
"623","the policies or procedures"
"624","may deteriorate."
"625","A deficiency in internal"
"626","control over financial"
"627","reporting exists when the"
"628","design or operation of a"
"629","control does not allow"
"630","management or employees,"
"631","in the normal course of"
"632","performing their assigned"
"633","functions, to prevent or"
"634","detect misstatements on a"
"635","timely basis.  A material"
"636","weakness is a deficiency, or"
"637","combination of deficiencies,"
"638","in internal control over"
"639","financial reporting, such that"
"640","there is a reasonable"
"641","possibility that a material"
"642","misstatement of the Fund's"
"643","annual or interim financial"
"644","statements will not be"
"645","prevented or detected on a"
"646","timely basis."
"647","Our consideration of the"
"648","Fund's internal control over"
"649","financial reporting was for"
"650","the limited purpose"
"651","described in the first"
"652","paragraph and would not"
"653","necessarily disclose all"
"654","deficiencies in internal"
"655","control over financial"
"656","reporting that might be"
"657","material weaknesses under"
"658","standards established by"
"659","the Public Company"
"660","Accounting Oversight Board"
"661","(United States).  However,"
"662","we noted no deficiencies in"
"663","the Fund's internal control"
"664","over financial reporting and"
"665","its operation, including"
"666","controls over safeguarding"
"667","securities that we consider"
"668","to be a material weakness"
"669","as defined above as of"
"670","September 30, 2016."
"671","This report is intended"
"672","solely for the information"
"673","and use of management"
"674","and the Board of Trustees"
"675","of Persimmon Long/Short"
"676","Fund (one of the series of"
"677","funds constituting the"
"678","Northern Lights Fund Trust"
"679","III) and the Securities and"
