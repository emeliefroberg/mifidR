"670","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"671","Accounting Firm"
"672","To the Board of Trustees of Vanguard New Jersey"
"673","Tax-Free Funds and the Shareholders of"
"674","Vanguard New Jersey Tax-Exempt Money Market"
"675","Fund and"
"676","Vanguard New Jersey Long-Term Tax-Exempt Fund"
"677","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"678","financial statements of Vanguard New Jersey Tax-"
"679","Exempt Money Market Fund and Vanguard New"
"680","Jersey Long-Term Tax-Exempt Fund (constituting"
"681","Vanguard New Jersey Tax-Free Funds, hereafter"
"682","referred to as the ?Trust?) as of and for the year"
"683","ended November 30, 2010, in accordance with the"
"684","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"685","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"686","Trust?s internal control over financial reporting,"
"687","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"688","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"689","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"690","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"691","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"692","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust?s"
"693","internal control over financial reporting."
"694","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"695","effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over"
"696","financial reporting."
"697","The management of the Trust is responsible for"
"698","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"699","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"700","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"701","management are required to assess the expected"
"702","benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"703","company?s internal control over financial reporting is"
"704","a process designed to provide reasonable"
"705","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"706","reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"707","for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"708","accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"709","internal control over financial reporting includes"
"710","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"711","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"712","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"713","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"714","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"715","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"716","financial statements in accordance with generally"
"717","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"718","and expenditures of the company are being made"
"719","only in accordance with authorizations of"
"720","management and trustees of the company; and (3)"
"721","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"722","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"723","or disposition of a company?s assets that could"
"724","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"725","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"726","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"727","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"728","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"729","risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"730","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"731","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"732","deteriorate."
"733","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"734","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"735","control does not allow management or employees,"
"736","in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"737","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"738","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"739","a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"740","over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"741","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"742","of the Trust's annual or interim financial statements"
"743","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"744","Our consideration of the Trust?s internal control over"
"745","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"746","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"747","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"748","control over financial reporting that might be material"
"749","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"750","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"751","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies"
"752","in the Trust?s internal control over financial reporting"
"753","and its operation, including controls over"
"754","safeguarding securities that we consider to be"
"755","material weaknesses as defined above as of"
"756","November 30, 2010."

"804","Important Changes to Each State?s Money Market Fund"
"805","On February 23, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted"
"806","amendments to Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which"
"807","governs all money market funds. The following changes to the Prospectus are"
"808","generally in response to such amendments."
"809","Prospectus Text Changes"
"810","Under the heading ?Primary Investment Policies? in the Fund Summary section,"
"811"," the following change is made. The following text replaces similar text:"
"812","The Fund invests in securities with effective maturities of 397 days or less,"
"813","maintains a dollar-weighted average maturity of 60 days or less, and"
"814","maintains a dollar-weighted average life of 120 days or less."
"815","Under the heading ?Market Exposure? in the More on the Funds section, the"
"816","following text is added immediately after ?Plain Talk About Bonds and"
"817","Interest Rates?:"
"818","Plain Talk About Weighted Average Life"
"819","A money market fund will maintain a dollar-weighted average maturity (WAM)"
"820","of 60 days or less and a dollar-weighted average life (WAL) of 120 days or"
"821","less. For purposes of calculating a fund?s WAM, the maturity of certain"
"822","longer-term adjustable rate securities held in the portfolio will"
"823","generally be the period"
"824","(over, please)"
"825","- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
"826","remaining until the next interest rate adjustment. When calculating its WAL,"
"827"," the maturity for these adjustable rate securities will generally be the"
"828"," final maturity date?the date on which principal is expected to be returned"
"829","in full. Maintaining a WAL of 120 days or less limits a fund?s ability to"
"830","invest in longer-term adjustable rate securities, which are generally more"
"831","sensitive to changes in interest rates, particularly in volatile markets."
"832","Under the heading ?Security Selection? in the More on the Funds section,"
"833","the following text replaces similar text under each state?s description"
"834","of its money market fund:"
"835","The Fund seeks to provide a stable net asset value of $1 per share by"
"836","investing in securities with effective maturities of 397 days or less,"
"837","by maintaining a dollar-weighted average maturity of 60 days or less"
"838","and by maintaining a dollar-weighted average life of 120 days or less."
"839","Under the heading ?Other Redemption Rules You Should Know? in the"
"840","Redeeming Shares section, the following change is made. The following"
"841"," text replaces similar text:"
"842","Potentially disruptive redemptions. Vanguard reserves the right to pay"
"843","all or part of a redemption in kind?that is, in the form of securities?"
"844","if we reasonably believe that a cash redemption would negatively affect"
"845"," the fund's operation or performance or that the shareholder may be"
"846","engaged in market-timing or frequent trading. Under these circumstances,"
"847"," Vanguard also reserves the right to delay payment of the redemption"
"848","proceeds for up to seven calendar days. By calling us before you attempt"
"849"," to redeem a large dollar amount, you may avoid in-kind or delayed"
"850","payment of your redemption. In connection with a determination by the"
"851","Board of Trustees under Rule 22e-3 under the 1940 Act, a money market"
"852","fund may suspend redemptions and postpone payment of redemption proceeds"
"853"," in order to facilitate an orderly liquidation of a fund. Please see"
"854","?Frequent-Trading Limits? for information about Vanguard?s policies to"

"864","Supplement to the Statement of Additional Information Dated March 29, 2010"
"865","On February 23, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted"
"866","amendments to Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which"
"867","governs all money market funds. The following changes to the Statement of"
"868"," Additional Information are generally in response to such amendments."
"869","Supplement of Additional Information Text Changes"
"870","In the Investment Strategies and Nonfundamental Policies section, the"
"871","following text changes are made. The following text replaces similar text:"
"872","Restricted and Illiquid Securities. Illiquid securities are securities that"
"873"," cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business within"
"874","seven business days at approximately the value at which they are being"
"875","carried on a fund?s books. The SEC generally limits aggregate holdings"
"876","of illiquid securities by a mutual fund to 15% of its net assets (5% for"
"877","money market funds). A fund may experience difficulty valuing and selling"
"878","illiquid securities and in some cases may be unable to value or sell"
"879","certain illiquid securities for an indefinite period of time. Illiquid"
"880","securities may include a wide variety of investments, such as:"
"881","(1) repurchase agreements maturing in more than seven days (unless the"
"882"," agreements have demand/redemption features); (2) OTC options contracts"
"883"," and certain other derivatives (including certain swap agreements);"
"884","(3) fixed time deposits that are not subject to prepayment or do not"
"885"," provide for withdrawal penalties upon prepayment (other than overnight"
"886","deposits); (4) loan interests and other direct debt instruments;"
"887","(5) municipal lease obligations; (6) commercial paper issued pursuant"
"888","to Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act; and (7) securities whose disposition"
"889","is restricted under the federal securities laws. Illiquid securities"
"890","include restricted, privately placed securities that, under the federal"
"891","securities laws, generally may be resold only to qualified institutional"
"892"," buyers. If a substantial market develops for a restricted security held"
"893","by a fund, it may be treated as a liquid security, in accordance with"
"894"," procedures and guidelines approved by the board of trustees. This"
"895","generally includes securities that are unregistered, that can be sold"
"896"," to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under"
"897"," the 1933 Act, or that are exempt from registration under the 1933 Act,"
"898","such as commercial paper. Although a fund?s advisor monitors the"
"899","liquidity of restricted securities on a daily basis, the board of"
"900","trustees oversees and retains ultimate responsibility for the advisor?s"
"901","liquidity determinations. Several factors that the trustees consider in"
"902","monitoring these decisions include the valuation of a security; the"
"903","availability of qualified institutional buyers, brokers, and dealers"
"904","that trade in the security; and the availability of information about"
"905","the security?s issuer."
"906","- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
"907","In the Purchase and Redemption of Shares section, the following text"
"908","changes are made. The following text replaces similar text:"
"909","Each Fund may suspend redemption privileges or postpone the date of"
"910","payment for redeemed shares: (1) during any period that the Exchange i"
"911","s closed or trading on the Exchange is restricted as determined by the"
"912","SEC; (2) during any period when an emergency exists, as defined by the"
"913"," SEC, as a result of which it is not reasonably practicable for the Fund"
"914","to dispose of securities it owns or to fairly determine the value of its"
"915"," assets; and (3) for such other periods as the SEC may permit, including"
"916","in connection with a determination by the board of a money market fund"
"917","under Rule 22e-3 under the 1940 Act to suspend redemptions and postpone"
"918"," payment of redemption proceeds in order to facilitate an orderly"
"919","liquidation of a fund."
