"517","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"518","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"519","GAMCO International Growth Fund, Inc."
"520","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"521","of GAMCO International Growth Fund, Inc. as of and for the year"
"522","ended December 31, 2009, in accordance with the standards of the"
"523","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"524","considered its internal control over financial reporting,"
"525","including control activities for safeguarding securities, as a"
"526","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"527","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"528","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"529","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of GAMCO"
"530","International Growth Fund, Inc.'s internal control over"
"531","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"532","The management of GAMCO International Growth Fund, Inc. is"
"533","responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"534","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"535","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"536","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"537","controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"538","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"539","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"540","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"541","generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal"
"542","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"543","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"544","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"545","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"546","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"547","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"548","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"549","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"550","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"551","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"552","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"553","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could"
"554","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"555","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"556","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"557","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"558","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"559","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"560","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"561","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"562","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"563","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"564","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"565","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"566","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"567","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"568","material misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"569","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"570","timely basis."
"571","Our consideration of GAMCO International Growth Fund, Inc.'s"
"572","internal control over financial reporting was for the limited"
"573","purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"574","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that"
"575","might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"576","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"577","However, we noted no deficiencies in GAMCO International Growth"
"578","Fund, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting and its"
"579","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, that"
"580","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"581","December 31, 2009."
"582","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"583","management and the Board of Directors of GAMCO International"
"584","Growth Fund, Inc. and the Securities and Exchange Commission and"
"585","is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"586","than these specified parties."

"613","By-Laws."
"614","            SECTION 2. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the"
"615","stockholders for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise"
"616","prescribed by statute or by the Corporation's Articles of"
"617","Incorporation, may be held at any place within the United"
"618","States, and may be called at any time by the Board of Directors"
"619","or by the President, and shall be called by the Secretary at the"
"620","request in writing of a majority of the Board of Directors or at"
"621","the request in writing of stockholders entitled to cast at least"
"622","10 (ten) percent of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting"
"623","upon payment by such stockholders to the Corporation of the"
"624","reasonably estimated cost of preparing and mailing a notice of"
"625","the meeting (which estimated cost shall be provided to such"
"626","stockholders by the Secretary of the Corporation)."
"627","Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless requested by stockholders"
"628","entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at"
"629","the meeting, a special meeting of the stockholders need not be"
"630","called at the request of stockholders to consider any matter"
"631","which is substantially the same as a matter voted on at any"
"632","special meeting of the stockholders held during the preceding 12"
"633","(twelve) months. A written request shall state the purpose or"
"634","purposes of the proposed meeting."
"635","            SECTION 3. Notice of Meetings. Written or printed"
"636","notice of the purpose or purposes and of the time and place of"
"637","every meeting of the stockholders shall be given by the"
"638","Secretary of the Corporation to each stockholder of record"
"639","entitled to vote at the meeting, by placing the notice in the"
"640","mail or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, electronic"
"641","mail or other form of legally permissible electronic"

"645","books of the Corporation or supplied by the stockholder to the"
"646","Corporation for the purpose of notice. The notice of any meeting"
"647","of stockholders may be accompanied by a form of proxy approved"
"648","by the Board of Directors in favor of the actions or persons as"
"649","the Board of Directors may select. Notice of any meeting of"
"650","stockholders shall be deemed waived by any stockholder who"
"651","attends the meeting in person or by proxy, or who before or"
"652","after the meeting submits a signed waiver of notice that is"
"653","filed with the records of the meeting. Notice directed to a"
"654","stockholder by electronic mail or other form of electronic"
"655","transmission may be transmitted to any address at which the"

"661","shall constitute a quorum at each meeting of the stockholders"
"662","and all questions shall be decided by a majority of the votes"
"663","cast at the meeting, except for the election of directors. A"
"664","plurality of all the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum"
"665","is present is sufficient to elect a director. In the absence of"
"666","a quorum, the stockholders present in person or by proxy, by"
"667","majority vote and without notice other than by announcement, may"
"668","adjourn the meeting from time to time as provided in section 5"
"669","of this Article I until a quorum shall attend. The stockholders"
"670","present at any duly organized meeting may continue to do"
"671","business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of"
"672","enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. The absence"
"673","from any meeting in person or by proxy of holders of the number"
"674","of shares of stock of the Corporation in excess of one-third"
"675","that may be required by the laws of the State of Maryland, the"
"676","Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or other applicable"
"677","statute, the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation or these"
"678","By-Laws, for action upon any given matter shall not prevent"
"679","action at the meeting on any other matter or matters that may"
"680","properly come before the meeting, so long as there are present,"
"681","in person or by proxy, holders of the number of shares of stock"

"683","matters."
"684","            SECTION 5. Adjournment. Any meeting of the"
"685","stockholders may be adjourned from time to time, without notice"
"686","other than by announcement at the meeting at which the"
"687","adjournment is taken. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum"
"688","shall be present any action may be taken that could have been"
"689","taken at the meeting originally called. A meeting of the"
"690","stockholders may not be adjourned to a date more than 120 (one"
"691","hundred twenty) days after the original record date."
"692","            SECTION 6. Organization. At every meeting of the"
"693","stockholders, the Chairman of the Board, or in his absence or"
"694","inability to act, the President, or in his absence or inability"

"696","Chairman of the meeting. The Secretary, or in his absence or"
"697","inability to act, a person appointed by the Chairman of the"

"699","minutes of the meeting."
"700","            SECTION 7. Order of Business. The order of business at"
"701","all meetings of the stockholders shall be as determined by the"
"702","chairman of the meeting."
"703","            SECTION 8. Voting. Except as otherwise provided by"
"704","holder of record of shares of stock of the Corporation having"
"705","voting power shall be entitled at each meeting of the"
"706","stockholders to one vote for every share of stock standing in"
"707","his name on the records of the Corporation as of the record date"
"708","determined pursuant to Section 9 of this Article I."
"709","            Each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of"
"710","stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for"
"711","him by (i) a proxy signed by the stockholder or his attorney-in-"
"712","fact or (ii) transmitting any authorization by telegram,"
"713","cablegram, datagram, electronic mail, or any other legally"
"714","permissible electronic or telephonic means in accordance with"
"715","the Corporation's procedures. No proxy shall be valid after the"
"716","expiration of eleven months from the date thereof, unless"
"717","otherwise provided in the proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable"
"718","at the pleasure of the stockholder executing it, except in those"
"719","cases in which the proxy states that it is irrevocable and in"
"720","which an irrevocable proxy is permitted by law."
"721","            If a vote shall be taken on any question then unless"
"722","required by statute or these By-Laws, or determined by the"
"723","Chairman of the meeting to be advisable, any such vote need not"
"724","be by ballot. On a vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed"
"725","by the stockholder voting, or by his proxy, and shall state the"
"726","number of shares voted."
"727","            SECTION 9. Fixing of Record Date. The Board of"
"728","Directors may set a record date for the purpose of determining"
"729","stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of the"
"730","stockholders. The record date for a particular meeting shall be"
"731","not more than 90 (ninety) nor fewer than 10 (ten) days before"
"732","the date of the meeting. All persons who were holders of record"
"733","of shares as of vote at such meeting and any adjournment thereof."
"734","            SECTION	 10. Inspectors. The Board of Directors may, in"
"735","advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more"
"736","inspectors to act at the meeting or at any adjournment of the"
"737","meeting. If the inspectors shall not be so appointed or if any"
"738","of them shall fail to appear or act, the chairman of the meeting"
"739","may appoint inspectors. Each inspector, before entering upon the"
"740","discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute"
"741","faithfully the duties of inspector at the meeting with strict"
"742","impartiality and according to the best of his ability. The"
"743","inspectors shall determine the number of shares outstanding and"
"744","the voting power of each share, the number of shares represented"
"745","at the meeting, the existence of a quorum and the validity and"
"746","effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents,"
"747","hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in"
"748","connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes,"
"749","ballots or consents, determine the result, and do those acts as"
"750","are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all"
