discharged or terminated orally, but only by an instrument in
writing signed by the party against which enforcement of the
change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought, and no
amendment of this Agreement shall be effective until

outstanding voting securities of the Series to which such
amendment relates and by the vote of a majority of the
directors who are not interested persons of the Manager,

of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, that:

       FIRST: On June 13, 2017, pursuant to the authority
granted to it in the Charter of the Corporation, resolutions were
unanimously approved by the Board of Directors, in accordance
with Section 2-105(c) of Maryland General Corporation Law,
authorizing an increase in the aggregate number of shares of the
Corporation. Article V of the Articles of Incorporation of this
Corporation is revised to: (i) authorize the addition of the Principal
LifeTime 2065 Fund series and authorize the issuance of the
following shares to the series: two hundred million (200,000,000)
shares of the Institutional Class, twenty-five million (25,000,000)
shares of Class R-1, twenty-five million (25,000,000) shares of
Class R-2, twenty-five million (25,000,000) shares of Class R-3,
twenty-five million (25,000,000) shares of Class R-4, and twenty-
five million (25,000,000) shares of Class R-5; (ii) authorize the
addition of the Principal LifeTime Hybrid 2065 Fund series and
authorize the issuance of the following shares to the series: two
hundred million (200,000,000) shares of the Institutional Class and
twenty-five million (25,000,000) shares of Class R-6; and (iii)
authorize the addition of one hundred million (100,000,000)
shares of Class J to the Blue Chip Fund.

       The total number of authorized shares of stock of the
Corporation will increase from eighty-two billion eighty million
(82,080,000,000) shares of stock to eighty-two billion seven
hundred thirty million (82,730,000,000) shares of stock. The
aggregate par value of all authorized shares will increase from
eight hundred twenty million eight hundred thousand dollars
($820,800,000) to eight hundred twenty-seven million three
hundred thousand dollars ($827,300,000). All authorized shares of
stock of the Corporation have a par value of one cent ($.01) per
share.

       As amended, Article V shall be and read in its entirety as
follows:

ARTICLE V
CAPITAL STOCK ALLOCATION

       Section 5.1. Authorized Shares: The total number of
shares of stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue
is eighty-two billion seven hundred thirty million (82,730,000,000)
shares of stock, with a par value of one cent ($0.01) per share.
The aggregate par value of all the authorized shares is eight
hundred twenty-seven million three hundred thousand dollars
($827,300,000). The shares may be issued by the Board of
Directors in such separate and distinct series and classes of
series as the Board of Directors shall from time to time create and
establish. The Board of Directors shall have full power and
authority, in its sole discretion, to establish and designate series
and classes of series, and to classify or reclassify any unissued
shares in separate series or classes having such preferences,
conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations
as to dividends, qualifications, and terms and conditions of
redemption as shall be fixed and determined from time to time by
the Board of Directors. Unless otherwise provided in these Articles
of Incorporation or by the Board of Directors when establishing a
class, each class of a series shall represent interests in the assets
belonging to that series and have identical voting, dividend,
liquidation and other rights and the same terms and conditions as
any other class of the series, except that expenses allocated to
the class of a series may be borne solely by such class as shall be
determined by the Board of Directors. Expenses related to the
distribution of, and other identified expenses that should properly
be allocated to, the shares of a particular series or class may be
charged to and borne solely by such series or class, and the
bearing of expenses solely by a series or class may be
appropriately reflected (in a manner determined by the Board of
Directors) and cause differences in the net asset value attributable
to, and the dividend, redemption and liquidation rights of, the
shares of each series or class. Subject to the authority of the
Board of Directors to increase and decrease the number of, and to
reclassify the shares of any series or class, there are hereby
established eighty-eight series of common stock, each comprising
the number of shares and having the share class designations
indicated:

       A total of one hundred seventy-five million (175,000,000)
shares remain authorized but un-classified shares.

	In addition, the Board of Directors is hereby expressly
granted authority to change the designation of any series or class,
to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series or
class, provided that the number of authorized shares of any series
or class shall not be decreased by the Board of Directors below
the number of shares thereof then outstanding, and to reclassify
any unissued shares into one or more series or classes that may
be established and designated from time to time.

(a)	The Corporation may issue shares of stock in
fractional denominations to the same extent as its
whole shares, and shares in fractional denominations
shall be shares of stock having proportionately, to the
respective fractions represented thereby, all the rights
of whole shares, including without limitation, the right
to vote, the right to receive dividends and distributions
and the right to participate upon liquidation of the
Corporation, but excluding the right to receive a stock
certificate representing fractional shares.

(b)	The holder of each share of stock of the Corporation
shall be entitled to one vote for each full share, and a
fractional vote for each fractional share, of stock,
irrespective of the series or class, then standing in the
holder's name on the books of the Corporation. On
any matter submitted to a vote of stockholders, all
shares of the Corporation then issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote shall be voted in the aggregate
and not by series or class except that (1) when
otherwise expressly required by the Maryland General
Corporation Law or the Investment Company Act of
1940, shares shall be voted by individual series or
class, and (2) if the Board of Directors, in its sole
discretion, determines that a matter (including an
amendment to these Articles of Incorporation) affects
the interests of only one or more particular series or
class or classes then only the holders of shares of
such affected series or class or classes shall be
entitled to vote thereon.

(c)	Unless otherwise provided in the resolution of the
Board of Directors providing for the establishment and
designation of any new series or class or classes,
each series and class of stock of the Corporation shall
have the following powers, preferences and rights,
and qualifications, restrictions, and limitations thereof:

(1)	Assets Belonging to a Series. All consideration
received by the Corporation for the issue or sale
of shares of a particular series, together with all
assets in which such consideration is invested or
reinvested, all income, earnings, profits and
proceeds thereof, including any proceeds
derived from the sale, exchange or liquidation of
such assets, and any funds or payments derived
from any reinvestment of such proceeds in
whatever form the same may be, shall
irrevocably belong to that series for all purposes,
subject only to the rights of creditors, and shall
be so recorded upon the books and accounts of
the Corporation. Such consideration, assets,
income, earnings, profits and proceeds thereof,
including any proceeds derived from the sale,
exchange or liquidation of such assets, and any
funds or payments derived from any
reinvestment of such proceeds, in whatever form
the same may be, together with any General
Items allocated to that series as provided in the
following sentence, are herein referred to as
assets belonging to that series. In the event
that there are any assets, income, earnings,
profits, proceeds thereof, funds or payments
which are not readily identifiable as belonging to
any particular series (collectively General"
"18814","Items), such General Items shall be allocated
by or under the supervision of the Board of
Directors to and among any one or more of the
series established and designated from time to
time in such manner and on such basis as the
Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, deems
fair and equitable, and any General Items so
allocated to a particular series shall belong to
that series. Each such allocation by the Board of
Directors shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes. The foregoing provisions of this
Section 5.1(c)(1) shall apply to each class to the
extent provided by the Board of Directors and
consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

(2)	Liabilities Belonging to a Series. The assets
belonging to each particular series shall be
charged with the liabilities of the Corporation in
respect of that series and all expenses, costs,
charges and reserves attributable to that series,
and any general liabilities, expenses, costs,
charges or reserves of the Corporation which are
not readily identifiable as belonging to any
particular series shall be allocated and charged
by or under the supervision of the Board of
Directors to and among any one or more of the
series established and designated from time to
time in such manner and on such basis as the
Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, deems
fair and equitable. The liabilities, expenses,
costs, charges and reserves allocated and so
charged to a series are herein referred to as
liabilities belonging to that series. Expenses
related to the shares of a series may be borne
solely by that series (as determined by the Board
of Directors). Each allocation of liabilities,
expenses, costs, charges and reserves by the
Board of Directors shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes. The foregoing
provisions of this Section 5.1(c)(2) shall apply to
each class to the extent provided by the Board of
Directors and consistent with applicable laws
and regulations.

(3)	Dividends and Distributions. The Board of
Directors may from time to time declare and pay
dividends or distributions, in stock, property or
cash, on any or all series of stock, the amount of
such dividends and property distributions and
the payment of them being wholly in the
discretion of the Board of Directors. Dividends
may be declared daily or otherwise pursuant to a
standing resolution or resolutions adopted only
once or with such frequency as the Board of
Directors may determine, after providing for
actual and accrued liabilities belonging to that
series. All dividends or distributions on shares of
a particular series shall be paid only out of
surplus or other lawfully available assets
determined by the Board of Directors as
belonging to such series. Dividends and
distributions may vary between the classes of a
series to reflect differing allocations of the
expense of each class of that series to such
extent and for such purposes as the Board of
Directors may deem appropriate. The Board of
Directors shall have the power, in its sole
discretion, to distribute in any fiscal year as
dividends, including dividends designated in
whole or in part as capital gains distributions,
amounts sufficient, in the opinion of the Board of
Directors, to enable the Corporation, or where
applicable each series of shares to qualify as a
regulated investment company under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
any successor or comparable statute thereto,
and regulations promulgated thereunder, and to
avoid liability for the Corporation, or each series
of shares, for Federal income and excise taxes
in respect of that or any other year.

(4)	Liquidation. In the event of the liquidation of the
Corporation or of the assets attributable to a
particular series or class, the stockholders of
each series or class that has been established
and designated and is being liquidated shall be
entitled to receive, as a series or class, when
and as declared by the Board of Directors, the
excess of the assets belonging to that series or
class over the liabilities belonging to that series
or class. The holders of shares of any series or
class shall not be entitled thereby to any
distribution upon liquidation of any other series
or class. The assets so distributable to the
stockholders of any particular series or class
shall be distributed among such stockholders
according to their respective rights taking into
account the proper allocation of expenses being
borne by that series or class. The liquidation of
assets attributable to any particular series or
class in which there are shares then outstanding
and the termination of the series or the class
may be authorized by vote of a majority of the
Board of Directors then in office, without action
or approval of the stockholders, to the extent
consistent with applicable laws and regulations.
In the event that there are any general assets
not belonging to any particular series or class of
stock and available for distribution, such
distribution shall be made to holders of stock of
various series or classes in such proportion as
the Board of Directors determines to be fair and
equitable, and such determination by the Board
of Directors shall be conclusive and binding for
all purposes.

(5)	Redemption. All shares of stock of the
Corporation shall be subject to the redemption,
repurchase and conversion provisions set forth
in Sections 5.6 through 5.11 of this Article V.

(d)	The Corporation's shares of stock are issued and
sold, and all persons who shall acquire stock of the
Corporation shall do so, subject to the condition and
understanding that the provisions of the Corporation's
Articles of Incorporation, as from time to time
amended, shall be binding upon them.

	Section 5.2. Quorum Requirements and Voting Rights:
Except as otherwise expressly provided by the Maryland General
Corporation Law, the presence in person or by proxy of the
holders of one-third of the shares of capital stock of the
Corporation outstanding and entitled to vote thereat shall
constitute a quorum at any meeting of the stockholders, except
that where the holders of any series or class are required or
permitted to vote as a series or class, one-third of the aggregate
number of shares of that series or class outstanding and entitled
to vote shall constitute a quorum.

	Notwithstanding any provision of Maryland General
Corporation Law requiring a greater proportion than a majority of
the votes of all series or classes or of any series or class of the
Corporation's stock entitled to be cast in order to take or authorize
any action, any such action may be taken or authorized upon the
concurrence of a majority of the aggregate number of votes
entitled to be cast thereon subject to applicable laws and
regulations. All shares of stock of this Corporation shall have the
voting rights provided for in Section 5.1(b) of this Article V.

	The Board of Directors from time to time, subject to such
procedures as may be adopted by the Board of Directors, and
consistent with applicable laws and regulations, may authorize the
holders of shares of any series or class to take action or consent
to any action by delivering a consent, in writing or by electronic
transmission, of the holders entitled to cast not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or
take the action at a meeting of the holders of shares of such
series or class.

	Section 5.3. No Preemptive or Appraisal Rights: No
holder of shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall, as such
holder, have any right to purchase or subscribe for any shares of
the capital stock of the Corporation which the Corporation may
issue or sell (whether consisting of shares of capital stock
authorized by these Articles of Incorporation, or shares of capital
stock of the Corporation acquired by it after the issue thereof, or
other shares) other than any right which the Board of Directors of
the Corporation, in its discretion, may determine.

	No holder of shares of capital stock of the Corporation
shall be entitled to exercise the rights of an objecting stockholder
under Subtitle 2 of Title 3 of the Maryland General Corporation
Law or any successor provision.

	Section 5.4. Determination of Net Asset Value: The net
asset value of each share of each series or class of each series of
the Corporation shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the
value of the net assets of the Corporation, or if applicable of the
series or class (being the value of the assets of the Corporation or
of the particular series or class or attributable to the particular
series or class less its actual and accrued liabilities exclusive of
capital stock and surplus), by the total number of outstanding
shares of the Corporation or the series or class, as applicable.
Such determination may be made on a series-by-series basis or
made or adjusted on a class-by-class basis, as appropriate, and
shall include any expenses allocated to a specific series or class
thereof. The Board of Directors may adopt procedures for
determination of net asset value consistent with the requirements
of applicable laws and regulations and, so far as accounting
matters are concerned, with generally accepted accounting
principles. The procedures may include, without limitation,
procedures for valuation of the Corporation's portfolio securities
and other assets, for accrual of expenses or creation of reserves
and for the determination of the number of shares issued and
outstanding at any given time.

	Section 5.5. Stable Net Asset Value: With respect to any
money market, stable value or other series or class that seeks to
maintain a stable net asset value per share, and pursuant to
procedures established by the Board of Directors, the Corporation
shall be entitled, without the payment of monetary compensation
but in consideration of the interest of the Corporation and its
stockholders in maintaining a stable net asset value per share of
such series or class, to redeem pro rata from all holders of record
of such series or class at the time of such redemption (in
proportion to their respective holdings of such shares) sufficient
outstanding shares (or fractional shares) of such series or class,
or to take such other measures as are not prohibited by the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as shall maintain for such
series or class a stable net asset value.

	Section 5.6. Redemption by Stockholders: Any
stockholder may redeem shares of the Corporation for the net
asset value of each series or class thereof, less such fees and
charges, if any, as may be established by the Board of Directors
from time to time, by presentation of an appropriate request,
together with the certificates, if any, for such shares, duly
endorsed, at the office or agency designated by the Corporation.
Redemptions as aforesaid, shall be made in the manner and
subject to the conditions contained in the bylaws or approved by
the Board of Directors.

	Section 5.7. Redemption at the Option of the
Corporation: Subject to the provisions of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, each share of the Corporation and each
share of each series and class shall be redeemable from any
stockholder at the option of the Corporation. In that regard, the
Board of Directors may from time to time authorize the
Corporation to redeem all or any part of the shares of the
Corporation or of any series or class upon such terms and
conditions as the Board of Directors may determine in its sole
discretion. The Corporation's right to redeem shares includes,
without limitation, the right to redeem shares when required for the
payment of account fees or other fees, charges and expenses as
set by the Board of Directors, including without limitation any small
account fees permitted by Section 5.9 of this Article V.

	Section 5.8. Purchase of Shares: The Corporation shall
be entitled to purchase all or any part of the shares of the
Corporation or of any series or class of its capital stock, to the
extent that the Corporation may lawfully effect such purchase
under Maryland General Corporation Law, upon such terms and
conditions and for such consideration as the Board of Directors
shall deem advisable.

	Section 5.9. Redemption of Minimum Amounts: The
Board of Directors may establish, from time to time, one or more
minimum investment amounts for stockholder accounts, which
may be different for each series or class and within each series or
class, and may impose account fees on, and/or require the
involuntary redemption of, those accounts the net asset value of
which for any reason falls below such established minimum
amounts, or may take any other action with respect to minimum
investment amounts as may be deemed appropriate by the Board
of Directors, in each case upon such terms as shall be established
by the Board of Directors. Any such account fee may be satisfied
by the Corporation by redeeming the requisite number of shares in
any such account in the amount of such fee.

	Section 5.10. Conversion of Shares by Stockholders
and by the Corporation: Subject to compliance with the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and applicable laws and
regulations, the Board of Directors shall have authority, without
stockholder approval, to provide that:

(a)	the holders of any series or class of shares shall have
the right to convert or exchange such shares into
shares of one or more other series or classes in
accordance with such terms and conditions as may be
established by the Board of Directors; and

(b)	the Corporation may automatically convert some or all
of the shares of a particular series or class into shares
of another series or class, at such times as may be
determined by the Board of Directors, based on the
relative net asset values of such series or class at time
of conversion and otherwise in accordance with such
terms and conditions as may be established by the
Board of Directors and which may vary within and
among the series and classes and within and among
the holders of the series or classes to the extent
determined by the Board of Directors.

	Section 5.11. Mode of Payment: Payment by the
Corporation for shares of any series or class of the capital stock of
the Corporation surrendered to it for redemption shall be made by
the Corporation within seven days of such surrender out of the
funds legally available therefor, provided that the Corporation may
suspend the right of the holders of capital stock of the Corporation
to redeem shares of capital stock and may postpone the right of
such holders to receive payment for any shares when permitted or
required to do so by law. Payment of the redemption or purchase
price may be made in cash or, at the option of the Corporation,
wholly or partly in such portfolio securities or other assets of the
Corporation as the Corporation may select in its sole discretion.
The composition of any such payments may be different among
stockholders, including those of the same series or class, as the
Corporation may determine in its sole discretion.

	Section 5.12. Rights of Holders of Shares Purchased
or Redeemed: The right of any holder of any series or class of
capital stock of the Corporation purchased or redeemed by the
Corporation as provided in this Article V to receive dividends
thereon and all other rights of such holder with respect to such
shares shall terminate at the time as of which the purchase or
redemption price of such shares is determined, except the right of
such holder to receive (i) the purchase or redemption price of such
shares from the Corporation or its designated agent and (ii) any
dividend or distribution or voting rights to which such holder has
previously become entitled as the record holder of such shares on
the record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled
to receive such dividend or distribution or to vote at the meeting of
stockholders.

	Section 5.13. Status of Shares Purchased or
Redeemed: In the absence of any specification as to the purpose
for which such shares of any series or class of capital stock of the
Corporation are redeemed or purchased by it, all shares so
redeemed or purchased shall be deemed to be retired in the
sense contemplated by the laws of the State of Maryland and may
be reissued. The number of authorized shares of capital stock of
the Corporation shall not be reduced by the number of any shares
redeemed or purchased by it.

	Section 5.14. Additional Limitations and Powers: The
following provisions are inserted for the purpose of defining,
limiting and regulating the powers of the Corporation and of the
Board of Directors and stockholders:

(a)	Any determination made in good faith and, so far as
accounting matters are involved, in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles by or
pursuant to the direction of the Board of Directors, as
to the amount of the assets, debts, obligations or
liabilities of the Corporation, as to the amount of any
reserves or charges set up and the propriety thereof,
as to the time of or purpose for creating such reserves
or charges, as to the use, alteration or cancellation of
any reserves or charges (whether or not any debt,
obligation or liability for which such reserves or
charges shall have been created shall have been paid
or discharged or shall be then or thereafter required to
be paid or discharged), as to the establishment or
designation of procedures or methods to be employed
for valuing any investment or other assets of the
Corporation and as to the value of any investment or
other asset, as to the allocation of any asset of the
Corporation to a particular series or class or classes of
the Corporation's stock, as to the funds available for
the declaration of dividends and as to the declaration
of dividends, as to the charging of any liability of the
Corporation to a particular series or class or classes of
the Corporation's stock, as to the number of shares of
any series or class or classes of the Corporation's
outstanding stock, as to the estimated expense to the
Corporation in connection with purchases or
redemptions of its shares, as to the ability to liquidate
investments in orderly fashion, or as to any other
matters relating to the issue, sale, purchase or
redemption or other acquisition or disposition of
investments or shares of the Corporation, or in the
determination of the net asset value per share of
shares of any series or class of the Corporation's
stock shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes.

(b)	Except to the extent prohibited by the Investment
Company Act of 1940, or rules, regulations or orders
thereunder promulgated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any successor thereto or by
the bylaws of the Corporation, a director, officer or
employee of the Corporation shall not be disqualified
by his position from dealing or contracting with the
Corporation, nor shall any transaction or contract of
the Corporation be void or voidable by reason of the
fact that any director, officer or employee or any firm
of which any director, officer or employee is a
member, or any corporation of which any director,
officer or employee is a stockholder, officer or director,
is in any way interested in such transaction or
contract; provided that in case a director, or a firm or
corporation of which a director is a member,
stockholder, officer or director is so interested, such
fact shall be disclosed to or shall have been known by
the Board of Directors or a majority thereof. Nor shall
any director or officer of the Corporation be liable to
the Corporation or to any stockholder or creditor
thereof or to any person for any loss incurred by it or
him or for any profit realized by such director or officer
under or by reason of such contract or transaction;
provided that nothing herein shall protect any director
or officer of the Corporation against any liability to the
Corporation or to its security holders to which he
would otherwise be subject by reason of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless
disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his
office; and provided always that such contract or
transaction shall have been on terms that were unfair
to the Corporation at the time at which it was entered
into. Any director of the Corporation who is so
interested, or who is a member, stockholder, officer or
director of such firm or corporation, may be counted in
determining the existence of a quorum at any meeting
of the Board of Directors of the Corporation which
shall authorize any such transaction or contract, with
like force and effect as if he were not such director, or
member, stockholder, officer or director of such firm or
corporation.

(c)	Specifically and without limitation of the foregoing
paragraph (b) but subject to the exception therein
prescribed, the Corporation may enter into
management or advisory, underwriting, distribution
and administration contracts, custodian contracts and
such other contracts as may be appropriate.

	Section 5.15. Reorganization: The Board of Directors
may merge or consolidate one of more series of shares with, and
may sell, convey and transfer the assets belonging to any one or
more series of shares to, another corporation, trust, partnership,
association or other organization, or to the Corporation to be held
as assets belonging to another series of shares, in exchange for
cash, securities or other consideration (including, in the case of a
transfer to another series of shares of the Corporation, shares of
such other series of shares) with such transfer being made subject
to, or with the assumption by the transferee of, the liabilities
belonging to each transferor series of shares if deemed
appropriate by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall
have the authority to effect any such merger, consolidation or
transfer of assets, without action or approval of the stockholders,
to the extent consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

	Section 5.16. Classes of Shares: The Board of Directors
shall also have the authority, subject to applicable laws and
regulations and without action or approval of the stockholders,
from time to time to designate any class of shares of a series of
shares as a separate series of shares as it deems necessary or
desirable. The designation of any class of shares of a series of
shares as a separate series of shares shall be effective at the time
specified by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall
allocate the assets, liabilities and expenses attributable to any
class of shares designated as a separate series of shares to such
separate series of shares and shall designate the relative rights
and preferences of such series of shares, provided that such
relative rights and preferences may not be materially adversely
different from the relative rights and preferences of the class of
shares designated as a separate series of shares.

	Section 5.17. Fees and Expenses. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in these Articles of
Incorporation, each share of any series or class of a series may
be subject to such sales loads or charges, whether initial, deferred
or contingent, or any combination thereof, or any other type of
sales load or charge; to such expenses and fees (including,
without limitation, distribution expenses, administrative expenses
under an administrative or service agreement, plan or other
arrangement, however designated, and other administrative,
recordkeeping, redemption, service and other fees, however
designated); to such account size requirements; and to such other
rights and provisions; which may be the same or different from
any other share of any series or class, including any other share
of the same series or class, all as the Board of Directors may from
time to time establish and/or change in accordance with applicable
laws and regulations.

SECOND: The Corporation is registered as an open-end company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

THIRD: The Articles Supplementary shall become effective
immediately upon filing.

OF
PRINCIPAL FUNDS, INC.


       Principal Funds, Inc., a Maryland Corporation having its
principal office in this state in Baltimore, Maryland (hereinafter
called the Corporation), hereby certifies to the State Department
of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, that:

	FIRST:  On March 14, 2017, the Board of Directors, acting
in accordance with Section 2-602 of Maryland General
Corporation Law, approved amendments to the Corporation's
Charter for the purpose of changing the names of the following
Series of the Corporation as follows:

Dynamic Floating Rate High
I
n
c
o
m
e

u
n
d

	SECOND:  The Charter Amendment was approved by a
majority of the entire Board of Directors and is limited to changes
expressly authorized by Section 2-605 of Maryland General
Corporation Law.

	THIRD:  The Charter Amendment shall be effective on
June 6, 2017.

	FOURTH: The Charter Amendment is as follows:

	(1) Article V shall be stricken in its entirety and replaced by
the following:

ARTICLE V
CAPITAL STOCK ALLOCATION

       Section 5.1. Authorized Shares: The total number of shares
of stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is eighty-
two billion eighty million (82,080,000,000) shares of stock, with a par
value of one cent ($0.01) per share. The aggregate par value of all
the authorized shares is eight hundred twenty million eight hundred
thousand dollars ($820,800,000). The shares may be issued by the
Board of Directors in such separate and distinct series and classes of
series as the Board of Directors shall from time to time create and
establish. The Board of Directors shall have full power and authority,
in its sole discretion, to establish and designate series and classes of
series, and to classify or reclassify any unissued shares in separate
series or classes having such preferences, conversion or other rights,
voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications,
and terms and conditions of redemption as shall be fixed and
determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. Unless
otherwise provided in these Articles of Incorporation or by the Board
of Directors when establishing a class, each class of a series shall
represent interests in the assets belonging to that series and have
identical voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights and the same
terms and conditions as any other class of the series, except that
expenses allocated to the class of a series may be borne solely by
such class as shall be determined by the Board of Directors.
Expenses related to the distribution of, and other identified expenses
that should properly be allocated to, the shares of a particular series
or class may be charged to and borne solely by such series or class,
and the bearing of expenses solely by a series or class may be
appropriately reflected (in a manner determined by the Board of
Directors) and cause differences in the net asset value attributable to,
and the dividend, redemption and liquidation rights of, the shares of
each series or class. Subject to the authority of the Board of Directors
to increase and decrease the number of, and to reclassify the shares
of any series or class, there are hereby established eighty-eight
series of common stock, each comprising the number of shares and
having the share class designations indicated:

       A total of one hundred seventy-five million (175,000,000)
shares remain authorized but un-classified shares.

	In addition, the Board of Directors is hereby expressly
granted authority to change the designation of any series or class,
to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series or
class, provided that the number of authorized shares of any series
or class shall not be decreased by the Board of Directors below
the number of shares thereof then outstanding, and to reclassify
any unissued shares into one or more series or classes that may
be established and designated from time to time.

(a)	The Corporation may issue shares of stock in
fractional denominations to the same extent as its
whole shares, and shares in fractional denominations
shall be shares of stock having proportionately, to the
respective fractions represented thereby, all the rights
of whole shares, including without limitation, the right
to vote, the right to receive dividends and distributions
and the right to participate upon liquidation of the
Corporation, but excluding the right to receive a stock
certificate representing fractional shares.

(b)	The holder of each share of stock of the Corporation
shall be entitled to one vote for each full share, and a
fractional vote for each fractional share, of stock,
irrespective of the series or class, then standing in the
holder's name on the books of the Corporation. On
any matter submitted to a vote of stockholders, all
shares of the Corporation then issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote shall be voted in the aggregate
and not by series or class except that (1) when
otherwise expressly required by the Maryland General
Corporation Law or the Investment Company Act of
1940, shares shall be voted by individual series or
class, and (2) if the Board of Directors, in its sole
discretion, determines that a matter (including an
amendment to these Articles of Incorporation) affects
the interests of only one or more particular series or
class or classes then only the holders of shares of
such affected series or class or classes shall be
entitled to vote thereon.

(c)	Unless otherwise provided in the resolution of the
Board of Directors providing for the establishment and
designation of any new series or class or classes,
each series and class of stock of the Corporation shall
have the following powers, preferences and rights,
and qualifications, restrictions, and limitations thereof:

(1)	Assets Belonging to a Series. All consideration
received by the Corporation for the issue or sale
of shares of a particular series, together with all
assets in which such consideration is invested or
reinvested, all income, earnings, profits and
proceeds thereof, including any proceeds
derived from the sale, exchange or liquidation of
such assets, and any funds or payments derived
from any reinvestment of such proceeds in
whatever form the same may be, shall
irrevocably belong to that series for all purposes,
subject only to the rights of creditors, and shall
be so recorded upon the books and accounts of
the Corporation. Such consideration, assets,
income, earnings, profits and proceeds thereof,
including any proceeds derived from the sale,
exchange or liquidation of such assets, and any
funds or payments derived from any
reinvestment of such proceeds, in whatever form
the same may be, together with any General
Items allocated to that series as provided in the
following sentence, are herein referred to as
assets belonging to that series. In the event
that there are any assets, income, earnings,
profits, proceeds thereof, funds or payments
which are not readily identifiable as belonging to
any particular series (collectively General"
"18815","Items), such General Items shall be allocated
by or under the supervision of the Board of
Directors to and among any one or more of the
series established and designated from time to
time in such manner and on such basis as the
Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, deems
fair and equitable, and any General Items so
allocated to a particular series shall belong to
that series. Each such allocation by the Board of
Directors shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes. The foregoing provisions of this
Section 5.1(c)(1) shall apply to each class to the
extent provided by the Board of Directors and
consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

(2)	Liabilities Belonging to a Series. The assets
belonging to each particular series shall be
charged with the liabilities of the Corporation in
respect of that series and all expenses, costs,
charges and reserves attributable to that series,
and any general liabilities, expenses, costs,
charges or reserves of the Corporation which are
not readily identifiable as belonging to any
particular series shall be allocated and charged
by or under the supervision of the Board of
Directors to and among any one or more of the
series established and designated from time to
time in such manner and on such basis as the
Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, deems
fair and equitable. The liabilities, expenses,
costs, charges and reserves allocated and so
charged to a series are herein referred to as
liabilities belonging to that series. Expenses
related to the shares of a series may be borne
solely by that series (as determined by the Board
of Directors). Each allocation of liabilities,
expenses, costs, charges and reserves by the
Board of Directors shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes. The foregoing
provisions of this Section 5.1(c)(2) shall apply to
each class to the extent provided by the Board of
Directors and consistent with applicable laws
and regulations.

(3)	Dividends and Distributions. The Board of
Directors may from time to time declare and pay
dividends or distributions, in stock, property or
cash, on any or all series of stock, the amount of
such dividends and property distributions and
the payment of them being wholly in the
discretion of the Board of Directors. Dividends
may be declared daily or otherwise pursuant to a
standing resolution or resolutions adopted only
once or with such frequency as the Board of
Directors may determine, after providing for
actual and accrued liabilities belonging to that
series. All dividends or distributions on shares of
a particular series shall be paid only out of
surplus or other lawfully available assets
determined by the Board of Directors as
belonging to such series. Dividends and
distributions may vary between the classes of a
series to reflect differing allocations of the
expense of each class of that series to such
extent and for such purposes as the Board of
Directors may deem appropriate. The Board of
Directors shall have the power, in its sole
discretion, to distribute in any fiscal year as
dividends, including dividends designated in
whole or in part as capital gains distributions,
amounts sufficient, in the opinion of the Board of
Directors, to enable the Corporation, or where
applicable each series of shares to qualify as a
regulated investment company under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
any successor or comparable statute thereto,
and regulations promulgated thereunder, and to
avoid liability for the Corporation, or each series
of shares, for Federal income and excise taxes
in respect of that or any other year.

(4)	Liquidation. In the event of the liquidation of the
Corporation or of the assets attributable to a
particular series or class, the stockholders of
each series or class that has been established
and designated and is being liquidated shall be
entitled to receive, as a series or class, when
and as declared by the Board of Directors, the
excess of the assets belonging to that series or
class over the liabilities belonging to that series
or class. The holders of shares of any series or
class shall not be entitled thereby to any
distribution upon liquidation of any other series
or class. The assets so distributable to the
stockholders of any particular series or class
shall be distributed among such stockholders
according to their respective rights taking into
account the proper allocation of expenses being
borne by that series or class. The liquidation of
assets attributable to any particular series or
class in which there are shares then outstanding
and the termination of the series or the class
may be authorized by vote of a majority of the
Board of Directors then in office, without action
or approval of the stockholders, to the extent
consistent with applicable laws and regulations.
In the event that there are any general assets
not belonging to any particular series or class of
stock and available for distribution, such
distribution shall be made to holders of stock of
various series or classes in such proportion as
the Board of Directors determines to be fair and
equitable, and such determination by the Board
of Directors shall be conclusive and binding for
all purposes.

(5)	Redemption. All shares of stock of the
Corporation shall be subject to the redemption,
repurchase and conversion provisions set forth
in Sections 5.6 through 5.11 of this Article V.

(d)	The Corporation's shares of stock are issued and
sold, and all persons who shall acquire stock of the
Corporation shall do so, subject to the condition and
understanding that the provisions of the Corporation's
Articles of Incorporation, as from time to time
amended, shall be binding upon them.

	Section 5.2. Quorum Requirements and Voting Rights:
Except as otherwise expressly provided by the Maryland General
Corporation Law, the presence in person or by proxy of the
holders of one-third of the shares of capital stock of the
Corporation outstanding and entitled to vote thereat shall
constitute a quorum at any meeting of the stockholders, except
that where the holders of any series or class are required or
permitted to vote as a series or class, one-third of the aggregate
number of shares of that series or class outstanding and entitled
to vote shall constitute a quorum.

	Notwithstanding any provision of Maryland General
Corporation Law requiring a greater proportion than a majority of
the votes of all series or classes or of any series or class of the
Corporation's stock entitled to be cast in order to take or authorize
any action, any such action may be taken or authorized upon the
concurrence of a majority of the aggregate number of votes
entitled to be cast thereon subject to applicable laws and
regulations. All shares of stock of this Corporation shall have the
voting rights provided for in Section 5.1(b) of this Article V.

	The Board of Directors from time to time, subject to such
procedures as may be adopted by the Board of Directors, and
consistent with applicable laws and regulations, may authorize the
holders of shares of any series or class to take action or consent
to any action by delivering a consent, in writing or by electronic
transmission, of the holders entitled to cast not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or
take the action at a meeting of the holders of shares of such
series or class.

	Section 5.3. No Preemptive or Appraisal Rights: No
holder of shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall, as such
holder, have any right to purchase or subscribe for any shares of
the capital stock of the Corporation which the Corporation may
issue or sell (whether consisting of shares of capital stock
authorized by these Articles of Incorporation, or shares of capital
stock of the Corporation acquired by it after the issue thereof, or
other shares) other than any right which the Board of Directors of
the Corporation, in its discretion, may determine.

	No holder of shares of capital stock of the Corporation
shall be entitled to exercise the rights of an objecting stockholder
under Subtitle 2 of Title 3 of the Maryland General Corporation
Law or any successor provision.

	Section 5.4. Determination of Net Asset Value: The net
asset value of each share of each series or class of each series of
the Corporation shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the
value of the net assets of the Corporation, or if applicable of the
series or class (being the value of the assets of the Corporation or
of the particular series or class or attributable to the particular
series or class less its actual and accrued liabilities exclusive of
capital stock and surplus), by the total number of outstanding
shares of the Corporation or the series or class, as applicable.
Such determination may be made on a series-by-series basis or
made or adjusted on a class-by-class basis, as appropriate, and
shall include any expenses allocated to a specific series or class
thereof. The Board of Directors may adopt procedures for
determination of net asset value consistent with the requirements
of applicable laws and regulations and, so far as accounting
matters are concerned, with generally accepted accounting
principles. The procedures may include, without limitation,
procedures for valuation of the Corporation's portfolio securities
and other assets, for accrual of expenses or creation of reserves
and for the determination of the number of shares issued and
outstanding at any given time.

	Section 5.5. Stable Net Asset Value: With respect to any
money market, stable value or other series or class that seeks to
maintain a stable net asset value per share, and pursuant to
procedures established by the Board of Directors, the Corporation
shall be entitled, without the payment of monetary compensation
but in consideration of the interest of the Corporation and its
stockholders in maintaining a stable net asset value per share of
such series or class, to redeem pro rata from all holders of record
of such series or class at the time of such redemption (in
proportion to their respective holdings of such shares) sufficient
outstanding shares (or fractional shares) of such series or class,
or to take such other measures as are not prohibited by the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as shall maintain for such
series or class a stable net asset value.

	Section 5.6. Redemption by Stockholders: Any
stockholder may redeem shares of the Corporation for the net
asset value of each series or class thereof, less such fees and
charges, if any, as may be established by the Board of Directors
from time to time, by presentation of an appropriate request,
together with the certificates, if any, for such shares, duly
endorsed, at the office or agency designated by the Corporation.
Redemptions as aforesaid, shall be made in the manner and
subject to the conditions contained in the bylaws or approved by
the Board of Directors.

	Section 5.7. Redemption at the Option of the
Corporation: Subject to the provisions of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, each share of the Corporation and each
share of each series and class shall be redeemable from any
stockholder at the option of the Corporation. In that regard, the
Board of Directors may from time to time authorize the
Corporation to redeem all or any part of the shares of the
Corporation or of any series or class upon such terms and
conditions as the Board of Directors may determine in its sole
discretion. The Corporation's right to redeem shares includes,
without limitation, the right to redeem shares when required for the
payment of account fees or other fees, charges and expenses as
set by the Board of Directors, including without limitation any small
account fees permitted by Section 5.9 of this Article V.

	Section 5.8. Purchase of Shares: The Corporation shall
be entitled to purchase all or any part of the shares of the
Corporation or of any series or class of its capital stock, to the
extent that the Corporation may lawfully effect such purchase
under Maryland General Corporation Law, upon such terms and
conditions and for such consideration as the Board of Directors
shall deem advisable.

	Section 5.9. Redemption of Minimum Amounts: The
Board of Directors may establish, from time to time, one or more
minimum investment amounts for stockholder accounts, which
may be different for each series or class and within each series or
class, and may impose account fees on, and/or require the
involuntary redemption of, those accounts the net asset value of
which for any reason falls below such established minimum
amounts, or may take any other action with respect to minimum
investment amounts as may be deemed appropriate by the Board
of Directors, in each case upon such terms as shall be established
by the Board of Directors. Any such account fee may be satisfied
by the Corporation by redeeming the requisite number of shares in
any such account in the amount of such fee.

	Section 5.10. Conversion of Shares by Stockholders
and by the Corporation: Subject to compliance with the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and applicable laws and
regulations, the Board of Directors shall have authority, without
stockholder approval, to provide that:

(a)	the holders of any series or class of shares shall have
the right to convert or exchange such shares into
shares of one or more other series or classes in
accordance with such terms and conditions as may be
established by the Board of Directors; and

(b)	the Corporation may automatically convert some or all
of the shares of a particular series or class into shares
of another series or class, at such times as may be
determined by the Board of Directors, based on the
relative net asset values of such series or class at time
of conversion and otherwise in accordance with such
terms and conditions as may be established by the
Board of Directors and which may vary within and
among the series and classes and within and among
the holders of the series or classes to the extent
determined by the Board of Directors.

	Section 5.11. Mode of Payment: Payment by the
Corporation for shares of any series or class of the capital stock of
the Corporation surrendered to it for redemption shall be made by
the Corporation within seven days of such surrender out of the
funds legally available therefor, provided that the Corporation may
suspend the right of the holders of capital stock of the Corporation
to redeem shares of capital stock and may postpone the right of
such holders to receive payment for any shares when permitted or
required to do so by law. Payment of the redemption or purchase
price may be made in cash or, at the option of the Corporation,
wholly or partly in such portfolio securities or other assets of the
Corporation as the Corporation may select in its sole discretion.
The composition of any such payments may be different among
stockholders, including those of the same series or class, as the
Corporation may determine in its sole discretion.

	Section 5.12. Rights of Holders of Shares Purchased
or Redeemed: The right of any holder of any series or class of
capital stock of the Corporation purchased or redeemed by the
Corporation as provided in this Article V to receive dividends
thereon and all other rights of such holder with respect to such
shares shall terminate at the time as of which the purchase or
redemption price of such shares is determined, except the right of
such holder to receive (i) the purchase or redemption price of such
shares from the Corporation or its designated agent and (ii) any
dividend or distribution or voting rights to which such holder has
previously become entitled as the record holder of such shares on
the record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled
to receive such dividend or distribution or to vote at the meeting of
stockholders.

	Section 5.13. Status of Shares Purchased or
Redeemed: In the absence of any specification as to the purpose
for which such shares of any series or class of capital stock of the
Corporation are redeemed or purchased by it, all shares so
redeemed or purchased shall be deemed to be retired in the
sense contemplated by the laws of the State of Maryland and may
be reissued. The number of authorized shares of capital stock of
the Corporation shall not be reduced by the number of any shares
redeemed or purchased by it.

	Section 5.14. Additional Limitations and Powers: The
following provisions are inserted for the purpose of defining,
limiting and regulating the powers of the Corporation and of the
Board of Directors and stockholders:

(a)	Any determination made in good faith and, so far as
accounting matters are involved, in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles by or
pursuant to the direction of the Board of Directors, as
to the amount of the assets, debts, obligations or
liabilities of the Corporation, as to the amount of any
reserves or charges set up and the propriety thereof,
as to the time of or purpose for creating such reserves
or charges, as to the use, alteration or cancellation of
any reserves or charges (whether or not any debt,
obligation or liability for which such reserves or
charges shall have been created shall have been paid
or discharged or shall be then or thereafter required to
be paid or discharged), as to the establishment or
designation of procedures or methods to be employed
for valuing any investment or other assets of the
Corporation and as to the value of any investment or
other asset, as to the allocation of any asset of the
Corporation to a particular series or class or classes of
the Corporation's stock, as to the funds available for
the declaration of dividends and as to the declaration
of dividends, as to the charging of any liability of the
Corporation to a particular series or class or classes of
the Corporation's stock, as to the number of shares of
any series or class or classes of the Corporation's
outstanding stock, as to the estimated expense to the
Corporation in connection with purchases or
redemptions of its shares, as to the ability to liquidate
investments in orderly fashion, or as to any other
matters relating to the issue, sale, purchase or
redemption or other acquisition or disposition of
investments or shares of the Corporation, or in the
determination of the net asset value per share of
shares of any series or class of the Corporation's
stock shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes.

(b)	Except to the extent prohibited by the Investment
Company Act of 1940, or rules, regulations or orders
thereunder promulgated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any successor thereto or by
the bylaws of the Corporation, a director, officer or
employee of the Corporation shall not be disqualified
by his position from dealing or contracting with the
Corporation, nor shall any transaction or contract of
the Corporation be void or voidable by reason of the
fact that any director, officer or employee or any firm
of which any director, officer or employee is a
member, or any corporation of which any director,
officer or employee is a stockholder, officer or director,
is in any way interested in such transaction or
contract; provided that in case a director, or a firm or
corporation of which a director is a member,
stockholder, officer or director is so interested, such
fact shall be disclosed to or shall have been known by
the Board of Directors or a majority thereof. Nor shall
any director or officer of the Corporation be liable to
the Corporation or to any stockholder or creditor
thereof or to any person for any loss incurred by it or
him or for any profit realized by such director or officer
under or by reason of such contract or transaction;
provided that nothing herein shall protect any director
or officer of the Corporation against any liability to the
Corporation or to its security holders to which he
would otherwise be subject by reason of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless
disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his
office; and provided always that such contract or
transaction shall have been on terms that were unfair
to the Corporation at the time at which it was entered
into. Any director of the Corporation who is so
interested, or who is a member, stockholder, officer or
director of such firm or corporation, may be counted in
determining the existence of a quorum at any meeting
of the Board of Directors of the Corporation which
shall authorize any such transaction or contract, with
like force and effect as if he were not such director, or
member, stockholder, officer or director of such firm or
corporation.

(c)	Specifically and without limitation of the foregoing
paragraph (b) but subject to the exception therein
prescribed, the Corporation may enter into
management or advisory, underwriting, distribution
and administration contracts, custodian contracts and
such other contracts as may be appropriate.

	Section 5.15. Reorganization: The Board of Directors
may merge or consolidate one of more series of shares with, and
may sell, convey and transfer the assets belonging to any one or
more series of shares to, another corporation, trust, partnership,
association or other organization, or to the Corporation to be held
as assets belonging to another series of shares, in exchange for
cash, securities or other consideration (including, in the case of a
transfer to another series of shares of the Corporation, shares of
such other series of shares) with such transfer being made subject
to, or with the assumption by the transferee of, the liabilities
belonging to each transferor series of shares if deemed
appropriate by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall
have the authority to effect any such merger, consolidation or
transfer of assets, without action or approval of the stockholders,
to the extent consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

	Section 5.16. Classes of Shares: The Board of Directors
shall also have the authority, subject to applicable laws and
regulations and without action or approval of the stockholders,
from time to time to designate any class of shares of a series of
shares as a separate series of shares as it deems necessary or
desirable. The designation of any class of shares of a series of
shares as a separate series of shares shall be effective at the time
specified by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall
allocate the assets, liabilities and expenses attributable to any
class of shares designated as a separate series of shares to such
separate series of shares and shall designate the relative rights
and preferences of such series of shares, provided that such
relative rights and preferences may not be materially adversely
different from the relative rights and preferences of the class of
shares designated as a separate series of shares.

	Section 5.17. Fees and Expenses. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in these Articles of
Incorporation, each share of any series or class of a series may
be subject to such sales loads or charges, whether initial, deferred
or contingent, or any combination thereof, or any other type of
sales load or charge; to such expenses and fees (including,
without limitation, distribution expenses, administrative expenses
under an administrative or service agreement, plan or other
arrangement, however designated, and other administrative,
recordkeeping, redemption, service and other fees, however
designated); to such account size requirements; and to such other
rights and provisions; which may be the same or different from
any other share of any series or class, including any other share
of the same series or class, all as the Board of Directors may from
time to time establish and/or change in accordance with applicable
laws and regulations.

ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARY
OF
PRINCIPAL FUNDS, INC.

       Principal Funds, Inc., a Maryland Corporation having its
principal office in this state in Baltimore City, Maryland (hereinafter
called the Corporation), hereby certifies to the State Department
of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, that:

       FIRST: On March 13, 2017, pursuant to the authority
granted to it in the Charter of the Corporation, resolutions were
unanimously approved by the Board of Directors, in accordance
with Section 2-105(c) of Maryland General Corporation Law,
authorizing an increase in the aggregate number of shares of the
Corporation. Article V of the Articles of Incorporation of this
Corporation is revised to: (i) authorize the issuance of one
hundred million (100,000,000) Class R-6 shares to the Global
Diversified Income Fund; and (ii) authorize the issuance of one
hundred million (100,000,000) Class R-6 shares to the Global
Multi Strategy Fund.

       The total number of authorized shares of stock of the
Corporation will increase from eighty-one billion eight hundred
eighty million (81,880,000,000) shares of stock to eighty-two
billion eighty million (82,080,000,000) shares of stock. The
aggregate par value of all authorized shares will increase from
eight hundred eighteen million eight hundred thousand dollars
($818,800,000) to eight hundred twenty million eight hundred
thousand dollars ($820,800,000). All authorized shares of stock of
the Corporation have a par value of one cent ($.01) per share.

       As amended, Article V shall be and read in its entirety as
follows:

ARTICLE V
CAPITAL STOCK ALLOCATION

       Section 5.1. Authorized Shares: The total number of
shares of stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue
is eighty-two billion eighty million (82,080,000,000) shares of
stock, with a par value of one cent ($0.01) per share. The
aggregate par value of all the authorized shares is eight hundred
twenty million eight hundred thousand dollars ($820,800,000). The
shares may be issued by the Board of Directors in such separate
and distinct series and classes of series as the Board of Directors
shall from time to time create and establish. The Board of
Directors shall have full power and authority, in its sole discretion,
to establish and designate series and classes of series, and to
classify or reclassify any unissued shares in separate series or
classes having such preferences, conversion or other rights,
voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends,
qualifications, and terms and conditions of redemption as shall be
fixed and determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.
Unless otherwise provided in these Articles of Incorporation or by
the Board of Directors when establishing a class, each class of a
series shall represent interests in the assets belonging to that
series and have identical voting, dividend, liquidation and other
rights and the same terms and conditions as any other class of the
series, except that expenses allocated to the class of a series may
be borne solely by such class as shall be determined by the Board
of Directors. Expenses related to the distribution of, and other
identified expenses that should properly be allocated to, the
shares of a particular series or class may be charged to and borne
solely by such series or class, and the bearing of expenses solely
by a series or class may be appropriately reflected (in a manner
determined by the Board of Directors) and cause differences in
the net asset value attributable to, and the dividend, redemption
and liquidation rights of, the shares of each series or class.
Subject to the authority of the Board of Directors to increase and
decrease the number of, and to reclassify the shares of any series
or class, there are hereby established eighty-eight series of
common stock, each comprising the number of shares and having
the share class designations indicated:

       A total of one hundred seventy-five million (175,000,000)
shares remain authorized but un-classified shares.

	In addition, the Board of Directors is hereby expressly
granted authority to change the designation of any series or class,
to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series or
class, provided that the number of authorized shares of any series
or class shall not be decreased by the Board of Directors below
the number of shares thereof then outstanding, and to reclassify
any unissued shares into one or more series or classes that may
be established and designated from time to time.

(a)	The Corporation may issue shares of stock in
fractional denominations to the same extent as its
whole shares, and shares in fractional denominations
shall be shares of stock having proportionately, to the
respective fractions represented thereby, all the rights
of whole shares, including without limitation, the right
to vote, the right to receive dividends and distributions
and the right to participate upon liquidation of the
Corporation, but excluding the right to receive a stock
certificate representing fractional shares.

(b)	The holder of each share of stock of the Corporation
shall be entitled to one vote for each full share, and a
fractional vote for each fractional share, of stock,
irrespective of the series or class, then standing in the
holder's name on the books of the Corporation. On
any matter submitted to a vote of stockholders, all
shares of the Corporation then issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote shall be voted in the aggregate
and not by series or class except that (1) when
otherwise expressly required by the Maryland General
Corporation Law or the Investment Company Act of
1940, shares shall be voted by individual series or
class, and (2) if the Board of Directors, in its sole
discretion, determines that a matter (including an
amendment to these Articles of Incorporation) affects
the interests of only one or more particular series or
class or classes then only the holders of shares of
such affected series or class or classes shall be
entitled to vote thereon.

(c)	Unless otherwise provided in the resolution of the
Board of Directors providing for the establishment and
designation of any new series or class or classes,
each series and class of stock of the Corporation shall
have the following powers, preferences and rights,
and qualifications, restrictions, and limitations thereof:

(1)	Assets Belonging to a Series. All consideration
received by the Corporation for the issue or sale
of shares of a particular series, together with all
assets in which such consideration is invested or
reinvested, all income, earnings, profits and
proceeds thereof, including any proceeds
derived from the sale, exchange or liquidation of
such assets, and any funds or payments derived
from any reinvestment of such proceeds in
whatever form the same may be, shall
irrevocably belong to that series for all purposes,
subject only to the rights of creditors, and shall
be so recorded upon the books and accounts of
the Corporation. Such consideration, assets,
income, earnings, profits and proceeds thereof,
including any proceeds derived from the sale,
exchange or liquidation of such assets, and any
funds or payments derived from any
reinvestment of such proceeds, in whatever form
the same may be, together with any General
Items allocated to that series as provided in the
following sentence, are herein referred to as
assets belonging to that series. In the event
that there are any assets, income, earnings,
profits, proceeds thereof, funds or payments
which are not readily identifiable as belonging to
any particular series (collectively General"
"18816","Items), such General Items shall be allocated
by or under the supervision of the Board of
Directors to and among any one or more of the
series established and designated from time to
time in such manner and on such basis as the
Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, deems
fair and equitable, and any General Items so
allocated to a particular series shall belong to
that series. Each such allocation by the Board of
Directors shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes. The foregoing provisions of this
Section 5.1(c)(1) shall apply to each class to the
extent provided by the Board of Directors and
consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

(2)	Liabilities Belonging to a Series. The assets
belonging to each particular series shall be
charged with the liabilities of the Corporation in
respect of that series and all expenses, costs,
charges and reserves attributable to that series,
and any general liabilities, expenses, costs,
charges or reserves of the Corporation which are
not readily identifiable as belonging to any
particular series shall be allocated and charged
by or under the supervision of the Board of
Directors to and among any one or more of the
series established and designated from time to
time in such manner and on such basis as the
Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, deems
fair and equitable. The liabilities, expenses,
costs, charges and reserves allocated and so
charged to a series are herein referred to as
liabilities belonging to that series. Expenses
related to the shares of a series may be borne
solely by that series (as determined by the Board
of Directors). Each allocation of liabilities,
expenses, costs, charges and reserves by the
Board of Directors shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes. The foregoing
provisions of this Section 5.1(c)(2) shall apply to
each class to the extent provided by the Board of
Directors and consistent with applicable laws
and regulations.

(3)	Dividends and Distributions. The Board of
Directors may from time to time declare and pay
dividends or distributions, in stock, property or
cash, on any or all series of stock, the amount of
such dividends and property distributions and
the payment of them being wholly in the
discretion of the Board of Directors. Dividends
may be declared daily or otherwise pursuant to a
standing resolution or resolutions adopted only
once or with such frequency as the Board of
Directors may determine, after providing for
actual and accrued liabilities belonging to that
series. All dividends or distributions on shares of
a particular series shall be paid only out of
surplus or other lawfully available assets
determined by the Board of Directors as
belonging to such series. Dividends and
distributions may vary between the classes of a
series to reflect differing allocations of the
expense of each class of that series to such
extent and for such purposes as the Board of
Directors may deem appropriate. The Board of
Directors shall have the power, in its sole
discretion, to distribute in any fiscal year as
dividends, including dividends designated in
whole or in part as capital gains distributions,
amounts sufficient, in the opinion of the Board of
Directors, to enable the Corporation, or where
applicable each series of shares to qualify as a
regulated investment company under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
any successor or comparable statute thereto,
and regulations promulgated thereunder, and to
avoid liability for the Corporation, or each series
of shares, for Federal income and excise taxes
in respect of that or any other year.

(4)	Liquidation. In the event of the liquidation of the
Corporation or of the assets attributable to a
particular series or class, the stockholders of
each series or class that has been established
and designated and is being liquidated shall be
entitled to receive, as a series or class, when
and as declared by the Board of Directors, the
excess of the assets belonging to that series or
class over the liabilities belonging to that series
or class. The holders of shares of any series or
class shall not be entitled thereby to any
distribution upon liquidation of any other series
or class. The assets so distributable to the
stockholders of any particular series or class
shall be distributed among such stockholders
according to their respective rights taking into
account the proper allocation of expenses being
borne by that series or class. The liquidation of
assets attributable to any particular series or
class in which there are shares then outstanding
and the termination of the series or the class
may be authorized by vote of a majority of the
Board of Directors then in office, without action
or approval of the stockholders, to the extent
consistent with applicable laws and regulations.
In the event that there are any general assets
not belonging to any particular series or class of
stock and available for distribution, such
distribution shall be made to holders of stock of
various series or classes in such proportion as
the Board of Directors determines to be fair and
equitable, and such determination by the Board
of Directors shall be conclusive and binding for
all purposes.

(5)	Redemption. All shares of stock of the
Corporation shall be subject to the redemption,
repurchase and conversion provisions set forth
in Sections 5.6 through 5.11 of this Article V.

(d)	The Corporation's shares of stock are issued and
sold, and all persons who shall acquire stock of the
Corporation shall do so, subject to the condition and
understanding that the provisions of the Corporation's
Articles of Incorporation, as from time to time
amended, shall be binding upon them.

	Section 5.2. Quorum Requirements and Voting Rights:
Except as otherwise expressly provided by the Maryland General
Corporation Law, the presence in person or by proxy of the
holders of one-third of the shares of capital stock of the
Corporation outstanding and entitled to vote thereat shall
constitute a quorum at any meeting of the stockholders, except
that where the holders of any series or class are required or
permitted to vote as a series or class, one-third of the aggregate
number of shares of that series or class outstanding and entitled
to vote shall constitute a quorum.

	Notwithstanding any provision of Maryland General
Corporation Law requiring a greater proportion than a majority of
the votes of all series or classes or of any series or class of the
Corporation's stock entitled to be cast in order to take or authorize
any action, any such action may be taken or authorized upon the
concurrence of a majority of the aggregate number of votes
entitled to be cast thereon subject to applicable laws and
regulations. All shares of stock of this Corporation shall have the
voting rights provided for in Section 5.1(b) of this Article V.

	The Board of Directors from time to time, subject to such
procedures as may be adopted by the Board of Directors, and
consistent with applicable laws and regulations, may authorize the
holders of shares of any series or class to take action or consent
to any action by delivering a consent, in writing or by electronic
transmission, of the holders entitled to cast not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or
take the action at a meeting of the holders of shares of such
series or class.

	Section 5.3. No Preemptive or Appraisal Rights: No
holder of shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall, as such
holder, have any right to purchase or subscribe for any shares of
the capital stock of the Corporation which the Corporation may
issue or sell (whether consisting of shares of capital stock
authorized by these Articles of Incorporation, or shares of capital
stock of the Corporation acquired by it after the issue thereof, or
other shares) other than any right which the Board of Directors of
the Corporation, in its discretion, may determine.

	No holder of shares of capital stock of the Corporation
shall be entitled to exercise the rights of an objecting stockholder
under Subtitle 2 of Title 3 of the Maryland General Corporation
Law or any successor provision.

	Section 5.4. Determination of Net Asset Value: The net
asset value of each share of each series or class of each series of
the Corporation shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the
value of the net assets of the Corporation, or if applicable of the
series or class (being the value of the assets of the Corporation or
of the particular series or class or attributable to the particular
series or class less its actual and accrued liabilities exclusive of
capital stock and surplus), by the total number of outstanding
shares of the Corporation or the series or class, as applicable.
Such determination may be made on a series-by-series basis or
made or adjusted on a class-by-class basis, as appropriate, and
shall include any expenses allocated to a specific series or class
thereof. The Board of Directors may adopt procedures for
determination of net asset value consistent with the requirements
of applicable laws and regulations and, so far as accounting
matters are concerned, with generally accepted accounting
principles. The procedures may include, without limitation,
procedures for valuation of the Corporation's portfolio securities
and other assets, for accrual of expenses or creation of reserves
and for the determination of the number of shares issued and
outstanding at any given time.

	Section 5.5. Stable Net Asset Value: With respect to any
money market, stable value or other series or class that seeks to
maintain a stable net asset value per share, and pursuant to
procedures established by the Board of Directors, the Corporation
shall be entitled, without the payment of monetary compensation
but in consideration of the interest of the Corporation and its
stockholders in maintaining a stable net asset value per share of
such series or class, to redeem pro rata from all holders of record
of such series or class at the time of such redemption (in
proportion to their respective holdings of such shares) sufficient
outstanding shares (or fractional shares) of such series or class,
or to take such other measures as are not prohibited by the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as shall maintain for such
series or class a stable net asset value.

	Section 5.6. Redemption by Stockholders: Any
stockholder may redeem shares of the Corporation for the net
asset value of each series or class thereof, less such fees and
charges, if any, as may be established by the Board of Directors
from time to time, by presentation of an appropriate request,
together with the certificates, if any, for such shares, duly
endorsed, at the office or agency designated by the Corporation.
Redemptions as aforesaid, shall be made in the manner and
subject to the conditions contained in the bylaws or approved by
the Board of Directors.

	Section 5.7. Redemption at the Option of the
Corporation: Subject to the provisions of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, each share of the Corporation and each
share of each series and class shall be redeemable from any
stockholder at the option of the Corporation. In that regard, the
Board of Directors may from time to time authorize the
Corporation to redeem all or any part of the shares of the
Corporation or of any series or class upon such terms and
conditions as the Board of Directors may determine in its sole
discretion. The Corporation's right to redeem shares includes,
without limitation, the right to redeem shares when required for the
payment of account fees or other fees, charges and expenses as
set by the Board of Directors, including without limitation any small
account fees permitted by Section 5.9 of this Article V.

	Section 5.8. Purchase of Shares: The Corporation shall
be entitled to purchase all or any part of the shares of the
Corporation or of any series or class of its capital stock, to the
extent that the Corporation may lawfully effect such purchase
under Maryland General Corporation Law, upon such terms and
conditions and for such consideration as the Board of Directors
shall deem advisable.

	Section 5.9. Redemption of Minimum Amounts: The
Board of Directors may establish, from time to time, one or more
minimum investment amounts for stockholder accounts, which
may be different for each series or class and within each series or
class, and may impose account fees on, and/or require the
involuntary redemption of, those accounts the net asset value of
which for any reason falls below such established minimum
amounts, or may take any other action with respect to minimum
investment amounts as may be deemed appropriate by the Board
of Directors, in each case upon such terms as shall be established
by the Board of Directors. Any such account fee may be satisfied
by the Corporation by redeeming the requisite number of shares in
any such account in the amount of such fee.

	Section 5.10. Conversion of Shares by Stockholders
and by the Corporation: Subject to compliance with the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and applicable laws and
regulations, the Board of Directors shall have authority, without
stockholder approval, to provide that:

(a)	the holders of any series or class of shares shall have
the right to convert or exchange such shares into
shares of one or more other series or classes in
accordance with such terms and conditions as may be
established by the Board of Directors; and

(b)	the Corporation may automatically convert some or all
of the shares of a particular series or class into shares
of another series or class, at such times as may be
determined by the Board of Directors, based on the
relative net asset values of such series or class at time
of conversion and otherwise in accordance with such
terms and conditions as may be established by the
Board of Directors and which may vary within and
among the series and classes and within and among
the holders of the series or classes to the extent
determined by the Board of Directors.

	Section 5.11. Mode of Payment: Payment by the
Corporation for shares of any series or class of the capital stock of
the Corporation surrendered to it for redemption shall be made by
the Corporation within seven days of such surrender out of the
funds legally available therefor, provided that the Corporation may
suspend the right of the holders of capital stock of the Corporation
to redeem shares of capital stock and may postpone the right of
such holders to receive payment for any shares when permitted or
required to do so by law. Payment of the redemption or purchase
price may be made in cash or, at the option of the Corporation,
wholly or partly in such portfolio securities or other assets of the
Corporation as the Corporation may select in its sole discretion.
The composition of any such payments may be different among
stockholders, including those of the same series or class, as the
Corporation may determine in its sole discretion.

	Section 5.12. Rights of Holders of Shares Purchased
or Redeemed: The right of any holder of any series or class of
capital stock of the Corporation purchased or redeemed by the
Corporation as provided in this Article V to receive dividends
thereon and all other rights of such holder with respect to such
shares shall terminate at the time as of which the purchase or
redemption price of such shares is determined, except the right of
such holder to receive (i) the purchase or redemption price of such
shares from the Corporation or its designated agent and (ii) any
dividend or distribution or voting rights to which such holder has
previously become entitled as the record holder of such shares on
the record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled
to receive such dividend or distribution or to vote at the meeting of
stockholders.

	Section 5.13. Status of Shares Purchased or
Redeemed: In the absence of any specification as to the purpose
for which such shares of any series or class of capital stock of the
Corporation are redeemed or purchased by it, all shares so
redeemed or purchased shall be deemed to be retired in the
sense contemplated by the laws of the State of Maryland and may
be reissued. The number of authorized shares of capital stock of
the Corporation shall not be reduced by the number of any shares
redeemed or purchased by it.

	Section 5.14. Additional Limitations and Powers: The
following provisions are inserted for the purpose of defining,
limiting and regulating the powers of the Corporation and of the
Board of Directors and stockholders:

(a)	Any determination made in good faith and, so far as
accounting matters are involved, in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles by or
pursuant to the direction of the Board of Directors, as
to the amount of the assets, debts, obligations or
liabilities of the Corporation, as to the amount of any
reserves or charges set up and the propriety thereof,
as to the time of or purpose for creating such reserves
or charges, as to the use, alteration or cancellation of
any reserves or charges (whether or not any debt,
obligation or liability for which such reserves or
charges shall have been created shall have been paid
or discharged or shall be then or thereafter required to
be paid or discharged), as to the establishment or
designation of procedures or methods to be employed
for valuing any investment or other assets of the
Corporation and as to the value of any investment or
other asset, as to the allocation of any asset of the
Corporation to a particular series or class or classes of
the Corporation's stock, as to the funds available for
the declaration of dividends and as to the declaration
of dividends, as to the charging of any liability of the
Corporation to a particular series or class or classes of
the Corporation's stock, as to the number of shares of
any series or class or classes of the Corporation's
outstanding stock, as to the estimated expense to the
Corporation in connection with purchases or
redemptions of its shares, as to the ability to liquidate
investments in orderly fashion, or as to any other
matters relating to the issue, sale, purchase or
redemption or other acquisition or disposition of
investments or shares of the Corporation, or in the
determination of the net asset value per share of
shares of any series or class of the Corporation's
stock shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes.

(b)	Except to the extent prohibited by the Investment
Company Act of 1940, or rules, regulations or orders
thereunder promulgated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any successor thereto or by
the bylaws of the Corporation, a director, officer or
employee of the Corporation shall not be disqualified
by his position from dealing or contracting with the
Corporation, nor shall any transaction or contract of
the Corporation be void or voidable by reason of the
fact that any director, officer or employee or any firm
of which any director, officer or employee is a
member, or any corporation of which any director,
officer or employee is a stockholder, officer or director,
is in any way interested in such transaction or
contract; provided that in case a director, or a firm or
corporation of which a director is a member,
stockholder, officer or director is so interested, such
fact shall be disclosed to or shall have been known by
the Board of Directors or a majority thereof. Nor shall
any director or officer of the Corporation be liable to
the Corporation or to any stockholder or creditor
thereof or to any person for any loss incurred by it or
him or for any profit realized by such director or officer
under or by reason of such contract or transaction;
provided that nothing herein shall protect any director
or officer of the Corporation against any liability to the
Corporation or to its security holders to which he
would otherwise be subject by reason of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless
disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his
office; and provided always that such contract or
transaction shall have been on terms that were unfair
to the Corporation at the time at which it was entered
into. Any director of the Corporation who is so
interested, or who is a member, stockholder, officer or
director of such firm or corporation, may be counted in
determining the existence of a quorum at any meeting
of the Board of Directors of the Corporation which
shall authorize any such transaction or contract, with
like force and effect as if he were not such director, or
member, stockholder, officer or director of such firm or
corporation.

(c)	Specifically and without limitation of the foregoing
paragraph (b) but subject to the exception therein
prescribed, the Corporation may enter into
management or advisory, underwriting, distribution
and administration contracts, custodian contracts and
such other contracts as may be appropriate.

	Section 5.15. Reorganization: The Board of Directors
may merge or consolidate one of more series of shares with, and
may sell, convey and transfer the assets belonging to any one or
more series of shares to, another corporation, trust, partnership,
association or other organization, or to the Corporation to be held
as assets belonging to another series of shares, in exchange for
cash, securities or other consideration (including, in the case of a
transfer to another series of shares of the Corporation, shares of
such other series of shares) with such transfer being made subject
to, or with the assumption by the transferee of, the liabilities
belonging to each transferor series of shares if deemed
appropriate by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall
have the authority to effect any such merger, consolidation or
transfer of assets, without action or approval of the stockholders,
to the extent consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

	Section 5.16. Classes of Shares: The Board of Directors
shall also have the authority, subject to applicable laws and
regulations and without action or approval of the stockholders,
from time to time to designate any class of shares of a series of
shares as a separate series of shares as it deems necessary or
desirable. The designation of any class of shares of a series of
shares as a separate series of shares shall be effective at the time
specified by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall
allocate the assets, liabilities and expenses attributable to any

aggregate par value of all authorized shares will increase from
eight hundred twenty-seven million three hundred thousand
dollars ($827,300,000) to eight hundred forty-six million five
hundred fifty thousand dollars ($846,550,000). All authorized
shares of stock of the Corporation have a par value of one cent
($.01) per share.

       As amended, Article V shall be and read in its entirety as
follows:

ARTICLE V
CAPITAL STOCK ALLOCATION

       Section 5.1. Authorized Shares: The total number of
shares of stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue
is eighty-four billion six hundred fifty-five million (84,655,000,000)
shares of stock, with a par value of one cent ($0.01) per share.
The aggregate par value of all the authorized shares is eight
hundred forty-six million five hundred fifty thousand dollars
($846,550,000). The shares may be issued by the Board of
Directors in such separate and distinct series and classes of
series as the Board of Directors shall from time to time create and
establish. The Board of Directors shall have full power and
authority, in its sole discretion, to establish and designate series
and classes of series, and to classify or reclassify any unissued
shares in separate series or classes having such preferences,
conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations
as to dividends, qualifications, and terms and conditions of
redemption as shall be fixed and determined from time to time by
the Board of Directors. Unless otherwise provided in these Articles
of Incorporation or by the Board of Directors when establishing a
class, each class of a series shall represent interests in the assets
belonging to that series and have identical voting, dividend,
liquidation and other rights and the same terms and conditions as
any other class of the series, except that expenses allocated to
the class of a series may be borne solely by such class as shall be
determined by the Board of Directors. Expenses related to the
distribution of, and other identified expenses that should properly
be allocated to, the shares of a particular series or class may be
charged to and borne solely by such series or class, and the
bearing of expenses solely by a series or class may be
appropriately reflected (in a manner determined by the Board of
Directors) and cause differences in the net asset value attributable
to, and the dividend, redemption and liquidation rights of, the
shares of each series or class. Subject to the authority of the
Board of Directors to increase and decrease the number of, and to
reclassify the shares of any series or class, there are hereby
established eighty-eight series of common stock, each comprising
the number of shares and having the share class designations
indicated:

       A total of one hundred seventy-five million (175,000,000)
shares remain authorized but un-classified shares.

	In addition, the Board of Directors is hereby expressly
granted authority to change the designation of any series or class,
to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series or
class, provided that the number of authorized shares of any series
or class shall not be decreased by the Board of Directors below
the number of shares thereof then outstanding, and to reclassify
any unissued shares into one or more series or classes that may
be established and designated from time to time.

(a)	The Corporation may issue shares of stock in
fractional denominations to the same extent as its
whole shares, and shares in fractional denominations
shall be shares of stock having proportionately, to the
respective fractions represented thereby, all the rights
of whole shares, including without limitation, the right
to vote, the right to receive dividends and distributions
and the right to participate upon liquidation of the
Corporation, but excluding the right to receive a stock
certificate representing fractional shares.

(b)	The holder of each share of stock of the Corporation
shall be entitled to one vote for each full share, and a
fractional vote for each fractional share, of stock,
irrespective of the series or class, then standing in the
holder's name on the books of the Corporation. On
any matter submitted to a vote of stockholders, all
shares of the Corporation then issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote shall be voted in the aggregate
and not by series or class except that (1) when
otherwise expressly required by the Maryland General
Corporation Law or the Investment Company Act of
1940, shares shall be voted by individual series or
class, and (2) if the Board of Directors, in its sole
discretion, determines that a matter (including an
amendment to these Articles of Incorporation) affects
the interests of only one or more particular series or
class or classes then only the holders of shares of
such affected series or class or classes shall be
entitled to vote thereon.

(c)	Unless otherwise provided in the resolution of the
Board of Directors providing for the establishment and
designation of any new series or class or classes,
each series and class of stock of the Corporation shall
have the following powers, preferences and rights,
and qualifications, restrictions, and limitations thereof:

(1)	Assets Belonging to a Series. All consideration
received by the Corporation for the issue or sale
of shares of a particular series, together with all
assets in which such consideration is invested or
reinvested, all income, earnings, profits and
proceeds thereof, including any proceeds
derived from the sale, exchange or liquidation of
such assets, and any funds or payments derived
from any reinvestment of such proceeds in
whatever form the same may be, shall
irrevocably belong to that series for all purposes,
subject only to the rights of creditors, and shall
be so recorded upon the books and accounts of
the Corporation. Such consideration, assets,
income, earnings, profits and proceeds thereof,
including any proceeds derived from the sale,
exchange or liquidation of such assets, and any
funds or payments derived from any
reinvestment of such proceeds, in whatever form
the same may be, together with any General
Items allocated to that series as provided in the
following sentence, are herein referred to as
assets belonging to that series. In the event
that there are any assets, income, earnings,
profits, proceeds thereof, funds or payments
which are not readily identifiable as belonging to
any particular series (collectively General"
"18817","Items), such General Items shall be allocated
by or under the supervision of the Board of
Directors to and among any one or more of the
series established and designated from time to
time in such manner and on such basis as the
Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, deems
fair and equitable, and any General Items so
allocated to a particular series shall belong to
that series. Each such allocation by the Board of
Directors shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes. The foregoing provisions of this
Section 5.1(c)(1) shall apply to each class to the
extent provided by the Board of Directors and
consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

(2)	Liabilities Belonging to a Series. The assets
belonging to each particular series shall be
charged with the liabilities of the Corporation in
respect of that series and all expenses, costs,
charges and reserves attributable to that series,
and any general liabilities, expenses, costs,
charges or reserves of the Corporation which are
not readily identifiable as belonging to any
particular series shall be allocated and charged
by or under the supervision of the Board of
Directors to and among any one or more of the
series established and designated from time to
time in such manner and on such basis as the
Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, deems
fair and equitable. The liabilities, expenses,
costs, charges and reserves allocated and so
charged to a series are herein referred to as
liabilities belonging to that series. Expenses
related to the shares of a series may be borne
solely by that series (as determined by the Board
of Directors). Each allocation of liabilities,
expenses, costs, charges and reserves by the
Board of Directors shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes. The foregoing
provisions of this Section 5.1(c)(2) shall apply to
each class to the extent provided by the Board of
Directors and consistent with applicable laws
and regulations.

(3)	Dividends and Distributions. The Board of
Directors may from time to time declare and pay
dividends or distributions, in stock, property or
cash, on any or all series of stock, the amount of
such dividends and property distributions and
the payment of them being wholly in the
discretion of the Board of Directors. Dividends
may be declared daily or otherwise pursuant to a
standing resolution or resolutions adopted only
once or with such frequency as the Board of
Directors may determine, after providing for
actual and accrued liabilities belonging to that
series. All dividends or distributions on shares of
a particular series shall be paid only out of
surplus or other lawfully available assets
determined by the Board of Directors as
belonging to such series. Dividends and
distributions may vary between the classes of a
series to reflect differing allocations of the
expense of each class of that series to such
extent and for such purposes as the Board of
Directors may deem appropriate. The Board of
Directors shall have the power, in its sole
discretion, to distribute in any fiscal year as
dividends, including dividends designated in
whole or in part as capital gains distributions,
amounts sufficient, in the opinion of the Board of
Directors, to enable the Corporation, or where
applicable each series of shares to qualify as a
regulated investment company under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
any successor or comparable statute thereto,
and regulations promulgated thereunder, and to
avoid liability for the Corporation, or each series
of shares, for Federal income and excise taxes
in respect of that or any other year.

(4)	Liquidation. In the event of the liquidation of the
Corporation or of the assets attributable to a
particular series or class, the stockholders of
each series or class that has been established
and designated and is being liquidated shall be
entitled to receive, as a series or class, when
and as declared by the Board of Directors, the
excess of the assets belonging to that series or
class over the liabilities belonging to that series
or class. The holders of shares of any series or
class shall not be entitled thereby to any
distribution upon liquidation of any other series
or class. The assets so distributable to the
stockholders of any particular series or class
shall be distributed among such stockholders
according to their respective rights taking into
account the proper allocation of expenses being
borne by that series or class. The liquidation of
assets attributable to any particular series or
class in which there are shares then outstanding
and the termination of the series or the class
may be authorized by vote of a majority of the
Board of Directors then in office, without action
or approval of the stockholders, to the extent
consistent with applicable laws and regulations.
In the event that there are any general assets
not belonging to any particular series or class of
stock and available for distribution, such
distribution shall be made to holders of stock of
various series or classes in such proportion as
the Board of Directors determines to be fair and
equitable, and such determination by the Board
of Directors shall be conclusive and binding for
all purposes.

(5)	Redemption. All shares of stock of the
Corporation shall be subject to the redemption,
repurchase and conversion provisions set forth
in Sections 5.6 through 5.11 of this Article V.

(d)	The Corporation's shares of stock are issued and
sold, and all persons who shall acquire stock of the
Corporation shall do so, subject to the condition and
understanding that the provisions of the Corporation's
Articles of Incorporation, as from time to time
amended, shall be binding upon them.

	Section 5.2. Quorum Requirements and Voting Rights:
Except as otherwise expressly provided by the Maryland General
Corporation Law, the presence in person or by proxy of the
holders of one-third of the shares of capital stock of the
Corporation outstanding and entitled to vote thereat shall
constitute a quorum at any meeting of the stockholders, except
that where the holders of any series or class are required or
permitted to vote as a series or class, one-third of the aggregate
number of shares of that series or class outstanding and entitled
to vote shall constitute a quorum.

	Notwithstanding any provision of Maryland General
Corporation Law requiring a greater proportion than a majority of
the votes of all series or classes or of any series or class of the
Corporation's stock entitled to be cast in order to take or authorize
any action, any such action may be taken or authorized upon the
concurrence of a majority of the aggregate number of votes
entitled to be cast thereon subject to applicable laws and
regulations. All shares of stock of this Corporation shall have the
voting rights provided for in Section 5.1(b) of this Article V.

	The Board of Directors from time to time, subject to such
procedures as may be adopted by the Board of Directors, and
consistent with applicable laws and regulations, may authorize the
holders of shares of any series or class to take action or consent
to any action by delivering a consent, in writing or by electronic
transmission, of the holders entitled to cast not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or
take the action at a meeting of the holders of shares of such
series or class.

	Section 5.3. No Preemptive or Appraisal Rights: No
holder of shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall, as such
holder, have any right to purchase or subscribe for any shares of
the capital stock of the Corporation which the Corporation may
issue or sell (whether consisting of shares of capital stock
authorized by these Articles of Incorporation, or shares of capital
stock of the Corporation acquired by it after the issue thereof, or
other shares) other than any right which the Board of Directors of
the Corporation, in its discretion, may determine.

	No holder of shares of capital stock of the Corporation
shall be entitled to exercise the rights of an objecting stockholder
under Subtitle 2 of Title 3 of the Maryland General Corporation
Law or any successor provision.

	Section 5.4. Determination of Net Asset Value: The net
asset value of each share of each series or class of each series of
the Corporation shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the
value of the net assets of the Corporation, or if applicable of the
series or class (being the value of the assets of the Corporation or
of the particular series or class or attributable to the particular
series or class less its actual and accrued liabilities exclusive of
capital stock and surplus), by the total number of outstanding
shares of the Corporation or the series or class, as applicable.
Such determination may be made on a series-by-series basis or
made or adjusted on a class-by-class basis, as appropriate, and
shall include any expenses allocated to a specific series or class
thereof. The Board of Directors may adopt procedures for
determination of net asset value consistent with the requirements
of applicable laws and regulations and, so far as accounting
matters are concerned, with generally accepted accounting
principles. The procedures may include, without limitation,
procedures for valuation of the Corporation's portfolio securities
and other assets, for accrual of expenses or creation of reserves
and for the determination of the number of shares issued and
outstanding at any given time.

	Section 5.5. Stable Net Asset Value: With respect to any
money market, stable value or other series or class that seeks to
maintain a stable net asset value per share, and pursuant to
procedures established by the Board of Directors, the Corporation
shall be entitled, without the payment of monetary compensation
but in consideration of the interest of the Corporation and its
stockholders in maintaining a stable net asset value per share of
such series or class, to redeem pro rata from all holders of record
of such series or class at the time of such redemption (in
proportion to their respective holdings of such shares) sufficient
outstanding shares (or fractional shares) of such series or class,
or to take such other measures as are not prohibited by the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as shall maintain for such
series or class a stable net asset value.

	Section 5.6. Redemption by Stockholders: Any
stockholder may redeem shares of the Corporation for the net
asset value of each series or class thereof, less such fees and
charges, if any, as may be established by the Board of Directors
from time to time, by presentation of an appropriate request,
together with the certificates, if any, for such shares, duly
endorsed, at the office or agency designated by the Corporation.
Redemptions as aforesaid, shall be made in the manner and
subject to the conditions contained in the bylaws or approved by
the Board of Directors.

	Section 5.7. Redemption at the Option of the
Corporation: Subject to the provisions of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, each share of the Corporation and each
share of each series and class shall be redeemable from any
stockholder at the option of the Corporation. In that regard, the
Board of Directors may from time to time authorize the
Corporation to redeem all or any part of the shares of the
Corporation or of any series or class upon such terms and
conditions as the Board of Directors may determine in its sole
discretion. The Corporation's right to redeem shares includes,
without limitation, the right to redeem shares when required for the
payment of account fees or other fees, charges and expenses as
set by the Board of Directors, including without limitation any small
account fees permitted by Section 5.9 of this Article V.

	Section 5.8. Purchase of Shares: The Corporation shall
be entitled to purchase all or any part of the shares of the
Corporation or of any series or class of its capital stock, to the
extent that the Corporation may lawfully effect such purchase
under Maryland General Corporation Law, upon such terms and
conditions and for such consideration as the Board of Directors
shall deem advisable.

	Section 5.9. Redemption of Minimum Amounts: The
Board of Directors may establish, from time to time, one or more
minimum investment amounts for stockholder accounts, which
may be different for each series or class and within each series or
class, and may impose account fees on, and/or require the
involuntary redemption of, those accounts the net asset value of
which for any reason falls below such established minimum
amounts, or may take any other action with respect to minimum
investment amounts as may be deemed appropriate by the Board
of Directors, in each case upon such terms as shall be established
by the Board of Directors. Any such account fee may be satisfied
by the Corporation by redeeming the requisite number of shares in
any such account in the amount of such fee.

	Section 5.10. Conversion of Shares by Stockholders
and by the Corporation: Subject to compliance with the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and applicable laws and
regulations, the Board of Directors shall have authority, without
stockholder approval, to provide that:

(a)	the holders of any series or class of shares shall have
the right to convert or exchange such shares into
shares of one or more other series or classes in
accordance with such terms and conditions as may be
established by the Board of Directors; and

(b)	the Corporation may automatically convert some or all
of the shares of a particular series or class into shares
of another series or class, at such times as may be
determined by the Board of Directors, based on the
relative net asset values of such series or class at time
of conversion and otherwise in accordance with such
terms and conditions as may be established by the
Board of Directors and which may vary within and
among the series and classes and within and among
the holders of the series or classes to the extent
determined by the Board of Directors.

	Section 5.11. Mode of Payment: Payment by the
Corporation for shares of any series or class of the capital stock of
the Corporation surrendered to it for redemption shall be made by
the Corporation within seven days of such surrender out of the
funds legally available therefor, provided that the Corporation may
suspend the right of the holders of capital stock of the Corporation
to redeem shares of capital stock and may postpone the right of
such holders to receive payment for any shares when permitted or
required to do so by law. Payment of the redemption or purchase
price may be made in cash or, at the option of the Corporation,
wholly or partly in such portfolio securities or other assets of the
Corporation as the Corporation may select in its sole discretion.
The composition of any such payments may be different among
stockholders, including those of the same series or class, as the
Corporation may determine in its sole discretion.

	Section 5.12. Rights of Holders of Shares Purchased
or Redeemed: The right of any holder of any series or class of
capital stock of the Corporation purchased or redeemed by the
Corporation as provided in this Article V to receive dividends
thereon and all other rights of such holder with respect to such
shares shall terminate at the time as of which the purchase or
redemption price of such shares is determined, except the right of
such holder to receive (i) the purchase or redemption price of such
shares from the Corporation or its designated agent and (ii) any
dividend or distribution or voting rights to which such holder has
previously become entitled as the record holder of such shares on
the record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled
to receive such dividend or distribution or to vote at the meeting of
stockholders.

	Section 5.13. Status of Shares Purchased or
Redeemed: In the absence of any specification as to the purpose
for which such shares of any series or class of capital stock of the
Corporation are redeemed or purchased by it, all shares so
redeemed or purchased shall be deemed to be retired in the
sense contemplated by the laws of the State of Maryland and may
be reissued. The number of authorized shares of capital stock of
the Corporation shall not be reduced by the number of any shares
redeemed or purchased by it.

	Section 5.14. Additional Limitations and Powers: The
following provisions are inserted for the purpose of defining,
limiting and regulating the powers of the Corporation and of the
Board of Directors and stockholders:

(a)	Any determination made in good faith and, so far as
accounting matters are involved, in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles by or
pursuant to the direction of the Board of Directors, as
to the amount of the assets, debts, obligations or
liabilities of the Corporation, as to the amount of any
reserves or charges set up and the propriety thereof,
as to the time of or purpose for creating such reserves
or charges, as to the use, alteration or cancellation of
any reserves or charges (whether or not any debt,
obligation or liability for which such reserves or
charges shall have been created shall have been paid
or discharged or shall be then or thereafter required to
be paid or discharged), as to the establishment or
designation of procedures or methods to be employed
for valuing any investment or other assets of the
Corporation and as to the value of any investment or
other asset, as to the allocation of any asset of the
Corporation to a particular series or class or classes of
the Corporation's stock, as to the funds available for
the declaration of dividends and as to the declaration
of dividends, as to the charging of any liability of the
Corporation to a particular series or class or classes of
the Corporation's stock, as to the number of shares of
any series or class or classes of the Corporation's
outstanding stock, as to the estimated expense to the
Corporation in connection with purchases or
redemptions of its shares, as to the ability to liquidate
investments in orderly fashion, or as to any other
matters relating to the issue, sale, purchase or
redemption or other acquisition or disposition of
investments or shares of the Corporation, or in the
determination of the net asset value per share of
shares of any series or class of the Corporation's
stock shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes.

(b)	Except to the extent prohibited by the Investment
Company Act of 1940, or rules, regulations or orders
thereunder promulgated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any successor thereto or by
the bylaws of the Corporation, a director, officer or
employee of the Corporation shall not be disqualified
by his position from dealing or contracting with the
Corporation, nor shall any transaction or contract of
the Corporation be void or voidable by reason of the
fact that any director, officer or employee or any firm
of which any director, officer or employee is a
member, or any corporation of which any director,
officer or employee is a stockholder, officer or director,
is in any way interested in such transaction or
contract; provided that in case a director, or a firm or
corporation of which a director is a member,
stockholder, officer or director is so interested, such
fact shall be disclosed to or shall have been known by
the Board of Directors or a majority thereof. Nor shall
any director or officer of the Corporation be liable to
the Corporation or to any stockholder or creditor
thereof or to any person for any loss incurred by it or
him or for any profit realized by such director or officer
under or by reason of such contract or transaction;
provided that nothing herein shall protect any director
or officer of the Corporation against any liability to the
Corporation or to its security holders to which he
would otherwise be subject by reason of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless
disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his
office; and provided always that such contract or
transaction shall have been on terms that were unfair
to the Corporation at the time at which it was entered
into. Any director of the Corporation who is so
interested, or who is a member, stockholder, officer or
director of such firm or corporation, may be counted in
determining the existence of a quorum at any meeting
of the Board of Directors of the Corporation which
shall authorize any such transaction or contract, with
like force and effect as if he were not such director, or
member, stockholder, officer or director of such firm or
corporation.

(c)	Specifically and without limitation of the foregoing
paragraph (b) but subject to the exception therein
prescribed, the Corporation may enter into
management or advisory, underwriting, distribution
and administration contracts, custodian contracts and
such other contracts as may be appropriate.

	Section 5.15. Reorganization: The Board of Directors
may merge or consolidate one of more series of shares with, and
may sell, convey and transfer the assets belonging to any one or
more series of shares to, another corporation, trust, partnership,
association or other organization, or to the Corporation to be held
as assets belonging to another series of shares, in exchange for
cash, securities or other consideration (including, in the case of a
transfer to another series of shares of the Corporation, shares of
such other series of shares) with such transfer being made subject
to, or with the assumption by the transferee of, the liabilities
belonging to each transferor series of shares if deemed
appropriate by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall
have the authority to effect any such merger, consolidation or
transfer of assets, without action or approval of the stockholders,
to the extent consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

	Section 5.16. Classes of Shares: The Board of Directors
shall also have the authority, subject to applicable laws and
regulations and without action or approval of the stockholders,
from time to time to designate any class of shares of a series of
shares as a separate series of shares as it deems necessary or
desirable. The designation of any class of shares of a series of
shares as a separate series of shares shall be effective at the time
specified by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall
allocate the assets, liabilities and expenses attributable to any
class of shares designated as a separate series of shares to such
separate series of shares and shall designate the relative rights
and preferences of such series of shares, provided that such
relative rights and preferences may not be materially adversely
different from the relative rights and preferences of the class of
shares designated as a separate series of shares.

	Section 5.17. Fees and Expenses. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in these Articles of
Incorporation, each share of any series or class of a series may
be subject to such sales loads or charges, whether initial, deferred
or contingent, or any combination thereof, or any other type of
sales load or charge; to such expenses and fees (including,
without limitation, distribution expenses, administrative expenses
under an administrative or service agreement, plan or other
arrangement, however designated, and other administrative,
recordkeeping, redemption, service and other fees, however
designated); to such account size requirements; and to such other
rights and provisions; which may be the same or different from
any other share of any series or class, including any other share
of the same series or class, all as the Board of Directors may from
time to time establish and/or change in accordance with applicable
laws and regulations.

SECOND: The Corporation is registered as an open-end company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

THIRD: The Articles Supplementary shall become effective
immediately upon filing.

PRINCIPAL GLOBAL INVESTORS, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company  (hereinafter called the Manager), and ROBERT W. BAIRD &
CO. INCORPORATED, a Wisconsin Corporation (hereinafter called the"
"18818","Sub-Advisor).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to each
series of the Principal  Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end
management investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it
with portfolio selection in connection with the investment advisory
services for each series of the Fund identified in Appendix A (hereinafter
called the Series), which the Manager has agreed to provide to the
Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to furnish such services on the terms
and conditions set forth herein; and

WHEREAS, the Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies
properly certified or authenticated of each of the following:

 	(a)	The Amended and Restated Management Agreement between
the Fund and the Manager (the Management Agreement) with
the Fund;

 	(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC);

 	(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the
Board of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and
services provided by the Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement,
the Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the
services described in Section 2 below for investment and
reinvestment of the securities and other assets of the Series,
subject to the supervision and direction of the Manager and the
Fund's Board of Directors, for the period and on the terms
hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor accepts such appointment
and agrees to furnish the services hereinafter set forth for the
compensation herein provided. The Sub-Advisor shall provide
such services with respect to the portion of the assets of the
Series allocated to it for management from time to time by the
Manager.  The Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes herein be
deemed to be an independent contractor and shall, except as
expressly provided or authorized herein, have no authority to act
for or represent the Fund or the Manager in any way or
otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

 		Subject to the terms of this Agreement and applicable law, the
Sub-Advisor shall have full discretionary authority to manage the
assets of the Series designated by the Manager for management
by the Sub-Advisor. As part of its services, the Sub-Advisor will:

(i)    Provide investment advisory services, including but not
limited to research, advice and supervision for the
Series.

(ii)	Furnish to the Board of Directors  for approval (or any
appropriate committee of such Board of Directors), and
revise from time to time as economic conditions require,
a recommended investment program for the Series
consistent with the Series' written investment objective
and policies.

(iii)	Implement the approved investment program by placing
orders for the purchase, sale and exchange of securities,
commodity interests (as defined in the Commodity
Exchange Act, as amended) and other financial
instruments  without prior consultation with the Manager
and without regard to the length of time the securities
and other financial instruments have been held, the
resulting rate of portfolio turnover or any tax
considerations, subject always to  (i) the provisions of
the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and (ii)
the requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same
shall be from time to time in effect.  The Sub-Advisor is
also authorized to provide instructions to the Fund's
custodian relating to such purchase, sale and exchange
of the Series' portfolio holdings.

(iv)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as reasonably
requested by the officers, in taking such steps as are
reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the
decisions of its Board of Directors, and any appropriate
committees of such Board, regarding the general
conduct of the investment business of the Series.

(v)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's
investment advisory services provided to the Series, its
compliance with the 1940 Act and the regulations
adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) thereunder and the Series' investment strategies
and restrictions as stated in the Fund's prospectus and
statement of additional information (together, the
Registration Statement), subject to receipt of such
additional information as may be required from the
Manager and provided in accordance with Section 11(d)
of this Agreement.

(vi)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such
times and in such detail as the Board of Directors may
reasonably deem appropriate in order to enable it to
determine that the investment policies, procedures and
approved investment program of the Series are being
observed.

(vii)	Upon request, provide reasonable assistance to the
Board of Directors or valuation committee of the Fund
with their determination of the fair value of certain
securities when reliable market quotations are not
readily available for purposes of calculating net asset
value in accordance with procedures and methods
established by the Board of Directors; it being agreed
that the Sub-Advisor shall have no responsibility for
determining the fair value of the Series' portfolio
holdings.

(viii)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment
and management facilities, including salaries of clerical
and other personnel required for it to execute its duties
faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including
bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment
necessary for the efficient conduct of its duties under this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties
agree that the Sub-Advisor shall not be responsible for
expenses related to the operation of the Fund, including,
without limitation, compensation of the Fund's officers or
directors, the Fund's brokerage commissions or taxes, or
the Fund's audit, accounting, administrative, transfer
agency, custody, legal, registration, or insurance
expenses.

(ix)	Open accounts with broker-dealers, futures commission
merchants, banks and other financial institutions
(collectively broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to
effect all transactions for the Series, place all necessary
orders with broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated
broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if
applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law,
purchase or sell orders for the Series may be
aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell
orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event
allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as
the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by
the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor
considers to be the most equitable and consistent with
its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients
of the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates over time.  The
Manager recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure
may limit the size of the position that may be acquired or
sold for the Series and that aggregation of orders may
not result in more favorable pricing or lower brokerage
commissions in all instances. At the Manager's request,
the Sub-Advisor will provide the Manager with the
information required pursuant to Rule 31a-1(b)(9) of the
1940 Act.   The Sub-Advisor will effect transactions with
those broker-dealers which it believes provide favorable
net prices and are capable of providing efficient
executions, taking into consideration, among other
things, order size, difficulty of execution, the operational
capabilities, facilities and financial condition of the
broker-dealer involved, whether that broker-dealer has
risked its own capital in positioning a block of securities
or other assets, and the prior experience of the broker-
dealer in effecting transactions of the relevant types. The
Sub-Advisor's primary objective will be to obtain best
execution with respect to all transactions for the Series.
However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers-dealers
on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or
other services or products to the Sub-Advisor or its
affiliates. To the extent consistent with applicable law,
the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount
of commission for effecting a securities transaction in
excess of the amount of commission or dealer spread
another broker-dealer would have charged for effecting
that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good
faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in
relation to the value of the brokerage and research
products and/or services provided by such broker-
dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage
and research products and/or services, may be viewed
in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall
responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates
have with respect to the Series and other accounts over
which they exercise investment discretion. Not all such
services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in
managing the Series. In addition, joint repurchase or
other accounts may not be utilized by the Series except
to the extent permitted under any exemptive order
obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions
of such order are complied with.

(x)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to
the Series as are required of an investment adviser of a
registered investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act
and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended
(the Investment Advisers Act), and the rules
thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with
such periodic and special reports as the Fund or
Manager may reasonably request.  In compliance with
the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the
Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it
maintains for the Series are the property of the Fund,
agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule
31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains
for the Fund and that are required to be maintained by
Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to
surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it
maintains for the Series upon request by the Fund or the
Manager. The Sub-Advisor may retain copies of any
such records; provided, however, the Sub-Advisor is
responsible for maintaining Fund records only insofar as
is directly related to the services the Sub-Advisor
provides to the Series.

(xi)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act
and the Sub-Advisor's code of ethics (the Code of"
"18819","Ethics) adopted pursuant to Rule 17j-1 as the same
may be amended from time to time.  The Manager
acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-Advisor's current
Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to
the Manager a copy of any material amendment to the
Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics.

(xii)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may
request, furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio
transactions and reports on investments held by the
Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the Fund
may reasonably request.  The Sub-Advisor will make
available its personnel to meet with the Fund's Board of
Directors at the Fund's principal place of business on
reasonable prior notice to review the investments of the
Series.

(xiii)	Provide such additional information in the possession of
the Sub-Advisor or its affiliates related to the Sub-
Advisor's management of the Series that may be
reasonably required for the Fund or the Manager to
comply with their respective obligations under applicable
laws, including, without limitation, the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act,
the Investment Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the Securities Act), and any state
securities laws, and any rule or regulation thereunder.
Sub-Advisor will advise Manager of any changes in Sub-
Advisor's Senior Management (i.e. Chief Investment
Officer and/or Chief Executive Officer) within a
reasonable time after any such change.  Manager
acknowledges receipt of Sub-Advisor's Form ADV more
than 48 hours prior to the execution of this Agreement.

(xiv)	Vote proxies, exercise conversion or subscription rights,
and respond to tender offers and other corporate actions
relating to the Series' portfolio holdings in the manner in
which the Sub-Advisor believes to be in the best
interests of the Series and in accordance with the Sub-
Advisor's policies and procedures then in effect. The
Sub-Advisor's obligations in the previous sentence
extend only to the proxies or other materials that it
actually receives and are contingent upon its timely
receipt of such materials from the Manager.  The
Manager shall cause to be forwarded to Sub-Advisor all
proxy solicitation materials that it receives and shall
assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to conduct the proxy
voting process.  The parties agree that Sub-Advisor shall
not be responsible for the management, administration
or enforcement of any legal claims that any Series may
have, such as those related to class action lawsuits or
bankruptcies, but Sub-Advisor will provide reasonable
assistance with those matters to the Series or the
Manager if requested to do so.

(xv) The Sub-Advisor shall not be obligated to perform any
service not described in this Agreement, and shall not be
deemed by virtue of this Agreement to have made any
representation or warranty that any level of investment
performance or level of investment results will be
achieved


    3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-
Advisor will not consult with any other investment advisory firm
that provides investment advisory services to any investment
company sponsored by Principal Life Insurance Company
regarding transactions for the Fund in securities or other assets;
provided that, this Section shall not prohibit the Sub-Advisor from
obtaining or using research services provided by such firms. The
Manager agrees to provide a list of such other investment
advisory firms to the Sub-Advisor, such list to be promptly
updated by the Manager upon any changes thereto.

    4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations
assumed by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the
Fund, the Manager shall pay the compensation specified in
Appendix A to this Agreement.

    5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its partners, members,
directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable
to the Manager, the Board of Directors, the Fund or its
shareholders for any claim, expense or other loss suffered by the
Manager or the Fund resulting from: (i) any error of judgment,
mistake of law, or any other act or omission made by the Sub-
Advisor in the good faith exercise of the Sub-Advisor's duties
under this Agreement; (ii) any acts or omissions of the Manager
or any other sub-advisor or service provider to the Fund; or (iii)
acts of the Sub-Advisor which result from or are based upon acts
of the Manager or any other service provider to the Fund, except
to the extent such losses result from the willful misfeasance, bad
faith or gross negligence of, or from reckless disregard of, the
duties of the Sub-Advisor or any of its partners, members,
directors, officers, employees, agents (excluding any broker-
dealer selected by the Sub-Advisor), or affiliates.

The Manager shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sub-Advisor
(including its partners, members, directors, officers, employees,
agents and affiliates) from and against any and all claims,
losses, liabilities or damages (including reasonable attorney's
fees and other related expenses) resulting from: (i) the
Manager's or its affiliates' willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence in connection with the performance of the Manager's
obligations under this Agreement; (ii) the Manager's or its
affiliates' violation of applicable law or reckless disregard of the
Manager's obligations and duties under this Agreement; (iii) any
acts or omissions of the Manager, its affiliates or any other
service provider to the Fund with respect to the Fund or its
shareholders; or (iv) any untrue statement of a material fact
contained in, or any omission of a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein not
misleading in the Fund's registration statement, proxy materials
or reports filed with the SEC, unless and to the extent such
untrue statement of a material fact or omission was made in
reliance upon, and is consistent with, information furnished in
writing to the Manager by the Sub-Advisor for use therein;
provided, however, that the Manager's obligation under this
Section shall be reduced to the extent that the claim against, or
the loss, liability or damage experienced by the Sub-Advisor, is
caused by or is otherwise directly related to the Sub-Advisor's
own willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence, or to the
reckless disregard of its duties under this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, federal securities laws and
certain state laws impose liabilities under certain circumstances
on persons who have acted in good faith, and therefore nothing
herein shall in any way constitute a waiver or limitation of any
rights which a party may have under any federal securities law or
state law.

      6.   Trade Errors

The Sub-Advisor will notify the Manager of any Trade Error(s),
regardless of materiality, promptly upon the discovery such

or its shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or the
Fund resulting from Trade Errors. Any gains which occur due to
a Trade Error shall be retained by the Fund. For purposes under

erroneous orders by the Sub-Advisor for the Series that result in
the purchase or sale of securities that were not intended to be
purchased or sold; (ii) erroneous orders by the Sub-Advisor that
result in the purchase or sale of securities for the Series in an
unintended amount or price; or (iii) purchases or sales of
financial instruments which violate the investment limitations or
restrictions disclosed in  the Registration Statement and/or
imposed by  applicable law or regulation (calculated at the Sub-
Advisor's portfolio level), unless otherwise agreed to in writing.

    7.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other
persons affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third
parties to better enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations
under this Agreement for the provision of certain personnel and
facilities to the Sub-Advisor, subject to written notification to and
approval of the Manager and, where required by applicable law,
the Board of Directors.

The services of the Sub-Advisor to the Manager and the Fund
are not to be deemed exclusive and it shall be free to render
similar services to others so long as its services hereunder are
not impaired thereby.  It is specifically understood that directors,
officers and employees of the Sub-Advisor and of its affiliates
may continue to engage in providing portfolio management
services and advice to other investment advisory clients.  The
Manager agrees that Sub-Advisor may give advice and take
action in the performance of its duties with respect to any of its
other clients which may differ from advice given or the timing or
nature of action taken with respect to the Fund.  Nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to require Sub-Advisor, its
principals, affiliates, agents or employees to purchase or sell for
the Fund any security which it or they may purchase or sell for its

such approval.

If the Board of Directors or the shareholders of a Series fail to
approve the Agreement or any continuance of the Agreement in
accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Sub-
Advisor will continue to act as Sub-Advisor with respect to the
Series pending the required approval of the Agreement or its

manager or Sub-Advisor or other definitive action; provided, that
the compensation received by the Sub-Advisor in respect to the

by the Sub-Advisor, or the Manager or by vote of a majority of

the Fund;

(b)	The  Fund's  registration  statement  and  financial  statements
as  filed  with  the  Securities  and Exchange Commission (the
SEC);

(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures  or instructions  adopted or approved  by
the  Board of  Directors of the  Fund relating to obligations and
services to be provided by the Sub-Advisor.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms
and conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment  of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement,
the Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the
services described in Section 2 below for investment and
reinvestment of such portion of the assets of each Series as may
be allocated to the Sub-Advisor by the Manager, from time to
time (the Allocated Assets), subject to the control and direction
of the Manager and the Fund's Board of Directors, for the period
and on the terms hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor accepts
such appointment and agrees to furnish the services hereinafter
set forth for the compensation herein provided. The Sub-Advisor
shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an independent
contractor and shall, except as expressly provided or authorized,
have no authority to act for or represent the Fund or the Manager
in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or the
Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

The Sub-Advisor will:

(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not
limited to research, advice and supervision for the Allocated
Assets of each Series.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval
(or any appropriate committee of such Board), and revise
from time to time as conditions require, a recommended
investment program for each Series consistent with each
Series' respective investment objective(s) and policies and
any specific criteria applicable to the Allocated Assets.

(c)	Implement the approved investment program for the
Allocated Assets by placing orders for the purchase and
sale of securities without prior consultation with the
Manager and without regard to the length of time the
securities have been held, the resulting rate of portfolio
turnover or any tax considerations, subject always to the
provisions of the Fund's registration  statement, Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws and the requirements of the 1940
Act, as each of the same shall be from time to time in effect.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by
the officers, in taking such steps as are necessary or
appropriate to carry out the decisions of its Board of
Directors, and any appropriate committees of such Board,
regarding the general conduct of the investment business of
each Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment
advisory services provided to the Allocated Assets,
compliance with the 1940 Act and the regulations adopted
by the SEC thereunder and the Series' investment
strategies and restrictions as stated in the Fund's
prospectus and statement of additional information and any
specific criteria applicable to the Allocated Assets.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times
and in such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably
deem appropriate in order to enable it to determine that the
investment policies, procedures and approved investment
program of each Series (and any specific criteria applicable
to the Allocated Assets) are being observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide assistance and recommendations for
the determination of the fair value of certain securities when
reliable market quotations are not readily available for
purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance with
procedures and methods established by the Fund's Board
of Directors.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment
and management facilities, including salaries of clerical and
other personnel required for it to execute its duties faithfully,
and (ii) administrative facilities, including bookkeeping,
clerical personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient
conduct of the investment advisory affairs of each Series.

(i)	Open accounts with Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
compliant broker-dealers and futures commission
merchants (broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect
all transactions for each Series, place all necessary orders
with broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated broker-
dealers), and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the
extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell
orders for each Series may be aggregated with
contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of other clients of
the Sub-Advisor. In such event, allocation of securities so
sold or purchased, as well as the expenses incurred in the
transaction, will be made by the Sub-Advisor in the manner
the Sub-Advisor considers to be the most equitable and
consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to
other clients. The Sub-Advisor will report on such
allocations at the request of the Manager, the Fund or the
Fund's Board of Directors providing such information as the
number of aggregated trades to which each Series was a
party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades were
directed and the basis for the allocation for the aggregated
trades. The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain
execution of transactions for each Series at prices which
are advantageous to the Series and at commission rates
that are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.
However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on
the basis that they provide brokerage, research or other
services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent
consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a
broker or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a
securities transaction in excess of the amount of
commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer
would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-
Advisor determines in good faith that such amount of
commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the
brokerage and research products and/or services provided
by such broker or dealer. This determination, with respect to
brokerage and research products and/or services, may be
viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the
overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its
affiliates have with respect to each Series as well as to
accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.
Not all such services or products need be used by the Sub-
Advisor in managing the Allocated Assets. In addition, joint
repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized by the
Series except to the extent permitted under any exemptive
order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all
conditions of such order are complied with.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the
Allocated Assets as are required of an investment advisor of
a registered investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act
and Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the
Advisers Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the
Fund and the Manager with such periodic and special
reports as the Fund or the Manager may reasonably
request. In compliance with the requirements of  Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act , the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all
records that it maintains for each Series are the property of
the Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by
Rule 31a- 2 under the 1940 Act any records that it
maintains for the Series and that are required to be
maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further
agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it
maintains for a Series upon request by the Fund or the
Manager. The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility for the
maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is directly
related to the services the Sub-Advisor provides to a Series.

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act
and the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to
that Rule as the same may be amended from time to time.
The Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Sub-
Advisor's current Code of Ethics. The Sub-Advisor shall
promptly forward to the Manager a copy of any material
amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics along with
certification that the Sub-Advisor has implemented
procedures for administering the Sub-Advisor's Code of
Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request,
furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio transactions
and reports on investments held by a Series, all in such
detail as the Manager or the Fund may reasonably request.
The Sub-Advisor will make available its officers and
employees to meet with the Fund's Board of Directors at the
Fund's principal place of business on due notice to review
the investments of a Series.

(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a
sub-advisor, or as may be required or reasonably requested
by the Manager, for the Fund or the Manager to comply with
their respective obligations under applicable laws, including,
without limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act),
and any state securities laws, and any rule or regulation
thereunder. Such information includes, but is not limited to:
the Sub-Advisor's compliance manual and policies and
procedures adopted to comply with Rule 206(4)-7 of the
Advisers Act; the Sub-Advisor's most recent annual
compliance report or a detailed summary of such report;
timely and complete responses to all Quarterly Compliance
Questionnaires (including the identification of any material
compliance maters and a copy of any material changes to
the Sub-Advisor's Rule 206(4)-7 compliance policies and
procedures, marked to show changes along with a written
summary of the purpose of each such change); Annual
Proxy Voting Questionnaires; Annual Best Execution and
Soft Dollar Questionnaires, and responses to all other
requests from the Manager.  The Sub-Advisor agrees to
make available for the Manager's review all deficiency
letters issued by the SEC together with all responses given
by Sub-Advisor to such letters. The Sub-Advisor will advise
the Manager of any material changes in the Sub-Advisor's
ownership within a reasonable time after any such change.

(n)	Vote proxies received on behalf of each Series (with respect
to the portion thereof allocated to the Sub-Advisor) in a
manner consistent with the Sub-Advisor's proxy voting
policies and procedures and provide a record of votes cast
containing all of the voting information required by Form N-
PX in an electronic format to enable the Series to file Form
N-PX as required by SEC rule.

(o)	Respond to tender offers, rights offerings and other
voluntary corporate action requests affecting securities held
by each Series (with respect to the portion thereof allocated
to the Sub- Advisor).  For the avoidance of doubt, the Sub-
Advisor is not responsible for the filing of claims in class
action litigation involving securities held in the Fund or
formerly held in the Fund but will provide investment related
advice relating to such litigation when requested by the
Manager in writing.

(p)	Cooperate with the Manager in its performance of quarterly
and annual tax compliance tests to monitor the Series'
compliance with Subchapter M of the Code and Section
817(h) of the Code. If it is determined by the Manager or its
tax advisors that the Series is not in compliance with the
requirements imposed by the Code, the Sub-Advisor, in
consultation with the Manager and its tax advisors, will take
prompt action to bring the Series back into compliance with
the time permitted under the Code.

3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-
Advisor will not consult with any other investment advisory firm
that provides investment advisory services to any investment
company sponsored by Principal Life Insurance Company
regarding transactions for the Fund in securities or other assets.

4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations
assumed by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the
Allocated Assets, the Manager shall pay the compensation
specified in Appendix A to this Agreement.

5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers,
employees , agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager,
the Fund or its shareholders for any loss suffered by the
Manager or the Fund resulting from any error of judgment made
in the good faith exercise of the Sub-Advisor's investment
discretion in connection with selecting investments for a Series
or as a result of the failure by the Manager or any of its affiliates
to comply with the terms of this Agreement, except for losses
resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence
of, or from reckless disregard of, the duties of the Sub-Advisor or
any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, or affiliates.

6.	Trade Errors

The Sub-Advisor will notify the Manager of any Trade Error(s),
regardless of materiality, promptly upon the discovery such
Trade Error(s) by the Sub-Advisor. Notwithstanding Section 5,
the Sub- Advisor shall be liable to the Manager, the Fund or its
shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or the Fund
resulting from Trade Errors due to negligence, misfeasance, or
disregard of duties of the Sub Advisor or any of its directors,
officers, employees, agents (excluding any broker- dealer
selected by the Sub-Advisor), or affiliates. For purposes under
this Section 6, Trade Errors are defined as errors due to (i)
erroneous orders by the Sub-Advisor for the Series that result in
the purchase or sale of securities that were not intended to be
purchased or sold; (ii) erroneous orders by the Sub-Advisor that
result in the purchase or sale of securities for the Series in an
unintended amount or price; or (iii) purchases or sales of
financial  instruments which violate  the investment limitations or
restrictions disclosed in the Fund's registration statement and/or
imposed by applicable law or regulation (calculated at the Sub-
Advisor's portfolio level), unless otherwise agreed to in writing.

7.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other
persons affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third
parties to better  enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations
under this Agreement for the provision of certain personnel and
facilities to the Sub- Advisor, subject to written notification to and
approval of the Manager and, where required by applicable law,
the Board of Directors of the Fund; provided, however, that entry
into any such arrangements shall not relieve the Sub-Advisor of
any of its obligations under this Agreement.

8.	Regulation

The Sub-Advisor shall submit to all regulatory and administrative
bodies having jurisdiction over the services provided pursuant to
this Agreement any information, reports or other material which
any such body may request or require pursuant to applicable
laws and regulations.

9.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement

as of the corresponding date set forth on Appendix B to this
Agreement, as may be amended from time to time, and, unless

any continuance of the Agreement in accordance with the
requirements of the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor will continue to act
as Sub-Advisor with respect to the Allocated Assets of such
Series pending the required approval of the Agreement or its
continuance or of any contract with the Sub-Advisor or a different
manager or sub-advisor or other definitive action; provided, that
the compensation received by the Sub-Advisor in respect to the
Allocated Assets of such Series during such period is in
compliance with Rule 15a-4 under the 1940 Act.

any time without the payment of any penalty by the Board of
Directors of the Fund or by the Sub-Advisor , the Manager or by

Series on sixty days written notice. This Agreement shall
automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. In

contained in Section 2(a) of the 1940 Act (particularly the
definitions of interested person, assignment, voting security
and majority of the outstanding voting securities) shall be
applied.

issued thereunder, by vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Series (as defined in the
1940 Act) and by vote of a majority of the Board of Directors of
the Fund who are not interested persons (as defined in the 1940
Act) of the Manager, the Sub-Advisor, Principal Life Insurance

required by the 1940 Act and the amendment of Appendices A
and B hereto.

certain advisory activities with respect to the Series so long as Sub-

omissions;
	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and
the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as
follows:
1.	Appointment of Sub-Sub-Advisor
The Sub-Advisor hereby appoints the Sub-Sub-Advisor,
consistent with the terms of this Agreement and Sub-
Advisory Agreement, to act as a discretionary investment
manager with respect to such portion of the assets of the

require, a recommended investment program for
each Series consistent with each Series' respective
investment objective(s) and policies and any
specific criteria applicable to the Allocated Assets.
(c)	Implement the approved investment program for the
Allocated Assets by placing orders for the purchase
and sale of securities without prior consultation with
the Manager and without regard to the length of time
the securities have been held, the resulting rate of
portfolio turnover or any tax considerations, subject
always to the provisions of the Fund's registration
statement, Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and
the requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the
same shall be from time to time in effect.
(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as
requested by the officers, in taking such steps as are
reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the
decisions of its Board of Directors, and any
appropriate committees of such Board, regarding the
general conduct of the investment business of each
Series.
(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Sub-Advisor's
investment advisory services provided to the
Allocated Assets, compliance with the 1940 Act and
the regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder and
the Series' investment strategies and restrictions as
stated in the Fund's prospectus and statement of
additional information, subject to receipt of such
additional information as may be required from the
Manager and provided in accordance with Section
12(d) of this Agreement and any specific criteria
applicable to the Allocated Assets.
(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such
times and in such detail as the Board of Directors
may reasonably deem appropriate in order to enable
it to determine that the investment policies,
procedures and approved investment program of
each Series (and any specific criteria applicable to
the Allocated Assets) are being observed.
(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the
determination of the fair value of certain securities
when reliable market quotations are not readily
available for purposes of calculating net asset value
in accordance with procedures and methods
established by the Fund's Board of Directors.
(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary
investment and management facilities, including
salaries of clerical and other personnel required for it
to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii) administrative
facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical personnel
and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of
the investment advisory affairs of each Series.
(i)	Open accounts with Foreign Account Tax Compliance
Act compliant broker-dealers and futures commission
merchants (broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to
effect all transactions for each Series, place all
necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers
(including affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate
commissions, if applicable. To the extent consistent
with applicable law and permitted by the FCA Rules,
purchase or sell orders for each Series may be
aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell
orders of other clients of the Sub-Sub-Advisor. In
such event allocation of securities so sold or
purchased, as well as the expenses incurred in the
transaction, will be made by the Sub-Sub-Advisor in
the manner the Sub-Sub-Advisor considers to be the
most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Fund and to other clients. The Sub-
Sub-Advisor will report on such allocations at the
request of the Manager, the Fund or the Fund's
Board of Directors providing such information as the
number of aggregated trades to which each Series
was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades
were directed and the basis for the allocation for the
aggregated trades. The Sub-Sub-Advisor shall use its
best efforts to obtain execution of transactions for
each Series at prices which are advantageous to the
Series and at commission rates that are reasonable
in relation to the benefits received. However, the Sub-
Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the
basis that they provide brokerage, research or other
services or products to the Sub-Sub-Advisor. To the
extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Sub-
Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of
commission for effecting a securities transaction in
excess of the amount of commission or dealer spread
another broker or dealer would have charged for
effecting that transaction if the Sub-Sub-Advisor
determines in good faith that such amount of
commission is reasonable in relation to the value of
the brokerage and research products and/or services
provided by such broker or dealer. This
determination, with respect to brokerage and
research products and/or services, may be viewed in
terms of either that particular transaction or the
overall responsibilities which the Sub-Sub-Advisor
and its affiliates have with respect to each Series as
well as to accounts over which they exercise
investment discretion. Not all such services or
products need be used by the Sub-Sub-Advisor in
managing the Allocated Assets. In addition, joint
repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized by
the Series except to the extent permitted under any
exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Sub-Advisor
provided that all conditions of such order are
complied with.
(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect
to the Allocated Assets as are required of an
investment advisor of a registered investment
company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers"
"18825","Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund
and the Manager with such periodic and special
reports as the Fund or the Manager may reasonably
request. In compliance with the requirements of Rule
31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Sub-Advisor
hereby agrees that all records that it maintains for
each Series are the property of the Fund, agrees to
preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2
under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains for
the Series and that are required to be maintained by
Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to
surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it
maintains for a Series upon request by the Fund or
the Manager. The Sub-Sub-Advisor has no
responsibility for the maintenance of Fund records
except insofar as is directly related to the services the
Sub-Sub-Advisor provides to the Allocated Assets of
a Series.
(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the
1940 Act and the Sub-Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics
adopted pursuant to that Rule as the same may be
amended from time to time. The Manager
acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Sub-Sub-
Advisor's current Code of Ethics. The Sub-Sub-
Advisor shall promptly forward to the Sub-Advisor,
and Sub-Advisor shall forward to the Manager, a
copy of any material amendment to the Sub-Sub-
Advisor's Code of Ethics along with certification
that the Sub-Sub-Advisor has implemented
procedures for administering the Sub-Sub-
Advisor's Code of Ethics.
(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may
request, furnish the requesting party reports on
portfolio transactions and reports on investments held
by a Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the
Fund may reasonably request. The Sub-Sub-Advisor
will make available its officers and employees to meet
with the Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's
principal place of business on due notice to review
the investments of the Allocated Assets of a Series.
(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided
by an investment advisor, or as may be required or
reasonably requested by the Manager, for the Fund
or the Manager to comply with their respective
obligations under applicable laws, including, without
limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Advisers
Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and
any rule or regulation thereunder.  Such information
includes, but is not limited to:  the Sub-Sub-Advisor's
compliance manual and policies and procedures
adopted to comply with Rule 206(4)-7 of the Advisers
Act (to the extent such compliance manual and
policies and procedures differ from those of the Sub-
Advisor); the Sub-Sub-Advisor's most recent annual
compliance report or a detailed summary of such
report; timely and complete responses to all Quarterly
Compliance Questionnaires (including the
identification of any material compliance matters and
a copy of any material changes to the Sub-Sub-
Advisor's Rule 206(4)-7 compliance policies and
procedures, along with a written summary of of each
such change); Annual Proxy Voting Questionnaires;
Annual Best Execution and Soft Dollar
Questionnaires, and responses to all other requests
from the Manager.  The Sub-Advisor or the Sub-Sub-
Advisor agrees to advise the Manager of any material
deficiencies issued by the SEC, as well as any
remedial activities.  The Sub-Advisor or the Sub-Sub-
Advisor will advise the Manager of any material
changes in the Sub-Sub-Advisor's ownership within a
reasonable time after any such change.
(n)	Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies
received on behalf of each Series (with respect to the
Allocated Assets) in a manner consistent with the
Sub-Sub-Advisor's proxy voting policies and
procedures and provide a record of votes cast
containing all of the voting information required by
Form N-PX in an electronic format to enable the
Series to file Form N-PX as required by SEC rule.
Sub-Advisor shall cause to be forwarded to Sub-Sub-
Advisor all proxy solicitation materials that it receives
and shall assist Sub-Sub-Advisor in its efforts to
conduct the proxy voting process.
(o)	Respond to tender offers, rights offerings and other
voluntary corporate action requests affecting
securities held by each Series (with respect to the
portion thereof allocated to the Sub-Sub-Advisor).
(p)	Cooperate with the Manager in its performance of
quarterly and annual tax compliance tests to monitor
the Series' compliance with Subchapter M of the
Code.  It is acknowledged that the Sub-Sub-Advisor
does not act as the tax advisor for the Series.  If it is
determined by the Manager or its tax advisors that
the Series is not in compliance with the requirements
imposed by the Code, the Sub-Sub-Advisor, in
consultation with the Manager and its tax advisors,
will take prompt action to bring the Series back into
compliance with the time permitted under the Code.

3.	Prohibited Conduct
(a)	In providing the services described in this agreement,
the Sub-Sub-Advisor will not consult with any other
investment advisory firm that provides investment advisory
services to any investment company sponsored by Principal
Financial Group, Inc. regarding transactions for the Fund in
securities or other assets.

(b)	The Sub-Advisor acknowledges that the Sub-Sub-
Advisor does not hold client money and/or safe custody"
"18826","assets for the Sub-Advisor under the Client Asset Rules (the
CASS Rules) of the FCA.

4.	Compensation
As full compensation for all services rendered and
obligations assumed by the Sub-Sub-Advisor hereunder
with respect to the Allocated Assets, the Sub-Advisor
agrees to pay to Sub-Sub-Advisor and Sub-Sub-Advisor
agrees to accept as full compensation for all services
rendered by Sub-Sub-Advisor as such a fee, computed
daily and payable monthly, as agreed to between Sub-Sub-
Advisor and Sub-Advisor from time to time.
5.	Liability of Sub-Sub-Advisor
Neither the Sub-Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers,
employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager,
the Fund or its shareholders for any loss suffered by the Sub-
Advisor, Manager or the Fund resulting from any error of
judgment made in the good faith exercise of the Sub-
Sub-Advisor's investment discretion in connection with
selecting investments for a Series or as a result of the failure
by the Manager or any of its affiliates to comply with the
terms of this Agreement, except for losses resulting from
willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of, or from
reckless disregard of, the duties of the Sub-Sub-Advisor or
any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, or affiliates.

6.	Trade Errors
The Sub-Advisor or the Sub-Sub-Advisor will notify the
Manager of any Trade Error(s), regardless of materiality,
promptly upon the discovery such Trade Error(s) by the Sub-
Sub-Advisor.

7.	Supplemental Arrangements
The Sub-Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with
other persons affiliated with the Sub-Sub-Advisor or with
unaffiliated third parties to better enable the Sub-Sub-Advisor
to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement for the provision
of certain personnel and facilities to the Sub-Sub-Advisor,
subject to written notification to and approval of the Manager
and, where required by applicable law, the Board of Directors
of the Fund; provided, however, that entry into any such
arrangements shall not relieve the Sub-Sub-Advisor of any of
its obligations under this Agreement.

8.	Regulation
The Sub-Sub-Advisor shall submit to all regulatory and
administrative bodies having jurisdiction over the services
provided pursuant to this Agreement any information, reports
or other material which any such body may request or require

receives notice of any action, suit, proceeding,

regulator, the Sub-Sub-Advisor becomes aware
of any material pending or threatened action, suit,
proceeding, inquiry or investigation that is

"18918","all transactions for the Series, place all necessary orders with"
"18919","broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated broker-dealers),"
"18920","and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the extent"
"18921","consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders for the"
"18922","Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or"
"18923","sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event"
"18924","allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as the"
"18925","expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the"
"18926","Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be"
"18927","the most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations"
"18928","to the Fund and to other clients.  The Manager recognizes"
"18929","that, in some cases, this procedure may limit the size of the"
"18930","position that may be acquired or sold for the Series.  The Sub-"
"18931","Advisor will report on such allocations at the request of the"
"18932","Manager, the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors providing"
"18933","such information as the number of aggregated trades to which"
"18934","the Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such"
"18935","trades were directed and the basis for the allocation for the"
"18936","aggregated trades.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts"
"18937","to obtain execution of transactions for the Series at prices"
"18938","which are advantageous to the Series and at commission"
"18939","rates that are reasonable in relation to the benefits received."
"18940","However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on"
"18941","the basis that they provide brokerage, research or other"
"18942","services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent"
"18943","consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a"
"18944","broker or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a"
"18945","securities transaction in excess of the amount of commission"
"18946","or dealer spread another broker or dealer would have charged"
"18947","for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in"
"18948","good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in"
"18949","relation to the value of the brokerage and research products"
"18950","and/or services provided by such broker or dealer. This"
"18951","determination, with respect to brokerage and research"
"18952","products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either"
"18953","that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which"
"18954","the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to the"
"18955","Series as well as to accounts over which they exercise"
"18956","investment discretion. Not all such services or products need"
"18957","be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the Series. In"

"18959","utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under any"

"19439","faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including"
"19440","bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment"
"19441","necessary for the efficient conduct of its investment"
"19442","advisory services to the Allocated Assets."
"19443","(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures"
"19444","commission merchants (broker-dealers), select broker-"
"19445","dealers to effect all transactions for each Series, place all"
"19446","necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers"
"19447","(including affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate"
"19448","commissions, if applicable. The Sub-Advisor may only"
"19449","open and maintain accounts with broker-dealers, futures"
"19450","commission merchants, banks and/or other financial"
"19451","institutions that the Sub-Advisor believes, through"
"19452","commercially reasonable efforts, are Foreign Account Tax"
"19453","Compliance Act (FATCA) compliant. Such commercially"
"19454","reasonable efforts shall include obtaining a signed IRS"
"19455","Form W-9 or W-8 from any investment counterparty"
"19456","selected by the Sub- Advisor for Fund investment"
"19457","transactions. To the extent consistent with applicable law,"
"19458","purchase or sell orders for each Series may be"
"19459","aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell"
"19460","orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event"
"19461","allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as"
"19462","the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by"
"19463","the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers"
"19464","to be the most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary"
"19465","obligations to the Fund and to other clients. The Sub-"
"19466","Advisor will report on such allocations at the request of"
"19467","the Manager, the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors"
"19468","providing such information as the number of aggregated"
"19469","trades to which each Series was a party, the broker-"
"19470","dealers to whom such trades were directed and the basis"
"19471","for the allocation for the aggregated trades. The Sub-"
"19472","Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain execution of"
"19473","transactions for each Series at prices which are"
"19474","advantageous to the Series and at commission rates that"
"19475","are reasonable in relation to the benefits received."
"19476","However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers"
"19477","on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or"
"19478","other services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the"
"19479","extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor"
"19480","may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission for"
"19481","effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount"
"19482","of commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer"
"19483","would have charged for effecting that transaction if the"
"19484","Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that such amount of"
"19485","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"19486","brokerage and research products and/or services"
"19487","provided by such broker or dealer. This determination,"
"19488","with respect to brokerage and research products and/or"
"19489","services, may be viewed in terms of either that particular"
"19490","transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-"
"19491","Advisor and its affiliates have with"
"19492","respect to each Series as well as to accounts over which"
"19493","they exercise investment discretion. Not all such services or"
"19494","products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the"
"19495","Allocated Assets. In addition, joint repurchase or other"
"19496","accounts may not be utilized by the Series except to the"
"19497","extent permitted under any exemptive order obtained by the"
"19498","Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions of such order are"
"19499","complied with."

"19512","any records that it maintains for the Series and that are"
"19513","required to be maintained by the Sub-Advisor under Rule"
"19514","31a-1(f) under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to"
"19515","surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it"
"19516","maintains for a Series upon request by the Fund or the"
"19517","Manager (but may keep copies thereof only if it is required"
"19518","by law). The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility for the"
"19519","maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is directly"
"19520","related to the services the Sub-Advisor provides to a"
"19521","Series."
"19522","(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act"

"19537","employees to meet with the Fund's Board of Directors at"

"19570","will advise the Manager of any material changes in the Sub-"

"19573","(n)	Vote proxies received on behalf of each Series (with"

"19584","and annual tax compliance tests to monitor the Series'"
"19585","compliance with Subchapter M of the Code and Section"

"19587","tax advisors that the Series is not in compliance with the"
"19588","requirements imposed by the Code, the Sub-Advisor will be"
"19589","informed by the Manager and, in consultation with the"
"19590","Manager and its tax advisors, will take prompt action to"
"19591","bring the Series back into compliance within the time"
"19592","permitted under the Code."
"19593","3.	Prohibited Conduct"
"19594","In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-"
"19595","Advisor will not consult with any other investment advisory firm"
"19596","that provides investment advisory services to any investment"
"19597","company sponsored by Principal Life Insurance Company"
"19598","regarding transactions for the Fund in securities or other assets."
"19599","4.	Compensation"
"19600","As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations"

"19605","Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers,"
"19606","employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager, a"
"19607","Series, the Fund or its shareholders for any loss suffered by the"
"19608","Manager, Series or the Fund resulting from any error of"
"19609","judgment made in the good faith exercise of the Sub-Advisor's"
"19610","investment discretion in connection with selecting investments"
"19611","for a Series or resulting from the failure by the Manager or any"
"19612","of its affiliates to comply with the terms of this Agreement,"
"19613","except for losses resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or"
"19614","gross negligence of, or from reckless disregard of, the duties of"
"19615","the Sub-Advisor or any of its directors, officers, employees,"
"19616","agents, or affiliates. The parties acknowledge and agree that"
"19617","broker- dealers selected by the Sub-Advisor are not agents of"
"19618","the Sub-Advisor hereunder. The U.S. securities laws impose"
"19619","liabilities under certain circumstances on persons who act in"
"19620","good faith and, therefore, nothing in this Agreement shall in any"
"19621","way constitute a waiver or limitation of any rights that the"
"19622","Manager, a Series or the Fund may have under any U.S."
"19623","securities laws."
"19624","6.	Trade Errors"
"19625","The Sub-Advisor will notify the Manager of any Trade Error(s),"
"19626","regardless of materiality, promptly upon the discovery such"
"19627","Trade Error(s) by the Sub-Advisor. Notwithstanding Section 5,"
"19628","the Sub-Advisor shall be liable to the Manager, the Fund or its"
"19629","shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or the Fund"
"19630","resulting from Trade Errors due to negligence, misfeasance, or"
"19631","disregard of duties of the Sub Advisor or any of its directors,"
"19632","officers, employees, agents (excluding any broker-dealer"
"19633","selected by the Sub-Advisor), or affiliates. For purposes under"
"19634","this Section 6, Trade Errors are defined as errors due to (i)"
"19635","erroneous orders by the Sub- Advisor for the Series that result"
"19636","in the purchase or sale of securities that were not intended to"
"19637","be purchased or sold; (ii) erroneous orders by the Sub-Advisor"
"19638","that result in the purchase or sale of securities for the Series in"
"19639","an unintended amount or price; or (iii) purchases or sales of"
"19640","financial instruments which violate the investment limitations or"
"19641","restrictions disclosed in the Fund's registration statement and/or"
"19642","imposed by applicable law or regulation (calculated at the"
"19643","Allocated Assets level), unless otherwise agreed to in writing."
"19644","7.	Supplemental Arrangements"
"19645","The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other"
"19646","persons affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third"
"19647","parties to delegate the Sub-Advisor's obligations under this"
"19648","Agreement for the provision of certain personnel and back"
"19649","office, reconciliation or compliance services, subject to written"
"19650","notification"
"19651","to and approval of the Manager and, where required by"
"19652","applicable law, the Board of Directors of the Fund; provided,"
"19653","however, that entry into any such arrangements shall not relieve"
"19654","the Sub-Advisor of any of its obligations under this Agreement."
"19655","8.	Regulation"
"19656","The Sub-Advisor shall submit to all regulatory and"
"19657","administrative bodies having jurisdiction over the services"
"19658","provided pursuant to this Agreement any information, reports or"
"19659","other material which any such body may properly request or"
"19660","require pursuant to applicable laws and regulations."
"19661","9.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement"
"19662","This Agreement shall become effective with respect to a Series"

"19664","Agreement, as may be amended from time to time, and, unless"
"19665","otherwise terminated with respect to such Series, shall continue"

"19674","Company, the Sub-Advisor or the Fund cast in person at a"
"19675","meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval."
"19676","If the shareholders of a Series fail to approve the Agreement or"
"19677","any continuance of the Agreement in accordance with the"
"19678","requirements of the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor will continue to"
"19679","act as Sub-Advisor with respect to the Allocated Assets of such"
"19680","Series pending the required approval of the Agreement or its"
"19681","continuance or of any contract with the Sub-Advisor or a"
"19682","different manager or sub-advisor or other definitive action;"
"19683","provided, that the compensation received by the Sub-Advisor in"
"19684","respect to the Allocated Assets of such Series during such"
"19685","period is in compliance with Rule 15a-4 under the 1940 Act."
"19686","This Agreement may be terminated with respect to a Series at"

"20273","Advisor determines in good faith that such amount of"
"20274","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"20275","brokerage and research products and/or services provided"
"20276","by such broker or dealer. This determination, with respect to"
"20277","brokerage and research products and/or services, may be"

"20301","over a period of time on a fair and equitable basis relative to"

"20832","purchase or sell orders of other clients of the Sub-"
"20833","Advisor. In such event allocation of securities so sold"

"20850","Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the basis"

"20852","services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent"
"20853","consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may"
"20854","pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission for"

"20859","faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in"
"20860","relation to the value of the brokerage and research"
"20861","products and/or services provided by such broker or"
"20862","dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage"
"20863","and research products and/or services, may be"
"20864","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or"
"20865","the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and"
"20866","its affiliates have with respect to each Series as well"
"20867","as to accounts over which they exercise investment"
"20868","discretion. Not all such services or products need be"
"20869","used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the Allocated"
"20870","Assets. In addition, joint repurchase or other"
"20871","accounts may not be utilized by the Series except to"
"20872","the extent permitted under any exemptive order"
"20873","obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all"
"20874","conditions of such order are complied with."
"20875","(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect"
"20876","to the Allocated Assets as are required of an"

"20893","for the maintenance of Fund records except insofar"
"20894","as is directly related to the services the Sub-Advisor"
"20895","provides to a Series."
"20896","(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the"

"21214","Firm"
"21215","The Shareholders and Board of"
"21216","Directors"
"21217","Principal Funds, Inc."
"21218","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"21219","of each of the Principal Funds, Inc. listed in Exhibit A attached"
"21220","hereto (the Funds) as of and for the period ended October 31,"
"21221","2017, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"21222","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"21223","Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"21224","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"21225","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"21226","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"21227","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"21228","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"21229","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"21230","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"21231","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"21232","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"21233","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"21234","related costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"21235","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"21236","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"21237","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"21238","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"21239","company's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"21240","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"21241","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"21242","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"21243","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"21244","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"21245","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that"
"21246","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"21247","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"21248","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"21249","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"21250","disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect"
"21251","on the financial statements."
"21252","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"21253","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"21254","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"21255","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"21256","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"21257","deteriorate."
"21258","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"21259","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"21260","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"21261","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"21262","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"21263","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"21264","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"21265","the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"21266","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"21267","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"21268","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"21269","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"21270","internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"21271","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"21272","(United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"21273","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"21274","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"21275","be a material weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2017."
"21276","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"21277","management and the Board of Directors of the Funds and the"
"21278","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"21279","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"21584","Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that such amount of"
"21585","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the"

"21590","transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-"
"21591","Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to each Series"
"21592","as well as to accounts over which they exercise"
"21593","investment discretion. Not all such services or products"

"22716","LargeCap Growth Fund II and Blue Chip Fund"
"22717","   The Board of Directors of Principal Funds, Inc., a Maryland"
"22718","corporation (the Fund), deems it advisable that the Blue Chip Fund"
"22719","series of the Fund (BLC) acquire all of the assets of the LargeCap"
"22720","Growth Fund II series of the Fund (LCGII), in exchange for the"
"22721","assumption by BLC of all of the liabilities of LCGII and for shares"
"22722","issued by BLC which are thereafter to be distributed by LCGII pro"
"22723","rata to its shareholders in complete liquidation and termination of"
"22724","LCGII and in exchange for all of LCGII's outstanding shares."
"22725","   LCGII will transfer to BLC, and BLC will acquire from LCGII, all of"
"22726","the assets of LCGII on the Closing Date and will assume from LCGII"
"22727","all of the liabilities of LCGII in exchange for the issuance of the"
"22728","number of shares of BLC determined as provided in the following"
"22729","paragraphs, which shares will be subsequently distributed pro rata to"
"22730","the shareholders of LCGII in complete liquidation and termination of"
"22731","LCGII and in exchange for all of LCGII's outstanding shares.  LCGII"
"22732","will not issue, sell or transfer any of its shares after the Closing Date,"
"22733","and only redemption requests received by LCGII in proper form prior"
"22734","to the Closing Date shall be fulfilled by LCGII.  Redemption requests"
"22735","received by LCGII thereafter will be treated as requests for"
"22736","redemption of those shares of BLC allocable to the shareholder in"
"22737","question."
"22738","   LCGII will declare, and BLC may declare, to its shareholders of"
"22739","record on or prior to the Closing Date a dividend or dividends which,"
"22740","together with all previous such dividends, shall have the effect of"
"22741","distributing to its shareholders all of its income (computed without"
"22742","regard to any deduction for dividends paid) and all of its net realized"
"22743","capital gains, if any, as of the Closing Date."
"22744","   On the Closing Date, BLC will issue to LCGII a number of full and"
"22745","fractional shares of BLC, taken at their then net asset value, having"
"22746","an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate value of the net"
"22747","assets of LCGII.  The aggregate value of the net assets of LCGII and"
"22748","BLC shall be determined in accordance with the then current"
"22749","Prospectus of BLC as of close of regularly scheduled trading on the"
"22750","New York Stock Exchange on the Closing Date."
"22751","   The closing of the transactions contemplated in this Plan (the"
"22752","Closing) shall be held at the offices of Principal Global Investors,"
"22753","LLC, 711 High Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50392 at 3:00 p.m. Central"
"22754","Time on September 20, 2017, or on such other date as fund"
"22755","management may determine. The date on which the Closing is to be"
"22756","held as provided in this Plan shall be known as the Closing Date."
"22757","   In the event that on the Closing Date (a) the New York Stock"
"22758","Exchange is closed for other than customary weekend and holiday"
"22759","closings or (b) trading on said Exchange is restricted or (c) an"
"22760","emergency exists as a result of which it is not reasonably practicable"
"22761","for BLC or LCGII to fairly determine the value of its assets, the"
"22762","Closing Date shall be postponed until the first business day after the"
"22763","day on which trading shall have been fully resumed."
"22764","   As soon as practicable after the Closing, LCGII shall (a) distribute"
"22765","on a pro rata basis to the shareholders of record of LCGII at the close"
"22766","of business on the Closing Date the shares of BLC received by LCGII"
"22767","at the Closing in exchange for all of LCGII's outstanding shares, and"
"22768","(b) be liquidated in accordance with applicable law and the Fund's"
"22769","Articles of Incorporation."
"22770","   For purposes of the distribution of shares of BLC to shareholders"
"22771","of LCGII, BLC shall credit its books an appropriate number its shares"
"22772","to the account of each shareholder of LCGII. No certificates will be"
"22773","issued for shares of BLC. After the Closing Date and until"
"22774","surrendered, each outstanding certificate, if any, which, prior to the"
"22775","Closing Date, represented shares of LCGII, shall be deemed for all"
"22776","purposes of the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to"
"22777","evidence the appropriate number of shares of BLC to be credited on"
"22778","the books of BLC in respect of such shares of LCGII as provided"
"22779","above."
"22780","   LCGII will, within a reasonable period of time before the Closing"
"22781","Date, furnish BLC with a list of LCGII's portfolio securities and other"
"22782","investments. BLC will, within a reasonable period of time before the"
"22783","Closing Date, identify the securities, if any, on LCGII's list referred to"
"22784","in the foregoing sentence that BLC wishes to receive from LCGII and"
"22785","otherwise how BLC wishes LCGII's portfolio to be repositioned prior"
"22786","to the Closing in accordance with BLC's investment objective, policies"
"22787","and strategies.  LCGII, if requested by BLC, will reposition its portfolio"
"22788","as directed by BLC prior to the Closing. In addition, if it is determined"
"22789","that the portfolios of LCGII and BLC, when aggregated, would contain"
"22790","investments exceeding certain percentage limitations applicable to"
"22791","BLC with respect to such investments, LCGII, if requested by BLC,"
"22792","will dispose of a sufficient amount of such investments as may be"
"22793","necessary to avoid violating such limitations as of the Closing."
"22794","Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein will require LCGII to"
"22795","dispose of or purchase any investments or securities if, in the"
"22796","reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors or Principal Global"
"22797","Investors, LLC, the investment adviser to LCGII and BLC, such"
"22798","disposition would adversely affect the status of the transactions"
"22799","contemplated in this Plan as a reorganization, as such term is used"
"22800","in Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,"
"22801","or would otherwise not be in the best interests of LCGII."
"22802","   Prior to the Closing Date, LCGII shall deliver to BLC a list setting"
"22803","forth the assets to be assigned, delivered and transferred to BLC,"
"22804","including the securities then owned by LCGII and the respective"
"22805","federal income tax bases (on an identified cost basis) thereof, and the"
"22806","liabilities to be assumed by BLC pursuant to this Plan."
"22807","   All of LCGII's portfolio securities shall be delivered by LCGII's"
"22808","custodian on the Closing Date to BLC or its custodian, either"
"22809","endorsed in proper form for transfer in such condition as to constitute"
"22810","good delivery thereof in accordance with the practice of brokers or, if"
"22811","such securities are held in a securities depository within the meaning"
"22812","of Rule 17f-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, transferred"
"22813","to an account in the name of BLC or its custodian with said"
"22814","depository. All cash to be delivered pursuant to this Plan shall be"
"22815","transferred from LCGII's account at its custodian to BLC's account at"
"22816","its custodian. If on the Closing Date LCGII is unable to make good"
"22817","delivery to BLC's custodian of any of LCGII's portfolio securities"
"22818","because such securities have not yet been delivered to LCGII's"
"22819","custodian by its brokers or by the transfer agent for such securities,"
"22820","then the delivery requirement with respect to such securities shall be"
"22821","waived, and LCGII shall deliver to BLC's custodian on or by said"
"22822","Closing Date with respect to said undelivered securities executed"
"22823","copies of an agreement of assignment in a form satisfactory to BLC,"
"22824","and a due bill or due bills in form and substance satisfactory to the"
"22825","custodian, together with such other documents including brokers'"
"22826","confirmations, as may be reasonably required by BLC."
"22827","   This Plan may be abandoned and terminated, whether before or"
"22828","after action thereon by the shareholders of LCGII and notwithstanding"
"22829","favorable action by such shareholders, if the Board of Directors"
"22830","believe that the consummation of the transactions contemplated"
"22831","hereunder would not be in the best interests of the shareholders of"
"22832","either fund. This Plan may be amended by the Board of Directors at"
"22833","any time, except that after approval by the shareholders of LCGII no"
"22834","amendment may be made with respect to the Plan which in the"
"22835","opinion of the Board of Directors materially adversely affects the"
"22836","interests of the shareholders of LCGII."
"22837","   Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Plan, LCGII will"
"22838","pay or cause to be paid all out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred"
"22839","in connection with the transactions contemplated under this Plan,"
"22840","including, but not limited to, accountants' fees, legal fees, registration"

"23147","dealer spread another broker or dealer would have"
"23148","charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor"
"23149","determines in good faith that such amount of commission is"
"23150","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"23151","research products and/or services provided by such"
"23152","broker or dealer. This determination, with respect to"
"23153","brokerage and research products and/or services, may be"

"23155","overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its"
"23156","affiliates have with respect to the Series as well as to"
"23157","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion."

"24756","between PRINCIPAL GLOBAL INVESTORS, LLC, a Delaware limited"
"24757","liability company (hereinafter called the Manager), and W.H. REAVES &"
"24758","CO., INC., a Delaware Corporation (hereinafter called the Sub-Advisor).
W I T N E S S E T H:

	WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to
each Series of Principal  Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end
management investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act); and
	WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to render
discretionary investment advisory services for all or a portion of the assets
of each Series of the Fund identified in Appendix A, as may be amended
from time to time (hereinafter called Series), which the Manager has
agreed to provide to the Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to furnish such
services; and
	WHEREAS, the Manager and the Sub-Advisor agree to amend and
restate the Amended and Restated Sub-Advisory Agreement between the
Manager (having assumed the rights and obligation of Principal
Management Corporation) and the Sub-Advisor dated Jan 1, 2014 with this
Agreement; and
	WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies
properly certified or authenticated of each of the following and will promptly
provide the Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or authenticated of
any amendment or supplement thereto:

 	(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement) with the
Fund;
 	(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC);
 	(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;
(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the
Board of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and services
to be provided by the Sub-Advisor.
	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms
and conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:
1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the
Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the services
described in Section 2 below for investment and reinvestment of
such portion of the assets of each Series as may be allocated to
the Sub-Advisor by the Manager, from time to time (the Allocated"
"24759","Assets), subject to the control and direction of the Manager and
the Fund's Board of Directors, for the period and on the terms
hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor accepts such appointment
and agrees to furnish the services hereinafter set forth for the
compensation herein provided. The Sub-Advisor shall for all
purposes herein be deemed to be an independent contractor and
shall, except as expressly provided or authorized, have no authority
to act for or represent the Fund or the Manager in any way or
otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

		The Sub-Advisor will:
(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited
to research, advice and supervision for the Allocated Assets of
each Series.
(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval (or
any appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from
time to time as conditions require, a recommended
investment program for each Series consistent with each
Series' respective investment objective(s) and policies and
any specific criteria applicable to the Allocated Assets.
(c)	Implement the approved investment program for the Allocated
Assets by placing orders for the purchase and sale of
securities without prior consultation with the Manager and
without regard to the length of time the securities have been
held, the resulting rate of portfolio turnover or any tax
considerations, subject always to the provisions of the Fund's
registration statement, Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws,
and the requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same
shall be from time to time in effect.
(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the
officers, in taking such steps as are necessary or appropriate
to carry out the decisions of its Board of Directors, and any
appropriate committees of such Board, regarding the general
conduct of the investment business of each Series.
(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment
advisory services provided to the Allocated Assets,
compliance with the 1940 Act and the regulations adopted by
the SEC thereunder and the Series' investment strategies and
restrictions as stated in the Fund's prospectus and statement
of additional information and any specific criteria applicable to
the Allocated Assets.
(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and
in such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem
appropriate in order to enable it to determine that the
investment policies, procedures and approved investment
program of each Series (and any specific criteria applicable to
the Allocated Assets) are being observed.
(g)	Upon request, provide assistance and recommendations for
the determination of the fair value of certain securities when
reliable market quotations are not readily available for
purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance with
procedures and methods established by the Fund's Board of
Directors.
(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and
management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other
personnel required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii)
administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical
personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct
of the investment advisory affairs of each Series.
(i)	Open accounts with Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
compliant broker-dealers and futures commission merchants
(broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all
transactions for each Series, place all necessary orders with
broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated broker-dealers),
and negotiate commissions, if applicable.  To the extent
consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders for
each Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous
purchase or sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In
such event allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as
well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made
by the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers
to be the most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Fund and to other clients.  The Sub-Advisor
will report on such allocations at the request of the Manager,
the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors providing such
information as the number of aggregated trades to which each
Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades
were directed and the basis for the allocation for the
aggregated trades.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts
to obtain execution of transactions for each Series at prices
which are advantageous to the Series and at commission
rates that are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.
However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on
the basis that they provide brokerage, research or other
services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent
consistent
with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or
dealer an amount of commission for effecting a securities
transaction in excess of the amount of commission or dealer
spread another broker or dealer would have charged for
effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in
good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in
relation to the value of the brokerage and research products
and/or services provided by such broker or dealer. This
determination, with respect to brokerage and research
products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either
that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which
the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to each
Series as well as to accounts over which they exercise
investment discretion. Not all such services or products need
be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the Allocated Assets.
In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be
utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under any
exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all
conditions of such order are complied with.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the
Allocated Assets as are required of an investment advisor of a
registered investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act and
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers"
"24760","Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the
Manager with such periodic and special reports as the Fund
or the Manager may reasonably request.  In compliance with
the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-
Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it maintains for
each Series are the property of the Fund, agrees to preserve
for the periods described by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act
any records that it maintains for the Series and that are
required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act,
and further agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any
records that it maintains for a Series upon request by the
Fund or the Manager. The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility
for the maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is
directly related to the services the Sub-Advisor provides to a
Series.

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and
the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that
Rule as the same may be amended from time to time.  The
Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Sub-Advisor's
current Code of Ethics.  The Sub-Advisor shall promptly
forward to the Manager a copy of any material amendment to
the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics along with certification that
the Sub-Advisor has implemented procedures for
administering the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request,
furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio transactions
and reports on investments held by a Series, all in such detail
as the Manager or the Fund may reasonably request.  The
Sub-Advisor will make available its officers and employees to
meet with the Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's
principal place of business on due notice to review the
investments of a Series.

(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-
advisor, or as may be required or reasonably requested by the
Manager, for the Fund or the Manager to comply with their
respective obligations under applicable laws, including,
without limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and
any state securities laws, and any rule or regulation
thereunder. Such information includes, but is not limited to:
the Sub-Advisor's compliance manual and policies and
procedures adopted to comply with Rule 206(4)-7 of the
Advisers Act; the Sub-Advisor's most recent annual
compliance report or a detailed summary of such report;
timely and complete responses to all Quarterly Compliance
Questionnaires (including the identification of any material
compliance maters and a copy of any material changes to the
Sub-Advisor's Rule 206(4)-7 compliance policies and
procedures, marked to show changes along with a written
summary of the purpose of each such change); Annual Proxy
Voting Questionnaires; Annual Best Execution and Soft Dollar
Questionnaires, and responses to all other requests from the
Manager.  The Sub-Advisor agrees to make available for the
Manager's review all deficiency letters issued by the SEC
together with all responses given by Sub-Advisor to such
letters.  The Sub-Advisor will advise the Manager of any
material changes in the Sub-Advisor's ownership within a
reasonable time after any such change.

(n)	Vote proxies received on behalf of each Series (with respect
to the portion thereof allocated to the Sub-Advisor) in a
manner consistent with the Sub-Advisor's proxy voting
policies and procedures and provide a record of votes cast
containing all of the voting information required by Form N-PX
in an electronic format to enable the Series to file Form N-PX
as required by SEC rule.

(o)	Respond to tender offers, rights offerings and other voluntary
corporate action requests affecting securities held by each
Series (with respect to the portion thereof allocated to the
Sub-Advisor).

    (p)	Cooperate with the Manager in its performance of quarterly and
annual tax compliance tests to monitor the Series' compliance with
Subchapter M of the Code and Section 817(h) of the Code.  If it is
determined by the Manager or its tax advisors that the Series is not in
compliance with the requirements imposed by the Code, the Sub-Advisor, in
consultation with the Manager and its tax advisors, will take prompt action
to bring the Series back into compliance with the time permitted under the
Code.
    3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-
Advisor will not consult with any other investment advisory firm that
provides investment advisory services to any investment company
sponsored by Principal Life Insurance Company regarding
transactions for the Fund in securities or other assets.

    4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations
assumed by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the
Allocated Assets, the Manager shall pay the compensation
specified in Appendix A to this Agreement.

    5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers,
employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager, the
Fund or its shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or
the Fund resulting from any error of judgment made in the good
faith exercise of the Sub-Advisor's investment discretion in
connection with selecting investments for a Series or as a result of
the failure by the Manager or any of its affiliates to comply with the
terms of this Agreement, except for losses resulting from willful
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of, or from reckless
disregard of, the duties of the Sub-Advisor or any of its directors,
officers, employees, agents, or affiliates.

    6.	Trade Errors

Sub-Advisor will notify the Manager of any Trade Error(s),
regardless of materiality, promptly upon the discovery such Trade
Error(s) by the Sub-Advisor. Notwithstanding Section 5, the Sub-
Advisor shall be liable to the Manager, the Fund or its shareholders
for any loss suffered by the Manager or the Fund resulting from
Trade Errors due to negligence, misfeasance, or disregard of duties
of the Sub Advisor or any of its directors, officers, employees,
agents (excluding any broker-dealer selected by the Sub-Advisor),
or affiliates. For purposes under this Section 6, Trade Errors are
defined as errors due to (i) erroneous orders by the Sub-Advisor for
the Series that result in the purchase or sale of securities that were
not intended to be purchased or sold; (ii) erroneous orders by the
Sub-Advisor that result in the purchase or sale of securities for the
Series in an unintended amount or price; or (iii) purchases or sales
of financial instruments which violate the investment limitations or
restrictions disclosed in the Fund's registration statement and/or
imposed by  applicable law or regulation (calculated at the Sub-
Advisor's portfolio level), unless otherwise agreed to in writing.

    7.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other persons
affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third parties to
better enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations under this
Agreement for the provision of certain personnel and facilities to the
Sub- Advisor, subject to written notification to and approval of the
Manager and, where required by applicable law, the Board of
Directors of the Fund; provided, however, that entry into any such
arrangements shall not relieve the Sub-Advisor of any of its
obligations under this Agreement.

    8.	Regulation

The Sub-Advisor shall submit to all regulatory and administrative
bodies having jurisdiction over the services provided pursuant to
this Agreement any information, reports or other material which any
such body may request or require pursuant to applicable laws and
regulations.

    9.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement

This Agreement shall become effective with respect to a Series as
of the corresponding date set forth on Appendix B to this
Agreement, as may be amended from time to time, and, unless
otherwise terminated with respect to such Series, shall continue in
effect thereafter for the initial term set forth on Appendix B to this
Agreement, and thereafter from year to year provided that in each
case the continuance is specifically approved within the period
required by the 1940 Act either by the Board of Directors of the
Fund or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities
of the Series and in either event by a vote of a majority of the Board
of Directors of the Fund who are not interested persons of the
Manager, Principal Life Insurance Company, the Sub-Advisor or the
Fund cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on
such approval.

If the shareholders of a Series fail to approve the Agreement or any
continuance of the Agreement in accordance with the requirements
of the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor will continue to act as Sub-Advisor
with respect to the Allocated Assets of such Series pending the
required approval of the Agreement or its continuance or of any
contract with the Sub-Advisor or a different manager or sub-advisor
or other definitive action; provided, that the compensation received
by the Sub-Advisor in respect to the Allocated Assets of such
Series during such period is in compliance with Rule 15a-4 under
the 1940 Act.

This Agreement may be terminated with respect to a Series at any
time without the payment of any penalty by the Board of Directors
of the Fund or by the Sub-Advisor, the Manager or by vote of a
majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Series on sixty
days written notice. This Agreement shall automatically terminate in
the event of its assignment. In interpreting the provisions of this
Section 8, the definitions contained in Section 2(a) of the 1940 Act
(particularly the definitions of interested person, assignment,
voting security and majority of the outstanding voting securities)
shall be applied.

    10.	Amendment of this Agreement

No amendment of this Agreement shall be effective unless in
writing and signed by both parties. No material amendment of this
Agreement shall be effective until approved, if required by the 1940
Act or the rules, regulations, interpretations or orders issued
thereunder, by vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
voting securities of the Series (as defined in the 1940 Act) and by
vote of a majority of the Board of Directors of the Fund who are not
interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Manager, the
Sub-Advisor, Principal Life Insurance Company or the Fund cast in
person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such
approval.
    11.	Additional Series

In the event the Manager wishes to appoint the Sub-Advisor to
perform the services described in this Agreement with respect to
one or more additional Series of the Fund after the effective date of
this Agreement, such Series will become a Series under this
Agreement upon approval of this
Agreement in the manner required by the 1940 Act and the
amendment of Appendices A and B hereto.

    12.	General Provisions

Management, 10 Exchange Place, 18th Floor, Jersey City, New

the occurrence of any of the following events:

registered as an investment advisor in order to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, at law

threatened action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation
that is reasonably likely to result in a conviction, order,
judgment or decree issued with respect to it or any affiliate

Advisor becoming ineligible to serve as an investment
adviser of a registered investment company under the
1940 Act.
(4)	the Sub-Advisor becomes aware of a transaction or series
of transactions that is reasonably likely to result in a

the Fund directs or is expected to direct portfolio securities
transactions, or any remuneration, to a broker or dealer in
consideration for the promotion or sale of Fund shares or
shares issued by any other registered investment company.

of Fund shares or shares issued by any other registered
investment company.

(f)	The Sub-Advisor agrees that neither it nor any of its affiliates

agreement of the parties.

Manager, from time to time (the Allocated Assets), subject
to the control and direction of the Manager and the Fund's
Board of Directors, for the period and on the terms
hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor accepts such
appointment and agrees to furnish the services hereinafter
set forth for the compensation herein provided. The
Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an
independent contractor and shall, except as expressly
provided or authorized, have no authority to act for or
represent the Fund or the Manager in any way or otherwise
be deemed an agent of the Fund or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the
Sub-Advisor
		The Sub-Advisor will:
(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not
limited to research, advice and supervision for the
Allocated Assets of each Series.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for
approval (or any appropriate committee of such Board),
and revise from time to time as conditions require, a
recommended investment program for each Series
consistent with each Series' respective investment
objective(s) and policies and any specific criteria
applicable to the Allocated Assets.

(c)	Implement the approved investment program for the
Allocated Assets by placing orders for the purchase and
sale of securities without prior consultation with the
Manager and without regard to the length of time the
securities have been held, the resulting rate of portfolio
turnover or any tax considerations, subject always to the
provisions of the Fund's registration statement, Articles
of Incorporation and Bylaws and the requirements of the
1940 Act, as each of the same shall be from time to time
in effect.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested
by the officers, in taking such steps as are necessary or
appropriate to carry out the decisions of its Board of
Directors, and any appropriate committees of such
Board, regarding the general conduct of the investment
business of each Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's
investment advisory services provided to the Allocated
Assets, compliance with the 1940 Act and the
regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder and the
Series' investment strategies and restrictions as stated
in the Fund's prospectus and statement of additional
information and any specific criteria applicable to the
Allocated Assets.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such
times and in such detail as the Board of Directors may
reasonably deem appropriate in order to enable it to
determine that the investment policies, procedures and
approved investment program of each Series (and any
specific criteria applicable to the Allocated Assets) are
being observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide assistance and recommendations
for the determination of the fair value of certain
securities when reliable market quotations are not
readily available for purposes of calculating net asset
value in accordance with procedures and methods
established by the Fund's Board of Directors.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment
and management facilities, including salaries of clerical
and other personnel required for it to execute its duties
faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including
bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment
necessary for the efficient conduct of the investment
advisory affairs of each Series.

(i)	Open accounts with Foreign Account Tax Compliance
Act compliant broker-dealers and futures commission
merchants (broker- dealers), select broker-dealers to
effect all transactions for each Series, place all
necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers
(including affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate
commissions, if applicable. To the extent consistent with
applicable law, purchase or sell orders for each Series
may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or
sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such
event allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as
well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be
made by the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor
considers to be the most equitable and consistent with
its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients.
The Sub-Advisor will report on such allocations at the
request of the Manager, the Fund or the Fund's Board of
Directors providing such information as the number of
aggregated trades to which each Series was a party, the
broker-dealers to whom such trades were directed and
the basis for the allocation for the aggregated trades.
The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain
execution of transactions for each Series at prices which
are advantageous to the Series and at commission rates
that are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.
However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers
on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or
other services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the
extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor
may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission
for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the
amount of commission or dealer spread another broker
or dealer would have charged for effecting that
transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith
that such amount of commission is reasonable in
relation to the value of the brokerage and research
products and/or services provided by such broker or
dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage
and research products and/or services, may be viewed
in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall
responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates
have with respect to each Series as well as to accounts
over which they exercise investment discretion. Not all
such services or products need be used by the Sub-
Advisor in managing the Allocated Assets.  In addition,
joint repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized
by the Series except to the extent permitted under any
exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided
that all conditions of such order are complied with.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to
the Allocated Assets as are required of an investment
advisor of a registered investment company pursuant to
the 1940 Act and Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended (the Advisers Act), and the rules thereunder,
and furnish the Fund and the Manager with such
periodic and special reports as the Fund or the Manager
may reasonably request.  In compliance with the
requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-
Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it maintains
for each Series are the property of the Fund, agrees to
preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2 under
the 1940 Act any records that it maintains for the Series
and that are required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1
under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to surrender
promptly to the Fund any records that it maintains for a
Series upon request by the Fund or the Manager.  The
Sub-Advisor has no responsibility for the maintenance of
Fund records except insofar as is directly related to the
services the Sub-Advisor provides to a Series.

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act
and the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant
to that Rule as the same may be amended from time to
time. The Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy of
the Sub-Advisor's current Code of Ethics. The Sub-
Advisor shall promptly forward to the Manager a copy of
any material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code of
Ethics along with certification that the Sub-Advisor has
implemented procedures for administering the Sub-
Advisor's Code of Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may
request, furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio
transactions and reports on investments held by a
Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the Fund
may reasonably request.  The Sub-Advisor will make
available its officers and employees to meet with the
Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's principal place
of business on due notice to review the investments of a
Series.

(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a
sub-advisor, or as may be required or reasonably
requested by the Manager, for the Fund or the Manager
to comply with their respective obligations under
applicable laws, including, without limitation, the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), the
1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the Securities Act), and any state
securities laws, and any rule or regulation thereunder.
Such information includes, but is not limited to:  the Sub-
Advisor's compliance manual and policies and
procedures adopted to comply with Rule 206(4)-7 of the
Advisers Act; the Sub-Advisor's most recent annual
compliance report or a detailed summary of such report;
timely and complete responses to all Quarterly
Compliance Questionnaires (including the identification
of any material compliance maters and a copy of any
material changes to the Sub-Advisor's Rule 206(4)-7
compliance policies and procedures, marked to show
changes along with a written summary of the purpose of
each such change); Annual Proxy Voting
Questionnaires; Annual Best Execution and Soft Dollar
Questionnaires, and responses to all other requests
from the Manager.  The Sub-Advisor agrees to make
available for the Manager's review all deficiency letters
issued by the SEC together with all responses given by
Sub-Advisor to such letters.  The Sub-Advisor will
advise the Manager of any material changes in the Sub-
Advisor's ownership within a reasonable time after any
such change.

(n)	Vote proxies received on behalf of each Series (with
respect to the portion thereof allocated to the Sub-
Advisor) in a manner consistent with the Sub-Advisor's
proxy voting policies and procedures and provide a
record of votes cast containing all of the voting
information required by Form N-PX in an electronic
format to enable the Series to file Form N-PX as
required by SEC rule.

(o)	Respond to tender offers, rights offerings and other
voluntary corporate action requests affecting securities
held by each Series (with respect to the portion thereof
allocated to the Sub-Advisor).

(p)	Cooperate with the Manager in its performance of
quarterly and annual tax compliance tests to monitor the
Series' compliance with Subchapter M of the Code and
Section 817(h) of the Code.  If it is determined by the
Manager or its tax advisors that the Series is not in
compliance with the requirements imposed by the Code,
the Sub-Advisor, in consultation with the Manager and
its tax advisors, will take prompt action to bring the
Series back into compliance with the time permitted
under the Code.

   3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the
Sub-Advisor will not consult with any other investment
advisory firm that provides investment advisory services to
any investment company sponsored by Principal Life
Insurance Company regarding transactions for the Fund in
securities or other assets.

   4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations
assumed by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the
Allocated Assets, the Manager shall pay the compensation
specified in Appendix A to this Agreement.

   5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers,
employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager,
the Fund or its shareholders for any loss suffered by the
Manager or the Fund resulting from any error of judgment
made in the good faith exercise of the Sub-Advisor's
investment discretion in connection with selecting
investments for a Series or as a result of the failure by the
Manager or any of its affiliates to comply with the terms of
this Agreement, except for losses resulting from willful
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of, or from
reckless disregard of, the duties of the Sub-Advisor or any of
its directors, officers, employees, agents, or affiliates.

   6.	Trade Errors

The Sub-Advisor will notify the Manager of any Trade
Error(s), regardless of materiality, promptly upon the
discovery such Trade Error(s) by the Sub-Advisor.
Notwithstanding Section 5, the Sub-Advisor shall be liable to
the Manager, the Fund or its shareholders for any loss
suffered by the Manager or the Fund resulting from Trade
Errors due to negligence, misfeasance, or disregard of duties
of the Sub Advisor or any of its directors, officers, employees,
agents (excluding any broker-dealer selected by the Sub-
Advisor), or affiliates. For purposes under this Section 6,
Trade Errors are defined as errors due to (i) erroneous
orders by the Sub-Advisor for the Series that result in the
purchase or sale of securities that were not intended to be
purchased or sold; (ii) erroneous orders by the Sub-Advisor
that result in the purchase or sale of securities for the Series
in an unintended amount or price; or (iii) purchases or sales
of financial instruments which violate the investment
limitations or restrictions disclosed in the Fund's registration
statement and/or imposed by  applicable law or regulation
(calculated at the Sub-Advisor's portfolio level), unless
otherwise agreed to in writing.

	7. 	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other
persons affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated
third parties to better enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement for the provision of certain
personnel and facilities to the Sub-Advisor, subject to written
notification to and approval of the Manager and, where
required by applicable law, the Board of Directors of the
Fund; provided, however, that entry into any such
arrangements shall not relieve the Sub-Advisor of any of its
obligations under this Agreement.

   8.	Regulation

The Sub-Advisor shall submit to all regulatory and
administrative bodies having jurisdiction over the services
provided pursuant to this Agreement any information, reports
or other material which any such body may request or require
pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.

   9.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement

This Agreement shall become effective with respect to a
Series as of the corresponding date set forth on Appendix B
to this Agreement, as may be amended from time to time,
and, unless otherwise terminated with respect to such Series,
shall continue in effect thereafter for the initial term set forth
on Appendix B to this Agreement, and thereafter from year to

specifically approved within the period required by the 1940
Act either by the Board of Directors of the Fund or by a vote

Directors of the Fund who are not interested persons of the

or the Fund cast in person at a meeting called for the
purpose of voting on such approval.

If the shareholders of a Series fail to approve the Agreement
or any continuance of the Agreement in accordance with the
requirements of the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor will continue
to act as Sub-Advisor with respect to the Allocated Assets of
such Series pending the required approval of the Agreement
or its continuance or of any contract with the Sub-Advisor or
a different manager or sub-advisor or other definitive action;
provided, that the compensation received by the Sub-Advisor
in respect to the Allocated Assets of such Series during such
period is in compliance with Rule 15a-4 under the 1940 Act.

This Agreement may be terminated with respect to a Series
at any time without the payment of any penalty by the Board
of Directors of the Fund or by the Sub-Advisor, the Manager
or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of
the Series on sixty days written notice. This Agreement shall
automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. In
interpreting the provisions of this Section 8, the definitions
contained in Section 2(a) of the 1940 Act (particularly the
definitions of interested person, assignment, voting"
"24761","security and majority of the outstanding voting securities)
shall be applied.

10.	Amendment of this Agreement

orders issued thereunder, by vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding voting securities of the Series (as defined
in the 1940 Act) and by vote of a majority of the Board of
Directors of the Fund who are not interested persons (as
defined in the 1940 Act) of the Manager, the Sub-Advisor,
Principal Life Insurance Company or the Fund cast in person
at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such
approval.

respect to one or more additional Series of the Fund after the
effective date of this Agreement, such Series will become a
Series under this Agreement upon approval of this
Agreement in the manner required by the 1940 Act and the
amendment of Appendices A and B hereto.

threatened action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and
investment adviser to each Fund of the Principal
Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end management
investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act);
and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-
Advisor to furnish it with portfolio selection and related
research and statistical services in connection with the
investment advisory services for each series identified in
Appendix A ( hereinafter called the Series), which the
Manager has agreed to provide to the Fund, and the
Sub-Advisor desires to furnish such services; and

WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-
Advisor with copies properly certified or authenticated
of each of the following and will promptly provide the
Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or
authenticated of any amendment or supplement thereto:

(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement)
with the Fund;
(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial
statements as filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission;
(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;
(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or
approved by the Board of Directors of the Fund
relating to obligations and services provided by the
Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises
and the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the
parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor
In accordance with and subject to the Management
Agreement, the Manager hereby appoints the Sub-
Advisor to perform the services described in
Section 2 below for investment and reinvestment of
such portion of the assets of each Series as
may be allocated to the Sub-Advisor by the
Manager, from time to time (the Allocated"
"26001","Assets), subject to the control and direction of the
Manager and the Fund's Board of Directors, for the
period and on the terms hereinafter set forth. The
Sub-Advisor accepts such appointment and agrees
to furnish the services hereinafter set forth for the
compensation herein provided. The Sub-Advisor
shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an
independent contractor and shall, except as
expressly provided or authorized, have no authority
to act for or represent the Fund or the Manager in
any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the
Fund or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and
Services to be
Provided by the Sub-
Advisor The Sub-
Advisor will:
(a)	Provide investment advisory services,
including but not limited to research, advice
and supervision for the Series.


(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for
approval (or any appropriate committee of such Board),
and revise from time to time as economic conditions
require, a recommended investment program for the
Fund consistent with the Series' investment objective and
policies.
(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing
orders for the purchase and sale of securities without
prior consultation with the Manager and without regard to
the length of time the securities have been held, the
resulting rate of portfolio turnover or any tax
considerations, subject always to the provisions of the
Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, the
requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same shall
be from time to time in effect.
(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested
by the officers, in taking such steps as are reasonably
necessary or appropriate to carry out the decisions of
its Board of Directors, and any appropriate committees
of such Board, regarding the general conduct of the
investment business of the Series.
(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment
advisory services provided to the Series, its compliance
with the 1940 Act and the regulations adopted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder and
the Series' investment strategies and restrictions as
stated in the Fund's prospectus and statement of
additional information, subject to receipt of such
additional information as may be required from the
Manager and provided in accordance with Section
11(d) of this Agreement. The Sub-Advisor has no
responsibility for the maintenance of Fund records except
insofar as is directly related to the services it provides to
the Series.
(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such
times and in such detail as the Board of Directors may
reasonably deem appropriate in order to enable it to
determine that the investment policies, procedures and
approved investment program of the Series are being
observed.
(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination
of the fair value of certain securities when reliable
market quotations are not readily available for purposes
of calculating net asset value in accordance with
procedures and methods established by the Fund's Board
of Directors.
(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment
and management facilities, including salaries of clerical
and other personnel required for it to execute its duties
faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including
bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment necessary
for the efficient conduct of its duties under this Agreement.
(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures
commission merchants (broker- dealers), select broker-
dealers to effect all transactions for the Series, place all
necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers
(including affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate
commissions, if applicable. To the extent consistent with
applicable law, purchase or sell orders for the Series
may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or
sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such
event allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as
well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be
made by the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor
considers to be the most equitable and consistent with
its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients.
The Manager recognizes that, in some cases, this
procedure may limit the size of the position that may be
acquired or sold for the Series. The Sub-Advisor will
report on such allocations at the request of the Manager,
the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors providing such
information as the number of aggregated trades to which
the Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such
trades were directed and the basis for the allocation for
the aggregated trades. The Sub-Advisor shall use its
best efforts to obtain execution of transactions for the
Series at prices which are


advantageous to the Series and at commission rates that
are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.
However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers
on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or
other services or products to the Sub- Advisor. To the
extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor
may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission
for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the
amount of commission or dealer spread another broker
or dealer would have charged for effecting that
transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith
that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation
to the value of the brokerage and research products
and/or services provided by such broker or dealer. This
determination, with respect to brokerage and research
products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of
either that particular transaction or the overall
responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates
have with respect to the Series as well as to accounts
over which they exercise investment discretion. Not all
such services or products need be used by the Sub-
Advisor in managing the Series. In addition, joint
repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized by the
Series except to the extent permitted under any
exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided
that all conditions of such order are complied with.
U) Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to
the Series as are required of an investment advisor of a
registered investment company pursuant to the 1940
Act and Investment Advisor's Act of 1940 (the
Investment Advisor's Act), and the rules thereunder,
and furnish the Fund and the Manager with such
periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager
may reasonably request. In compliance with the
requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-
Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it maintains for
the Series are the property of the Fund, agrees to
preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2 under
the 1940 Act any records that it maintains for the Fund
and that are required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1
under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to surrender
promptly to the Fund any records that it maintains for
the Series upon request by the Fund or the Manager.
(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 1?j-1 under the 1940 Act
and the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant
to that Rule as the same may be amended from time to
time. The Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy of
Sub-Advisor's current Code of Ethics. Sub-Advisor shall
promptly forward to the Manager a copy of any
material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics.
(I)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may
request, furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio
transactions and reports on investments held by the
Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the Fund
may reasonably request. The Sub- Advisor will make
available its officers and employees to meet with the
Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's principal place
of business on due notice to review the investments of
the Series.
(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by
a sub-advisor and may be required for the Fund or the
Manager to comply with their respective obligations under
applicable laws, including, without limitation, the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), the
1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act, the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and any state
securities laws, and any rule or regulation thereunder.
Sub-Advisor will advise Manager of any changes in
Sub- Advisor's general partners within a reasonable time
after any such change. Manager acknowledges receipt
of Sub-Advisor's Form ADV more than 48 hours prior
to the execution of this Agreement.
(n)	Perform quarterly and annual tax compliance tests to
monitor the Series' compliance with Subchapter M of the
Code and Section 817(h) of the Code, subject to receipt
of such additional information as may be required from
the Manager and provided in


accordance with Section 11(d) of this Agreement.
The Sub-Advisor shall notify the Manager
immediately upon having a reasonable basis for
believing that the Series has ceased to be in
compliance or that it might not be in compliance in
the future. If it is determined that the Series is not in
compliance with the requirements noted above, the
Sub-Advisor, in consultation with the Manager, will
take prompt action to bring the Series back into
compliance (to the extent possible) within the time
permitted under the Code.
(o)	Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies
solicited by, or with respect to, the issuers of
securities held in the Series. The Manager shall
cause to be forwarded to Sub-Advisor all proxy
solicitation materials that it receives and shall assist
Sub-Advisor in its efforts to conduct the proxy voting
process.

3.	Prohibited Conduct
In providing the services described in this agreement, the
Sub-Advisor will not consult with any other investment
advisory firm that provides investment advisory services to
any investment company sponsored by Principal Life
Insurance Company regarding transactions for the Fund in
securities or other assets.

4.	Compensation
As full compensation for all services rendered and
obligations assumed by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with
respect to the Fund, the Manager shall pay the
compensation specified in Appendix A to this Agreement.

5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor
Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers,
employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable to the
Manager, the Fund or its shareholders for any loss
suffered by the Manager or the Fund resulting from any
error of judgment made in the good faith exercise of the
Sub-Advisor's duties under this Agreement or as a result
of the failure by the Manager or any of its affiliates to
comply with the terms of this Agreement except for
losses resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence of, or from reckless disregard of, the duties of
the Sub-Advisor or any of its directors, officers, employees,
agents (excluding any broker-dealer selected by the Sub-
Advisor), or affiliates.

6.	Indemnification
The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Sub-Advisor from and against any and all claims, losses,
liabilities or damages (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and other related expenses), (Losses) howsoever arising,
from or in connection with this Agreement or the
performance by the Sub-Advisor of its duties hereunder,
so long as the Sub-Advisor shall, after receipt of notice of
any claim or commencement of any action, promptly notify
the Manager in writing of the claim or commencement of
such action. The Manager shall not be liable for any
settlement of any claim or action effected without its written
consent. Nothing contained herein shall require the
Manager to indemnify the Sub-Advisor for Losses resulting
from the Sub-Advisor's willful misfeasance, bad faith or
gross negligence in the performance of its duties or from
its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under
this Agreement.

7.	Supplemental Arrangements
The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other
persons affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated
third parties to better enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement for the provision of
certain personnel and facilities to the Sub- Advisor, subject
to written notification to and approval of the Manager
and, where required by applicable law, the Board of
Directors of the Fund.


8.	Regulation
The Sub-Advisor shall submit to all regulatory and
administrative bodies having jurisdiction over the services
provided pursuant to this Agreement any information,
reports or other material which any such body may
request or require pursuant to applicable laws and
regulations.

9.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement
No amendment of this Agreement shall be effective
unless in writing and signed by both parties. This
Agreement shall become effective with respect to a
Series as of the corresponding date set forth on Appendix
B to this Agreement, as may be amended from time to
time, and, unless otherwise terminated, shall continue in
effect for the initial term set forth on Appendix B to this
Agreement, and thereafter from year to year provided that
in each case the continuance is specifically approved
within the period required by the 1940 Act either by the
Board of Directors of the Fund or by a vote of a majority of
the outstanding voting securities of the Series and in
either event by a vote of a majority of the Board of
Directors of the Fund who are not interested persons of the
Manager, Principal Life Insurance Company, the Sub-
Advisor or the Fund cast in person at a meeting called for
the purpose of voting on such approval.

If the shareholders of a Series fail to approve the
Agreement or any continuance of the Agreement in
accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act, the
Sub-Advisor will continue to act as Sub-Advisor with
respect to the Allocated Assets of such Series pending the
required approval of the Agreement or its continuance or
of any contract with the Sub- Advisor or a different
manager or Sub-Advisor or other definitive action;
provided, that the compensation received by the Sub-
Advisor in respect to the Allocated Assets of such Series
during such period is in compliance with Rule 15a-4 under
the 1940 Act.

This Agreement may be terminated at any time without
the payment of any penalty by the Board of Directors of
the Fund or by the Sub-Advisor, the Manager or by vote of
a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Series
on sixty days written notice. This Agreement shall
automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. In
interpreting the provisions of this Section 9, the definitions
contained in Section 2(a) of the 1940 Act (particularly the
definitions of interested person, assignment and voting"
"26002","security) shall be applied.

effective until approved, if required by the 1940 Act or the
rules, regulations, interpretations or orders issued
thereunder, by vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Series and by vote of a
majority of the Board of Directors of the Fund who are
not interested persons of the Manager, the Sub-Advisor,
Principal Life Insurance Company or the Fund cast in
person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such
approval, and such amendment is signed by both parties.

execute such further documents as are necessary to
effectuate the purposes hereof. This Agreement shall
be construed and enforced in accordance with and
governed by the laws of the State of Iowa. The
captions in this Agreement are included for
convenience only and in no way define or delimit any
of the provisions hereof or otherwise affect their
construction or effect.

(b)	Any notice under this Agreement shall be in writing,
addressed and delivered or mailed postage pre-paid to

0200, and the address of the Sub-Advisor shall be
11 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10010.

(c)	The Sub-Advisor will promptly notify the Manager in
writing of the occurrence of any of the following
events:

Advisers Act or under the laws of any jurisdiction
in which the Sub-Advisor is required to be
registered as an investment advisor in order to
perform its obligations under this Agreement.

cash available for investment in the Series, and all

the Sub-Advisor to perform its duties and

direct portfolio securities transactions, or any
remuneration, to a broker or dealer in consideration

issued by any other registered investment company.
Sub-advisor further represents that it is contrary to

or shares issued by any other registered investment
company.

(f)	The Sub-Advisor agrees that neither it nor any of
its affiliates will in any way refer directly or indirectly

agreement of the parties.

that the Diversified Real Asset Fund series does not rely
on the exclusion from the definition of commodity pool"
"26003","operator under Section 4.5 of the General Regulations
under the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA).

The Sub-Advisor represents that it is a commodity trading
advisor duly registered with the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and is a member in good standing of

revocation or limitation of the Sub-Advisor's commodity
trading advisor registration or NFA membership, or (iii) the
institution of an action or proceeding that could lead to a
statutory disqualification under the CEA or an
investigation by any governmental agency or self-
regulatory organization of which the Sub-Advisor is
subject or has been advised it is a target.

"26119","well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be"
"26120","made by the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor"
"26121","considers to be the most equitable and consistent with its"
"26122","fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients. The"
"26123","Manager recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure"
"26124","may limit the size of the position that may be acquired or"
"26125","sold for the Series. The Sub-Advisor will report on such"
"26126","allocations at the request of the Manager, the Fund or the"
"26127","Fund's Board of Directors providing such information as the"

"26135","the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the basis"

"26139","an amount of commission for effecting a securities"
"26140","transaction in excess of the amount of commission or dealer"
"26141","spread another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"26142","effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in"
"26143","good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in"
"26144","relation to the value of the brokerage and research products"
"26145","and/or services provided by such broker or dealer. This"
"26146","determination, with respect to brokerage and research"
"26147","products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either"
"26148","that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities"
"26149","which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to"
"26150","each Series as well as to accounts over which they exercise"
"26151","investment discretion. Not all such services or products"
"26152","need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the Allocated"
"26153","Assets. In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may"
"26154","not be utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted"
