"429","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"430","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"431","Copley Fund, Inc."
"432","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Copley Fund,"
"433","Inc.  (the  Company)  as  of  and  for  the  year  ended February 28, 2014, in"
"434","accordance  with  the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"435","(United  States),  we  considered  the Company's internal control over financial"
"436","reporting,  including  controls  over  safeguarding  securities,  as a basis for"
"437","designing  our  auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"438","the  financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"439","not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on the effectiveness of the"
"440","Company's  internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"441","such opinion."
"442","The  management  of  the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"443","effective   internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  In  fulfilling  this"
"444","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"445","expected  benefits  and  related costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"446","over  financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"447","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"448","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"449","accounting  principles  (GAAP).  A  company's  internal  control  over financial"
"450","reporting  includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that  (1)  pertain to the"
"451","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"452","the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"453","reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as necessary to permit"
"454","preparation  of  financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"455","and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance with"
"456","authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the company; and (3) provide"
"457","reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"458","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material"
"459","effect on the financial statements."
"460","Because  of  its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"461","may  not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"462","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"463","inadequate  because  of  changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"464","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"465","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"466","or  operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"467","course   of   performing   their   assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"468","misstatements  on  a  timely  basis.  A  material  weakness  is a deficiency, or"
"469","combination  of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"470","that  there  is  a  reasonable  possibility  that a material misstatement of the"
"471","Company's  annual  or  interim  financial  statements  will  not be prevented or"
"472","detected on a timely basis."
"473","Our consideration of the Company's internal control over financial reporting was"
"474","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in  the  first  paragraph  and  would not"
"475","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"476","weaknesses   under  standards  established  by  the  Public  Company  Accounting"
"477","Oversight  Board  (United  States). However, we noted a material weakness in the"
"478","Company's internal control over financial reporting and its operation as defined"
"479","above  as  of  February  28, 2014. Certain expense accounts and related payables"
"480","were  not timely recorded, reviewed and reconciled by management. Management has"
"481","advised  that,  subsequent to February 28, 2014, it has taken corrective actions"
"482","by retaining Roy C. Hale, CPA (a member of the Board) to review the recording of"
"483","expense accounts and related payables no less frequently than monthly."
"484","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"485","Board  of  Directors  of  Copley  Fund,  Inc.  and  the  Securities and Exchange"
"486","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"487","these specified parties."
