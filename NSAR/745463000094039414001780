"7869","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"

"8147","such opinion."
"8148","The management of the Fund is responsible for"

"8154","A fund's internal control over financial reporting"

"8165","the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"8166","transactions are recorded as necessary to"

"8185","A deficiency in internal control over financial"

"9659","October 31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of"
"9660","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"9661","States), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"9662","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"9663","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"9664","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"9665","the financial statements and to comply with the"
"9666","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"9667","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"9668","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"

"9670","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"9671","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"9672","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"9673","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"9674","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"9675","controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"9676","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"9677","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"9678","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"9679","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"9680","principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"

"9682","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"9683","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"9684","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"9685","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"9686","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"

"9692","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"9693","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"9694","effect on the financial statements."
"9695","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"9696","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"9697","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"9698","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"9699","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"9700","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"9701","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"9702","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"9703","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"9704","allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"9705","of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
