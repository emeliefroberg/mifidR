"529","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"530","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"531","Gabelli Investor Funds, Inc."
"532","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"533","statements of The Gabelli ABC Fund, a series of Gabelli"
"534","Investor Funds, Inc., as of and for the year ended December"
"535","31, 2009, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"536","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"537","considered its internal control over financial reporting,"
"538","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"539","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"540","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"541","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"542","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"543","the Company's internal control over financial reporting."
"544","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"545","The management of Gabelli Investor Funds, Inc. is"
"546","responsible for establishing and maintaining effective"
"547","internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"548","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"549","are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"550","costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"551","financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"552","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"553","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"554","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"555","accounting principles. A company's internal control over"
"556","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"557","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"558","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"559","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"560","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"561","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"562","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"563","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"564","company are being made only in accordance with"
"565","authorizations of management and directors of the company;"
"566","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"567","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"568","disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"569","material effect on the financial statements."
"570","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"571","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"572","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"573","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"574","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"575","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"576","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"577","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"578","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"579","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"580","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"581","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"582","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"583","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"584","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"585","company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"586","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"587","Our consideration of Gabelli Investor Funds Inc. internal"
"588","control over financial reporting was for the limited"
"589","purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"590","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"591","that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"592","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"593","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"594","Gabelli Investor Funds Inc. internal control over financial"
"595","reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"596","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material"
"597","weakness as defined above as of December 31, 2009."
"598","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"599","of management and the Board of Directors of Gabelli"
"600","Investor Funds Inc. and the Securities and Exchange"
"601","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used"
"602","by anyone other than these specified parties."

"673","submit a signed waiver of notice which is filed with the records of"

"676","new record date for an adjourned meeting, or the adjournment is for"
"677","more than one hundred and twenty days after the original record"
"678","date, notice of such adjourned meeting need not be given if the"

"681","            Section 5. Quorum. At all meetings of the stockholders,"

"690","to time, without notice other than announcement thereat except as"
"691","otherwise required by these By-Laws, until the holders of the"
"692","requisite amount of shares of stock shall be so present. At any"

"711","            Section 6. Organization. At each meeting of the"
"712","stockholders, the Chairman of the Board (if one has been designated"

"715","the Chairman of the Board and the President, a Vice President,"
"716","shall act as chairman of the meeting. The Secretary, or in the"
"717","Secretary's absence or inability to act, any person appointed by"

"723","            Section 8. Voting. Pursuant to Article V, section (3)(m)"
"724","of the Corporation's Articles, stockholders shall be entitled to"

"730","the close of business on the day on which notice of the meeting is"
"731","mailed or (ii) the thirtieth day before the meeting."
"732","            Each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of"
"733","stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him"
"734","(i) by a proxy signed by such stockholder or his attorney-in-fact"
"735","or (ii) by transmitting any authorization by telegram, cablegram,"
"736","datagram, electronic mail, or any other legally permissible"
"737","electronic or telephonic means in accordance with the Corporation's"
"738","procedures. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven"
"739","months from the date thereof, unless otherwise provided in the"
"740","proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the"
"741","stockholder executing it, except in those cases where such proxy"
"742","states that it is irrevocable and where an irrevocable proxy is"
"743","permitted by law. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the 1940"
"744","Act, the 1940 Act Rules, the Articles or these By-Laws, any"
"745","corporate action to be taken by vote of the stockholders shall be"
"746","authorized by a majority of the total votes cast at a meeting of"
"747","stockholders by the holders of shares present in person or"
"748","represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such action."
"749","            If a vote shall be taken on any question other than the"
"750","election of directors, which shall be by written ballot, then"
"751","unless required by statute, the 1940 Act, the 1940 Act Rules or"
