"1336","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1337","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"1338","of Touchstone Dynamic Equity Fund, Touchstone Controlled"
"1339","Growth with Income Fund, Touchstone Dynamic Diversified"
"1340","Income Fund, and Touchstone Dynamic Global Allocation Fund"
"1341","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1342","statements of Touchstone Dynamic Equity Fund,  Touchstone"
"1343","Controlled Growth with Income Fund, Touchstone Dynamic"
"1344","Diversified Income Fund, and Touchstone Dynamic Global"
"1345","Allocation Fund (four of the funds constituting the"
"1346","Touchstone Strategic Trust) (the Trust) as of and for the"
"1347","year ended December 31, 2016, in accordance with the"
"1348","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1349","(United States), we considered the Trust's internal control"
"1350","over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1351","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1352","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1353","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1354","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1355","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's"
"1356","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"1357","express no such opinion."
"1358","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing"
"1359","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1360","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1361","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"1362","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"1363","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"1364","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1365","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1366","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"1367","with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's"
"1368","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1369","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1370","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1371","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1372","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"1373","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1374","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"1375","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"1376","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"1377","accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"1378","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1379","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1380","acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets"
"1381","that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1382","statements."
"1383","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1384","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1385","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1386","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"1387","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1388","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1389","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1390","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1391","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1392","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1393","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1394","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"1395","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1396","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1397","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1398","company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"1399","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1400","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over"
"1401","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"1402","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1403","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1404","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"1405","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1406","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trust's internal"

"1455","accordance  with  and  subject  to  the Investment Advisory"
"1456","Agreement between the Trust and the Advisor, attached hereto as"

"1462","Statement of Additional Information and subject to the control"
"1463","and direction of the Advisor and the Trust's Board of Trustees,"
"1464","for the period and on the terms hereinafter set forth.  The Sub-"
"1465","Advisor hereby accepts such appointment and agrees during such"
"1466","period to render the services and to perform the duties called"
"1467","for by this Agreement for the compensation herein provided.  The"
"1468","Sub-Advisor shall at all times maintain its registration as an"
"1469","investment advisor under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the"
"1470","Advisers Act) and shall otherwise comply in all material"
"1471","respects with all applicable laws and regulations, both state and"
"1472","federal.  The Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes herein be deemed"
"1473","an independent contractor and shall,  except  as  expressly"
"1474","provided  or  authorized  (whether  herein  or  otherwise),  have"
"1475","no authority to act for or represent the Trust in any way or"
"1476","otherwise be deemed an agent of the Trust or the Fund."
"1477","      2.         Duties of the Sub-Advisor.  The Sub-Advisor will"
"1478","provide the following services and undertake the following"
"1479","duties:"
"1480","      a.         The Sub-Advisor will manage the investment"
"1481","and reinvestment of the Fund Assets, subject to and in"
"1482","accordance with the investment objectives, policies and"
"1483","restrictions of the Fund and in conformity with the Fund's"
"1484","currently effective Registration Statement, prospectus and"
"1485","Statement of Additional Information and any directions which"
"1486","the Advisor or the Trust's Board of Trustees may give from"
"1487","time to time with respect to the Fund.  In furtherance of"
"1488","the foregoing, the Sub-Advisor will make all determinations"
"1489","with respect to the investment of the Fund Assets and the"
"1490","purchase and sale of portfolio securities and shall take"
"1491","such steps as may be necessary or advisable to implement the"
"1492","same.  The Sub-Advisor also will determine the manner in"
"1493","which voting rights, rights to consent to corporate action"
"1494","and any other rights pertaining to the portfolio securities"
"1495","will be  exercised.    The  Sub-Advisor  will  render"
"1496","regular  reports  to  the  Trust's Board  of Trustees and to"
"1497","the Advisor (or such other advisor or advisors as the"
"1498","Advisor shall engage to assist it in the evaluation of the"
"1499","performance and activities of the Sub-Advisor).  Such"
"1500","reports shall be made in such form and manner and with"
"1501","respect to such matters regarding the Fund and the Sub-"
"1502","Advisor as the Trust or the Advisor shall from time to time"
"1503","request; provided, however, that in the absence of"
"1504","extraordinary circumstances, a senior member of the Sub-"
"1505","Advisor's portfolio management team responsible for"
"1506","management of Fund Assets for the Sub-Advisor will not be"
"1507","required to attend in person more than one meeting per"
"1508","year with the Trustees of the Trust. The Sub-Advisor may"
"1509","utilize the services of a third-party to research and vote"
"1510","proxies on its behalf and on behalf of the Fund.  The Sub-"
"1511","Advisor shall not have custody of any of the assets of the"
"1512","Fund, is not authorized to provide the Fund with legal or"
"1513","tax advice and is not authorized to engage the Fund in any"
"1514","legal proceedings, including responding to class action"
"1515","claims; provided, however, that the Sub-Advisor shall"
"1516","promptly forward any notices it receives relating to class"
"1517","action claims to the Fund's custodian or other duly"
"1518","designated Fund agent.  The Sub-Advisor shall  assist  the"
"1519","custodian  or  other  duly  designated  Fund  agent  in"
"1520","evaluating  such securities litigation claims, as reasonably"
"1521","requested in writing, but the Sub-Advisor will not be"
"1522","responsible for filing such claims.  The Advisor"
"1523","acknowledges that the Fund's custodian or other duly"
"1524","designated Fund agent will be responsible for evaluating and"
"1525","making all decisions regarding securities litigation claims"
"1526","involving securities presently or formerly held by the Fund."
"1527","      b.         In addition, the Sub-Advisor may, to the"
"1528","extent permitted by applicable law and regulations,"
"1529","aggregate purchase and sale orders of securities placed"
"1530","with respect to  the  assets  of  the  Fund  with  similar"
"1531","orders  being  made  simultaneously  for  other accounts"
"1532","managed by the Sub-Advisor or its affiliates, if, in the"
"1533","Sub-Advisor's reasonable judgment, such aggregation shall"
"1534","result in an overall economic benefit to the Fund, taking"
"1535","into consideration the selling or purchase price, brokerage"
"1536","commissions and other expenses.  In the event that a"
"1537","purchase or sale of an asset of the Fund occurs as part of"
"1538","any aggregate sale or purchase order, the objective of the"
"1539","Sub-Advisor and any of its affiliates involved in such"
"1540","transaction shall be to allocate the securities so purchased"
"1541","or sold, as well as expenses incurred in the transaction,"
"1542","among the Fund and other accounts in a fair and equitable"
"1543","manner.  Whenever the Fund and one or more other"
"1544","investment advisory clients of the Sub-Advisor have"
"1545","available funds for investment, investments suitable and"
"1546","appropriate for each will be allocated in a manner believed"
"1547","by the Sub- Advisor to be equitable to each.  Moreover, it"
"1548","is possible that due to differing investment"
"1549","objectives or for other reasons, the Sub-Advisor and its"
"1550","affiliates may purchase securities of an issuer for one"
"1551","client and at approximately the same time recommend selling"
"1552","or sell the same or similar types of securities for another"
"1553","client, including the Fund."
"1554","      c.         The Sub-Advisor will not arrange purchases"
"1555","or sales of securities between the Fund and other accounts"
"1556","advised by the Sub-Advisor or its affiliates unless (a)"
"1557","such purchases  or  sales  are  in  accordance  with"
"1558","applicable  law  and  regulation  (including Rule 17a-7"
"1559","under the 1940 Act) and the Fund's policies and"
"1560","procedures, (b) the Sub- Advisor determines the purchase or"
"1561","sale is in the best interests of the Fund, and (c) the"
"1562","Fund's Board of Trustees has approved these types of"
"1563","transactions."
"1564","      d.        The Sub-Advisor shall promptly notify the"
"1565","Advisor if the Sub-Advisor reasonably believes that the"
"1566","value of any security held by the Fund may not reflect fair"
"1567","value. The Sub-Advisor agrees to provide any pricing"
"1568","information of which the Sub- Advisor is aware to the"
"1569","Advisor and/or any Fund pricing agent to assist in the"
"1570","determination of the fair value of any Fund holdings for"
"1571","which market quotations are not readily available or as"
"1572","otherwise required in accordance with the 1940 Act or the"
"1573","Fund's valuation procedures for the purpose of calculating"
"1574","the Fund's net asset value in accordance with procedures"
"1575","and methods established by the Board.  The parties hereto"
"1576","recognize that the Sub-Advisor is not an official pricing"
"1577","source."
"1578","e.  Regulatory Compliance."
"1579","(i)  The Sub-Advisor agrees to comply with the"
"1580","requirements of the"
"1581","1940 Act, the Advisers Act,  the 1933 Act, the Securities"
"1582","Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act), the"
"1583","Commodity Exchange Act and the respective rules and"
"1584","regulations thereunder, as applicable, as well as with all"
"1585","other applicable federal and state laws, rules, regulations"
"1586","and case law that relate to the services and relationships"
"1587","described hereunder  and  to  the  conduct  of  its"
"1588","business  as  a  registered  investment  adviser.  In"
"1589","selecting the Fund's portfolio securities and performing the"
"1590","Sub-Advisor's obligations hereunder, the Sub-Advisor shall"
"1591","cause the Fund to comply with the diversification and source"
"1592","of income requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal"
"1593","Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), for"
"1594","qualification as a regulated investment company.  The Sub-"
"1595","Advisor shall maintain compliance procedures that it"
"1596","reasonably believes are adequate to ensure the compliance"
"1597","with the foregoing.  No supervisory activity undertaken by"
"1598","the Advisor shall limit the Sub-Advisor's full"
"1599","responsibility for any of the foregoing."
"1600","            (ii)     The Sub-Advisor has adopted a written"
"1601","code of ethics that it reasonably believes complies with the"
"1602","requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act, which it will"
"1603","provide to the Advisor and the Fund.  The Sub-Advisor shall"
"1604","ensure that its Access Persons (as defined in the Sub-"
"1605","Advisor's Code of Ethics) comply in all material respects"
"1606","with the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics, as in effect from"
"1607","time to time.   Upon request, the Sub-Advisor shall provide"
"1608","the Fund with (i) a copy of the Sub-Advisor's current Code"
"1609","of Ethics, as in effect from time to time, and (ii) a"
"1610","certification that it has adopted procedures reasonably"
"1611","necessary to prevent Access Persons from engaging in"
"1612","any conduct prohibited by the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics."
"1613","No less frequently than annually, the Sub-Advisor shall"
"1614","furnish a written report, which complies with the"
"1615","requirements of Rule 17j-1, concerning the Sub-Advisor's"
"1616","Code of Ethics to the Fund and the Advisor.  The Sub-Advisor"
"1617","shall respond to requests for information from the Advisor"
"1618","as to violations of the Code by Access Persons and the"
"1619","sanctions imposed by the Sub- Advisor.  The Sub-Advisor"
"1620","shall immediately notify the Advisor of any material"
"1621","violation of the Code, whether or not such violation relates"
"1622","to a security held by the Fund."
"1623","            (iii)      The Sub-Advisor shall notify the"
"1624","Trust's Chief Compliance Officer and Advisor immediately"
"1625","upon detection of (i) any material failure to manage the"
"1626","Fund in accordance with its investment objectives and"
"1627","policies or any applicable law; or (ii) any material breach"
"1628","of any of the Fund's or the Advisor's policies, guidelines"
"1629","or procedures as set forth in the Fund's currently effective"
"1630","Registration Statement, prospectus and Statement of"
"1631","Additional Information or as provided to the Sub-Advisor in"
"1632","writing.  In addition, the Sub-Advisor shall provide a"
"1633","quarterly report regarding each Fund's compliance with its"
"1634","investment objectives and policies and applicable law,"
"1635","including, but not limited to the 1940 Act, the Code, and"
"1636","the Fund's and the Advisor's policies, guidelines or"
"1637","procedures as applicable to the Sub-Advisor's obligations"
"1638","under this Agreement. The Sub-Advisor acknowledges and"
"1639","agrees that the Advisor may, in its discretion, provide such"
"1640","quarterly compliance certifications to the Board.  The Sub-"
"1641","Advisor agrees to correct any such failure promptly and to"
"1642","take any action that the Board and/or the Advisor may"
"1643","reasonably request in connection with any such breach."
"1644","The Sub-Advisor will promptly notify the Trust in the event"
"1645","(i) the Sub-Advisor is served or otherwise receives notice"
"1646","of any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation,"
"1647","at law or in equity, before or by any court, public board,"
"1648","or body, involving the affairs of the Trust (excluding class"
"1649","action suits in which a Fund is a member of the plaintiff"
"1650","class by reason of the Fund's ownership of shares in the"
"1651","defendant) or the compliance by the Sub- Advisor with the"
"1652","federal or state securities laws or (ii) the controlling"
"1653","stockholder of the Sub-Advisor changes or an actual change"
"1654","in control resulting in an assignment (as defined in the"
"1655","1940 Act) has occurred or is otherwise proposed to occur."
"1656","            (iv)      The  Sub-Advisor  shall  maintain"
"1657","separate  books  and  detailed records of all matters"
"1658","pertaining to the Fund's assets advised by the Sub-Advisor"
"1659","required by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act (other than those"
"1660","records being maintained by the Advisor, custodian or"
"1661","transfer agent appointed by the Fund) relating to its"
"1662","responsibilities provided hereunder with respect to the"
"1663","Fund, and shall preserve such records for the periods and"
"1664","in a manner prescribed therefore by Rule 31a-2 under the"
"1665","1940 Act (the Fund Books and Records).  The Fund Books"
"1666","and Records shall be available to the Advisor and the Board"
"1667","at any time upon request, shall be delivered to the Trust"
"1668","upon the termination of this Agreement and shall be"
"1669","available for telecopying without delay during any day the"
"1670","Fund is open for business."
"1671","      f.         The Sub-Advisor shall provide reasonable"
"1672","support to the Advisor with respect to the marketing of"
"1673","the Fund, including but not limited to:  (i) permission to"
"1674","use the Sub-Advisor's name as provided in Section 5, (ii)"
"1675","upon reasonable request from the Advisor, permission to use"
"1676","the past performance and investment history of the Sub-"
"1677","Advisor with respect to a composite of other funds managed"
"1678","by the Sub-Advisor that are comparable, in investment"
"1679","objective and composition, to the Fund, (iii) reasonable"
"1680","access to the individual(s) responsible for day-to-day"
"1681","management as well as for servicing of the Fund for"
"1682","marketing conferences, teleconferences and other activities"
"1683","involving the promotion of the Fund, subject to the"
"1684","reasonable request of the Advisor from time to time, (iv)"
"1685","permission to use biographical and historical data of the"
"1686","Sub-Advisor and individual manager(s), and (v) permission to"
"1687","use the names of those clients pre-approved by the Sub-"
"1688","Advisor to which the Sub-Advisor provides investment"
"1689","management services, subject to receipt of the consent of"
"1690","such clients to the use of their names."
"1691","      g.         The  Sub-Advisor  will,  in  the  name of"
"1692","the  Fund,  place  orders  for  the execution of all"
"1693","portfolio transactions in accordance with the policies with"
"1694","respect thereto set forth in the Trust's registration"
"1695","statements under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act of"
"1696","1933, as such registration statements may be in effect"
"1697","from time to time.   When placing orders with brokers and"
"1698","dealers, the Sub-Advisor's primary objective shall be to"
"1699","obtain the most favorable price and execution available for"
"1700","the Fund, and in placing such orders the Sub-Advisor may"
"1701","consider a number of factors, including, without limitation,"
"1702","the overall direct net economic result to the Fund"
"1703","(including commissions), the financial strength and"
"1704","stability of the broker, the efficiency with which the"
"1705","transaction will be effected, the ability to effect the"
"1706","transaction at all where a large block is involved and the"
"1707","availability of the broker or dealer to stand ready to"
"1708","execute possibly difficult transactions in the future."
"1709","Consistent with the Conduct Rules of the Financial Industry"
"1710","Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and subject to seeking most"
"1711","favorable price and execution and compliance with Rule 12b-"
"1712","1(h) under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers"
"1713","and dealers to execute portfolio transactions of the Fund"
"1714","that promote or sell shares of the Fund.   The Sub-Advisor"
"1715","is specifically authorized, to the extent authorized by law"
"1716","(including, without limitation, Section 28(e) of the 1934"
"1717","Act),  to pay a broker or dealer who  provides  research"
"1718","services  to  the  Sub-Advisor  an  amount  of  commission"
"1719","for effecting a portfolio transaction in excess of the"
"1720","amount of commission another broker or dealer  would  have"
"1721","charged  for  effecting  such  transaction,  in  recognition"
"1722","of  such additional research services rendered by the broker"
"1723","or dealer, but only if the Sub-Advisor determines in good"
"1724","faith that the excess commission is reasonable in relation"
"1725","to the value of the brokerage and research services provided"
"1726","by such broker or dealer viewed in terms of the particular"
"1727","transaction or the Sub-Advisor's overall responsibilities"
"1728","with respect to discretionary accounts that it manages, and"
"1729","that the Fund derives or will derive a reasonable benefit"
"1730","from such research services.  The Sub-Advisor will present"
"1731","a written report to the Board of Trustees of the Trust, at"
"1732","least quarterly, indicating total brokerage expenses, actual"
"1733","or imputed, as well as the services obtained in"
"1734","consideration for such expenses, broken down by broker-"
"1735","dealer and containing such information as the Board of"
"1736","Trustees reasonably shall request."
"1737","      h.         The Sub-Adviser shall maintain errors and"
"1738","omissions insurance coverage in an amount consistent with"
"1739","industry practice and standards and shall provide annual"
"1740","certificates of insurance to the Trust evidencing such"
"1741","coverage. Furthermore, the Sub- Advisor shall, upon"
"1742","reasonable request, provide the Trust with any information"
"1743","it may reasonably require concerning the amount of or scope"
"1744","of such insurance."
"1745","      i.         In the event of any reorganization or other"
"1746","change in the Sub-Advisor, its investment principals,"
"1747","supervisors or members of its investment (or comparable)"
"1748","committee, the Sub-Advisor shall give the Advisor and the"
"1749","Trust's Board of Trustees written notice of such"
"1750","reorganization or change within a reasonable time (but not"
"1751","later than 30 days) after such reorganization or change."
"1752","      j.         The Sub-Advisor will bear its expenses of"
"1753","providing services to the Fund pursuant to this Agreement"
"1754","except such expenses as are expressly undertaken by the"
"1755","Advisor or the Trust."
"1756","3.  Compensation of the Sub-Advisor."
"1757","      a.        As compensation for the services to be"
"1758","rendered and duties undertaken hereunder by the Sub-Advisor,"
"1759","the Advisor will pay to the Sub-Advisor a monthly fee equal"
"1760","on an annual basis to XX% the first XX million of average"
"1761","daily net assets of the Fund, XX% of the next XX million of"
"1762","average daily net assets of the Fund, XX% of the next XX"
"1763","million of average daily net assets of the Fund, XX% of the"
"1764","next XX million of average daily net assets of the Fund, XX%"
"1765","of the next XX million of average daily net assets of the"
"1766","Fund, XX% of the next XX million of average daily net assets"
"1767","of the Fund and XX% of the average daily net assets of the"
"1768","Fund in excess of XX billion without regard to any total"
"1769","expense limitation of the Trust or the Advisor.  Such fee"
"1770","shall be computed and accrued daily and paid monthly in"
"1771","arrears.  If the Sub-Advisor serves in such capacity for"
"1772","less than the whole of any period specified in this Section"
"1773","3a, the compensation to the Sub-Advisor shall be prorated."
"1774","For purposes of calculating the Sub- Advisor's fee, the"
"1775","daily value of the Fund Assets shall be computed by the"
"1776","same method as the Trust uses to compute the net asset value"
"1777","of the Fund for purposes of purchases and redemptions of"
"1778","shares thereof."
"1779","      b.         The  Sub-Advisor  reserves  the  right  to"
"1780","waive  all  or  a  part  of  its  fees hereunder."
"1781","      4.         Activities of the Sub-Advisor.   The Sub-"
"1782","Advisor will report to the Board of Trustees of the Trust (at"
"1783","regular quarterly meetings and at such other times as such Board"
"1784","of Trustees reasonably shall request, subject to the limitation"
"1785","on personal attendance at such meetings set forth in Section 2a)"
"1786","(i) the financial condition and financial prospects of the Sub-"
"1787","Advisor, (ii) the nature and amount of transactions that may be"
"1788","reasonably expected to affect the Fund that involve the Sub-"
"1789","Advisor and affiliates of the Sub-Advisor, (iii) information"
"1790","regarding any potential conflicts of interest arising by"
"1791","reason of its continuing provision of advisory services to the"
"1792","Fund and to its other accounts, and (iv) such other information"
"1793","as the Board of Trustees  shall  reasonably  request  regarding"
"1794","the  Fund,  including  but  not  limited  to  the performance"
"1795","of the specific strategy used to manage the assets of the Fund,"
"1796","and the capacity of the Sub-Advisor as it relates to the"
"1797","continuing ability of the Sub-Advisor to accept additional cash"

"1827","that in no event shall such approval be unreasonably withheld."

"1852","all  such  Losses  that  the  Sub-Advisor  Indemnitee  incurs"

"1863","applicable federal or state law, rule or regulation, or (b) the"
"1864","Advisor's willful misfeasance, bad"
