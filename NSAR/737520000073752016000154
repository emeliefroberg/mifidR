A company&#146;s internal </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of f</FONT><FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>inancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
