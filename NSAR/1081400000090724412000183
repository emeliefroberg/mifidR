"2890","<PAGE>"
"2891","     SECTION 6. BROKER-DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. The Sub-Adviser is responsible for"
"2892","the purchase and sale of securities for the Funds, broker-dealer selection, and"
"2893","negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Sub-Adviser's primary"
"2894","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain the best"
"2895","price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular"
"2896","transaction for a Fund, the Sub-Adviser will take the following into"
"2897","consideration: the best net price available, the reliability, integrity and"
"2898","financial condition of the broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in"
"2899","executing the order; and the value of the expected contribution of the"
"2900","broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the"
"2901","Fund in any transaction may be less favorable than that available from another"
"2902","broker-dealer if the difference is reasonably justified by other aspects of the"
"2903","portfolio execution services offered. Subject to such policies as the Trust's"
"2904","Board of Trustees may from time to time determine, the Sub-Adviser shall not be"
"2905","deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this"
"2906","Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a Fund to pay a broker"
"2907","or dealer that provides brokerage and research services to the Sub-Adviser an"
"2908","amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in excess"
"2909","of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"2910","effecting that transaction, if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that"
"2911","such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"2912","brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in"
"2913","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of"
"2914","the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund and to other clients of the"
"2915","Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser is further authorized to allocate the orders placed"
"2916","by it on behalf of the Funds to brokers and dealers who also provide research or"
"2917","statistical material, or other services to the Funds or to the Sub-Adviser. Such"
"2918","allocation shall be in such amounts and proportions as the Sub-Adviser shall"
"2919","determine and the Sub-Adviser will report on said allocations regularly to the"
"2920","Board of Trustees of the Trust indicating the brokers to whom such allocations"
"2921","have been made and the basis therefor."
"2922","     SECTION 7. EXPENSES OF THE FUND. All of the ordinary business expenses"
"2923","incurred in the operations of the Funds and the offering of their shares shall"
"2924","be borne by the Funds unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement."
"2925","These expenses borne by the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage"
"2926","commissions, taxes, legal, auditing or governmental fees, the cost of preparing"
"2927","share certificates, custodian, transfer agent and shareholder service agent"
"2928","costs, expense of issue, sale, redemption and repurchase of shares, expenses of"
"2929","registering and qualifying shares for sale, expenses relating to trustees and"
"2930","shareholder meetings, the cost of preparing and distributing reports and notices"
"2931","to shareholders, the fees and other expenses incurred by the Funds in connection"
"2932","with membership in investment company organizations and the cost of printing"
"2933","copies of prospectuses and statements of additional information distributed to"
"2934","the Funds' shareholders."
"2935","     SECTION 8. COMPENSATION. As compensation for the sub-advisory services"
"2936","provided under this Agreement, the Adviser shall pay the Sub-Adviser fees,"
"2937","payable monthly, the annual rates indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such"
"2938","Schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to time. It is understood that"
"2939","the Adviser shall be"
"2940","                                        4"
"2941","<PAGE>"
"2942","responsible for the Sub-Adviser's fee for its services hereunder, and the"
"2943","Sub-Adviser agrees that it shall have no claim against the Trust or the Funds"
"2944","with respect to compensation under this Agreement."
"2945","     SECTION 9. STANDARD OF CARE. The Trust and Adviser shall expect of the"
"2946","Sub-Adviser, and the Sub-Adviser will give the Trust and the Adviser the benefit"
"2947","of, the Sub-Adviser's best judgment and efforts in rendering its services to the"
"2948","Trust, and as an inducement to the Sub-Adviser's undertaking these services at"
"2949","the compensation level specified, the Sub-Adviser shall not be liable hereunder"
"2950","for any mistake in judgment. In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith,"
"2951","negligence or reckless disregard of obligations or duties hereunder on the part"
"2952","of the Sub-Adviser or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents, the"
"2953","Sub-Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Trust or to any"
"2954","shareholders in the Trust for any act or omission in the course of, or connected"
"2955","with, rendering services hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in"
"2956","the purchase, holding or sale of any security."
"2957","     SECTION 10. NON-EXCLUSIVITY. The services of the Sub-Adviser to the Adviser"
"2958","and the Trust are not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Sub-Adviser shall be"
"2959","free to render investment advisory and administrative or other services to"
"2960","others (including other investment companies) and to engage in other activities."
"2961","It is understood and agreed that officers or directors of the Sub-Adviser are"
"2962","not prohibited from engaging in any other business activity or from rendering"
"2963","services to any other person, or from serving as partners, officers, directors"
"2964","or trustees of any other firm or trust, including other investment advisory"
"2965","companies."
"2966","     SECTION 11. RECORDS. The Sub-Adviser shall, with respect to orders the"
"2967","Sub-Adviser places for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities of the"
"2968","Funds, maintain or arrange for the maintenance of the documents and records"
"2969","required pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act as well as trade tickets and"
"2970","confirmations of portfolio trades and such other records as the Adviser or the"
"2971","Funds' Administrator reasonably requests to be maintained. All such records"
"2972","shall be maintained in a form acceptable to the Funds and in compliance with the"
"2973","provisions of Rule 31a-1 or any successor rule. All such records will be the"
"2974","property of the Funds, and will be available for inspection and use by the Funds"
"2975","and their authorized representatives (including the Adviser). The Sub-Adviser"
"2976","shall promptly, upon the Trust's request, surrender to the Funds those records"
"2977","which are the property of the Trust or any Fund. The Sub-Adviser will promptly"
"2978","notify the Funds' Administrator if it experiences any difficulty in maintaining"
"2979","the records in an accurate and complete manner."
"2980","     SECTION 12. TERM AND APPROVAL. This Agreement shall become effective with"
"2981","respect to a Fund after it is approved in accordance with the express"
"2982","requirements of the 1940 Act, and executed by the Trust, Adviser and Sub-Adviser"
"2983","and shall thereafter continue from year to year, provided that the continuation"

"2985","Act, which currently requires that the continuation be approved at least"
"2986","annually:"

"3003","the 1940 Act, as it may be interpreted by the Commission or its staff in"
"3004","interpretive releases, or applied by the Commission staff in no-action letters,"
"3005","issued under the 1940 Act."
"3006","     SECTION 14. INDEMNIFICATION BY THE SUB-ADVISER. The Trust shall not be"

"3203","and between Wells Fargo Funds Management, LLC (the"

"3654","things necessary or incidental to the furtherance or conduct of such purchases,"
"3655","sales or other transactions."

"3740","     SECTION 5. CONTROL BY BOARD. Any investment activities undertaken by the"
"3741","Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any other activities undertaken"
"3742","by the Adviser on behalf of the Funds, shall at all times be subject to the"
"3743","direction and control of the Board."
"3744","     SECTION 6. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS. In carrying out its"
"3745","obligations under this Agreement, the Adviser shall at all times comply with:"
"3746","     (a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"3747","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"3748","     (b) the Registration Statement of the Trust, as it may be amended from time"
"3749","to time, filed with the Commission under the Securities Act and the 1940 Act;"

"3758","solicited with respect to issuers of securities in which assets of the Funds are"
"3759","invested in accordance with the Trust's policies on proxy voting."
"3760","     SECTION 8. BROKER-DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. In connection with the purchase and"
"3761","sale of securities for the Funds, the Adviser is responsible for broker-dealer"
"3762","selection and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Adviser's primary"
"3763","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain the best"
"3764","price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular"
"3765","transaction for a Fund, the Adviser will consider among other things: the best"
"3766","net price available, the reliability, integrity and financial condition of the"
"3767","broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value"
"3768","of the expected contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing"
"3769","basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any transaction may be less"
"3770","favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the difference is"
"3771","reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio execution services"
"3772","offered. Subject to such policies as the Board may from time to time determine,"
"3773","the Adviser shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any"
"3774","duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a"
"3775","Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and research services to"
"3776","the Adviser an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"3777","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would"
"3778","have charged for effecting that transaction, if the Adviser determines in good"
"3779","faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of"
"3780","the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in"
"3781","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of"
"3782","the Adviser with respect to the Fund and to other clients of the"

"3784","<PAGE>"
"3785","Adviser. The Adviser is further authorized to allocate the orders placed by it"
"3786","on behalf of the Funds to brokers and dealers who also provide brokerage and"
"3787","research services within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange"
"3788","Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith. Such allocation shall be in such"
"3789","amounts and proportions as the Adviser shall determine and the Adviser will"
"3790","report on said allocations regularly to the Board, indicating the brokers to"
"3791","whom such allocations have been made and the basis therefore."
"3792","     SECTION 9. EXPENSES. All of the ordinary business expenses incurred in the"
"3793","operations of the Funds and the offering of their shares shall be borne by the"
"3794","Funds unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement. The expenses"
"3795","borne by the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage commissions,"

"3808","Trust: (a) to amend the Trust's registration statement or supplement the Fund's"

"3821","supplemented from time to time;"

"3826","Section 12(d)(1)(E) under the 1940 Act (a Master-Feeder Fund structure);"

"3829","investment assets in two or more registered, open-end management investment"
"3830","companies, or separate series thereof, in each case, in accordance with Section"
"3831","12(d)(1)(G) under the Act, the rules thereunder or an exemptive order"

"3846","     SECTION 12. NON-EXCLUSIVITY. The services of the Adviser to the Funds are"
"3847","not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Adviser shall be free to render"
"3848","investment advisory or other services to others (including other investment"
"3849","companies) and to engage in other activities. It is understood and agreed that"
"3850","officers or directors of the Adviser may serve as officers and directors of the"

"4598","Money Market Fund (collectively the Funds), eleven of the funds"
"4599","comprising the Wells Fargo Funds Trust, for the period ended January"
"4600","31, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"4601","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"4602","Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"4603","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"4604","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial"
"4605","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"4606","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"4607","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"4608","express no such opinion."
"4609","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"4610","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"4611","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"4612","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"4613","controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"4614","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"4615","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"4616","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"4617","accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over"
"4618","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"4619","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"4620","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"4621","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"4622","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"4623","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"4624","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"4625","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"4626","and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"4627","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"4628","use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material"
"4629","effect on the financial statements."
"4630","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"4631","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"4632","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"4633","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"4634","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or"
"4635","procedures may deteriorate."
"4636","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"4637","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"4638","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"4639","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"4640","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"4641","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"4642","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim"
"4643","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"4644","Our consideration of Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"4645","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"4646","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might"
"4647","be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"4648","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we"
"4649","noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"4650","reporting and their operations, including controls over safeguarding"
"4651","securities that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above"
"4652","as of January 31, 2012."
