"494","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"495","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"496","To the Board of Trustees of Northern Lights Fund"
"497","Trust"
"498","and the Shareholders of Zeo Strategic Income Fund"
"499","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"500","statements of Zeo Strategic Income Fund, a series of"
"501","shares of beneficial interest in Northern Lights Fund"
"502","Trust (the Fund), as of April 30, 2017 and for the year"
"503","then ended, in accordance with the standards of the"
"504","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"505","States) (PCAOB), we considered the Fund's internal"
"506","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"507","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"508","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"509","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"
"510","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"511","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"512","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"513","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"514","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"515","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"516","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"517","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"518","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"519","controls.  A company's internal control over financial"
"520","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"521","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"522","and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"523","purposes in accordance with accounting principles"
"524","generally accepted in the United States of America"
"525","(GAAP).  A company's internal control over financial"
"526","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"527","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"528","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"529","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"530","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"531","necessary to permit preparation of the financial"
"532","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"533","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"534","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"535","trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"536","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"537","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"538","company's assets that could have a material effect on"
"539","the financial statements."
"540","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over"
"541","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"542","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"543","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"544","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"545","conditions or that the degree of compliance with the"
"546","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"547","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"548","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"549","allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"550","of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"551","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"552","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,"
"553","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there"
"554","is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"555","of the Fund's annual or interim financial statements will"
"556","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"557","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"558","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"559","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"560","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"561","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"562","PCAOB.  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"563","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"564","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"565","securities, that we consider to be a material weakness,"
"566","as defined above, as of April 30, 2017."
"567","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"568","of management, the shareholders of Zeo Strategic"
"569","Income Fund, the Board of Trustees of Northern Lights"
"570","Fund Trust and the Securities and Exchange"
"571","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be"
"572","used by anyone other than these specified parties."
