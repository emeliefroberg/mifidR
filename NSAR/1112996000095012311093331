"6246","investment advisers, along with Invesco Aim Distributors, n/k/a Invesco"
"6247","Distributors, Inc. (Invesco Distributors) reached final settlements with certain"

"6249","Attorney General and the Colorado Attorney General, to resolve civil enforcement"
"6250","actions and/or investigations related to market timing and related activity in"
"6251","the AIM Funds (n/k/a the Invesco Funds), including those formerly advised by"
"6252","IFG. As part of the settlements, a $325 million fair fund ($110 million of which"
"6253","is civil penalties) was created to compensate shareholders harmed by market"
"6254","timing and related activity in funds formerly advised by IFG. Additionally,"
"6255","Invesco and Invesco Distributors created a $50 million fair fund ($30 million of"
"6256","which is civil penalties) to compensate shareholders harmed by market timing and"
"6257","related activity in funds advised by Invesco, which was done pursuant to the"
"6258","terms of the settlement. The methodology of the fair funds distributions was"
"6259","determined by Invesco's independent distribution consultant (IDC Plan), in"
"6260","consultation with Invesco and the independent trustees of the Invesco Funds, and"
"6261","approved by the SEC on May 23, 2008."
"6262","     The IDC Plan provides for distribution to all eligible investors for the"
"6263","periods spanning January 1, 2000 through July 31, 2003 (for the IFG Fair Fund)"
"6264","and January 1, 2001 through September 30, 2003 (for the AIM Fair Fund), their"
"6265","proportionate share of the applicable Fair Fund to compensate such investors for"
"6266","injury they may have suffered as a result of market timing in the affected"
"6267","funds. The IDC Plan includes a provision for any residual amounts in the Fair"
"6268","Funds to be distributed in the future to the affected funds. Further details"

"6270","Web site, available at http://www.invesco.com/us."
"6271","     On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Office of the State Auditor -"
"6272","Securities Commission (WVASC) issued a Summary Order to Cease and Desist and"
"6273","Notice of Right to Hearing to Invesco and Invesco Distributors (collectively,"
"6274","Invesco) (Order No. 05-1318). The WVASC made findings of fact that Invesco"
"6275","allegedly entered into certain arrangements permitting market timing of the"
"6276","Invesco Funds and failed to disclose these arrangements in the prospectuses for"
"6277","such Funds, and conclusions of law to the effect that Invesco violated the West"
"6278","Virginia securities laws. The WVASC ordered Invesco to cease any further"
"6279","violations and sought to impose monetary sanctions, including restitution to"
"6280","affected investors, disgorgement of fees, reimbursement of investigatory,"
"6281","administrative and legal costs and an administrative assessment to be"
"6282","determined by the Commissioner. Invesco is not aware of any further efforts by"
"6283","WVASC to pursue the prosecution of this matter. Invesco settled all other"
"6284","regulatory investigations related to market timing, resulting in: 1) affected"
"6285","shareholders receiving restitution; 2) Invesco paying disgorgement and civil"
"6286","penalties; and 3) Invesco taking remedial actions to prevent market timing."
"6287","Accordingly, Invesco considers this matter resolved."

"6300","On May 23, 2011, AIM Counselor Series Trust (Invesco Counselor Series Trust)"
"6301","(the Trust) commenced operations of Class R shares for Invesco Van Kampen"
"6302","American Franchise Fund (the Fund). Class R shares are sold at net asset"
"6303","value, and are not subject to an initial sales charge. Shares of beneficial"
"6304","interest of the Trust are redeemable at their net asset value at the option of"
"6305","the shareholder or at the option of the Trust in certain circumstances, subject"
"6306","in certain circumstances to a contingent deferred sales charge or redemption"
"6307","fee. Class R shares represent an interest in the same portfolio of investments."
"6308","Differing sales charges and expenses will result in differing net asset values"
"6309","and dividends and distributions. Each share of the Fund generally has the same"
"6310","voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights; however, each class of shares of"
"6311","the Fund is subject to different sales loads, conversion features, exchange"
"6312","privileges and class-specific expenses. Only shareholders of a specific class"
"6313","may vote on matters relating to that class's distribution plan. Shareholders of"
"6314","the Fund are entitled to one vote per share (with proportionate voting for"
"6315","fractional shares), irrespective of the relative net asset value of the shares"
"6316","of the Fund. However, on matters affecting an individual Fund or class of"
"6317","shares, a separate vote of shareholders of that Fund or class is required."
"6318","Shareholders of the Fund or class are not entitled to vote on any matter which"
"6319","does not affect that Fund or class but that requires a separate vote of another"
"6320","Fund or class. When issued, shares of the Fund are fully paid and nonassessable,"
"6321","have no preemptive or subscription rights and are freely transferable. Class R"
"6322","shares do not have conversion rights. Class R shares do not have cumulative"
"6323","voting rights, which means that when shareholders elect trustees, holders of"
"6324","more than 50% of the shares voting for the election of trustees can elect all of"
"6325","the trustees of the Trust, and the holders of fewer than 50% of the shares"
"6326","voting for the election of trustees will not be able to elect any trustees. Upon"
"6327","any liquidation of the Trust, shareholders of each class are entitled to share"
"6328","pro rata in the net assets belonging to the applicable Fund allocable to such"
"6329","class available for distribution after satisfaction of outstanding liabilities"
"6330","of the Fund allocable to such class."
"6331","Under Delaware law, shareholders of a Delaware statutory trust shall be entitled"
"6332","to the same limitations of personal liability extended to shareholders of"
"6333","private for-profit corporations organized under Delaware law. There is a remote"
"6334","possibility, however, that shareholders could, under certain circumstances, be"
"6335","held liable for the obligations of the Trust to the extent the courts of another"
"6336","state which does not recognize such limited liability were to apply the laws of"
"6337","such state to a controversy involving such obligations. The Amended and Restated"
"6338","Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the Trust Agreement) disclaims shareholder"
"6339","liability for acts or obligations of the Trust and requires that notice of such"
"6340","disclaimer be given in each agreement, obligation or instrument entered into or"
"6341","executed by the Trust or the trustees to all parties, and each party thereto"
"6342","must expressly waive all rights of action directly against shareholders of the"
"6343","Trust. The Trust Agreement provides for indemnification out of the property of a"
"6344","Fund for all losses and expenses of any shareholder of such Fund held liable on"
"6345","account of being or having been a shareholder. Thus, the risk of a shareholder"
"6346","incurring financial loss due to shareholder liability is limited to"
"6347","circumstances in which a Fund is unable to meet its obligations and the"
"6348","complaining party is not held to be bound by the disclaimer."

                           SIXTH AMENDED AND RESTATED
                            MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
                 (SECURITIES LENDING ADMINISTRATIVE FEE WAIVER)

     This Sixth Amended and Restated Memorandum of Agreement is entered into as
of the dates indicated on Exhibit A between AIM Counselor Series Trust
(Invesco Counselor Series Trust), AIM Equity Funds (Invesco Equity Funds), AIM
Funds Group (Invesco Funds Group), AIM Growth Series (Invesco Growth Series),
AIM International Mutual Funds (Invesco International Mutual Funds), AIM
Investment Funds (Invesco Investment Funds), AIM Investment Securities Funds
(Invesco Investment Securities Funds), AIM Sector Funds (Invesco Sector Funds),
AIM Tax-Exempt Funds (Invesco Tax-Exempt Funds), AIM Treasurer's Series Trust
(Invesco Treasurer's Series Trust), AIM Variable Insurance Funds (Invesco
Variable Insurance Funds) and Short-Term Investments Trust (each a Fund and
collectively, the Funds), on behalf of the portfolios listed on Exhibit A to
this Memorandum of Agreement (the Portfolios), and Invesco Advisers, Inc.
(Invesco).

     For and in consideration of the mutual terms and agreements set forth
herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the Funds and Invesco agree as follows:

     1.   Each Fund, for itself and its Portfolios, and Invesco agree that
          until the expiration date, if any, of the commitment set forth on the
          attached Exhibit A occurs, as such Exhibit A is amended from time
          to time, Invesco has agreed that it will not charge any administrative
          fee under each Portfolio's advisory agreement in connection with
          securities lending activities without prior approval from the
          Portfolio's Board (such agreement is referred to as the Waiver).

     2.   Neither a Fund nor Invesco may remove or amend the Waiver to a Fund's
          detriment prior to requesting and receiving the approval of the
          Portfolio's Board to remove or amend the Waiver. Invesco will not have
          any right to reimbursement of any amount so waived.

     Unless a Fund, by vote of its Board of Trustees terminates the Waiver, or a
Fund and Invesco are unable to reach an agreement on the amount of the Waiver to
which the Fund and Invesco desire to be bound, the Waiver will continue
indefinitely with respect to such Fund.  Exhibit A will be amended to reflect
the new date through which a Fund and Invesco agree to be bound.

     It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the Trusts hereunder shall
not be binding upon any of the Trustees, shareholders, nominees, officers,
agents or employees of the Trusts personally, but shall only bind the assets and
property of the Funds, as provided in each Trust's Agreement and Declaration of
Trust.  The execution and delivery of this Memorandum of Agreement have been
authorized by the Trustees of each Trust, and this Memorandum of Agreement has
been executed and delivered by an authorized officer of each Trust acting as
such; neither such authorization by such Trustees nor such execution and
delivery by such officer shall be deemed to have been made by any of them
individually or to impose any liability on any of them personally, but shall
bind only the assets and property of the Funds, as provided in each Trust's
Agreement and Declaration of Trust.

     Nothing in this Memorandum of Agreement is intended to affect any other
memorandum of agreement executed by any Fund or Invesco with respect to any
other fee waivers, expense reimbursements and/or expense limitations.

<PAGE>

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each Fund, on behalf of itself and its Portfolios
listed in Exhibit A to this Memorandum of Agreement, and Invesco have entered
into this Memorandum of Agreement as of the dates indicated on Exhibit A.

                            MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
                             (EXPENSE LIMITATIONS)

     This Memorandum of Agreement is entered into as of the Effective Date on
the attached exhibits (the Exhibits), between AIM Counselor Series Trust
(Invesco Counselor Series Trust), AIM Equity Funds (Invesco Equity Funds), AIM
Funds Group (Invesco Funds Group), AIM Growth Series (Invesco Growth Series),
AIM International Mutual Funds (Invesco International Mutual Funds), AIM
Investment Funds (Invesco Investment Funds), AIM Investment Securities Funds

(Invesco Variable Insurance Funds), Invesco California Insured Municipal Income
Trust, Invesco California Quality Municipal Securities, Invesco High Yield
Investments Funds, Inc., Invesco Insured California Municipal Securities,
Invesco Insured Municipal Bond Trust, Invesco Insured Municipal Income Trust,
Invesco Insured Municipal Securities, Invesco Insured Municipal Trust, Invesco
Municipal Income Opportunities Trust, Invesco Municipal Income Opportunities
Trust II, Invesco Municipal Income Opportunities Trust III, Invesco Municipal
Premium Income Trust, Invesco New York Quality Municipal Securities, Invesco
Prime Income Trust, Invesco Quality Municipal Income Trust, Invesco Quality
Municipal Investment Trust, Invesco Quality Municipal Securities and Short-Term
Investments Trust (each a Trust or, collectively, the Trusts), on behalf of
the funds listed on the Exhibits to this Memorandum of Agreement (the Funds),
and Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco).  Invesco shall and hereby agrees to
waive fees or reimburse expenses of each Fund, on behalf of its respective
classes as applicable, severally and not jointly, as indicated in the attached
Exhibits.

     For and in consideration of the mutual terms and agreements set forth
herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the Trusts and Invesco agree as follows:

     For the Contractual Limits (listed in Exhibits A - D), the Trusts and
Invesco agree until at least the expiration date set forth on the attached
Exhibits A - D (the Expiration Date) that Invesco will waive its fees or
reimburse expenses to the extent that expenses of a class of a Fund (excluding
(i) interest; (ii) taxes; (iii) dividend expense on short sales; (iv)
extraordinary or non-routine items; (v) expenses related to a merger or
reorganization, as approved by the Funds' Boards of Trustees; (vi) expenses of
the underlying funds that are paid indirectly as a result of share ownership of
the underlying funds; and (vii) expenses that each Fund has incurred but did not
actually pay because of an expense offset arrangement, if applicable) exceed the
rate, on an annualized basis, set forth on the Exhibits of the average daily net
assets allocable to such class.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Funds
indicated on Exhibits A - D with an asterisk, Invesco will waive its fees or
reimburse expenses to the extent that total annual fund operating expenses after
fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement of a class of a Fund (excluding (i)
interest; (ii) taxes; (iii) dividend expense on short sales; (iv) extraordinary
or non-routine items; (v) expenses that each Fund has incurred but did not
actually pay because of an expense offset arrangement, if applicable) exceed the
rate, on an annualized basis, set forth on the Exhibits of the average daily net
assets allocable to such class.   Acquired fund fees and expenses are not fees
or expenses incurred by a fund directly but are expenses of the investment
companies in which a fund invests.  These fees and expenses are incurred
indirectly through the valuation of a fund's investment in these investment
companies.  Acquired fund fees and expenses are required to be disclosed and
included in the total annual fund operating expenses in the prospectus fee
table.  As a result, the net total annual fund operating expenses shown in the
prospectus fee table may exceed the expense limits reflected in Exhibits A-D.
With regard to the Contractual Limits, the Board of Trustees of the Trust and
Invesco may terminate or modify this Memorandum of Agreement prior to the
Expiration Date only by mutual written consent.  Invesco will not have any right
to reimbursement of any amount so waived or reimbursed.

     For the Contractual Limits, each of the Trusts and Invesco agree to review
the then-current expense limitations for each class of each Fund listed on the
Exhibits on a date prior to the Expiration Date to determine whether such
limitations should be amended, continued or terminated.  The expense limitations
will expire upon the Expiration Date unless the Trusts and Invesco have agreed
to continue them.  The Exhibits will be amended to reflect any such agreement.

     For the Voluntary Limits (listed in Exhibits A - D), the Trusts and Invesco
agree that these are not contractual in nature and that Invesco may establish,
amend and/or terminate such expense limitations at

<PAGE>

any time in its sole discretion after consultation with the Funds' Boards of
Trustees. Any delay or failure by Invesco to update this Memorandum of
Agreement with regards to the terminations, extensions, or expirations of the
Voluntary Limits shall have no effect on the term of such Voluntary Limitations;
the Voluntary Limitations are listed herein for informational purposes only.

     It is expressly agreed that the obligations of each Trust hereunder shall
not be binding upon any of the Trustees, shareholders, nominees, officers,
agents or employees of the Trusts personally, but shall only bind the assets and
property of each Fund, as provided in each Trust's Agreement and Declaration of
Trust.  The execution and delivery of this Memorandum of Agreement have been
authorized by the Trustees of the Trusts, and this Memorandum of Agreement has
been executed and delivered by an authorized officer of the Trusts acting as
such; neither such authorization by such Trustees nor such execution and
delivery by such officer shall be deemed to have been made by any of them
individually or to impose any liability on any of them personally, but shall
bind only the assets and property of the Funds, as provided in each Trust's

                            MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
                             (ADVISORY FEE WAIVERS)

     This Memorandum of Agreement is entered into as of the effective date on
the attached Exhibit A and B (each an Exhibit or, collectively the
Exhibits), between AIM Counselor Series Trust (Invesco Counselor Series
Trust), AIM Equity Funds (Invesco Equity Funds), AIM Funds Group (Invesco Funds
Group), AIM Growth Series (Invesco Growth Series), AIM International Mutual
Funds (Invesco International Mutual Funds), AIM Investment Funds (Invesco

(Invesco Tax-Exempt Funds), AIM Treasurer's Series Trust (Invesco Treasurer's
Series Trust), AIM Variable Insurance Funds (Invesco Variable Insurance Funds)
and Short-Term Investments Trust (each a Trust or, collectively, the
Trusts), on behalf of the funds listed on the Exhibits to this Memorandum of
Agreement (the Funds), and Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco). Invesco shall
and hereby agrees to waive fees of the Funds, on behalf of their respective
classes as applicable, severally and not jointly, as indicated in the Exhibits.

     For and in consideration of the mutual terms and agreements set forth
herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the Trusts and Invesco agree that until at least
the expiration date set forth on Exhibit A (the Expiration Date) and with
respect to those Funds listed on the Exhibit, Invesco will waive its advisory
fees at the rate set forth on the Exhibit.

     For and in consideration of the mutual terms and agreements set forth
herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the Trusts and Invesco Aim agree as follows:

1.   Each Trust, for itself and its Funds, and Invesco agree that until the
     expiration date, if any, of the commitment set forth on the attached
     Exhibit B occurs, as such Exhibit B is amended from time to time, Invesco
     will waive advisory fees payable by an Investing Trust in an amount equal
     to 100% of the net advisory fee Invesco receives on the Uninvested Cash
     (defined below) from the Affiliated Money Market Fund (defined below) in
     which the Investing Trust invests (the Waiver).

     i.   Invesco's Fund Accounting Group will calculate, and apply, the Waiver
          monthly, based upon the average investment of Uninvested Cash made by
          the Investing Trust during the previous month in an Affiliated Money
          Market Fund.

     ii.  The Waiver will not apply to those investing Trusts that do not
          charge an advisory fee, either due to the terms of their advisory
          agreement, or as a result of contractual or voluntary fee waivers.

     iii. The Waiver will not apply to cash collateral for securities lending.

     For purposes of the paragraph above, the following terms shall have the
     following meanings:

     (a) Affiliated Money Market Fund - any existing or future Trust that
     holds itself out as a money market fund and complies with Rule 2a-7 under
     the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; and

     (b) Uninvested Cash - cash available and uninvested by a Trust that may
     result from a variety of sources, including dividends or interest received
     on portfolio securities, unsettled securities transactions, strategic
     reserves, matured investments, proceeds from liquidation of investment
     securities, dividend payments, or new investor capital.

<PAGE>

     2.   Neither a Trust nor Invesco may remove or amend the Waiver to a
          Trust's detriment prior to requesting and receiving the approval of
          the Board of Trustee of the applicable Fund's Trust to remove or amend
          such Waiver. Invesco will not have any right to reimbursement of any
          amount so waived.

     The Boards of Trustees and Invesco may terminate or modify this Memorandum
of Agreement prior to the Expiration Date only by mutual written consent.
Invesco will not have any right to reimbursement of any amount so waived or
reimbursed.

     Subject to the foregoing paragraphs, each of the Trusts and Invesco agree
to review the then-current waivers for each class of the Funds listed on the
Exhibits on a date prior to the Expiration Date to determine whether such
waivers should be amended, continued or terminated. The waivers will expire upon
the Expiration Date unless the Trusts and Invesco have agreed to continue them.
The Exhibits will be amended to reflect any such agreement.

     It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the Trusts hereunder shall
not be binding upon any of the Trustees, shareholders, nominees, officers,
agents or employees of the Trusts personally, but shall only bind the assets and
property of the Funds, as provided in each Trust's Agreement and Declaration of
Trust. The execution and delivery of this Memorandum of Agreement have been
authorized by the Trustees of each Trust, and this Memorandum of Agreement has
been executed and delivered by an authorized officer of each Trust acting as
such; neither such authorization by such Trustees nor such execution and
delivery by such officer shall be deemed to have been made by any of them
individually or to impose any liability on any of them personally, but shall
bind only the assets and property of the Funds, as provided in each Trust's
Agreement and Declaration of Trust.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Trusts, on behalf of itself and its Funds
listed in Exhibit A and B to this Memorandum of Agreement, and Invesco have
entered into this Memorandum of Agreement as of the Effective Date on the
attached Exhibits.

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (Agreement) is adopted as of this
1st day of April, 2011 by and among (i) each of the Invesco open-end registered

a transaction pursuant to which: (i) the Acquiring Fund will acquire the
assets and assume the liabilities of the Target Fund in exchange for the

     cash, bank deposits or cash equivalent securities in an amount necessary to
     pay the estimated costs of extinguishing any Excluded Liabilities (as
     defined in Section 1.2(c)) and cash in an amount necessary to pay any
     distributions pursuant to Section 7.1(f) (collectively, Assets).

          (c) The Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the liabilities of the
     Target Fund, whether accrued or contingent, known or unknown, existing at
     the Closing Date, except for the Target Fund's Excluded Liabilities (as
     defined below), if any, pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, with
     respect to each Target Fund separately, Liabilities). If prior to the
     Closing Date the Acquiring Entity identifies a liability that the Acquiring
     Entity and the Target Entity mutually agree should not be assumed by the
     Acquiring Fund, such liability shall be excluded from the definition of
     Liabilities hereunder and shall be listed on a Schedule of Excluded
     Liabilities to be signed by the Acquiring Entity and the Target Entity at
     Closing and attached to this Agreement as Schedule 1.2(c) (the Excluded"
"6814","     Liabilities). The Assets minus the Liabilities of a Target Fund shall be
     referred to herein as the Target Fund's Net Assets.

          (d) As soon as is reasonably practicable after the Closing, the Target
     Fund will distribute to its shareholders of record (Target Fund"
"6815","     Shareholders) the shares of the Acquiring Fund of the corresponding class
     received by the Target Fund pursuant to Section 1.2(a), as set forth in
     Exhibit A, on a pro rata basis within that class, and the Target Fund will
     as promptly as practicable completely liquidate and dissolve. Such
     distribution and liquidation will be accomplished, with respect to each
     class of the Target Fund's shares, by the transfer of the Acquiring Fund
     shares of the corresponding class then credited to the account of the
     Target Fund on the books of the Acquiring Fund to open accounts on the
     share records of the Acquiring Fund in the names of the Target Fund
     Shareholders of the class. The aggregate net asset value of the Acquiring
     Fund shares to be so credited to the corresponding Target Fund Shareholders
     shall be equal to the aggregate net asset value of the corresponding Target
     Fund's shares owned by the Target Fund Shareholders on the Valuation Date.
     At the Closing, any outstanding certificates representing shares of a
     Target Fund will be cancelled. The Acquiring Fund

                                      -2-

<PAGE>

     shall not issue certificates representing shares in connection with such
     exchange, irrespective of whether Target Fund shareholders hold their
     shares in certificated form.

          (e) Ownership of Acquiring Fund shares will be shown on its books, as
     such are maintained by the Acquiring Fund's transfer agent.

2.   VALUATION

     2.1. With respect to each Reorganization:

          (a) The value of the Target Fund's Assets shall be the value of such
     Assets computed as of immediately after the close of regular trading on the
     New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which shall reflect the declaration of
     any dividends, on the business day next preceding the Closing Date (the
     Valuation Date), using the Target Fund's valuation procedures established
     by the Target Entity's Board of Trustees.

          (b) The net asset value per share of each class of the Acquiring Fund
     shares issued in connection with the Reorganization shall be the net asset
     value per share of the corresponding class of each class computed on the
     Valuation Date using the Acquiring Fund's valuation procedures established
     by the Acquiring Entity's Board of Trustees, which are the same as the
     Target Fund's valuation procedures.

          (c) The number of shares issued of each class of the Acquiring Fund
     (including fractional shares, if any, rounded to the nearest thousandth) in
     exchange for the Target Fund's Net Assets shall be determined by dividing
     the value of the Net Assets of the Target Fund attributable to each class
     of Target Fund shares by the net asset value per share of the corresponding
     share class of the Acquiring Fund.

          (d) All computations of value shall be made by the Target Fund's and
     the Acquiring Fund's designated recordkeeping agent using the valuation
     procedures described in this Section 2.

3.   CLOSING AND CLOSING DATE

     3.1. Each Reorganization shall close on the date identified on Exhibit A or
such other date as the parties may agree with respect to any or all
Reorganizations (the Closing Date). All acts taking place at the closing of a
Reorganization (the Closing) shall be deemed to take place simultaneously as
of immediately prior to the opening of regular trading on the NYSE on the
Closing Date of that Reorganization unless otherwise agreed to by the parties
(the Closing Time).

     3.2. With respect to each Reorganization:

     assets that are represented by a certificate or other written instrument
     shall be transferred and delivered by the Target Fund as of the Closing

     Fund, duly endorsed in proper form for transfer and in such condition as to
     constitute good delivery thereof. The Target Fund shall direct the Target

                                      -3-

     Fund's custodian (the Target Custodian) to deliver to the Acquiring
     Fund's Custodian as of the Closing Date by book entry, in accordance with
     the customary practices of Target Custodian and any securities depository
     (as defined in Rule 17f-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
     amended (the 1940 Act)), in which the Assets are deposited, the Target
     Fund's portfolio securities and instruments so held. The cash to be
     transferred by a Target Fund shall be delivered to the Acquiring Fund's

     the Closing Date.

          (b) The Target Entity shall direct the Target Custodian for each

     officer stating that (i) except as permitted by Section 3.2(a), the Assets
     have been delivered in proper form to the Acquiring Fund no later than the
     Closing Time on the Closing Date, and (ii) all necessary taxes in
     connection with the delivery of the Assets, including all applicable
     Federal, state and foreign stock transfer stamps, if any, have been paid or
     provision for payment has been made.

          (c) At such time prior to the Closing Date as the parties mutually
     agree, the Target Fund shall provide (i) instructions and related
     information to the Acquiring Fund or its transfer agent with respect to the
     Target Fund Shareholders, including names, addresses, dividend reinvestment
     elections and tax withholding status of the Target Fund Shareholders as of
     the date agreed upon (such information to be updated as of the Closing
     Date, as necessary) and (ii) the information and documentation maintained
     by the Target Fund or its agents relating to the identification and
     verification of the Target Fund Shareholders under the USA PATRIOT ACT and
     other applicable anti-money laundering laws, rules and regulations and such
     other information as the Acquiring Fund may reasonably request. The
     Acquiring Fund and its transfer agent shall have no obligation to inquire
     as to the validity, propriety or correctness of any such instruction,
     information or documentation, but shall, in each case, assume that such
     instruction, information or documentation is valid, proper, correct and
     complete.

          (d) The Target Entity shall direct each applicable transfer agent for

     addresses of the Target Fund Shareholders and the number of outstanding
     shares of each class owned by each such shareholder immediately prior to
     the Closing. The Acquiring Fund shall issue and deliver to the Secretary of
     the Target Fund a confirmation evidencing the Acquiring Fund shares to be
     credited on the Closing Date, or provide other evidence satisfactory to the
     Target Entity that such Acquiring Fund shares have been credited to the
     Target Fund Shareholders' accounts on the books of the Acquiring Fund. At
     the Closing, each party shall deliver to the other such bills of sale,
     checks, assignments, certificates, if any, receipts or other documents as
     such other party or its counsel may reasonably request.

          (e) In the event that on the Valuation Date or the Closing Date (a)
     the NYSE or another primary trading market for portfolio securities of the
     Target Fund (each, an Exchange) shall be closed to trading or trading
     thereupon shall be restricted, or (b) trading or the reporting of trading
     on such Exchange or elsewhere shall be disrupted so

                                      -4-

<PAGE>

     that, in the judgment of the Board of Trustees of the Acquiring Entity or
     the Target Entity or the authorized officers of either of such entities,
     accurate appraisal of the value of the net assets of the Acquiring Fund or
     the Target Fund, respectively, is impracticable, the Closing Date shall be
     postponed until the first business day after the day when trading shall
     have been fully resumed and reporting shall have been restored.

     such date not disclosed therein;

          (h) Since the last day of the Target Fund's most recently completed

     Fund's financial condition, assets, liabilities or business, other than
     changes occurring in the ordinary course of business;

          (i) On the Closing Date, all material Returns (as defined below) of
     the Target Fund required by law to have been filed by such date (including
     any extensions) shall have been filed and are or will be true, correct and
     complete in all material respects, and all Taxes (as defined below) shown
     as due or claimed to be due by any government entity shall have been paid

     supporting material) filed or required to be filed with respect to Taxes,

     capital gain, the Target Fund, before the Closing Date will declare on or

     or dividends that, together with all previous such dividends, shall have
     the effect of distributing (i) all of its investment company taxable income
     (determined without regard to any deductions for dividends paid) and all of
     its net capital gains (after reduction for any capital loss carryover), if
     any, for the period from the close of its last fiscal year to the Closing
     Time on the Closing Date; (ii) any such investment company taxable income
     and net capital gains for its taxable year ended prior to the Closing Date
     to the extent not otherwise already distributed; and (iii) at least 90
     percent of the excess, if any, of the Target Fund's interest income
     excludible from gross income under Section 103(a) of the Code over its
     deductions disallowed under Sections 265 and 171(a)(2) of the Code for its
     taxable year ended prior to the Closing Date and at least 90 percent of
     such net tax-exempt income for the period from the close of its last fiscal
     year to the Closing Time on the Closing Date.;

          (k) All issued and outstanding shares of the Target Fund are, and on
     the Closing Date will be, duly and validly issued and outstanding, fully
     paid and non-assessable by the Target Entity and, in every state where
     offered or sold, such offers and sales have been in compliance in all
     material respects with applicable registration and/or notice requirements
     of the 1933 Act and state and District of Columbia securities laws;

          (l) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will
     have been duly authorized prior to the Closing Date by all necessary
     action, if any, on the part of the Board of Trustees of the Target Entity,
     on behalf of the Target Fund, and subject to the approval of the
     shareholders of the Target Fund and the due authorization, execution and
     delivery of this Agreement by the other parties hereto, this Agreement will
     constitute

                                      -7-

<PAGE>

     a valid and binding obligation of the Target Fund, enforceable
     in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy,
     insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws relating to or
     affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles;

          (m) The books and records of the Target Fund are true and correct in
     all material respects and contain no material omissions with respect to
     information required to be maintained under the laws, rules and regulations
     applicable to the Target Fund;

          (n) The Target Fund is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a
     Title 11 or similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the
     Code; and

          (o) The Target Fund has no unamortized or unpaid organizational fees
     or expenses.

and warrants to the Target Entity and its corresponding Target Fund as follows:

          (a) The Acquiring Fund is duly organized as a series of the Acquiring
     Entity, which is a statutory trust duly formed, validly existing, and in
     good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with power under its
     Agreement and Declaration of Trust, as amended (the Agreement and"
"6817","     Declaration of Trust), to own all of its properties and assets and to
     carry on its business as it is now being, and as it is contemplated to be,
     conducted, and to enter into this Agreement and perform its obligations
     hereunder;

          (b) The Acquiring Entity is a registered investment company classified
     as a management company of the open-end type, and its registration with the
     Commission as an investment company under the 1940 Act and the registration
     of the shares of the Acquiring Fund under the 1933 Act are in full force
     and effect;

          (c) No consent, approval, authorization, or order of any court,
     governmental authority or FINRA is required for the consummation by the
     Acquiring Fund and the Acquiring Entity of the transactions contemplated
     herein, except such as have been or will be obtained (at or prior to the
     Closing Date) under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, the 1940 Act and state
     securities laws;

          (d) The prospectuses and statements of additional information of the
     Acquiring Fund to be used in connection with the Reorganization will
     conform at the time of their use in all material respects to the applicable
     requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations
     of the Commission thereunder and will not include any untrue statement of a
     material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
     therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
     circumstances under which they were made, not materially misleading;

          (e) The Acquiring Fund is in compliance in all material respects with
     the applicable investment policies and restrictions set forth in the
     Acquiring Fund's prospectus and statement of additional information;

                                      -8-

<PAGE>

          (f) The financial statements of the Acquiring Fund for the Acquiring
     Fund's most recently completed fiscal year have been audited by the
     independent registered public accounting firm identified in the Acquiring
     Fund's prospectus or statement of additional information included in the
     Acquiring Fund's registration statement on Form N-1A. Such statements, as
     well as the unaudited, semi-annual financial statements for the semi-annual
     period next succeeding the Acquiring Fund's most recently completed fiscal
     year, if any, were prepared in accordance with accounting principles
     generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) consistently
     applied, and such statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
     financial condition of the Acquiring Fund as of such date in accordance
     with GAAP, and there are no known contingent liabilities of the Acquiring
     Fund required to be reflected on a balance sheet (including the notes
     thereto) in accordance with GAAP as of such date not disclosed therein;

          (g) Since the last day of the Acquiring Fund's most recently completed
     fiscal year, there has not been any material adverse change in the
     Acquiring Fund's financial condition, assets, liabilities or business,
     other than changes occurring in the ordinary course of business;

          (h) On the Closing Date, all material Returns of the Acquiring Fund
     required by law to have been filed by such date (including any extensions)
     shall have been filed and are or will be true, correct and complete in all
     material respects, and all Taxes shown as due or claimed to be due by any
     government entity shall have been paid or provision has been made for the
     payment thereof. To the Acquiring Fund's knowledge, no such Return is
     currently under audit by any Federal, state, local or foreign Tax
     authority; no assessment has been asserted with respect to such Returns;
     there are no levies, liens or other encumbrances on the Acquiring Fund or
     its assets resulting from the non-payment of any Taxes; and no waivers of
     the time to assess any such Taxes are outstanding nor are any written
     requests for such waivers pending; and adequate provision has been made in
     the Acquiring Fund financial statements for all Taxes in respect of all
     periods ended on or before the date of such financial statements;

          (i) The Acquiring Fund has elected to be a regulated investment
     company under Subchapter M of the Code and is a fund that is treated as a
     separate corporation under Section 851(g) of the Code. The Acquiring Fund
     has qualified for treatment as a regulated investment company for each
     taxable year since inception that has ended prior to the Closing Date and
     has satisfied the requirements of Part I of Subchapter M of the Code to
     maintain such qualification for the period beginning on the first day of
     its current taxable year and ending on the Closing Date. The Acquiring Fund
     has no earnings or profits accumulated in any taxable year in which the
     provisions of Subchapter M of the Code did not apply to it. If the
     Acquiring Fund serves as a funding vehicle for variable contracts (life

8.   FURTHER CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATIONS OF THE ACQUIRING FUND AND THE
     TARGET FUND

     With respect to each Reorganization, if any of the conditions set forth
below have not been satisfied on or before the Closing Date with respect to the
Target Fund or the Acquiring Fund, the Acquiring Entity or Target Entity,
respectively, shall, at its option, not be required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement:

     8.1.     The Agreement shall have been approved by the requisite vote of
the holders of the outstanding shares of the Target Fund in accordance with the
provisions of the Target Entity's Governing Documents, Delaware law, and the
1940 Act.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Target
Fund nor the Acquiring Fund may waive the conditions set forth in this Section
8.1;

     8.2.     On the Closing Date, no action, suit or other proceeding shall be
pending or, to the Target Entity's or the Acquiring Entity's knowledge,
threatened before any court or governmental agency in which it is sought to
restrain or prohibit, or obtain damages or other relief in connection with, this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein;

     8.3.     All consents of other parties and all other consents, orders and
permits of Federal, state and local regulatory authorities deemed necessary by
the Acquiring Fund or the Target Fund to permit consummation, in all material
respects, of the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been obtained,
except where failure to obtain any such consent, order or permit would not
involve a risk of a material adverse effect on the assets or properties of the
Acquiring Fund or the Target Fund, provided that either party hereto may for
itself waive any of such conditions;

     8.4.     A registration statement on Form N-14 under the 1933 Act properly
registering the Acquiring Fund shares to be issued in connection with the
Reorganization shall have become effective under the 1933 Act and no stop orders
suspending the effectiveness thereof shall have been issued and, to the best
knowledge of the parties hereto, no investigation or proceeding for that purpose
shall have been instituted or be pending, threatened or known to be contemplated
under the 1933 Act; and

     8.5.     The Target Entity and the Acquiring Entity shall have received on
or before the Closing Date an opinion of Stradley Ronon in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Target Entity and the Acquiring Entity, as to the
matters set forth on Schedule 8.6.  In rendering such opinion, Stradley Ronon
may request and rely upon representations contained in certificates of officers
of the Target Entity, the Acquiring Entity and others, and the officers of the
Target

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

available such truthful certificates.

9.   FEES AND EXPENSES

     9.1. Each Acquiring Fund will bear its expenses relating to the
Reorganizations, which IAI has estimated to be $30,000 per Reorganization. A
Target Fund will bear its costs associated with the Reorganization to the extent
that the Target Fund is expected to recoup those costs within 24 months
following the Reorganization as a result of reduced total annual fund operating
expenses based on estimates prepared by the Adviser and discussed with the
Board. IAI has agreed to bear the Reorganization costs of any Target Fund that
does not meet the foregoing threshold.

10.  FINAL TAX RETURNS AND FORMS 1099 OF TARGET FUND

     10.1.     After the Closing Date, except as otherwise agreed to by the
parties, Target Entity shall or shall cause its agents to prepare any federal,
state or local tax returns, including any Forms 1099, required to be filed by
Target Entity with respect to each Target Fund's final taxable year ending with
its complete liquidation and for any prior periods or taxable years and shall
further cause such tax returns and Forms 1099 to be duly filed with the
appropriate taxing authorities.

11.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT; SURVIVAL OF WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS

     11.1.     The representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith
shall not survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder.
The covenants to be performed after the Closing shall survive the Closing.

12.  TERMINATION

     This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby
may be abandoned with respect to one or more (or all) Reorganizations by mutual
agreement of the parties.

13.  AMENDMENTS

     This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented in a writing signed
by the parties hereto to be bound by such Amendment.

14.  HEADINGS; GOVERNING LAW; COUNTERPARTS; ASSIGNMENT; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

     14.1.     The Article and Section headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

     14.2. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable Federal law, without regard to
its principles of conflicts of laws.

     14.3. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns, but no assignment or
transfer hereof or of any rights or obligations hereunder shall be made by any
party without the written consent of the other parties. Nothing herein expressed
or implied is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any person,
firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement.

     14.4. This agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which shall be considered an original.

     14.5. It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the parties hereunder
shall not be binding upon any of their respective directors or trustees,
shareholders, nominees, officers, agents, or employees personally, but shall
bind only the property of the applicable Target Fund or the applicable Acquiring
Fund as provided in the Governing Documents of the Target Entity or the
Agreement and Declaration of Trust of the Acquiring Entity, respectively. The
execution and delivery by such officers shall not be deemed to have been made by
any of them individually or to impose any liability on any of them personally,
but shall bind only the property of such party.

                                      -16-
