"3018","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"3019","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Franklin"
"3020","Fund Allocator Series:"
"3021","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"3022","statements of Franklin Payout 2018 Fund, Franklin Payout 2019"
"3023","Fund, Franklin Payout 2020 Fund, Franklin Payout 2021 Fund,"

"3026","Growth Fund constituting portfolios of Franklin Fund"
"3027","Allocator Series (the Funds) as of and for the year"
"3028","ended May 31, 2018, in accordance with the standards of"
"3029","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"3030","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3031","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"3032","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"3033","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"3034","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"3035","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"3036","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"3037","we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"3038","internal control over financial reporting."
"3039","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"3040","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"3041","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"3042","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"3043","related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over financial"
"3044","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"3045","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"3046","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"3047","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal"
"3048","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"3049","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"3050","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"3051","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"3052","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"3053","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"3054","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"3055","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"3056","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"3057","of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"3058","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"3059","use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a"
"3060","material effect on the financial statements."
"3061","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"3062","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"3063","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"3064","future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"3065","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"3066","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures"
"3067","may deteriorate."
"3068","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"3069","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"3070","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"3071","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"3072","on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"3073","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"3074","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"3075","material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial"
"3076","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3077","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3078","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"3079","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"3080","in internal control over financial reporting that might be"
"3081","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"3082","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However,"
"3083","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over"
"3084","financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"3085","over safeguarding securities that we consider to be material"
"3086","weaknesses as defined above as of May 31, 2018."

"3353","to the registrant's charter or by-laws"
"3354","Amendment Effective February 1, 2018"
"3355","To the By-Laws of"
"3356","Franklin Fund Allocator Series"
"3357","(the Trust)"
"3358","WHEREAS, Article VIII, Section 2 of the By-Laws provides that"
"3359","the By-Laws may be amended by the Board of Trustees; and"
"3360","WHEREAS, by resolutions adopted October 24, 2017 at a meeting of"
"3361","the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Board of Trustees"
"3362","unanimously authorized the By-Laws to be amended as set forth below."
"3363","NOW THEREFORE, the By-Laws are hereby amended as follows:"
"3364","1.	ARTICLE VII, Sections 3, 4 and 6 are replaced in their entirety"
"3365","with the following:"
"3366","*  *  *  *  *  *"
"3367","Section 3.	CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES.  No certificate or certificates"
"3368","for Shares shall be issued to Shareholders and no Shareholder shall"
"3369","have the right to demand or require that a certificate for Shares"
"3370","be issued to it.  The Trust shall adopt and use a system of"
"3371","issuance, recordation and transfer of its shares by electronic"
"3372","or other means."
"3373","Section 4.	LOST CERTIFICATES.  No new certificate for Shares shall"
"3374","be issued to replace an old certificate that is surrendered to the"
"3375","Trust for cancellation.  In case any Share certificate or"
"3376","certificate for any other security is lost, stolen, or destroyed,"
"3377","such certificate shall be cancelled and the ownership of an"
"3378","uncertificated Share shall be recorded upon the books of the Trust,"
"3379","on such terms and conditions as the Board may require, including a"
"3380","provision for indemnification of the Board and the Trust secured by"
"3381","a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the Trust"
"3382","and the Board against any claim that may be made against either,"
"3383","including any expense or liability on account of the alleged loss,"
"3384","theft, or destruction of the certificate."
"3385","*  *  *  *  *  *"
"3386","Section 6.	TRANSFERS OF SHARES.  Shares are transferable,"
"3387","if authorized by the Declaration of Trust, only on the record"
"3388","books of the Trust by the Person in whose name such Shares are"
"3389","registered, or by his or her duly authorized attorney-in-fact or"
"3390","representative.  Upon receipt of proper transfer instructions"
"3391","from the registered owner of certificated Shares, and upon"
"3392","the surrender for cancellation of such certificates representing"
"3393","the number of Shares to be transferred with an assignment and power"
"3394","of transfer endorsed thereon or attached thereto, duly executed,"
"3395","with such proof of the authenticity of the signature as the Trust"
"3396","or its agents may reasonably require, the Trust shall cancel the"
"3397","old certificate and record the transaction and ownership of"
"3398","uncertificated Shares upon the books of the Trust.  Upon receipt"
"3399","of proper transfer instructions from the registered owner of"
"3400","uncertificated Shares, such uncertificated Shares shall be"
"3401","transferred on the record books to the Person entitled thereto."
"3402","The Trust, its transfer agent or other duly authorized agents"
"3403","may refuse any requested transfer of Shares, or request additional"
"3404","evidence of authority to safeguard the assets or interests of the"
"3405","Trust or of its Shareholders, in their sole discretion.  In all"
"3406","cases of transfer by an attorney-in-fact, the original power of"
"3407","attorney, or an official copy thereof duly certified, shall be"
"3408","deposited and remain with the Trust, its transfer agent or"
"3409","other duly authorized agent.  In case of transfers by"
"3410","executors, administrators, guardians or other legal representatives,"
"3411","duly authenticated evidence of their authority shall be presented to"
"3412","the Trust, its transfer agent or other duly authorized agent, and"
"3413","may be required to be deposited and remain with the Trust, its"
"3414","transfer agent or other duly authorized agent."
"3415","Adopted and approved as of October 24, 2017 by the Board of Trustees."
