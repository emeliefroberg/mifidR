"504","<TEXT>"
"505","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"506","The Board of Directors and Shareholders"
"507","Sit U.S. Government Securities Fund, Inc."
"508","Sit Mutual Funds II, Inc."
"509","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"510","Sit U.S. Government Securities Fund, Inc., Sit Tax-Free Income"
"511","Fund (a series of Sit Mutual Funds II, Inc.), Sit Minnesota"
"512","Tax-Free Income Fund (a series of Sit Mutual Funds II, Inc.),and"
"513","Sit High Income Municipal Bond Fund (a series of Sit Mutual Funds"
"514","II,Inc.)(collectively Sit Mutual Funds) as of and for the year ended"
"515","March 31, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"516","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered their"
"517","internal control over financial reporting, including control activities"
"518","for safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"519","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"520","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"521","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Sit"
"522","Mutual Funds internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"523","we express no such opinion."
"524","The management of Sit Mutual Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"525","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"526","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"527","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"528","costs of controls. A companys internal control over financial"
"529","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"530","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"531","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S."
"532","generally accecpted accounting principles. Such internal control"
"533","includes polocies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance"
"534","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"535","use or disposition of a companys assets that could have a material"
"536","effect on the financial statements."
"537","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"538","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"539","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"540","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"541","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the polocies or"
"542","procedures may deteriorate."
"543","A control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control"
"544","does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"545","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"546","misstatements on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a control"
"547","deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that adversely"
"548","affects the company's ability to initiate, authorize, record, process"
"549","or report financial data reliably in accordance with U.S. generally"
"550","accepted accounting principals such that there is more than a remote"
"551","likelihood that a misstatement of the companys annual or interim"
"552","financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be"
"553","prevented or detected. A material weakness is a significant"
"554","deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results"
"555","in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the"
"556","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"557","detected."
"558","Our consideration of Sit Mutual Funds internal control over financial"
"559","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"560","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"561","that might be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses under"
"562","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"563","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in Sit Mutual"
"564","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"565","including controls for safeguarding securities that we consider to be"
"566","a material weakness as defined above as of March 31, 2010."
"567","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"568","management, the Board of Directors and Shareholders, and the Securities"
"569","and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be"
"570","used by anyone other than these specified parties."
