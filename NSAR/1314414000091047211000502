"318","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"319","To the Shareholders of Adaptive Allocation Fund and"
"320","Board of Trustees of Northern Lights Fund Trust"
"321","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"322","statements of Adaptive Allocation Fund the Fund a"
"323","series of shares of beneficial interest of Northern Lights"
"324","Fund Trust as of and for the year ended January 31 2011"
"325","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"326","Accounting Oversight Board United States PCAOB we"
"327","considered its internal control over financial reporting"
"328","including controls over safeguarding securities as a basis"
"329","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"330","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"331","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR but not for"
"332","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"333","of the Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"334","Accordingly we express no such opinion."
"335","The management of Northern Lights Fund Trust is responsible"
"336","for establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"337","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility"
"338","estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"339","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"340","companys internal control over financial reporting is a"
"341","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"342","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"343","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"344","with accounting principles generally accepted in the United"
"345","States of America GAAP.  A companys internal control"
"346","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"347","that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in"
"348","reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the"
"349","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company"
"350","2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"351","as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements"
"352","in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of"
"353","the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"354","of management and trustees of the company and 3 provide"
"355","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"356","of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of a companys"
"357","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"358","statements."
"359","Because of its inherent limitations internal control over"
"360","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"361","Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"362","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"

"371","reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
