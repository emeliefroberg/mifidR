"573","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"574","Accounting Firm"
"575","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors"
"576","of"
"577","Federated Investment Series Funds, Inc.:"
"578","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"579","financial statements of Federated Bond Fund"
"580","(the sole portfolio constituting Federated"
"581","Investment Series Funds, Inc.) (the Fund)"
"582","as of and for the year ended November 30,"
"583","2017, in accordance with the standards of"
"584","the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"585","Board (United States), we considered the"
"586","Fund's internal control over financial"
"587","reporting, including controls over"
"588","safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"589","designing our auditing procedures for the"
"590","purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"591","financial statements and to comply with the"
"592","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"593","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"594","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"595","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"596","express no such opinion."
"597","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"598","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"599","internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"600","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"601","judgments by management are required to"
"602","assess the expected benefits and related"
"603","costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"604","control over financial reporting is a process"
"605","designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"606","regarding the reliability of financial"
"607","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"608","statements for external purposes in"
"609","accordance with generally accepted"
"610","accounting principles.  A company's internal"
"611","control over financial reporting includes"
"612","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"613","to the maintenance of records that, in"
"614","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"615","reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"616","the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"617","reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"618","recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"619","of financial statements in accordance with"
"620","generally accepted accounting principles,"
"621","and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"622","company are being made only in accordance"
"623","with authorizations of management and"
"624","directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"625","reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"626","or timely detection of unauthorized"
"627","acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"628","company's assets that could have a material"
"629","effect on the financial statements."
"630","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"631","control over financial reporting may not"
"632","prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"633","projections of any evaluation of"
"634","effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"635","the risk that controls may become"
"636","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"637","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"638","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"639","A deficiency in internal control over"
"640","financial reporting exists when the design or"
"641","operation of a control does not allow"
"642","management or employees, in the normal"
"643","course of performing their assigned"
"644","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"645","on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"646","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"647","in internal control over financial reporting,"
"648","such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"649","that a material misstatement of the"
"650","company's annual or interim financial"
"651","statements will not be prevented or detected"
"652","on a timely basis."
"653","Our consideration of the Fund's internal"
"654","control over financial reporting was for the"
"655","limited purpose described in the first"
"656","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"657","disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"658","that might be material weaknesses under"
"659","standards established by the Public"
"660","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"661","(United States).  However, we noted no"
"662","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control"
"663","over financial reporting and its operation,"
"664","including controls over safeguarding"
"665","securities that we consider to be a material"
"666","weakness as defined above as of November"
"667","30, 2017."
"668","This report is intended solely for the"
"669","information and use of management and the"
"670","Board of Directors of the Fund and the"
"671","Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"672","not intended to be and should not be used by"

"5037","intermediaries in consideration of an advance"
"5038","commission of up to 1.00% of the public offering price,"
"5039","paid by the principal underwriter. Financial"
"5040","intermediaries may also provide shareholder services"
"5041","and may receive shareholder services fees therefor."
"5042","Additionally, the principal underwriter and financial"
"5043","intermediaries may receive distribution and/or"
"5044","administrative service fees under the 12b-1 Plan. In"
"5045","cases where the principal underwriter has advanced a"
"5046","commission to the financial intermediary, such 12b-1"
"5047","fees will be paid to the financial intermediary beginning"
"5048","in the thirteenth month after purchase.  In consideration"
"5049","of advancing commissions, the principal underwriter"
"5050","will receive the contingent deferred sales charges paid"
"5051","upon redemption of Class C Shares and payments made"
"5052","under the 12b-1 Plan for twelve months following the"

"6492","in consideration of the payment of the sales load (dealer
reallowance). Financial intermediaries may also provide"
"6493","shareholder services and may receive shareholder service fees"
"6494","therefor. Additionally, the principal underwriter may pay up to"
"6495","100 basis points (1.00%) of the public offering price to"
"6496","financial intermediaries as an advance commission on sales."
"6497","In consideration of advancing this payment, the principal"
"6498","underwriter will receive any contingent deferred sales charges"
"6499","paid upon redemption of Class F Shares and distribution"
"6500","service fees under the 12b-1 Plan on an ongoing basis.  In"
