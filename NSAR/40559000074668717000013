"984","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING"
"985","FIRM"
"986","To the Board of Trustees and the Shareholders of"
"987","General Electric RSP U.S. Equity Fund and General"
"988","Electric RSP Income Fund"
"989","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"990","financial statements of General Electric RSP U.S."
"991","Equity Fund and General Electric RSP Income Fund"
"992","(each a Fund and collectively the Funds) as of"
"993","December 31, 2016 and for the year then ended, in"
"994","accordance with the standards of the Public"
"995","Company"
"996","Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),"
"997","we considered the Funds internal control over"
"998","financial reporting, including controls over"
"999","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"1000","our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1001","expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"1002","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1003","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"1004","on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control"
"1005","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express"
"1006","no such opinion."
"1007","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"1008","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1009","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"1010","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1011","management are required to assess the expected"
"1012","benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"1013","companys internal control over financial reporting"
"1014","is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1015","assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1016","financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1017","financial statements for external purposes in"
"1018","accordance with accounting principles generally"
"1019","accepted in the United States of America (GAAP)."
"1020","A companys internal control over financial"
"1021","reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"1022","that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1023","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"1024","and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1025","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"1026","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1027","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the"
"1028","financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and"
"1029","that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"1030","being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"1031","of management and trustees of the company; and (3)"
"1032","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1033","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1034","use or disposition of a companys assets that could"
"1035","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1036","Because of inherent limitations, internal control"
"1037","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1038","misstatements.  Also, projections of any"
"1039","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1040","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1041","inadequate because of changes in conditions or"
"1042","that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1043","procedures may deteriorate."
"1044","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1045","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1046","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1047","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1048","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1049","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1050","or combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1051","control over financial reporting, such that there"
"1052","is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1053","material misstatement of the Funds annual or"
"1054","interim financial statements will not be prevented"
"1055","or detected on a timely basis."
"1056","Our consideration of the Funds internal control"
"1057","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"1058","purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"1059","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1060","internal control that might be material weaknesses"
"1061","under standards established by the PCAOB.  However,"
"1062","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal"
"1063","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1064","including controls over safeguarding securities"
"1065","that we consider to be a material weakness, as"
"1066","defined above, as of December 31, 2016."
"1067","This report is intended solely for the information"
"1068","and use of management, the shareholders of General"
"1069","Electric RSP U.S. Equity Fund and General Electric"

"1200","RSP U.S. Equity Fund, formerly known as General Electric S&S U.S. Equity Fund"
"1201","(each, a Fund), each a New York common law trust, separately and not jointly,"
"1202","and SSGA Funds Management, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (SSGA FM),"
"1203","                                  WITNESSETH:"
"1204","   WHEREAS, each Fund is an open-end management investment company organized"
"1205","under the laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment"

"1211","   WHEREAS, each Fund desires to retain SSGA FM to render investment advisory"
"1212","and administrative services to the Fund, and SSGA FM is willing to render such"
"1213","services;"
"1214","   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein set forth,"
"1215","the parties hereto agree as follows:"
"1216","1. Appointment as Investment Adviser and Administrator"
"1217","   The Trustees hereby appoint SSGA FM to act as the Investment Adviser and"
"1218","   Administrator to each Fund on the terms set forth in this Agreement. SSGA FM"
"1219","   hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to render the services herein set"
"1220","   forth on the terms herein contained."
"1221","2. Services to be Performed"
"1222","   a. SSGA FM will recommend to the Trustees of each Fund (the Trustees)"
"1223","      certain individuals to fill the positions of Manager, Secretary and, if"
"1224","      the Trustees so desire, Assistant Secretary and other officers of the"
"1225","      Fund. Upon receipt of such recommendations the Trustees will vote upon"

"1227","      recommended; and will advise SSGA FM as to whether or not they have been"
"1228","      so appointed."
"1229","   b. Subject to the oversight and supervision of the Trustees, and subject to"
"1230","      Section 2(g) of this Agreement with respect to any Fund advised by a"
"1231","      sub-adviser, SSGA FM agrees to provide a continuous investment program"
"1232","      for each Fund's assets, and will manage the investment and reinvestment"
"1233","      of all the assets in the Fund"
"1234","                                      1"
"1235","<PAGE>"
"1236","       from time to time (including any income earned thereon and increments in"
"1237","       the value thereof). Among other things, SSGA FM shall be responsible for"
"1238","       all investment decisions regarding purchases and sales of securities and"
"1239","       other property, the retention of securities, and the retention of"
"1240","       uninvested cash. In performing the aforesaid services to a Fund, SSGA FM"
"1241","       shall comply with all investment policies of the Fund in effect from"
"1242","       time to time and such general guidance, policies and instructions as the"
"1243","       Trustees may additionally establish. SSGA FM shall, in addition, make"
"1244","       recommendations as and when requested by the Trustees with respect to"
"1245","       the adoption or modification of investment policies and each Fund's"
"1246","       objective."
"1247","    c. Unless a Fund gives written instructions to the contrary, SSGA FM shall"
"1248","       vote or not vote all proxies solicited by or with respect to the issuers"
"1249","       of securities in which assets of the Fund may be invested. SSGA FM shall"
"1250","       use its best good faith judgment to vote or not vote such proxies in a"
"1251","       manner which best serves the interests of a Fund's unitholders. Each"
"1252","       Fund has received and reviewed the proxy guidelines of SSGA FM, which"
"1253","       indicate how SSGA FM will vote."
"1254","    d. Subject to the supervision and direction of the Trustees, SSGA FM, as"
"1255","       administrator, will furnish each Fund with, or cause it to be furnished"
"1256","       with, statistical and research data, clerical help and accounting, data"

"1261","            distribute, all Fund profiles, supplemental information documents"

"1263","            documents or reports which are required by Federal and state"
"1264","            regulatory authorities, as well as any other reports specifically"

"1269","       iii. cooperate with the independent public accountants retained by the"
"1270","            Trustees in their examination of the Fund and will cooperate in any"
"1271","            inspection of the accounts and records by the Trustees;"
"1272","       iv.  compute, or cause the Fund to compute, the net asset value for the"
"1273","            Fund in accordance with the Fund's organizational documents"
"1274","            (referred to herein as the Trust Agreement) and the appendix to"
"1275","            the General Electric Retirement Savings Plan entitled Rules of the
            Funds (the Rules of the Funds);"
"1276","                                      2"
"1277","<PAGE>"
"1278","       v.   prepare, or cause the Fund to prepare, such reports to, and filings"
"1279","            with Federal, state or local governmental authorities, including"
"1280","            tax returns, as may be required by applicable law or as requested"
"1281","            by the Trustees;"
"1282","       vi.  submit periodically to the Trustees, or cause the Fund to submit"
"1283","            periodically to the Trustees, written reports covering fund"
"1284","            transactions, the results of the Fund's operations, the assets and"
"1285","            financial condition of the Fund, and such other information in such"
"1286","            form and at such times as the Trustees may reasonably request; and"
"1287","       vii. be responsible for causing the Fund to effect adequate routines to"
"1288","            collect, receive and deposit all income of the Fund and other"
"1289","            payments to the Fund, including stock dividends, rights, warrants"
"1290","            and similar items, but excluding payments associated with"
"1291","            subscriptions and redemptions."
"1292","    e. SSGA FM will keep each Fund and its respective Boards informed of"
"1293","       developments materially affecting the Fund, and will, on its own"
"1294","       initiative, furnish the Fund and its respective Boards from time to time"
"1295","       with whatever information SSGA FM believes is appropriate for this"
"1296","       purpose."
"1297","    f. SSGA FM, in the performance of its duties and obligations under this"
"1298","       Agreement, shall act in conformity with the certain documents relating"
"1299","       to the Funds, as amended and including but not limited to: the Trust"
"1300","       Agreement, the Rules of the Funds, any disclosure statement relating to"
"1301","       the Fund, including the Funds' consolidated profile and supplemental"
"1302","       information document (together with the Rules of the Funds, the Fund
       Disclosure Documents), any exemptive applications, notices and orders"
"1303","       on which a Fund relies at the time, and with any instructions and"
"1304","       directions of the Trustees."
"1305","    g. SSGA FM may from time to time, in its discretion and with the approval"
"1306","       of the Trustees, delegate certain of its investment advisory"
"1307","       responsibilities under this Agreement in respect of either Fund to one"
"1308","       or more qualified companies (each, a sub-adviser), each of which is"
"1309","       registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended,"
"1310","       provided that the separate costs of employing such sub-advisers and of"
"1311","       the sub-advisers themselves are borne by SSGA FM or the sub-advisers and"
"1312","       not by the Fund in question. Unless the Board specifies otherwise in"
"1313","       connection with its approval of any such delegation or unless any"
"1314","       agreement pursuant to which such delegation is effected specifies"
"1315","       otherwise, (i) the obligation of SSGA FM in respect of the activities of"
"1316","       any such sub-adviser shall be to provide to the Trustees its"
"1317","       recommendation as to the selection of the sub-adviser and as to the"
"1318","       periodic renewal of the sub-advisory agreement with the sub-adviser, and"
"1319","       to oversee generally the performance by such sub-adviser of its"
"1320","       obligations to the Fund in question over time (which oversight may"
"1321","       include periodic review of policies and procedures of the sub-adviser"
"1322","       but will not include approval of or responsibility for specific"
"1323","       investment decisions by the sub-adviser) and to report to the Trustees"
"1324","       periodically as to its evaluation of the performance of such sub-adviser"
"1325","       and as to the nature and scope of such general oversight, in"
"1326","                                      3"
"1327","<PAGE>"
"1328","       accordance with the standard of care set out in Section 8 below, and"
"1329","       (ii) assuming compliance by SSGA FM with its obligations under clause"
"1330","       (i), SSGA FM shall not be responsible or have any liability for any"
"1331","       investment decision or any other act or omission on the part of any"
"1332","       sub-adviser, including without limitation any error or mistake of"
"1333","       judgment on the part of the sub-adviser or failure by the sub-adviser to"
"1334","       comply with any policies, procedures, guidelines, or objectives of any"
"1335","       Fund."
"1336","3. Selection of Investments on Behalf of the Fund"
"1337","   Unless otherwise set forth in the Fund Disclosure Documents or directed by a"
"1338","   Fund or its respective Board, SSGA FM will, in selecting brokers or dealers"
"1339","   to effect transactions on behalf of a Fund, seek the best overall terms"
"1340","   available. In so doing, SSGA FM may consider the breadth of the market for"
"1341","   the investment, the price of the security, the size and difficulty of the"
"1342","   order, the willingness of the broker or dealer to position, the reliability,"
"1343","   financial condition and execution and operational capabilities of the broker"
"1344","   or dealer, and the reasonableness of the commission or size of the dealer's"
"1345","   spread, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis."
"1346","   SSGA FM may also consider brokerage and research services provided to the"
"1347","   Fund and/or other accounts over which SSGA FM or its affiliates exercise"
"1348","   investment discretion. The Funds recognize the desirability of SSGA FM's"
"1349","   having access to supplemental investment and market research and security"
"1350","   and economic analyses provided by brokers and that those brokers may execute"
"1351","   brokerage transactions at a higher cost to a Fund than would be the case if"
"1352","   the transactions were executed on the basis of the most favorable price and"
"1353","   efficient execution. To the extent permitted by applicable law and"
"1354","   regulations, SSGA FM shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have"
"1355","   breached any duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of"
"1356","   its having caused a Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage"
"1357","   and research services to SSGA FM an amount of commission for effecting a"
"1358","   portfolio investment transaction in excess of the amount of commission that"
"1359","   another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction,"
"1360","   if SSGA FM determines in good faith that such amount of commission was"
"1361","   reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services"
"1362","   provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular"
"1363","   transaction or SSGA FM's overall responsibilities with respect to the Fund"
"1364","   and to other clients of SSGA FM as to which SSGA FM exercises investment"
"1365","   discretion. Each Fund hereby agrees that any entity or person associated"
"1366","   with SSGA FM which is a member of a national securities exchange is"
"1367","   authorized to effect any transaction on such exchange for the account of the"
"1368","   Fund which is permitted by Section 11(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of"
"1369","   1934, as amended."
"1370","4. Services to Other Companies or Accounts"
"1371","   a. Each Fund understands and acknowledges that SSGA FM now acts and will"
"1372","      continue to act as investment manager or adviser to various fiduciary or"
"1373","      other managed accounts and no Fund has any objection to SSGA FM's so"
"1374","      acting, so long as when a Fund and any account served by SSGA FM are"
"1375","      prepared to invest in, or desire to dispose of, the same security,"
"1376","      available investments or"
"1377","                                      4"
"1378","<PAGE>"
"1379","      opportunities for sales, as well as the expenses incurred in such"
"1380","      transactions, will be allocated in a manner believed by SSGA FM to be"
"1381","      fair and equitable to the Fund and the account. Each Fund recognizes"
"1382","      that, in some cases, this procedure may adversely affect the price paid"
"1383","      or received by a Fund or the size of the position obtained or disposed of"
"1384","      by a Fund."
"1385","   b. Each Fund understands and acknowledges that the persons employed by SSGA"
"1386","      FM to assist in the performance of its duties under this Agreement will"
"1387","      not devote their full time to that service and agrees that nothing"
"1388","      contained in this Agreement will be deemed to limit or restrict the right"
"1389","      of SSGA FM or any affiliate of SSGA FM to engage in and devote time and"
"1390","      attention to other businesses or to render services of whatever kind or"
"1391","      nature."
"1392","5. Costs and Expenses"
"1393","   (a) SSGA FM will bear the cost of rendering the services it is obligated to"
"1394","   provide under this Agreement and will provide each Fund with all executive,"
"1395","   administrative, clerical and other personnel necessary for the investment"
"1396","   and administrative operations of the Funds and will pay salaries and other"
"1397","   employment-related costs of employing these persons. SSGA FM will furnish"
"1398","   each Fund with office space, facilities, and equipment and will pay the"
"1399","   day-to-day expenses related to the operation of such space, facilities and"
"1400","   equipment."
"1401","   (b) Each Fund shall be responsible for paying all expenses that it may incur"
"1402","   in its operation and all of the general administrative expenses allocable to"
"1403","   each except those expressly assumed by SSGA FM above. These include, by way"
"1404","   of description and not of limitation, any unit redemption expenses,"
"1405","   unitholder servicing costs (including allocable personnel and telephone"
"1406","   expenses), the expenses of any unitholder servicing plan and/or distribution"
"1407","   plan adopted by the Board pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, the"
"1408","   costs of custody, transfer agency and recordkeeping services in connection"
"1409","   with the Fund; brokerage fees and commissions; taxes; registration costs of"
"1410","   the Fund and its units under Federal and state securities laws; the cost and"
"1411","   expense of printing, including typesetting and distributing of reports and"
"1412","   disclosure statements relating to the Fund, including the Fund's"
"1413","   consolidated profile and supplemental information document and any"
"1414","   supplements thereto, to regulatory authorities and the Fund's unitholders;"
"1415","   all expenses incurred in conducting meetings of the Fund's unitholders and"
"1416","   meetings of the Board relating to the Fund, including fees paid to members"
"1417","   of the Board who are not interested persons of the Fund, if any; all"
"1418","   expenses incurred in preparing, printing and mailing proxy statements and"
"1419","   reports to unitholders of the Fund; fees and travel expenses of members of"
"1420","   the Board or members of any advisory board or committee who are not"
"1421","   interested persons of the Fund, if any; all expenses incident to any"
"1422","   dividend, withdrawal or redemption options provided to Fund unitholders;"
"1423","   charges and expenses of any outside service used for pricing the Fund's"
"1424","   portfolio securities and calculating the net asset value of the Fund's"
"1425","   units; fees and expenses of legal counsel, including counsel to the members"
"1426","   of the Board who are not interested persons of the Fund, if any, and"
"1427","   independent auditors; membership dues of industry associations; interest on"
"1428","   Fund borrowings; postage; insurance premiums for coverage of property or"
"1429","   personnel (including officers and"
"1430","                                      5"
"1431","<PAGE>"
"1432","   Trustees) of the Fund; extraordinary expenses (including, but not limited"
"1433","   to, legal claims and liabilities and litigation costs and any"
"1434","   indemnification relating thereto); and all other costs of the Fund's"
"1435","   operations."
"1436","6. Compensation"
"1437","   In consideration of services rendered and the expenses paid by SSGA FM"
"1438","   pursuant to this Agreement, each Fund will pay SSGA FM within thirty"
"1439","   (30) days of the first business day of each month, a fee calculated as a"
"1440","   percentage of the average daily net assets of the Fund during the previous"
"1441","   month at the annual rate set forth on Appendix A."
"1442","7. Records"
"1443","   SSGA FM shall maintain such books and records with respect to its activities"
"1444","   hereunder as may be required from time to time by applicable law and as the"
"1445","   Trustees may, in addition, reasonably request. SSGA FM shall make available"
"1446","   its books and records to the Trustees and their agents, counsel and"
"1447","   accountants as and when requested by the Trustees for purposes of audit or"
"1448","   otherwise."
"1449","8. Limitation of Liability"
"1450","   a. SSGA FM will exercise its best judgment in rendering the services"
"1451","      described in this Agreement, except that SSGA FM shall not be liable,"
"1452","      subject to any contrary mandatory requirements of applicable law, for any"
"1453","      error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by either"
"1454","      Fund in connection with the matters to which this Agreement relates,"
"1455","      other than a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross"
"1456","      negligence on the part of SSGA FM in the performance of its duties under"
"1457","      this Agreement or from SSGA FM's reckless disregard of its obligations"
"1458","      and duties under this Agreement."
"1459","   b. Each Fund and SSGA FM agree that the obligations of such Fund under this"
"1460","      Agreement will not be binding upon any of the Trustees, unitholders,"
"1461","      nominees, officers, employees or agents, whether past, present or future,"
"1462","      of any Fund, individually, but are binding only upon the assets and"
"1463","      property of the Fund in question. The execution and delivery of this"
"1464","      Agreement have been authorized by the Trustees of the Funds, and signed"
"1465","      by an authorized officer of the Funds, acting as such, and neither the"
"1466","      authorization by the Trustees nor the execution and delivery by the"
"1467","      officer will be deemed to have been made by any of them individually or"
"1468","      to impose any liability on any of them personally, but will bind only the"
"1469","      trust property of each Fund."
"1470","9. Communications"
"1471","   All communications between SSGA FM and the Trustees may be made orally or in"
"1472","   writing and SSGA FM may rely on any such communications with respect to a"
"1473","   Fund if it believes in good faith that the same have been given to it by a"
