"1690"," Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1691","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1692","Federated MDT Series:"
"1693","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1694","statements of Federated MDT All Cap Core Fund, Federated"
"1695","MDT Balanced Fund, Federated MDT Large Cap Growth"
"1696","Fund, Federated MDT Small Cap Core Fund and Federated"
"1697","MDT Small Cap Growth Fund (collectively, the Funds)"
"1698","(five of the portfolios constituting Federated MDT"
"1699","Series) as of and for the year ended July 31, 2012,"
"1700","in accordance with the standards of the"
"1701","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"1702","we considered the Funds"
"1703","internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1704","controls over safeguarding securities,"
"1705","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"1706","the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"1707","on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1708","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"1709","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1710","effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"1711","control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"1712","we express no such opinion.  The management of the Funds"
"1713","is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective"
"1714","internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"1715"," this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1716","management are required to assess the expected benefits"
"1717","and related costs of controls. A companys internal"
"1718","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1719","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability"
"1720","of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1721","financial statements for external purposes in"
"1722","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"1723","A companys internal control over financial reporting"
"1724","includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1725","pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"1726","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"1727","the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1728","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1729","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1730","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1731","statements in accordance with generally"
"1732","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"1733","and expenditures of the company are"
"1734","being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"1735","of management and directors of the company; and"
"1736","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1737","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1738","use or disposition of a companys assets that could have a"
"1739","material effect on the financial statements."
"1740","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1741","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1742","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"1743","future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1744","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"

"1786"," Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1787","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1788","Federated MDT Series:"

"1794","(collectively, the Funds) (five of the portfolios constituting"
"1795","Federated MDT Series) as of and for the year ended July 31, 2012,"
"1796","in accordance with the standards of the"
"1797","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"1798","we considered the Funds'"
"1799","internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"1800","over safeguarding securities,"
"1801","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1802","purpose of expressing our opinion"
"1803","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"1804","of Form N-SAR, but not"
"1805","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"1806","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"1807"," we express no such opinion.  The management of the Funds"
"1808"," is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective"
"1809","internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1810","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"1811","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs"
"1812","of controls. A company's internal control over financial"
"1813","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1814","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"1815","and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"1816","purposes in accordance with generally"
"1817","accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"1818","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"1819","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1820","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1821","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1822"," transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"1823","of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1824","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1825","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"1826","with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"1827","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1828","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1829","use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"1830","material effect on the financial statements."
"1831","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1832","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1833","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"1834","future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1835","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"1836","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures"
"1837","may deteriorate.A deficiency in internal control over"
