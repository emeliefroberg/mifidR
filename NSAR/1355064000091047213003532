"506","REPORT OF"
"507","INDEPENDENT"
"508","REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"509","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"510","To the Shareholders"
"511","of the Listed Private"
"512","Equity Plus Fund"
"513","and the Board of"
"514","Trustees of the Mutual"
"515","Fund Series Trust"
"516","In planning and"
"517","performing our audit of"
"518","the financial statements"
"519","of Listed Private Equity"
"520","Plus Fund, a series of"
"521","shares of beneficial"
"522","interest of Mutual Fund"
"523","Series Trust (the"
"524","Fund), as of and for"
"525","the year ended June 30,"
"526","2013, in accordance"
"527","with the standards of"
"528","the Public Company"
"529","Accounting Oversight"
"530","Board (United States),"
"531","we considered its"
"532","internal control over"
"533","financial reporting,"
"534","including controls over"
"535","safeguarding securities,"
"536","as a basis for designing"
"537","our auditing procedures"
"538","for the purpose of"
"539","expressing our opinion"
"540","on the financial"
"541","statements and to"
"542","comply with the"
"543","requirements of Form"
"544","N-SAR, but not for the"
"545","purpose of expressing"
"546","an opinion on the"
"547","effectiveness of the"
"548","Fund's internal control"
"549","over financial reporting."
"550","Accordingly, we express"
"551","no such opinion."
"552","The management of the"
"553","Fund is responsible for"
"554","establishing and"
"555","maintaining effective"
"556","internal control over"
"557","financial reporting.  In"
"558","fulfilling this"
"559","responsibility, estimates"
"560","and judgments by"
"561","management are"
"562","required to assess the"
"563","expected benefits and"
"564","related costs of"
"565","controls.  The Fund's"
"566","internal control over"
"567","financial reporting is a"
"568","process designed to"
"569","provide reasonable"
"570","assurance regarding the"
"571","reliability of financial"
"572","reporting and the"
"573","preparation of financial"
"574","statements for external"
"575","purposes in accordance"
"576","with accounting"
"577","principles generally"
"578","accepted in the United"
"579","States of America"
"580","(GAAP).  A"
"581","company's internal"
"582","control over financial"
"583","reporting includes those"
"584","policies and procedures"
"585","that (1) pertain to the"
"586","maintenance of records"
"587","that, in reasonable"
"588","detail, accurately and"
"589","fairly reflect the"
"590","transactions and"
"591","dispositions of the"
"592","assets of the company;"
"593","(2) provide reasonable"
"594","assurance that"
"595","transactions are"
"596","recorded as necessary"
"597","to permit preparation of"
"598","the financial statements"
"599","in accordance with"
"600","GAAP, and that receipts"
"601","and expenditures of the"
"602","company are being"
"603","made only in"
"604","accordance with"
"605","authorizations of"
"606","management and"
"607","trustees of the"
"608","company; and (3)"
"609","provide reasonable"
"610","assurance regarding"
"611","prevention or timely"
"612","detection of"
"613","unauthorized"
"614","acquisition, use or"
"615","disposition of the"
"616","company's assets that"
"617","could have a material"
"618","effect on the financial"
"619","statements."
"620","Because of its inherent"
"621","limitations, internal"
"622","control over financial"
"623","reporting may not"
"624","prevent or detect"
"625","misstatements.  Also,"
"626","projections of any"
"627","evaluation of"
"628","effectiveness to future"
"629","periods are subject to"
"630","the risk that controls"
"631","may become"
"632","inadequate because of"
"633","changes in conditions or"
"634","that the degree of"
"635","compliance with the"
"636","policies or procedures"
"637","may deteriorate.  A"
"638","deficiency in internal"
"639","control over financial"
"640","reporting exists when"
"641","the design or operation"
"642","of a control does not"
"643","allow management or"
"644","employees, in the"
"645","normal course of"
"646","performing their"
"647","assigned functions, to"
"648","prevent or detect"
"649","misstatements on a"
"650","timely basis.  A material"
"651","weakness is a"
"652","deficiency, or"
"653","combination of"
"654","deficiencies, in internal"
"655","control over financial"
"656","reporting, such that"
"657","there is a reasonable"
"658","possibility that a"
"659","material misstatement"
"660","of the Fund's annual or"
"661","interim financial"
"662","statements will not be"
"663","prevented or detected"
"664","on a timely basis."
"665","Our consideration of the"
"666","Fund's internal control"
"667","over financial reporting"
"668","was for the limited"
"669","purpose described in"
"670","the first paragraph and"
"671","would not necessarily"
"672","disclose all deficiencies"
"673","in internal control that"
"674","might be material"
"675","weaknesses under"
"676","standards established"
"677","by the Public Company"
"678","Accounting Oversight"
"679","Board (United States)."
"680","However, we noted no"
"681","deficiencies in the"
"682","internal control over"
"683","financial reporting and"
"684","its operations, including"
"685","controls over"
"686","safeguarding securities"
"687","that we consider to be"
"688","material weaknesses,"
"689","as defined above, as of"
"690","June 30, 2013."
"691","This report is intended"
"692","solely for the"
"693","information and use of"
"694","management, the"
"695","shareholders of the"
