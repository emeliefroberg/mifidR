"769","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"770","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Fairholme Funds, Inc.:"
"771","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"772","statements of Fairholme Funds, Inc. (the Funds), including The"
"773","Fairholme Fund and The Fairholme Focused Income Fund, as of and"
"774","for the years ended November 30, 2010, in accordance with the"
"775","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"776","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"777","financial reporting, including control over safeguarding"
"778","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"779","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"780","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"781","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"782","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"783","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"784","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"785","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"786","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"787","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"788","related costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"789","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"790","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"791","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"792","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"793","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"794","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"795","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"796","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"797","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"798","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"799","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"800","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"801","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"802","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"803","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"804","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a company's"
"805","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"806","statements."
"807","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"808","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"809","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"810","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"811","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"812","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"813","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"814","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"815","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"816","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"817","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"818","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"819","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"820","material misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"821","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"822","timely basis."
"823","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"824","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"825","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"826","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"827","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"828","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"829","Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"830","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, that"
"831","we consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as of"
"832","November 30, 2010."
"833","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"834","management and the Board of Directors of Fairholme Funds, Inc."
"835","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"836","to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"837","specified parties."

"1002","counsel, in connection with litigation by or"

"1005","Portfolio."
"1006","      (D)	BOOKS AND RECORDS. All books and records prepared and"
"1007","maintained by Manager for the Portfolio under this Agreement"
"1008","shall be the property of the Company and, upon request therefor,"
"1009","Manager shall surrender to the Company such of the books and"
"1010","records so requested. Manager shall preserve for the periods"
"1011","prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the Act those records required by"

"1013","      (E)	STAFF AND FACILITIES. Manager agrees, at its own"
"1014","expense or at the expense of one or more of its affiliates, to"
"1015","render the Services and to provide the office space,"
"1016","furnishings, equipment and personnel as may be reasonably"
"1017","required in the judgment of the Board of Directors of the"
"1018","Company to perform the Services on the terms and for the"
"1019","compensation provided herein. Manager shall authorize and permit"
"1020","any of its officers, directors and employees, who may be elected"
"1021","as directors or officers of the Company, to serve in the"
"1022","capacities in which they are elected."
"1023","      2.	PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS. Manager is authorized to"
"1024","select the brokers or dealers that will execute the purchases"
"1025","and sales of securities for the Portfolio.  Manager shall seek"
"1026","best execution of such transactions.  In selecting brokers to"
"1027","effect transactions for the Portfolio, the determination of what"
"1028","is expected to result in best execution involves a number of"
"1029","considerations. Among these are the Manager's evaluation of the"
"1030","broker-dealer's efficiency in executing and clearing"
"1031","transactions, the rate of commission or the size of the broker-"
"1032","dealer's spread, the size and difficulty of the order, the"
"1033","nature of the market for the security, and operational"
"1034","capabilities of the broker-dealer.  The Manager will not take"
"1035","into account the sale of Portfolio shares when selecting brokers"
"1036","to execute transactions for the Portfolio."
"1037","      Manager may, in its discretion, purchase and sell portfolio"
"1038","securities from and to brokers and dealers who provide the"
"1039","Portfolio and any other account over which the Manager exercises"
"1040","investment discretion with research and brokerage services (as"
"1041","those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities and"
"1042","Exchange Act of 1934 and interpretations thereunder), and"
"1043","Manager may pay to these brokers and dealers, in return for"
"1044","research and brokerage services, a higher commission or spread"
"1045","than may be charged by other brokers and dealers for that"
"1046","transaction, provided that Manager determines in good faith that"
"1047","such commission is reasonable relative to the value of the"
"1048","research and brokerage services provided by such broker or"
"1049","dealer as viewed in terms either of that particular transaction"
"1050","or of the overall responsibility of Manager to the Portfolio and"
"1051","its other clients. Manager will promptly communicate to the"
"1052","officers and the directors of the Company such information"
"1053","relating to portfolio transactions as they may reasonably"
"1054","request."
"1055","      When Manager deems the purchase or sale of a security or"
"1056","other investment to be in the best interests of the Portfolio"
"1057","and other advisory clients, Manager may, to the extent permitted"
"1058","by applicable laws and regulations, aggregate orders for the"
"1059","Portfolio and those other advisory clients for the purchase or"
"1060","sale of the security or other investment.  In such event,"
"1061","allocation of the securities or investment so purchased or sold,"
"1062","as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be"
"1063","made by Manager in the manner it considers to be most equitable"
"1064","and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Portfolio"
"1065","and to such other clients."
"1066","      3.	COMPENSATION OF MANAGER. The Company will pay to"
"1067","Manager on the last day of each month a fee (the Management
Fee) at an annual rate equal to [1.00]% of the daily average"
"1068","net assets of the Portfolio, such fee to be computed daily based"
"1069","upon the net assets of the Portfolio as determined by a"
"1070","valuation made in accordance with the Company's procedures for"
"1071","calculating Portfolio net asset value as described in the"
"1072","Portfolio's Prospectus and/or Statement of Additional"
"1073","Information. During any period when the determination of the"
"1074","Portfolio's net asset value is suspended by the directors of the"
"1075","Company, the net asset value of a share of the Portfolio and the"
"1076","corresponding value of the net assets of the Portfolio as of the"
"1077","last business day prior to such suspension shall, for the"
"1078","purpose of this Paragraph 3, be deemed to be net asset value per"
"1079","share and value of the net assets of the Portfolio,"
"1080","respectively, at the close of each succeeding business day until"
"1081","it is again determined."
"1082","      The Manager may reduce or waive any portion of the"
"1083","Management Fee due to it, or otherwise agree to make payments to"
"1084","limit certain operating expenses of the Portfolio.  The Manager"
"1085","retains its right to receive reimbursement of any amount"
"1086","(Waived Amount) corresponding to its reduction or waiver of"
"1087","the Management Fee or to its payment of operating expenses of"
"1088","the Portfolio.  Any such Waived Amount is subject to"
"1089","reimbursement by the Company, on behalf of the Portfolio, to the"
"1090","Manager, if so requested by the Manager, in subsequent fiscal"
"1091","years provided that the aggregate amount paid by the Portfolio"
"1092","for its operating expenses for such fiscal year (taking into"
"1093","account any reimbursement) does not exceed the applicable"
"1094","limitation on such expenses for that year or, if no such"
"1095","limitation is effective for that year, the Management Fee"
"1096","payable by the Company, on behalf of the Portfolio, to the"
"1097","Manager for that year.   The Manager may recoup from the"
"1098","Portfolio reimbursement of any Waived Amount made in any fiscal"
"1099","year of the Portfolio over the following three fiscal years of"
"1100","the Portfolio.  Any such reimbursement is contingent upon the"
"1101","review and approval of the Board of Directors of the Company at"
"1102","time the reimbursement is made."
"1103","      4.	STATUS OF MANAGER. The services of Manager to the"
"1104","Company and the Portfolio are not to be deemed exclusive, and"
"1105","Manager shall be free to render similar services to others so"
"1106","long as its services to the Company and the Portfolio are not"
"1107","impaired thereby. Manager shall be deemed to be an independent"
"1108","contractor and shall, unless otherwise expressly provided or"
"1109","authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the"
"1110","Company or the Portfolio in any way or otherwise be deemed an"
"1111","agent of the Company or the Portfolio. Nothing in this Agreement"
"1112","shall limit or restrict the right of any director, officer or"
"1113","employee of Manager, who may also be a director, officer, or"
"1114","employee of the Company, to engage in any other business or to"
"1115","devote his or her time and attention in part to the management"
"1116","or other aspects of any other business, whether of a similar"
"1117","nature or a dissimilar nature."
"1118","      5.	PERMISSIBLE INTERESTS. Directors, agents, and"
"1119","stockholders of the Company are or may be interested in Manager"
"1120","(or any successor thereof) as directors, partners, officers, or"
"1121","stockholders, or otherwise, and directors, partners, officers,"
"1122","agents, and stockholders of Manager are or may be interested in"
"1123","the Company as directors, stockholders or otherwise; and Manager"
