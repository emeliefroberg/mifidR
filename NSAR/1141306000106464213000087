"781","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"782","financial statements in accordance with generally"

"787","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"788","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a funds"
"789","assets that could have a material effect on the"
"790","financial statements."
"791","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"792","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"793","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"794","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"795","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"796","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"797","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"798","deteriorate."
"799","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"800","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"801","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"802","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"803","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"804","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"805","a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"806","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"807","possibility that a material misstatement of the funds"
"808","annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"809","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"810","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"

"817","no deficiencies in the Funds internal control over"
