"3602","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"3603","Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"3604","Lehman Brothers Income Funds"
"3605","New York, New York"
"3606","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"3607"," statements of Neuberger Berman Core Bond Fund,"
"3608","Neuberger Berman New York Municipal Money Fund,"
"3609","Neuberger Berman Core Plus Bond Fund and"
"3610","Neuberger Berman California TaxFree Money Fund (the Funds),"
"3611","each a series of Lehman Brothers"
"3612","Income Funds (the Trust) for the period ended"
"3613","October 31, 2008, in accordance with the standards of the"
"3614","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"3615","we considered their internal control over"
"3616","financial reporting, including control activities for"
"3617","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"3618","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"3619","opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"3620","with the requirements of Form NSAR, but not for the"
"3621","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"3622","effectiveness of the Trusts internal control over"
"3623","financial reporting.   Accordingly, we express no such"
"3624","opinion."
"3625","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing"
"3626"," and maintaining effective internal control"
"3627","over financial reporting.   In fulfilling this"
"3628","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"3629","required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"3630","costs of controls.   A companys internal control over"
"3631","financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"3632","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"3633","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"3634","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"3635","generally accepted accounting principles.   A companys"
"3636","internal control over financial reporting includes"
"3637","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"3638","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"3639","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"3640","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"3641","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"3642","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"3643","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"3644","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"3645","expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"3646","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"3647","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"3648","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"3649","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"3650","companys assets that could have a material effect on"
"3651","the financial statements."
"3652","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over"
"3653","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"3654","misstatements.   Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"3655","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"3656","risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"3657","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"3658","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3659","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"3660","exists when the design or operation of a control"
"3661","does not allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"3662"," of performing their assigned functions, to"
"3663","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"3664","A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination"
"3665","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"3666","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"3667","material misstatement of the companys annual or"
"3668","interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"3669","detected on a timely basis."

"3673","Our consideration of the Trusts internal control over"
"3674","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"3675","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"3676","all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"3677","material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"3678","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"3679","(United States).   However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"3680","the Trusts internal control over financial reporting"
"3681","and its operation, including controls for safeguarding"
"3682","securities, which we consider to be material"
"3683","weaknesses, as defined above, as of October 31, 2008."
"3684","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"3685","use of management, Shareholders and Board of"
"3686","Trustees of Neuberger Berman Equity Funds and the"

"5268","(formerly Lehman Brothers Strategic Income Fund), six of"
"5269","the series constituting the Lehman Brothers Income Funds"
"5270","(the Trust) as of and for the year ended"
"5271","October 31, 2008, in accordance with the standards of"
"5272","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"5273","(United States), we considered the Trusts internal"
"5274","control over financial reporting, including controls"
"5275","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"5276","our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"5277","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"5278","to comply with the requirements of Form NSAR,"
"5279","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"5280","effectiveness of the Trusts internal control over"
"5281","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"5282","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing"
"5283","and maintaining effective internal control"
"5284","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"5285","estimates and judgments by management are"
"5286","required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"5287","costs of controls. A companys internal control over"
"5288","financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"5289","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"5290","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"5291","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"5292","generally accepted accounting principles. A companys"
"5293","internal control over financial reporting includes"
"5294","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"5295"," maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"5296","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"5297","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"5298","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"5299","as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"5300","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"5301"," accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"5302","expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"5303","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"5304","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"5305","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"5306","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"5307","companys assets that could have a material effect on"
"5308","the financial statements."
"5309","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"5310"," financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"5311","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"5312","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"5313","risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"5314","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"5315","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"5316","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"5317","exists when the design or operation of a control"
"5318","does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"5319","course of performing their assigned functions, to"
"5320","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"5321","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"5322","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"5323","such that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"5324","a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim"
"5325","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"5326","detected on a timely basis."
"5327","Our consideration of the Trusts internal control over"
"5328","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"5329","described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily"
"5330","disclose all deficiencies in internal control that"
"5331","might be material weaknesses under standards established"
"5332","by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"5333","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"5334"," in the Companys internal control over"
"5335","financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"5336","over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"5337","be a material weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2008."
