"516","FPA CAPITAL FUND, INC."
"517","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT"
"518","REGISTERED"
"519","PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"520","TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND"
"521","BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF FPA CAPITAL FUND, INC."
"522","   We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and"
"523","liabilities of FPA Capital Fund, Inc. (the Fund), including the"
"524","portfolio of investments, as of March 31, 2017, and the related"
"525","statement of operations for the year then ended, the statements of"
"526","changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then"
"527","ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the"
"528","period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights"
"529","are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is"
"530","to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial"
"531","highlights based on our audits."
"532","   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of"
"533","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"534","Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain"
"535","reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and"
"536","financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund is"
"537","not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of"
"538","its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included"
"539","consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis"
"540","for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the"
"541","circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"542","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"543","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also"
"544","includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the"
"545","amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the"
"546","accounting principles used and significant estimates made by"
"547","management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement"
"548","presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of securities"
"549","owned as of March 31, 2017, by correspondence with the custodian"
"550","and brokers; when replies were not received from brokers, we"
"551","performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits"
"552","provide a reasonable basis for our opinion."
"553","   In our opinion, such financial statements and financial highlights"
"554","referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial"
"555","position of FPA Capital Fund, Inc. as of March 31, 2017, the results"
"556","of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets"
"557","for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial"
"558","highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in"
"559","conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the"
"560","United States of America."
