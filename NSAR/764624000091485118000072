"1107","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"1108","of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"1109","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1110","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1111","Company's internal control over financial reporting."
"1112","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness"

"1120","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1121","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"1122","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1123","accounting principles.  A company's internal control over"
"1124","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"1125","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1126","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1127","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"1128","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"

"1131","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"

"1134","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1135","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"1136","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1137","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"

"1139","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1140","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1141","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"1142","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1143","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1144","exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1145","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
