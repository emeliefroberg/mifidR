"475","series of the Equinox"
"476","Funds Trust, as of"
"477","and for the period"

"479","2016, in accordance"
"480","with the standards of"
"481","the Public Company"
"482","Accounting"
"483","Oversight Board"
"484","(United States), we"
"485","considered the"
"486","Fund's internal"
"487","control over financial"
"488","reporting, including"
"489","controls over"
"490","safeguarding"
"491","securities, as a basis"
"492","for designing our"
"493","auditing procedures"
"494","for the purpose of"
"495","expressing our"
"496","opinion on the"
"497","financial statements"
"498","and to comply with"
"499","the requirements of"
"500","Form N-SAR, but not"
"501","for the purpose of"
"502","expressing an"
"503","opinion on the"
"504","effectiveness of the"
"505","Fund's internal"
"506","control over financial"
"507","reporting."
"508","Accordingly, we"
"509","express no such"
"510","opinion."
"511","The management of"
"512","the Fund is"
"513","responsible for"
"514","establishing and"
"515","maintaining effective"
"516","internal control over"
"517","financial reporting. In"
"518","fulfilling this"
"519","responsibility,"
"520","estimates and"
"521","judgments by"
"522","management are"
"523","required to assess"
"524","the expected"
"525","benefits and related"
"526","costs of controls. A"
"527","fund's internal"
"528","control over financial"
"529","reporting is a"
"530","process designed to"
"531","provide reasonable"
"532","assurance regarding"
"533","the reliability of"
"534","financial reporting"
"535","and the preparation"
"536","of financial"
"537","statements for"
"538","external purposes in"
"539","accordance with"
"540","generally accepted"
"541","accounting principles"
"542","(GAAP). A fund's"
"543","internal control over"
"544","financial reporting"
"545","includes those"
"546","policies and"
"547","procedures that (a)"
"548","pertain to the"
"549","maintenance of"
"550","records that, in"
"551","reasonable detail,"
"552","accurately and fairly"
"553","reflect the"
"554","transactions and"
"555","dispositions of the"
"556","assets of the fund;"
"557","(b) provide"
"558","reasonable"
"559","assurance that"
"560","transactions are"
"561","recorded as"
"562","necessary to permit"
"563","preparation of"
"564","financial statements"
"565","in accordance with"
"566","GAAP, and that"
"567","receipts and"
"568","expenditures of the"
"569","fund are being made"
"570","only in accordance"
"571","with authorizations"
"572","of management and"
"573","trustees of the fund;"
"574","and (c) provide"
"575","reasonable"
"576","assurance regarding"
"577","prevention or timely"
"578","detection of"
"579","unauthorized"
"580","acquisition, use or"
"581","disposition of a"
"582","fund's assets that"
"583","could have a"
"584","material effect on the"
"585","financial statements."
"586","Because of inherent"
"587","limitations, internal"
"588","control over financial"
"589","reporting may not"
"590","prevent or detect"
"591","misstatements. Also,"
"592","projections of"
"593","effectiveness to"
"594","future periods are"
"595","subject to the risk"
"596","that controls may"
"597","become inadequate"
"598","because of changes"
"599","in conditions, or that"
"600","the degree of"
"601","compliance with the"
"602","policies or"
"603","procedures may"
"604","deteriorate."
"605","A deficiency in"
"606","internal control over"
"607","financial reporting"
"608","exists when the"
"609","design or operation"
"610","of a control does not"
"611","allow management"
"612","or employees, in the"
"613","normal course of"
"614","performing their"
"615","assigned functions,"
"616","to prevent or detect"
"617","misstatements on a"
"618","timely basis. A"
"619","material weakness is"
"620","a deficiency, or"
"621","combination of"
"622","deficiencies, in"
"623","internal control over"
"624","financial reporting,"
"625","such that there is a"
"626","reasonable"
"627","possibility that a"
"628","material"
"629","misstatement of the"
"630","Fund's annual or"
"631","interim financial"
"632","statements will not"
"633","be prevented or"
"634","detected on a timely"
"635","basis."
"636","Our consideration of"
"637","the Fund's internal"
"638","control over financial"
"639","reporting was for the"
"640","limited purpose"
"641","described in the first"
"642","paragraph and"
"643","would not"
"644","necessarily identify"
"645","all deficiencies in"
"646","internal control that"
"647","might be material"
"648","weaknesses under"
"649","standards"
"650","established by the"
"651","Public Company"
"652","Accounting"
"653","Oversight Board"
"654","(United States)."
"655","However, we"
"656","identified the"
"657","following"
"658","deficiencies in"
"659","internal control over"
"660","financial reporting"
"661","that we consider to"
"662","be material"
"663","weaknesses, as"
"664","defined above."
"665","These conditions"
"666","were considered in"
"667","determining the"
"668","nature, timing, and"
"669","extent of the"
"670","procedures"
"671","performed in our"
"672","audit of the"
"673","consolidated"
"674","financial statements"
"675","of the Fund as of"
"676","and for the year"
"677","ended June 30,"
"678","2016 and this report"
"679","does not affect our"
"680","report thereon dated"
"681","October 26, 2016."
"682","As of and for the"
"683","year ended June 30,"
"684","2016, we noted that"
"685","the Fund's internal"
"686","control structure,"
"687","including the use of"
"688","a third party"
"689","administrator, failed"
"690","to identify material"
"691","unreconciled"
"692","differences within"
"693","the Fund's"
"694","brokerage accounts"
"695","related to investment"
"696","settlement"
"697","differences and"
"698","foreign currency"
"699","adjustments for an"
"700","extended period of"
"701","time.  As a result of"
"702","this material"
"703","weakness,"
"704","adjustments were"
"705","recorded in the"
"706","Fund's consolidated"
"707","financial statements"
"708","as of and for the"
"709","period ended June"
"710","30, 2016."
"711","Management has"
"712","reviewed the"
"713","processes and"
"714","controls that gave"
"715","rise to these"
"716","adjustments, and as"
"717","a result, the"
"718","administrator and"
"719","management have"
"720","implemented"
"721","changes that"
"722","management"
"723","believes will allow for"
"724","the prevention"
"725","and/or timely"
"726","detection of similar"
"727","errors on a go-"
"728","forward basis."
"729","This report is"
"730","intended solely for"
"731","the information and"
"732","use of management"
"733","and the Board of"
"734","Trustees of the Fund"
"735","and the Securities"
"736","and Exchange"
"737","Commission and is"
"738","not intended to be"
"739","and should not be"
"740","used by anyone"
"741","other than these"
"742","specified parties."
