"861","INDEPENDENT REGISTERED ACCOUNTING FIRM </P>"
"862","<P align=center>ON INTERNAL CONTROL REQUIRED BY FORM N-SAR </P>"
"863","<P align=center>____ </P>"
"864","<P align=left>To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Fidelity Rutland"
"865","Square Trust II: </P>"
"866","<P align=left></P>"
"867","<P align=left>In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"868","of Fidelity Rutland Square Trust II: Strategic Advisers Core Fund (collectively,"
"869","the Trust) as of and for the year ended May 31, 2010, in accordance with the"
"870","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"871","considered the Trust's internal control over financial reporting, including"
"872","control activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"873","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"874","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"875","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal"
"876","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"877","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting. </P>"
"878","<P align=left>The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"879","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"880","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"881","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal"
"882","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"883","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"884","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"885","accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"886","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"887","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"888","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"889","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"890","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"891","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Trust are being"
"892","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"893","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"894","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a Trust's assets"
"895","that could have a material effect on the financial statements. </P>"
"896","<P align=left>Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"897","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"898","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"899","controls may become inadequate because of changes in </P>"
"900","<P align=left>conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"901","procedures may deteriorate. </P>"
"902","<P align=left></P>"
"903","<P align=left>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"904","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"905","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to"
"906","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"907","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"908","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"909","misstatement of the Trust's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"910","prevented or detected on a timely basis. </P>"
"911","<P id=C__\desktop\q77b_pwcauditletter__3_.html.2 align=left>Our consideration of"
"912","the Trust's internal control over financial reporting was for the limited"
"913","purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"914","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"915","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"916","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"917","Trust's internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"918","controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material"
"919","weaknesses as defined above as of May 31, 2010. </P>"

"922","management and the Board of Trustees of Fidelity Rutland Square Trust II and the"

"2551","<P align=left>1. (a) Investment Advisory Services. The Adviser undertakes to act"
"2552","as investment adviser of the Portfolio and shall, subject to the supervision of"
"2553","the Fund's Board of Trustees, direct the investments of the Portfolio in"
"2554","accordance with the investment objective, policies and limitations as provided"
"2555","in the Portfolio's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as amended from"
"2556","time to time, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and rules thereunder, as"
"2557","amended from time to time (the 1940 Act), and such other limitations as the"

"2573","times be subject to the control and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."
"2574","</P>"
"2575","<P align=left>(b) Management Services. The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for"
"2576","the performance by its affiliates of) the management and administrative services"
"2577","necessary for the operation of the Fund. The Adviser shall, subject to the"
"2578","supervision of the Board of Trustees, perform various services for the"
"2579","Portfolio, including but not limited to: (i) providing the Portfolio with office"
"2580","space, equipment and facilities (which may be its own) for maintaining its"

"2590","and developing and implementing, if appropriate, management and shareholder"
"2591","services designed to enhance the value or convenience of the Portfolio as an"
"2592","investment vehicle. </P>"
"2593","<P align=left>The Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations,"
"2594","information or analyses to the Fund as the Fund's Board of Trustees may request"
"2595","from time to time or as the Adviser may deem to be desirable. The Adviser shall,"
"2596","subject to review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other services as the"
"2597","Adviser shall from time to time determine to be necessary or useful to perform"
"2598","its obligations under this Contract. </P>"
"2599","<P align=left>(c) The Adviser undertakes to pay, either itself or through an"
"2600","affiliated company, all expenses involved in the operation of the Portfolio,"
"2601","except the following, which shall be paid by the Portfolio: (i) taxes; (ii) the"
"2602","fees and expenses of all Trustees of the Fund who are not interested persons"
"2603","of the Fund or of the Adviser; (iii) brokerage fees and commissions; (iv)"
"2604","redemption fees and other shareholder charges associated with investments in"
"2605","other mutual funds; (v) interest expenses with respect to borrowings by the"
"2606","Portfolio; (vi) prime brokerage fees and expenses, including margin interest and"
"2607","payments in lieu of dividends associated with short sale transactions; and (vii)"
"2608","such non-recurring and extraordinary expenses as may arise, including actions,"
"2609","suits or proceedings to which the Portfolio is or is threatened to be a party"
"2610","and the legal obligation that the Portfolio may have to indemnify the Fund's"
"2611","Trustees and officers with respect thereto. It is understood that service"
"2612","charges billed directly to shareholders of the Portfolio, including charges for"
"2613","exchanges, redemptions, sub-accounting or other services, shall not be payable"
"2614","by the Adviser, but may be received and retained by the Adviser or its"
"2615","affiliates. </P>"
"2616","<P id=C__\desktop\Strat\q77q1_managementcontract.html.2 align=left>(d) The"
"2617","Adviser, either itself or through an affiliated company or through the"
"2618","Portfolio's custodian, shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of"
"2619","mutual fund shares for the Portfolio's account with such underlying funds'"
"2620","transfer agents. With respect to portfolio securities other than mutual fund"
"2621","shares, the Adviser, either itself or through an affiliated company, shall place"
"2622","all purchase and sale orders for the Portfolio's account with brokers or dealers"
"2623","selected by the Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with"
"2624","the Adviser. The Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio"
"2625","transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission"
"2626","rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received. In selecting"
"2627","brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or"
"2628","dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as"
"2629","those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)"
"2630","to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Adviser or its"
"2631","affiliates exercise investment discretion. The Adviser is authorized to pay a"
"2632","broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission"
"2633","for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess of"
"2634","the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"2635","effecting that transaction if the Adviser determines in good faith that such"
"2636","amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"2637","research services provided by such broker or dealer. This determination may be"
"2638","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"2639","responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to"
"2640","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. The Trustees of the"
"2641","Fund shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to"
"2642","determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were"
"2643","reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio. </P>"
"2644","<P align=left>The Adviser shall, in acting hereunder, be an independent"
"2645","contractor. The Adviser shall not be an agent of the Portfolio. </P>"
"2646","<P align=left>2. It is understood that the Trustees, officers and shareholders"
"2647","of the Fund are or may be or become interested in the Adviser as directors,"
"2648","officers or otherwise and that directors, officers and stockholders of the"
"2649","Adviser are or may be or become similarly interested in the Fund, and that the"
"2650","Adviser may be or become interested in the Fund as a shareholder or otherwise."
"2651","</P>"
"2652","<P align=left>3. (a) For the services and facilities to be furnished hereunder,"
"2653","the Adviser shall receive a monthly management fee equal to the sum of (i) the"
"2654","annual rate of 0.25% of the average daily net assets of the Portfolio (computed"
"2655","in the manner set forth in the Trust Instrument) throughout the month, which is"
"2656","retained by the Adviser and (ii) the total fees payable monthly to the"
"2657","sub-advisers retained by the Fund and the Adviser pursuant to investment"
"2658","sub-advisory agreements, which, for each sub-adviser, is based on the average"
"2659","daily Portfolio Assets; provided, however, that the maximum aggregate annual"
"2660","management fee rate payable by the Portfolio shall not exceed 1.00% of the"
"2661","average daily net assets of the Portfolio and that the fee, so computed, be"
"2662","reduced by the compensation, including reimbursement of expenses, paid by the"
"2663","Portfolio to those Trustees who are not interested persons of the Fund or the"
"2664","Adviser. For purposes of calculating the fee payable to each sub-adviser,"
"2665","Portfolio Assets shall mean the portion of the net assets of the Portfolio"
"2666","managed by the relevant sub-adviser. </P>"
"2667","<P align=left>(b) The Adviser shall pay the sub-advisers the fees described in"
"2668","clause (a)(ii) above pursuant to, and in accordance with, the investment"
"2669","sub-advisory agreements. </P>"
"2670","<P align=left>(c) In case of initiation or termination of this Contract during"
"2671","any month, the fee for that month shall be reduced proportionately on the basis"
"2672","of the number of business days during which it is in effect, and the fee"
"2673","computed upon the average net assets for the business days it is so in effect"
"2674","for that month. </P>"
"2675","<P align=left>4. The services of the Adviser to the Portfolio are not to be"
"2676","deemed exclusive, the Adviser being free to render services to others and engage"
"2677","in other activities, provided, however, that such other services and activities"
"2678","do not, during the term of this Contract, interfere, in a material manner, with"
"2679","the Adviser's ability to meet all of its obligations with respect to rendering"
"2680","services to the Portfolio hereunder. In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad"
"2681","faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of obligations or duties hereunder"
"2682","on the part of the Adviser, the Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the"
"2683","Portfolio or to any shareholder of the Portfolio for any act or omission in the"
"2684","course of, or connected with, rendering services hereunder or for any losses"
"2685","that may be sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security or other"
"2686","investment instrument. </P>"
"2687","<P align=left>5. Subject to the prior written approval of the Trustees of the"

"2801","<P align=left>1. (a) Investment Advisory Services. The Adviser undertakes to act"
"2802","as investment adviser of the Portfolio and shall, subject to the supervision of"
"2803","the Fund's Board of Trustees, direct the investments of the Portfolio in"
"2804","accordance with the investment objective, policies and limitations as provided"

"2813","Adviser and of all personnel of the Fund or the Adviser performing services"
"2814","relating to research, statistical and investment activities. The Adviser is"
"2815","authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with the Portfolio,"
"2816","to buy, sell, lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities"
"2817","and investment instruments on behalf of the Portfolio. The investment policies"
"2818","and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times be subject to"
"2819","the control and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees. </P>"
"2820","<P align=left>(b) Management Services. The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for"
"2821","the performance by its affiliates of) the management and administrative services"
"2822","necessary for the operation of the Fund. The Adviser shall, subject to the"
"2823","supervision of the Board of Trustees of the Fund, perform various services for"
"2824","the Portfolio, including but not limited to: (i) providing the Portfolio with"
"2825","office space, equipment and facilities (which may be its own) for maintaining"
"2826","its organization; (ii) on behalf of the Portfolio, supervising relations with,"
"2827","and monitoring the performance of, any sub-advisers, custodians, depositories,"
"2828","transfer and pricing agents, accountants, attorneys, underwriters, brokers and"
"2829","dealers, insurers and other persons in any capacity deemed to be necessary or"
"2830","desirable; (iii) preparing all general shareholder communications, including"

"2832","Fund's existence and its records; (vi) during such times as shares are publicly"
"2833","offered, maintaining the registration and qualification of the Portfolio's"
"2834","shares under federal and state law; and (vii) investigating the development of"
"2835","and developing and implementing, if appropriate, management and shareholder"
"2836","services designed to enhance the value or convenience of the Portfolio as an"
"2837","investment vehicle. </P>"
"2838","<P align=left>The Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations,"
"2839","information or analyses to the Fund as the Fund's Board of Trustees may request"
"2840","from time to time or as the Adviser may deem to be desirable. The Adviser shall"
"2841","make recommendations to the Fund's Board of Trustees with respect to Fund"
"2842","policies, and shall carry out such policies as are adopted by the Trustees. The"
"2843","Adviser shall, subject to review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other"
"2844","services as the Adviser shall from time to time determine to be necessary or"
"2845","useful to perform its obligations under this Contract. </P>"
"2846","<P align=left>(c) The Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale"
"2847","of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's account with brokers or dealers"
"2848","selected by the Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with"
"2849","the Adviser. The Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio"
"2850","transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission"
"2851","rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received. In selecting"
"2852","brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or"
"2853","dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as"
"2854","those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)"
"2855","to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Adviser or its"
"2856","affiliates exercise investment discretion. The Adviser is authorized to pay a"
"2857","broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission"
"2858","for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess of"
"2859","the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"2860","effecting that transaction if the Adviser determines in good faith that such"
"2861","amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"2862","research services provided by such broker or dealer. This determination may be"
"2863","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"2864","responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to"
"2865","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. The Trustees of the"
"2866","Fund shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to"
"2867","determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were"
"2868","reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio. </P>"
"2869","<P align=left>The Adviser shall, in acting hereunder, be an independent"
"2870","contractor. The Adviser shall not be an agent of the Portfolio. </P>"
"2871","<P id=C__\desktop\Strat_1\q77q1_managementcontract2.html.2 align=left>2. It is"
"2872","understood that the Trustees, officers and shareholders of the Fund are or may"
"2873","be or become interested in the Adviser as directors, officers or otherwise and"
"2874","that directors, officers and stockholders of the Adviser are or may be or become"
"2875","similarly interested in the Fund, and that the Adviser may be or become"
"2876","interested in the Fund as a shareholder or otherwise. </P>"

"2878","the Adviser shall receive a monthly management fee equal to the <U>sum of</U>"
"2879","(i) the annual rate of 0.25% of the average daily net assets of the Portfolio"
"2880","(computed in the manner set forth in the Trust Instrument) throughout the month,"
"2881","which is retained by the Adviser and (ii) the total fees payable monthly to the"
"2882","sub-advisers retained by the Fund and the Adviser pursuant to investment"
"2883","sub-advisory agreements, which, for each sub-adviser, is based on the average"
"2884","daily Portfolio Assets; <U>provided however</U>, that the maximum aggregate"
"2885","annual management fee rate payable by the Portfolio shall not exceed 0.95% of"
"2886","the average daily net assets of the Portfolio. For purposes of calculating the"
"2887","fee payable to each sub-adviser, Portfolio Assets shall mean the portion of"
"2888","the net assets of the Portfolio managed by the relevant sub-adviser. </P>"
"2889","<P align=left>(b) The Adviser shall pay the sub-advisers the fees described in"
"2890","clause (a)(ii) above pursuant to, and in accordance with, the investment"
"2891","sub-advisory agreements. </P>"
"2892","<P align=left>(c) In the case of initiation or termination of this contract"
"2893","during any month, the fee for that month shall be reduced proportionately on the"
"2894","basis of the number of business days during which it is in effect and the fee"
"2895","computed upon the average net assets for the business days it is so in effect"
"2896","for that month. </P>"
"2897","<P align=left>4. It is understood that the Portfolio will pay all its expenses"
"2898","other than those expressly stated to be payable by the Adviser hereunder, which"
"2899","expenses payable by the Portfolio shall include, without limitation, (i)"
"2900","interest and taxes; (ii) brokerage commissions and other costs in connection"

"2916","Portfolio is a party and the legal obligation which the Portfolio may have to"
"2917","indemnify the Fund's Trustees and officers with respect thereto. </P>"
"2918","<P align=left>5. The services of the Adviser to the Portfolio are not to be"
"2919","deemed exclusive, the Adviser being free to render services to others and engage"
"2920","in other activities, <U>provided, however</U>, that such other services and"
"2921","activities do not, during the term of this Contract, interfere, in a material"
"2922","manner, with the Adviser's ability to meet all of its obligations with respect"
"2923","to rendering services to the Portfolio hereunder. In the absence of willful"
"2924","misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of obligations or"
"2925","duties hereunder on the part of the Adviser, the Adviser shall not be subject to"
"2926","liability to the Portfolio or to any shareholder of the Portfolio for any act or"
