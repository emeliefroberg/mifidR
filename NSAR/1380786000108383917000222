"1380","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1381","(United States), we considered the Funds internal control over"
"1382","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"1383","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1384","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"
"1385","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
