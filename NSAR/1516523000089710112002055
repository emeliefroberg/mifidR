"486","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Arial,sans-serif; margin: 0>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Advisers"
"487","Investment Trust (&quot;the Trust&quot;) as of and for the period ended September 30, 2012, in accordance with the standards of"
"488","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust&rsquo;s internal control over financial"
"489","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"490","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"491","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not"

"494","<P STYLE=font: 12pt Times New Roman,serif; margin: 0><FONT STYLE=font: 10pt Arial,sans-serif>The management of the Trust is"
"495","responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"496","estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company&rsquo;s"
"497","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"498","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"499","A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"500","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"501","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"502","with</FONT> <FONT STYLE=font: 10pt Arial,sans-serif>generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures"
"503","of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide"
"504","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company&rsquo;s"
"505","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</FONT></P>"
"506","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Arial,sans-serif; margin: 0>&nbsp;</P>"
"507","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Arial,sans-serif; margin: 0>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"508","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"509","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"510","or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"
"511","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Arial,sans-serif; margin: 0>&nbsp;</P>"
"512","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Arial,sans-serif; margin: 0>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"513","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"514","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"515","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Trust's"
"516","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</P>"

"521","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trust&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting and its"
