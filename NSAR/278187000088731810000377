"606","<TEXT>"
"607","       Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"608","The Board of Directors and Shareholders"
"609","Prudential High Yield Fund, Inc.:"
"610","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"611","financial statements of Prudential High Yield"
"612","Fund, Inc."
"613","(formerly Dryden High Yield Fund, Inc.)"
"614","(hereafter referred to as the ?Fund?), as of"
"615","and for the year"
"616","ended August 31, 2010, in accordance with the"
"617","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"618","Oversight"
"619","Board (United States), we considered the Fund's"
"620","internal control over financial reporting,"
"621","including"
"622","controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"623","basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"624","the purpose of"
"625","expressing our opinion on the financial"
"626","statements and to comply with the requirements"
"627","of Form N-SAR,"
"628","but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"629","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"630","internal control over"
"631","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"632","such opinion."
"633","Management of the Fund is responsible for"
"634","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"635","control over"
"636","financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"637","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"638","management are required"
"639","to assess the expected benefits and related"
"640","costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"641","over financial"
"642","reporting is a process designed to provide"
"643","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability"
"644","of financial"
"645","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"646","statements for external purposes in accordance"
"647","with generally"
"648","accepted accounting principles. A company's"
"649","internal control over financial reporting"
"650","includes those"
"651","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"652","maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"653","detail, accurately"
"654","and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"655","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"656","provide reasonable"
"657","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"658","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"659","statements in"
"660","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"661","principles, and that receipts and expenditures"
"662","of the"
"663","company are being made only in accordance with"
"664","authorizations of management and directors of"
"665","the"
"666","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"667","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"668","unauthorized"
"669","acquisition, use, or disposition of the"
"670","company's assets that could have a material"
"671","effect on the financial"
"672","statements."
"673","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"674","control over financial reporting may not"
"675","prevent or detect"
"676","misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"677","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"678","are subject to the risk"
"679","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"680","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"681","compliance"
"682","with the policies or procedures may"
"683","deteriorate."
"684","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"685","reporting exists when the design or operation"
"686","of a control"
"687","does not allow management or employees, in the"
"688","normal course of performing their assigned"
"689","functions, to"
"690","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
"691","basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"692","a combination"
"693","of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"694","financial reporting, such that there is a"
"695","reasonable possibility that a"
"696","material misstatement of the Fund's annual or"
"697","interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"698","detected on a timely basis."
"699","Our consideration of the Fund's internal"
"700","control over financial reporting was for the"
"701","limited purpose"
"702","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"703","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"704","control that"
"705","might be material weaknesses under standards"
"706","established by the Public Company Accounting"
"707","Oversight"
"708","Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"709","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over"
"710","financial"
"711","reporting and its operation, including controls"
"712","over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"713","be a"
"714","material weakness as defined above as of August 31,"
"715","2010."
"716","This report is intended solely for the information"
"717","and use of management and the Board of Directors of"
"718","the Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and"
"719","is not intended to be and should not be used"
