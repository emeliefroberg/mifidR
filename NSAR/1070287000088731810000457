"700","Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal"

"702","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"703","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"

"710","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"

"719","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"720","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"721","of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"722","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"723","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"724","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"725","company are being made only in accordance with"
"726","authorizations of management and trustees of the company;"
"727","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"728","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"729","disposition of the company's assets that could have a material"
"730","effect on the financial statements."
"731","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"732","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"733","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"734","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"735","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"736","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"737","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"738","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"739","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"740","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"741","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"742","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"743","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"744","material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial"
"745","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"746","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"747","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"748","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"749","in internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"750","standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"751","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"752","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"753","reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"754","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material"
"755","weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2010."
"756","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"757","management and the Board of Trustees of the Fund and the"
"758","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be"
