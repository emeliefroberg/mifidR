"478","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"479","Shareholders and Board of Directors"
"480","Stratton Real Estate Fund, Inc."
"481","Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania"
"482","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"483","of Stratton Real Estate Fund, Inc., for the year ended December"
"484","31, 2009, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"485","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered their"
"486","internal control over financial reporting, including control"
"487","activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"488","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"489","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"490","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"491","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"492","internal control over financial reporting.   Accordingly, we"
"493","express no such opinion."
"494","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"495","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"496","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"497","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"498","related costs of controls.   A company's internal control over"
"499","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"500","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"501","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"502","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.   A"
"503","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"504","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"505","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"506","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"507","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"508","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"509","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"510","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"511","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"512","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"513","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"514","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"515","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"516","statements."
"517","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"518","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.   Also,"
"519","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"520","are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"521","because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"522","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"523","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"524","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"525","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"526","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"527","a timely basis.   A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"528","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"529","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"530","material misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"531","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"532","timely basis."
"533","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"534","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"535","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"536","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"537","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"538","Board (United States).   However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"539","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"540","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, which"
"541","we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above, as of"
"542","December 31, 2009."
"543","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"544","management, Shareholders and Board of Directors of Stratton Real"
"545","Estate Fund, Inc. and the Securities and Exchange Commission,"
"546","and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"547","than these specified parties."

"559","                       Dividend REIT Shares, Inc.)"
"560","            N-SAR July 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009"

"562","           Policies with Respect to Security Investments"
"563","Effective September 30, 2009, the name of Stratton Monthly"
"564","Dividend REIT Shares, Inc. changed to Stratton Real Estate Fund,"
"565","Inc. (Fund).  The Fund no longer declares dividends on a"
"566","monthly basis.  Rather, the Fund expects to declare and pay"
"567","dividends, if any, semi-annually, however it may declare and pay"
"568","dividends more frequently."
"569","The Fund's new investment objective is total return through"
"570","investment in real estate securities.  In pursuing total return,"
"571","the Fund will emphasize both capital appreciation and current income."
"572","The Fund's new principal investment strategies are as follows:"
"573","*	Under normal circumstances, the Fund seeks to achieve its"
"574","objective by investing at least 80% of its assets in"
"575","securities of real estate and real estate related"
"576","companies, or in companies which own significant real"
"577","estate assets at the time of purchase (real estate
companies) and may include Real Estate Investment Trusts"
"578","(REITs).  A real estate company generally derives at"
"579","least 50% of its revenue from the ownership, construction,"
"580","financing, management or sale of commercial, industrial, or"
"581","residential real estate, or has at least 50% of its assets"
"582","in such real estate.  REITs are companies that own"
"583","interests in real estate or in real estate related loans or"
"584","other interests, and their revenue primarily consists of"
"585","rent derived from owned, income producing real estate"
"586","properties and capital gains from the sale of such"
"587","properties."
"588","*	Examples of companies that might be included in the"
"589","Stratton Real Estate Fund portfolio are, but are not"
"590","limited to, the following:"
"591","REITs; real estate operating companies; homebuilders;"
"592","companies engaged in the construction, distribution, sale"
"593","and financing of manufactured housing; hotel and hotel"
"594","management companies; real estate brokerage companies"
"595","and/or management companies; financial institutions that"
"596","make or service mortgage loans; manufacturers or"
"597","distributors of construction materials and/or building"
"598","supplies; mortgage or title insurance companies; lumber,"
"599","paper, forest product, timber and mining and oil companies;"
"600","companies with significant real estate holdings such as"
"601","supermarkets, restaurant chains and retail chains."
"602","*	The Fund may invest in equity securities of issuers of any"
"603","size and debt securities of any maturities."
"604","*	The Fund may invest in securities of foreign issuers which"
"605","meet the same criteria for investment as domestic"
"606","companies, or sponsored and unsponsored depository receipts"
"607","for such securities."
"608","In addition, for temporary defensive purposes the Fund may now"
"609","invest, without limitation, in non-convertible preferred stocks,"
"610","debt securities and domestic corporate and government fixed"
"611","income obligations.  To the extent such investments are made,"
"612","the Fund may not achieve its investment objectives."
