"1827","fund invests at least 80% of its assets, determined"
"1828","at the time of purchase, in the stocks and other"
"1829","securities with equity characteristics of non-US"
"1830","companies. The fund typically achieves its equity"
"1831","exposure to non-US equity securities through investing"
"1832","in American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), but is not"
"1833","limited to investments in ADRs. The fund may invest"
"1834","up to 50% of its assets in emerging markets securities."
"1835","The fund's equity investments are mainly common stocks,"
"1836","but may also include other types of equities such"
"1837","as preferred stocks or convertible securities. The"
"1838","fund may also invest up to 20% of its assets in cash"
"1839","equivalents, US investment-grade fixed-income securities,"
"1840","and US stocks and other equities."
"1841","Management process. Portfolio management employs a value"
"1842","strategy and looks for companies it believes are"
"1843","undervalued. These are typically companies that portfolio"
"1844","management believes have been historically sound but are"
"1845","temporarily out of favor. Portfolio management uses a"
"1846","variety of quantitative screens to compare a company's"
"1847","stock price to earnings, book value, cash flow and dividend"
"1848","yield, and analyze individual companies to identify those"
"1849","that portfolio management believes are financially sound"
"1850","and appear to have strong potential for long-term growth."
"1851","The company valuations are compared on an absolute basis"
"1852","as well as within their respective industries."
"1853","To further narrow the universe, portfolio management"
"1854","analyzes factors such as price momentum, earnings estimate"
"1855","revisions and fundamental changes. After narrowing the"
"1856","universe through a combination of qualitative and fundamental"
"1857","research, portfolio management evaluates and selects the"
"1858","45 to 60 stocks typically held by the fund."
"1859","Benchmark:"
"1860","Effective June 21, 2010, the index benchmark for the fund"
"1861","has been changed from the Morgan Stanley Capital International"
"1862","(MSCI) Europe, Australasia and Far East (EAFE) Index to the"
"1863","Russell Global Ex-US Value Index, because portfolio management"
"1864","believes that it better reflects the fund's investment strategy."

"1875","Litigation Update"
"1876","Federal Court Market Timing Litigation:A number of"
"1877","private lawsuits have been filed including purported"
"1878","class and derivative lawsuits, making various"
"1879","allegations and naming as defendants various persons,"
"1880","including certain Scudder and Deutsche (now DWS)"
"1881","funds (singularly, a Fund and collectively, the"
"1882","Funds), the Funds' investment advisors and their"
"1883","affiliates, certain individuals (including in some"
"1884","cases Fund Trustees/Directors, officers), and other"
"1885","parties.  Each Fund's investment advisor has agreed"
"1886","to indemnify the applicable Funds in connection with"
"1887","these lawsuits, or other lawsuits or regulatory"
"1888","actions that may be filed making allegations similar"
"1889","to these lawsuits regarding market timing, revenue"
"1890","sharing, fund valuation or other subjects related to"
"1891","investigations of the foregoing matters.  Based on"
"1892","currently available information, the Funds'"
"1893","investment advisors believe the likelihood that the"
"1894","pending lawsuits will have a material adverse"
"1895","financial impact on a Fund is remote and such actions"
"1896","are not likely to materially affect their ability to"
"1897","perform under their investment management agreements"
"1898","with the Funds."
"1899","Fifteen class and derivative actions pertaining to"
"1900","market timing have been consolidated and transferred"
"1901","to a Multidistrict Litigation Panel in the District"
"1902","of Maryland (MDL) (Multidistrict Litigation 1586-In"
"1903","re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation).  The 11"
"1904","Complaints originally filed in the Southern District"
"1905","of New York that were transferred to the MDL were"
"1906","virtually identical and each asserted claims against"
"1907","Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Investment Management"
"1908","Americas Inc. (DIMA) and Deutsche Asset Management,"
"1909","Inc. as well as approximately 85 Funds in the Scudder"
"1910","and Deutsche family of funds and John Doe defendants."
"1911","The three cases that were originally filed in the"
"1912","Eastern District of New York and the one case"
"1913","originally filed in the District of Delaware are"
"1914","derivative actions brought by purported shareholders"
"1915","in certain of the Funds.  These actions are against"
"1916","Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc.,"
"1917","Deutsche Asset Management, Inc., and John Doe"
"1918","defendants."
"1919","On September 29, 2004, two consolidated amended"
"1920","complaints, one a Consolidated Amended Class Action"
"1921","Complaint and the other a Consolidated Amended Fund"
"1922","Derivative Complaint, were filed in the MDL."
"1923","On January 11, 2006, Plaintiffs filed a Second"
"1924","Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint in the"
"1925","MDL.  The officer defendants have been voluntarily"
"1926","dismissed from the class action pursuant to a tolling"
"1927","agreement with Plaintiffs.  Deutsche Bank AG has been"
"1928","dismissed from the derivative action.  On March 16,"
"1929","2007, the Court issued an opinion in the MDL granting"
"1930","in part and denying in part the Deutsche Defendants'"
"1931","motion to dismiss the Second Consolidated Amended"
"1932","Class Action Complaint."
"1933","Plaintiffs filed a Third Consolidated Amended Class"
"1934","Action Complaint (Third Amended Complaint) on"
"1935","December 10, 2007 in the MDL.  In the Third Amended"
"1936","Complaint, the Plaintiffs added the names of Funds"
"1937","that they allegedly purchased or held during the"
"1938","class period.  In addition, as contemplated in the"
"1939","Court's scheduling order, the Third Amended Complaint"
"1940","added a new Plaintiff in an attempt to address"
"1941","standing challenges raised by the Defendants.  On"
"1942","January 16, 2008, the Court granted in part and"
"1943","denied in part the Defendants' motion to dismiss"
"1944","certain claims on standing grounds.  The parties"
"1945","conducted extensive discovery.  The Defendants filed"
"1946","a motion for summary judgment and various related"
"1947","motions, and Class Plaintiffs contemporaneously filed"
"1948","a motion for class certification. The Court heard"
"1949","oral argument on these motions on December 10-11,"
"1950","2008."
"1951","On February 12, 2010, the parties agreed to a"
"1952","stipulation and agreement of settlement.  Plaintiffs"
"1953","filed their motions for preliminary approval of the"
"1954","settlement with the Court on April 21, 2010.  The"
"1955","Court conducted a hearing on May 7, 2010 on those"
"1956","motions and granted preliminary approval of the"
"1957","settlements on May 19, 2010.  Afterward, class"
"1958","notices were distributed to shareholders, and on"
"1959","September 14, 2010, plaintiffs filed their motion for"
"1960","final approval of the settlement, which was"
"1961","supplemented by a reply brief filed on October 6,"
"1962","2010.  On October 21-22, 2010, the Court conducted a"
"1963","hearing on the motion for final approval of the"
"1964","settlement.  The Court granted the motion on October"
"1965","25, 2010 and entered a judgment approving a"
"1966","settlement class, approving the settlements,"
"1967","dismissing the claims against the Defendants in the"
"1968","MDL, and enjoining Plaintiffs and class members from"
"1969","instituting, commencing or prosecuting any claims"
"1970","subject to the settlement against the Defendants."
"1971","State Court Market Timing Litigation:"
"1972","On September 16, 2003, an action was commenced in the"
"1973","Circuit Court for Madison County, Illinois, entitled"
"1974","Potter v. Janus Investment Fund, et al.  Defendants"
"1975","include, among others, DIMA and the Scudder"
"1976","International Fund. On October 23, 2003, Defendants"
"1977","removed the action to the United States District"
"1978","Court for the Southern District of Illinois. On"
"1979","February 9, 2004 the District Court remanded the case"
"1980","back to the Circuit Court for Madison County."
"1981","Defendants appealed this decision.  On April 5, 2005"
"1982","the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the"
"1983","District Court's decision and instructed the District"
"1984","Court to undo the remand order and dismiss the"
"1985","complaint.  On May 27, 2005, the District Court, in"
"1986","accord with the Seventh Circuit's mandate, dismissed"
"1987","the action with prejudice.  On September 29, 2005,"
"1988","Plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari"
"1989","to the Supreme Court of the United States.  On"
"1990","January 6, 2006, the Supreme Court granted the"
"1991","petition to address jurisdictional questions.  On"
"1992","June 15, 2006, the Supreme Court vacated the decision"
"1993","of the Seventh Circuit and held that the Court of"
"1994","Appeals did not have jurisdiction to address the"
"1995","District Court's remand order.  The case was remanded"
"1996","to and reopened in the Circuit Court for Madison"
"1997","County.  On November 13, 2006, Defendants removed the"
"1998","case to Federal District Court for a second time.  On"
"1999","April 6, 2007, the District Court remanded the case"
"2000","back to the Circuit Court for Madison County."
"2001","Defendants appealed this decision to the Seventh"
"2002","Circuit, which dismissed the appeal for lack of"
"2003","jurisdiction on July 13, 2007.  The case is now back"
"2004","in the Circuit Court for Madison County.  Argument on"
"2005","Defendants' motion to dismiss occurred in August"
"2006","2007, and the parties are awaiting the Circuit"
"2007","Court's decision.  The Circuit Court issued an Order"
"2008","dated July 16, 2008 stating that the issues raised by"
"2009","the motion to dismiss are nearly identical to those"
"2010","in a pending appeal in an action involving the Putnam"
"2011","funds, and that the Court would therefore wait for"
"2012","the decision of the Illinois Appellate Court in that"
"2013","case before ruling on the motion to dismiss."
"2014","On January 6, 2010, the Illinois Appellate Court"
"2015","ruled in favor of the Putnam fund defendants and"
"2016","against Plaintiffs in that action, holding that"
"2017","Plaintiffs' claims are precluded by the Securities"
"2018","Litigation Uniform Standards Act.  Plaintiffs filed a"
"2019","motion for rehearing in the Illinois Appellate Court,"
"2020","which was denied on February 16, 2010.  The Illinois"
"2021","Appellate Court issued its mandate on March 30, 2010,"
"2022","and on April 5, 2010, the Circuit Court dismissed the"
"2023","Putnam action with prejudice.  On April 15, 2010,"
"2024","Defendants in the Scudder action filed a supplemental"
"2025","memorandum in support of their pending motion to"
"2026","dismiss.  On April 15, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a"
"2027","motion in the Putnam case to modify the order"
"2028","dismissing that action and for leave to file an"
"2029","amended complaint.  On April 20, 2010, Plaintiffs"
"2030","filed a motion for leave to file a Second Amended"
"2031","Complaint in the Scudder action, which Defendants"
"2032","opposed.  On July 22, 2010, the Court denied"
"2033","Plaintiffs' motion but granted leave for Plaintiffs"
"2034","to file an amended complaint within twenty-one days"
"2035","that does not include any class-action-based"
"2036","allegations or prayers for relief.  Subsequently,"
"2037","Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the"
"2038","Court's July 22, 2010 Order or, in the alternative,"
"2039","for certification of an interlocutory appeal."
"2040","Defendants filed their opposition to that motion on"
"2041","August 25, 2010.  The Court has set a hearing on the"
"2042","motion for November 16, 2010."
"2043","Federal Court Revenue Sharing Litigation:"
"2044","The following purported class actions pertaining to"
"2045","revenue sharing were filed in the Southern District"
"2046","of New York: Walker v. Deutsche Bank AG, et al.,"
"2047","Mazza v. Deutsche Bank AG, et al. and Icardo v."
"2048","Deutsche Bank AG, et al.  These three class actions"
