"660","SETTLED ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO MARKET TIMING"
"661","          On October 8, 2004, Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco), successor by"
"662","merger to Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc. and INVESCO Funds Group, Inc. (IFG), both"
"663","former investment advisers, along with Invesco Aim Distributors, n/k/a Invesco"
"664","Distributors, Inc. (Invesco Distributors) reached final settlements with certain"
"665","regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York"
"666","Attorney General and the Colorado Attorney General, to resolve civil enforcement"
"667","actions and/or investigations related to market timing and related activity in"
"668","the AIM Funds (n/k/a the Invesco Funds), including those formerly advised by"
"669","IFG. As part of the settlements, a $325 million fair fund ($110 million of which"
"670","is civil penalties) was created to compensate shareholders harmed by market"
"671","timing and related activity in funds formerly advised by IFG. Additionally,"
"672","Invesco and Invesco Distributors created a $50 million fair fund ($30 million of"
"673","which is civil penalties) to compensate shareholders harmed by market timing and"
"674","related activity in funds advised by Invesco, which was done pursuant to the"
"675","terms of the settlement. The methodology of the fair funds distributions was"
"676","determined by Invesco's independent distribution consultant (IDC Plan), in"
"677","consultation with Invesco and the independent trustees of the Invesco Funds, and"
"678","approved by the SEC on May 23, 2008."
"679","          The IDC Plan provides for distribution to all eligible investors, for"
"680","the periods spanning January 1, 2000 through July 31, 2003 (for the IFG Fair"
"681","Fund) and January 1, 2001 through September 30, 2003 (for the AIM Fair Fund),"
"682","their proportionate share of the applicable Fair Fund to compensate such"
"683","investors for injury they may have suffered as a result of market timing in the"
"684","affected funds. The IDC Plan includes a provision for any residual amounts in"
"685","the Fair Funds to be distributed in the future to the affected funds. Further"
"686","details regarding the IDC Plan and distributions thereunder are available on"
"687","Invesco's Web site, available at http://www.invesco.com/us."
"688","At the present time, management of Invesco and the Invesco Funds are unable to"
"689","estimate the impact, if any, that the outcome of the Pending Litigation and"
"690","Regulatory Inquiries described herein may have on Invesco, Invesco Distributors"
"691","or the Invesco Funds."
"692","Pending Regulatory Action Alleging Market Timing"
"693","          On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Office of the State Auditor -"
"694","Securities Commission (WVASC) issued a Summary Order to Cease and Desist and"
"695","Notice of Right to Hearing to Invesco and Invesco Distributors (Order No."
"696","05-1318). The WVASC makes findings of fact that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"697","entered into certain arrangements permitting market timing of the Invesco Funds"
"698","and failed to disclose these arrangements in the prospectuses for such Funds,"
"699","and conclusions of law to the effect that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"700","violated the West Virginia securities laws. The WVASC orders Invesco and Invesco"
"701","Distributors to cease any further violations and seeks to impose monetary"
"702","sanctions, including restitution to affected investors, disgorgement of fees,"
"703","reimbursement of investigatory, administrative and legal costs and an"
"704","administrative assessment, to be determined by the Commissioner. Initial"
"705","research indicates that these damages could be limited or capped by statute. By"
"706","agreement with the Commissioner of Securities, Invesco's time to respond to that"
"707","Order has been indefinitely suspended."
"708","Private Civil Actions Alleging Market Timing"
"709","          Multiple civil lawsuits, including purported class action and"
