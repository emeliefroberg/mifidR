"1109","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"1110","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1111","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"1112","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"1113","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"1114","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"1115","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"1116","over financial reporting."
"1117","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"1118","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1119","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1120","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"1121","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"1122","A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1123","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1124","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1125","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1126","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1127","principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"1128","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1129","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1130","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1131","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1132","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1133","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1134","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"1135","and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"1136","made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1137","management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"1138","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1139","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1140","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1141","financial statements."
"1142","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1143","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1144","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1145","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1146","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1147","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1148","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1149","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1150","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1151","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1152","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1153","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1154","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1155","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1156","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1157","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1158","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1159","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"1160","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"1161","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1162","all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting"
"1163","that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"1164","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1165","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1166","in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and"
"1167","its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1168","securities, which we consider to be material weaknesses as"
"1169","defined above as of May 31, 2017."

"1190","Item 77D 	Deutsche Floating Rate Fund (a series of"
"1191","Deutsche Portfolio Trust)"
"1192","Effective January 10, 2017, the main investments of"
"1193","the Fund have been revised to the following:"
"1194","Main investments. Under normal market conditions,"
"1195","the fund invests at least 80% of its total assets in"
"1196","adjustable rate loans that have a senior right to"
"1197","payment (senior loans) and other floating rate debt"
"1198","securities. The fund may also borrow money in an"
"1199","amount up to 331/3% of the fund's total assets for a"
"1200","range of purposes, including to create investment"
"1201","leverage."
"1202","Senior loans are made by banks and other financial"
"1203","institutions, typically to large corporate customers."
"1204","Senior loans offer interest payments that typically"
"1205","vary with a benchmark indicator of prevailing interest"
"1206","rates, such as the prime rate offered by one or more"
"1207","major US banks or the London Interbank Offered"
"1208","Rate (LIBOR)."
"1209","Senior loans typically are of below investment-grade"
"1210","quality and, compared to investment grade loans, may"
"1211","pay higher yields and have higher volatility and"
"1212","higher risk of default on payments of interest or"
"1213","principal. The fund invests in senior loans that may"
"1214","not be rated by a rating agency, registered with the"
"1215","Securities and Exchange Commission or any state"
"1216","securities commission or listed on any national"
"1217","exchange."
"1218","The senior loans in which the fund invests are"
"1219","generally fully collateralized with assets and/or cash"
"1220","flow that portfolio management believes have a"
"1221","market value at the time of acquisition that equals or"
"1222","exceeds the principal amount of the senior loan. The"
"1223","loan arrangement may or may not require the"
"1224","borrower to pledge additional collateral to secure the"
"1225","senior loan if the value of the initial collateral"
"1226","declines. In addition, the fund may invest a portion of"
"1227","its assets in senior loans that are not secured by"
"1228","collateral. Such unsecured loans involve a greater risk"
"1229","of loss."
"1230","Senior loans generally are arranged through private"
"1231","negotiations between a borrower and a financial"
"1232","institution that acts as agent for the holder(s) of a"
"1233","loan. The fund generally acquires senior loans from,"
"1234","and sells senior loans to, financial institutions that act"
"1235","as lenders. The agent and the other original lenders"
"1236","typically have the right to sell interests"
"1237","(participations) in their share of the senior loan to"
"1238","other participants, and to assign all or a portion of"
"1239","their interests (assignments) in the senior loan to"
"1240","other participants. While the senior loan interests held"
"1241","by the fund typically will be structured as"
"1242","assignments, the fund may also purchase"
"1243","participations."
"1244","When the fund acquires an assignment, the fund"
"1245","typically will have a direct contractual relationship"
"1246","with the borrower and may enforce compliance by the"
"1247","borrower with the terms of the loan agreement. When"
"1248","the fund acquires a participation, the fund typically"
"1249","will have a contractual relationship only with the"
"1250","lender, not with the borrower, and therefore the fund"
"1251","generally will have no right to enforce compliance by"
"1252","the borrower with the terms of the loan agreement."
"1253","In addition to investments in US-dollar denominated"
"1254","loans of US companies, investments may include US-"
"1255","dollar denominated loans of non-US companies and"
"1256","non-US dollar denominated loans of both US and"
"1257","non-US companies. The fund may acquire senior"
"1258","loans of borrowers engaged in any industry, but will"
"1259","invest no more than 25% of its total assets in senior"
"1260","loans of borrowers and securities of issuers in any one"
"1261","industry. The fund does not have a targeted maturity"
"1262","range for its portfolio."
"1263","Under normal market conditions, up to 20% of the"
"1264","fund's total assets may be held in cash and other"
"1265","investments, including, but not limited to, fixed-rate"
"1266","debt obligations, short- to medium-term notes, high-"
"1267","yield securities, which are those rated below the"
"1268","fourth highest credit rating category (that is, grade"
"1269","BB/Ba and below, commonly referred to as junk"
"1270","bonds), equity securities, hybrid and synthetic loans,"
"1271","collateralized loan obligations, and asset-backed"
"1272","securities."
"1273","The fund may also invest in exchange-traded funds"
"1274","(ETFs) and affiliated mutual funds. The fund may"
"1275","invest up to 5% of total assets in each of ETFs or"
"1276","shares of Deutsche High Income Fund (which invests"
"1277","primarily in high yield bonds)."
