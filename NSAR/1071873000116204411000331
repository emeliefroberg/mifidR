"488","<P style=margin:0pt; line-height:14pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt align=justify>The management of The MP63 Fund, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of The MP63 Fund, Inc.; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of The MP63 Fund, Inc. are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of The MP63 Fund, Inc.; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"

"490","<P style=margin:0pt; line-height:14pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt align=justify>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"

"492","<P style=margin:0pt; line-height:14pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt align=justify>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of The MP63 Fund, Inc.'s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</P>"

However, we noted no deficiencies in The MP63 Fund, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of February 28, 2011.</P>"
