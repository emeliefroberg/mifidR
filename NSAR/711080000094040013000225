"2871","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"2872","of Touchstone Strategic Trust"
"2873","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"

"2875","Touchstone Diversified Small Cap Growth Fund, Touchstone"
"2876","Growth Opportunities Fund, Touchstone Large Cap Growth"
"2877","Fund, and Touchstone Mid Cap Growth Fund (the Trust) as"
"2878","of and for the year ended March 31, 2013, in accordance"
"2879","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"2880","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"2881","company's internal control over financial reporting,"
"2882","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"2883","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"2884","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"2885","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"2886","SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"2887","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over"
"2888","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"2889","opinion."
"2890","The management of the Trust is responsible for"
"2891","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"2892","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"2893","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"2894","required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"2895","costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"2896","financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"2897","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"2898","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"2899","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"2900","generally accepted accounting principles. A company's"
"2901","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"2902","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2903","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"2904","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2905","dispositions of the assets of the trust; (2) provide"
"2906","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2907","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"2908","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2909","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"2910","company are being made only in accordance with"
"2911","authorizations of management and trustees of the trust;"
"2912","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"2913","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"2914","disposition of the company's assets that could have a"
"2915","material effect on the financial statements."
"2916","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"2917","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2918","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2919","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"2920","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2921","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"2922","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2923","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"2924","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"2925","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"2926","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2927","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"2928","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2929","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"2930","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"2931","the company's annual or interim financial statements will"
"2932","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2933","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over"
"2934","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"2935","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"2936","all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"2937","material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"2938","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"

"2940","company's internal control over financial reporting and"
"2941","its operation, including controls over safeguarding"

"2943","defined above as of March 31, 2013."

"3052","On April 16, 2012, the Registrant acquired substantially all"
"3053","of the assets and liabilities of the OM Focused Fund an"
"3054","investment portfolio of Old Mutual Funds II (the OM Funds),"
"3055","another registered open-end investment company, pursuant to an"
"3056","Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated October 4, 2011"
"3057","(the Agreement)  and approved by the shareholders of the OM"
"3058","Funds  (the Reorganizations).  The Reorganizations were"
"3059","accomplished through a tax-free exchange of an equal aggregate"
"3060","value of newly-issued common shares of the Registrant.   The"
"3061","Boards of Trustees of each of the Registrant and the OM Funds"
"3062","approved its respective Reorganization."
"3063","On October 28, 2012, in connection with the Reorganizations,"
"3064","the Registrant filed a Preliminary Registration Statement on"
"3065","Form N-14 (the N-14 Registration Statement').  The N-14
Registration Statement contained the proxy materials
soliciting the approval of the Reorganizations by the
shareholders of the OM Funds.  A filing on Form 497 was made
on December 6, 2012.  Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to Form
N-14 was filed on November 30, 2011 and Post-Effective
Amendment No. 2 to Form N-14 was filed on April 27, 2012.  The
N-14 Registration Statement as amended was declared effective
by the Commission on April 27, 2012.
On April 16, 2012 (the Closing Date), pursuant to the
Agreement, the following acquisitions occurred:

1.	 Net assets of the OM Focused Fund valued at
$563,962,037 (24,707,139 shares outstanding) were
transferred  for 24,707,139 newly issued shares of the
Touchstone Focused Fund, a series of the Registrant;

The OM Funds filed an application for deregistration under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act),
on form N-8F on April 26, 2012. A Notice was issued May 25,
2012 and an order was issued under Section 8(f) of the 1940
Act declaring that the OM Funds ceased to be a registered
investment company under the 1940 Act.

as, a plan of reorganization within the meaning of the regulations under
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
Code).

      E.    Each reorganization shall consist of:  (1) all of the
Fund Assets (as defined below) of an Acquired Fund will be transferred
to the corresponding Acquiring Fund in exchange for the corresponding
class of the Acquiring Fund as set forth on Exhibit A to this Agreement
(each, a Corresponding Class) and the assumption by the corresponding
Acquiring Fund of all of the Acquired Fund's Liabilities (as defined
below), and (2) Corresponding Class shares of the corresponding
Acquiring Fund of equal value to the net assets of the Acquired Fund
being acquired will be distributed to holders of shares of the Acquired
Fund in the manner set forth in Exhibit A of this Agreement, in complete
liquidation and termination of the Acquired Fund, all upon the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement (each a Reorganization).

      F.    The Board of Trustees of the Acquired Trust (the
Old Mutual Board), including a majority of trustees who are not
interested persons (as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act)) (Independent"
"3067","Trustees) of the Acquired Trust, has determined with respect to each
Acquired Fund that: (1) participation in the Reorganization is in the
best interests of the Acquired Fund and its shareholders, and (2) the
value of the interests of existing shareholders of the Acquired Fund
will not be diluted as a result of its effecting the Reorganization.

      G.    The Board of Trustees of the Acquiring Trust (the
Touchstone Board), including a majority of Independent Trustees of the
Acquiring Trust, has determined with respect to each Acquiring Fund
that: (1) participation in the Reorganization is in the best interests
of the Acquiring Fund and its shareholders, if any, and (2) the value of
the interests of existing shareholders, if any, of the Acquiring Fund
will not be diluted as a result of its effecting the Reorganization.

      H.    The consummation of any Reorganization shall not be
contingent on the consummation of any other Reorganization and it is the
intention of the parties hereto that each Reorganization described
herein shall be conducted separately of the others.

      I.    For convenience, the balance of this Agreement
refers only to a single Reorganization, one Acquired Fund and one
Acquiring Fund, but the terms and conditions hereof shall apply
separately to each Reorganization and the Acquired Fund and Acquiring
Fund participating therein.

AGREEMENT:

      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises,
representations, and warranties made herein, covenants and agreements
hereinafter contained, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the Parties, and
Old Mutual Capital and Touchstone to the extent indicated above,
intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE REORGANIZATION

      1.1    The Reorganization.  In accordance with the Amended
and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust and the Amended and
Restated By-laws, as they may be amended from time to time, of the
Acquired Trust (the Old Mutual Governing Documents), at the Effective
Time (as defined below), upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and on the basis of the representations and warranties
contained herein, the Acquired Fund shall assign, deliver and otherwise
transfer all Fund Assets, subject to all of the liabilities of the
Acquired Fund (the Liabilities), to the Acquiring Fund, and the
Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the Liabilities of the Acquired
Fund.  In consideration of the foregoing, the Acquiring Fund, at the
Effective Time shall deliver to the Acquired Fund full and fractional
(to the third decimal place) shares of the Acquiring Fund.  The
aggregate number of shares of the Acquiring Fund shall be determined as
set forth in paragraph 2.3 by dividing (a) the value of the Fund Assets
attributable to the Acquired Fund, net of the Acquired Fund's
Liabilities (computed as of the Valuation Time (as defined below) in the
manner set forth in paragraph 2.1), by (b) the net asset value of one
share of the corresponding class of the Acquiring Fund shares (computed
as of the Valuation Time in the manner set forth in paragraph 2.2).
Holders of each class of shares of the Acquired Fund will receive shares
of the Corresponding Class, as set forth in Section E of the Recitals
and Exhibit A to this Agreement, of the Acquiring Fund, as set forth in
Section A of the Recitals. At and after the Effective Time, all of the
Fund Assets of the Acquired Fund shall become and be included in the
Fund Assets of the Acquiring Fund and the Liabilities of the Acquired
Fund shall become and be the Liabilities of and shall attach to the
Acquiring Fund.  At and after the Effective Time, the Liabilities of the
Acquired Fund may be enforced only against the Acquiring Fund to the
same extent as if such Liabilities had been incurred by the Acquiring
Fund subject to any defense and/or set off that the Acquired Fund was
entitled to assert immediately prior to the Effective Time and further
subject to any defense and/or setoff that the Acquiring Trust or the
Acquiring Fund may from time to time be entitled to assert.

      1.2          The Acquired Fund Assets.

            (a)    At least ten Business Days prior to the
Valuation Time, the Acquired Fund will provide the Acquiring Fund
with a schedule of the securities and other assets and Liabilities
of the Acquired Fund.  Prior to the execution of this Agreement,
the Acquiring Fund has provided the Acquired Fund with a copy of
its current investment objective, investment policies, principal
investment strategies, and restrictions and will provide the
Acquired Fund with a written notice of any changes thereto through
the Valuation Time.  The Acquired Fund reserves the right to sell
any of the securities or other assets shown on the schedule it
provides to the Acquiring Fund pursuant to this paragraph
1.2(a) in the ordinary course as necessary to meet distribution
and redemption requirements prior to the Valuation Time but will
not, without the prior approval of the Acquiring Fund, acquire any
additional securities other than securities which the Acquiring
Fund may purchase in accordance with its stated investment
objective and policies.

            (b)    At least five Business Days prior to the
Valuation Time, the Acquiring Fund will advise the Acquired Fund
of any investments of the Acquired Fund shown on the Acquired
Fund's schedule provided pursuant to paragraph 1.2(a) which the
Acquiring Fund would not be permitted to hold (i) under its
investment objective, principal investment strategies or
investment restrictions; (ii) under applicable Law; or
(iii) because the transfer of such investments would result in
material operational or administrative difficulties to the
Acquiring Fund in connection with facilitating the orderly
transition of the Acquired Fund's Fund Assets.  Under such
circumstances, to the extent practicable, the Acquired Fund will,
if requested by the Acquiring Fund and, to the extent permissible
and consistent with its own investment objectives and policies and
the fiduciary duties of the investment adviser or sub-adviser
responsible for the portfolio management of the Acquired Fund,
dispose of such investments prior to the Valuation Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein will require the
Acquired Fund to dispose of any portfolio securities or other
investments of the Acquired Fund, if, in the reasonable judgment
of the Old Mutual Board or the Acquired Fund's investment adviser
or sub-adviser, such disposition would adversely affect the tax-
free nature of the Reorganization for federal income tax purposes
or would otherwise not be in the best interests of the Acquired
Fund and its shareholders.

      1.3    Assumption of Liabilities.  The Acquired Fund will, to
the extent permissible and consistent with its own investment objectives
and policies, use its best efforts to discharge all of the Liabilities
of the Acquired Fund prior to or at the Effective Time.  The Acquiring
Fund will assume all of the Liabilities of the Acquired Fund.

      1.4    Distribution of Acquiring Fund Shares.  Immediately
upon receipt, the Acquired Fund will distribute the Corresponding
Class shares of the Acquiring Fund received by the Acquired Fund from
the Acquiring Fund pursuant to paragraph 1.1  pro rata to the record
holders of shares of the Acquired Fund.  Such distribution will be
accomplished by transferring the Acquiring Fund Shares then credited to
the Acquired Fund's account on the Books and Records of the Acquiring
Fund to open accounts on the Books and Records of the Acquiring Fund
established and maintained by the Acquiring Fund's transfer agent in the
names of record holders of the Acquired Fund and representing the
respective pro rata number of the Acquiring Fund Shares due to such
record holder.  All issued and outstanding shares of the Acquired Fund
will, without further notice, be cancelled promptly by the Acquired Fund
on the Acquired Fund's

Books and Records.  Any such shares issued and outstanding prior to such
cancellation shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Acquiring Fund Shares issued to the Acquired Fund in accordance with
paragraph 1.1 above.  In addition, each record holder of the Acquired
Fund shall have the right to receive any unpaid dividends or other
distributions which were declared with respect to his/her or its shares
of the Acquired Fund at or before the Valuation Time.

      1.5    Liquidation of the Acquired Fund.  As soon as
conveniently practicable after the distribution of the Acquiring Fund
Shares pursuant to paragraph 1.4 has been made, the Acquired Fund shall
take, in accordance with Delaware law, the 1940 Act and the Old Mutual
Governing Documents, all such other steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to effect a complete liquidation and termination of the
Acquired Fund.

      1.6    Transfer Taxes.  Any transfer taxes payable on
issuance of the Acquiring Fund Shares in a name other than that of the
record holder of the Acquired Fund shares on the Acquired Fund's Books
and Records shall be paid by the Person to whom such Acquiring Fund
Shares are issued and transferred, as a condition of that transfer.

ARTICLE II

VALUATION

      2.1    Net Asset Value of the Acquired Fund.  The net asset
value of a share of each class of the Acquired Fund shall be the net
asset value computed as of the Valuation Time, after the declaration and
payment of any dividends and/or other distributions on the date thereof,
using the valuation procedures described in the then-current prospectus
and statement of additional information of the Acquired Fund as
supplemented from time to time, or such other valuation procedures as
shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties.

      2.2    Net Asset Value of the Acquiring Fund.  The net asset
value per share of each Corresponding Class of the Acquiring Fund shall
be the net asset value per share of the Corresponding Class of the
Acquired Fund as of the Valuation Time.  The net asset value of the
Acquiring Fund and the Acquired Fund will be determined by using the
valuation procedures described in the then-current prospectus and
statement of additional information of the Acquired Fund as supplemented
from time to time, or such other valuation procedures as shall be
mutually agreed upon by the parties.

      2.3    Calculation of Number of Acquiring Fund Shares.  The
number of Acquiring Fund Shares to be issued (including fractional
shares (to the third decimal place), if any) in connection with the
Reorganization shall be the number of outstanding Acquired Fund Shares
as of the Valuation Time.

      2.4    Determination of Net Asset Value.  All computations of
net asset value and the value of securities transferred under this
Article II shall be made by BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc.
(BNY Mellon), sub-administrator for the Acquired Fund, in accordance
with its regular practice and the requirements of the 1940 Act.

      2.5          Valuation Time.  Valuation Time shall mean 4:00 PM
Eastern Time of the Business Day preceding the Effective Time.
ARTICLE III

EFFECTIVE TIME AND CLOSING

      3.1    Effective Time and Closing.  Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Reorganization shall occur immediately
prior to the opening of business on April 16, 2012, or on such other
date as may be mutually agreed in writing by an authorized officer of
each Party (the Effective Time).  To the extent any Fund Assets are,
for any reason, not transferred at the Effective Time, the Acquired Fund
shall cause such Fund Assets to be transferred in accordance with this
Agreement at the earliest practical date thereafter.  The closing of the
Reorganization shall be held in person, by facsimile, by e-mail or by
such other communication means as may be mutually agreed by the Parties,
at the Effective Time (the Closing).

      3.2    Transfer and Delivery of Fund Assets.  The Acquired
Fund shall direct The Bank of New York Mellon (Acquired Fund"
"3068","Custodian), as custodian for the Acquired Fund, to deliver to the
Acquiring Fund at the Closing, or promptly thereafter, consistent with
commercially reasonable standards, a certificate of an authorized
officer certifying that: (a) Acquired Fund Custodian delivered the Fund
Assets of the Acquired Fund to the Acquiring Fund at the Effective Time;
and (b) all necessary taxes in connection with the delivery of such Fund
Assets, including all applicable foreign, federal and state stock
transfer stamps and any other stamp duty taxes, if any, have been paid
or provision (as reasonably estimated) for payment has been made.

      3.3    Acquiring Fund Share Records. The Acquiring Fund shall
deliver to an officer of the Acquired Trust at the Closing a
confirmation evidencing that:  (a) the appropriate number of Acquiring
Fund Shares have been credited to the account of the Acquired Fund on
the Books and Records of the Acquired Fund pursuant to paragraph 1.1
prior to the actions contemplated by paragraph 1.4, and (b) the
appropriate number of Acquiring Fund Shares have been credited to the
accounts of record holders of the Acquired Fund shares on the Books and
Records of the Acquiring Fund pursuant to paragraph 1.4.

      3.4    Postponement of Valuation Time and Effective Time.  If
immediately prior to the Valuation Time:  (a) the NYSE or another
primary trading market for portfolio securities of the Acquiring Fund or
the Acquired Fund is closed to trading, or trading thereupon is
restricted, or (b) trading or the reporting of trading on such market is
disrupted so that, in the judgment of an appropriate officer of the
Acquired Fund or the Acquiring Fund, accurate appraisal of the value of
the net assets of the Acquiring Fund or the Acquired Fund is
impracticable, the Valuation Time and Effective Time shall be postponed
until the first Business Day that is a Friday after the day when trading
shall have been fully resumed and reporting shall have been restored or
such later date as may be mutually agreed in writing by an authorized
officer of each Party.

ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

      4.1    Representations and Warranties of the Acquired Trust.
The Acquired Trust, on behalf of the Acquired Fund, hereby represents
and warrants to the Acquiring Trust, on behalf of the Acquiring Fund, as
follows, which representations and warranties shall be true and correct
on the date hereof and agrees to confirm the continuing accuracy and
completeness of the following at the Effective Time:

            (a)    The Acquired Trust is a statutory trust
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Delaware and is duly qualified, licensed or
admitted to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
association under the Laws of each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification,
licensing or admission necessary, except in such jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or admitted and in
good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on its properties or assets or the
properties or assets of the Acquired Fund.  The Acquired Fund has
full power under the Old Mutual Governing Documents to conduct its
business as it is now being conducted and to own the properties
and assets it now owns.  The Acquired Fund has all necessary
authorizations, licenses and approvals from any applicable
Governmental or Regulatory Body necessary to carry on its business
as such business is now being carried on except authorizations,
licenses and approvals that the failure to so obtain would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Fund.

            (b)    The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Acquired Fund and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein will have been duly and validly
authorized by the Old Mutual Board, and the Old Mutual Board has
approved the Reorganization and has resolved to recommend the
Reorganization to the shareholders of the Acquired Fund and to
call a meeting of shareholders of the Acquired Fund for the
purpose of approving this Agreement and the Reorganization
contemplated hereby.  Other than the approval by the requisite
vote of the shareholders of the outstanding shares of the Acquired
Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Old Mutual Governing
Documents, applicable Delaware Law and the 1940 Act, no other
action on the part of the Acquired Fund or its shareholders is
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Acquired Fund or the consummation of the
Reorganization contemplated herein.  This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by the Acquired Trust on behalf
of the Acquired Fund and assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery hereof by the Acquiring Trust on behalf of the Acquiring
Fund, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Acquired
Trust, as it relates to the Acquired Fund, enforceable in
accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other Laws relating to
or affecting creditors' rights, to general equity principles and
to any limitations on indemnity as may be required under federal
and state securities Laws).

            (c)    The authorized capital of the Acquired
Fund consists of an unlimited number of shares of beneficial
interest with a par value of $0.001 per share.  Each share
represents a fractional undivided interest in the Acquired Fund.
The issued and outstanding shares of the Acquired Fund are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.  There
are no outstanding options, warrants or other rights of any kind
to acquire from the Acquired Fund any shares of any series or
equity interests of the Acquired Fund or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for, or which otherwise confer on the holder
thereof any right to acquire, any such additional shares, nor is
the Acquired Fund committed to issue any share appreciation or
similar rights or options, warrants, rights or securities in
connection with any series of shares. The Acquired Fund has no
share certificates outstanding.

            (d)    The Acquired Fund has no subsidiaries.

            (e)    Except for consents, approvals, or waivers
to be received prior to the Effective Time, including shareholder
approval by the Acquired Fund, and upon the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement (as defined below), the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by the Acquired Trust on behalf
of the Acquired Fund does not, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein will not:  (i) violate or
conflict with the terms, conditions or provisions of the Old
Mutual Governing Documents, or of any material contract,
agreement, indenture, instrument, or other undertaking to which
the Acquired Trust is a party or by which the Acquired Trust or
the Acquired Fund is bound, (ii) result in the acceleration of any
obligation, or the imposition of any penalty, under any material
agreement, indenture, instrument, contract, lease or other
undertaking to which the Acquired Trust is a party or by which the
Acquired Trust or the Acquired Fund is bound, (iii) result in a
breach or violation by the Acquired Trust or the Acquired Fund of
any terms, conditions, or provisions of any Law or Order, or
(iv) require any consent or approval of, filing with or notice to,
any Governmental or Regulatory Body other than such documents as
are necessary to terminate the Acquired Funds as a series of a
Delaware statutory trust.

            (f)    (i)    Prior to the execution of this
Agreement, the Acquired Fund has delivered to the Acquiring Trust
true and complete copies of the Acquired Fund's audited statements
of assets and liabilities of as of March 31, 2011, and unaudited
statements of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2011, or
a later date if available prior to the date hereof, and the
related audited schedules of investments, statements of income and
changes in net assets and financial highlights for the periods
then ended.

                  (ii)    Except as set forth in the notes thereto,
all such financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied
throughout the periods then ended, and fairly present the financial
condition and results of operations of the Acquired Fund as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods covered thereby
subject, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments.

                  (iii)    To the best of the Acquired Fund's
Knowledge, except as reflected or reserved against in the statement of
assets and liabilities included in the Acquired Fund's audited financial
statements as of March 31, 2011, and unaudited financial statements as
of September 30, 2011, or in the notes thereto, or as previously
disclosed in writing to the Acquiring Trust, there are no liabilities
against, relating to or affecting the Acquired Fund, other than those
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, which, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Acquired Fund.  In particular, since September 30,
2011 to the best of the Acquired Fund's Knowledge and except as
disclosed in writing to the Acquiring Trust, there has not been any
change in the financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities or
business of the Acquired Fund that would have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Acquired Fund or its properties or assets other than changes
occurring in the ordinary course of business.

            (g)    As of the date hereof, except as
previously disclosed to the Acquiring Fund in writing, and except
as have been corrected as required by applicable Law, and to the
best of the Acquired Fund's Knowledge, there have been no material
miscalculations of the net asset value of the Acquired Fund during
the twelve-month period preceding the date hereof which would have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Fund or its properties
or assets, and all such calculations have been made in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the 1940 Act.

            (h)    The minute books and other similar records
of the Acquired Trust as made available to the Acquiring Trust
prior to the execution of this Agreement contain a true and
complete record in all material respects of all material action
taken at all meetings and by all written consents in lieu of
meetings of the shareholders of the Acquired Fund, the Old Mutual
Board and committees of the Old Mutual Board.  The stock transfer
ledgers and other similar records of the Acquired Fund as made
available to the Acquiring Trust prior to the execution of this
Agreement accurately reflect all record transfers prior to the
execution of this Agreement in the shares of the Acquired Fund.

            (i)    The Acquired Fund has maintained, or
caused to be maintained on its behalf, in all material respects,
all Books and Records required of a registered investment company
in compliance with the requirements of Section 31 of the 1940 Act
and rules thereunder.

            (j)    Except as set forth in writing to the

assets other than changes occurring in the ordinary course of
business.

      4.2     Representations and Warranties of the Acquiring
Trust.  The Acquiring Trust, on behalf of the Acquiring Fund, hereby
represents and warrants to the Acquired Fund as follows, which
representations and warranties shall be true and correct on the date
hereof and agrees to confirm the continuing accuracy and completeness of
the following at the Effective Time:

            (a)    The Acquiring Trust is a business trust
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is duly qualified,
licensed or admitted to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign association under the Laws of each jurisdiction in which
the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification, licensing or admission necessary, except in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or
admitted and in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on its properties or
assets or the properties or assets of the Acquiring Fund.  The
Acquiring Fund has full power under the Acquiring Trust's Restated
Agreement and Declaration of Trust, as amended from time to time,
and By-laws (Touchstone Governing Documents) to conduct its
business as it is now being conducted and to own properties and
assets for itself.  The Acquiring Fund will prior to the Effective
Time have all necessary authorizations, licenses and approvals
from any applicable Governmental or Regulatory Body necessary to
carry on its business.

            (b)    The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Acquiring Trust on behalf of the Acquiring
Fund and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein
have been duly and validly authorized by the Touchstone Board and
the Touchstone Board has approved the Reorganization.  No action

Agreement by the Acquiring Trust on behalf of the Acquiring Fund
or the consummation of the Reorganization.  This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Acquiring
Trust on behalf of the Acquiring Fund, and assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Acquired Trust
on behalf of the Acquired Fund, is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Acquiring Trust, as it relates to the Acquiring
Fund, enforceable in accordance with its terms (subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights, to general
equity principles and to any limitations on indemnity as may be
required under federal and state securities Laws).

            (c)    The authorized capital of the Acquiring
Fund consists of an unlimited number of shares of beneficial
interest without par value.  As of the date of this Agreement, the
Acquiring Fund has no outstanding shares of any class.  As of the
Valuation Time, the outstanding shares of beneficial interest of
the Acquiring Fund will consist solely of shares having the
characteristics described in the Acquiring Fund's prospectus
effective at such time.  There are no outstanding options,
warrants or other rights of any kind to acquire from the Acquiring
Fund any shares of any series or equity interests of the Acquiring
Fund or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or which
otherwise confer on the holder thereof any right to acquire, any
such additional shares, nor is the Acquiring Fund committed to
issue any share appreciation or similar rights or options,
warrants, rights or securities in connection with any series of
shares.

            (d)    Except for consents, approvals, or waivers
to be received prior to the Effective Time, including shareholder
approval by the Acquired Fund, and upon the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Acquiring Trust on behalf of the Acquiring
Fund does not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein will not:  (i) violate or conflict with the
terms, conditions or provisions of the Touchstone Governing
Documents, or of any material contract, agreement, indenture,
instrument, or other undertaking to which the Acquiring Trust is a
party or by which the Acquiring Trust or the Acquiring Fund is
bound, (ii) result in the acceleration of any obligation, or the
imposition of any penalty, under any material agreement,
indenture, instrument, contract, lease or other undertaking to
which the Acquiring Trust is a party or by which the Acquiring
Trust or the Acquiring Fund is bound, (iii) result in a breach or
violation by the Acquiring Trust or the Acquiring Fund of any
terms, conditions, or provisions of any Law or Order, or
(iv) require any consent or approval of, filing with or notice to,

            (e)    Except as set forth in writing to the
Acquired Fund, there is no Action or Proceeding pending against
the Acquiring Trust or the Acquiring Fund or, to the best of the
Acquiring Trust's Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
affecting, the Acquiring Trust or the Acquiring Fund.

            (f)    No agent, broker, finder or investment or
commercial banker, or other Person or firm engaged by or acting on
behalf of the Acquiring Trust or the Acquiring Fund in connection
with the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
or any other agreement contemplated hereby, or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, is or will be entitled to
any broker's or finder's or similar fees or other commissions as a
result of the consummation of such transactions.

            (g)    The Acquiring Trust is registered with the
SEC as an open-end management investment company under the 1940
Act, and its registration with the SEC as such an investment
company is in full force and effect, and the Acquiring Fund is a
separate series of the Acquiring Trust duly designated in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Touchstone
Governing Documents and in and compliance in all material respects
with the 1940 Act and its rules and regulations.

            (h)    The Acquiring Fund is, and will at the
Effective Time be, a new series portfolio of the Acquiring Trust
created within the last 12 months, and such Acquiring Fund will
not have had any assets (other than assets required to meet the
requirements of Section 14(a) of the 1940 Act or other seed
capital) or operations at any time prior to the Effective Time.
            (i)    The Acquiring Fund was established in
order to effect the transactions described in this Agreement, and,
prior to the Effective Time, shall not have carried on any
business activity (other than such activities as are customary to
the organization of a new series prior to its commencement of
investment operations).  It has not yet filed its first federal
income tax return and, thus, has not yet elected to be treated as
a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes.
However, upon filing its first federal income tax return at the
completion of its first taxable year, the Acquiring Fund shall
elect to be a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of
the Code and until such time shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to ensure that it qualifies for taxation as a regulated"
"3070","investment company under Sections 851 and 852 of the Code.  The
Acquiring Fund is and will at the Effective Time be treated as a
separate corporation under Section 851(g) of the Code.

shareholders) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will have
been duly authorized at the Effective Time and, when so issued and
delivered, will be registered under the 1933 Act, duly and validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable and no shareholder of the
Acquiring Fund shall have any statutory or contractual preemptive
right of subscription or purchase in respect thereof.  In regard
to the statement above that the Acquiring Fund shares will be non-
assessable, it is noted that the Acquiring Trust is a
Massachusetts business trust and under Massachusetts' Law,
shareholders could, under certain circumstances, be held
personally liable for the obligations of the Acquiring Fund;
however, the Acquiring Fund has included appropriate provisions
disclaiming such liability in all material contracts entered into
between the Acquiring Fund and any third-party.

            (k)    As of the Valuation Time, the Acquiring
Fund's prospectus and statement of additional information will
conform in all material respects to the applicable requirements of
the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder and will not include any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not materially misleading.

            (l)    The Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be
included in the Registration Statement and filed in connection
with this Agreement, and the documents incorporated therein by
reference and any amendment or supplement thereto insofar as they
relate to the Acquiring Trust and the Acquiring Fund, each comply
or will comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the 1933 Act, 1934 Act and the 1940 Act and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder on the
effective date of such Registration Statement.  Each of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, Registration Statement and the documents
incorporated therein by reference and any amendment or supplement
thereto, insofar as it relates to the Acquiring Trust and the
Acquiring Fund, does not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not materially misleading on the
effective date of such Registration Statement; provided, however,
that the Acquiring Trust makes no representations or warranties as
to the information contained in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
Registration Statement and the documents incorporated therein by
reference and any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon
and in conformity with information relating to the Acquired Trust
or the Acquired Fund and furnished by the Acquired Fund to the
Acquiring Trust specifically for use in connection with the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, Registration Statement and the documents
incorporated therein by reference and any amendment or supplement
thereto.

            (m)    The Acquiring Trust has adopted and
implemented written policies and procedures in accordance with
Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act.

            (n)    The Acquiring Fund has maintained, or
caused to be maintained on its behalf, in all material respects,
all Books and Records required of a registered investment company
in compliance with the requirements of Section 31 of the 1940 Act
and rules thereunder.

            (o)    Except as disclosed in writing to the
Acquired Fund, to the best of the Acquiring Fund's Knowledge, no
events have occurred and no issues, conditions or facts have
arisen which either individually or in the aggregate have had a
Material Adverse Effect on the Acquiring Fund other than changes
occurring in the ordinary course of business.

            (p)    The Acquiring Trust is not under the
jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or similar case (within
the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code).

            (q)    The Acquiring Fund has no unamortized or
unpaid organizational fees or expenses for which it does not
expect to be reimbursed by Touchstone or its Affiliates.
