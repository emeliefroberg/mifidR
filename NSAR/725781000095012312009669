"3662","Funds):"
"3663","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Invesco"
"3664","Energy Fund, Invesco Gold & Precious Metals Fund, Invesco Leisure Fund, Invesco"
"3665","Technology Fund, Invesco Utilities Fund, Invesco Van Kampen American Value Fund,"
"3666","Invesco Van Kampen Comstock Fund, Invesco Van Kampen Mid Cap Growth Fund,"
"3667","Invesco Small Cap Value Fund, Invesco Value Opportunities Fund; (ten of the"
"3668","Funds constituting AIM Sector Funds (Invesco Sector Funds), hereafter referred"
"3669","to as the Funds), as of and for the year ended April 30, 2012, in accordance"
"3670","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"3671","States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"3672","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"3673","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"3674","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"3675","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"3676","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"3677","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"3678","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"3679","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"3680","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"3681","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"3682","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"3683","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"3684","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"3685","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"3686","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"3687","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"3688","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"3689","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"3690","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"3691","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"3692","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and"
"3693","(3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"3694","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"3695","a material effect on the financial statements."
"3696","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"3697","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"3698","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3699","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"3700","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3701","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"3702","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"3703","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3704","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"3705","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"3706","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"3707","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"3708","on a timely basis."
"3709","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"3710","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3711","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"3712","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"3713","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"3714","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"3715","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"3716","be material weaknesses as defined above as of April 30, 2012."
"3717","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"3718","Board of Trustees of AIM Sector Funds (Invesco Sector Funds) and the Securities"

"3751","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over financial"
"3752","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"3753","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"3754","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"3755","principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"3756","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"3757","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"3758","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"3759","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"3760","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"3761","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"3762","authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"3763","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"3764","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"3765","effect on the financial statements."
"3766","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"3767","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"3768","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3769","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"3770","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3771","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"3772","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"3773","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3774","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"3775","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"3776","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"3777","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"3778","on a timely basis."
"3779","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"3780","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3781","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"3782","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"3783","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"3784","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"3785","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"3786","be material weaknesses as defined above as of April 30, 2012."

(Invesco). Invesco shall and hereby agrees to waive fees of the Funds, on
behalf of their respective classes as applicable, severally and not jointly, as
indicated in the Exhibits.

     For and in consideration of the mutual terms and agreements set forth
herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the Trusts and Invesco agree that until at least
the expiration date set forth on Exhibit A (the Expiration Date) and with
respect to those Funds listed on the Exhibit, Invesco will waive its advisory
fees at the rate set forth on the Exhibit.

     For and in consideration of the mutual terms and agreements set forth
herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the Trusts and Invesco Aim agree as follows:

     1.   Each Trust, for itself and its Funds, and Invesco agree that until the
          expiration date, if any, of the commitment set forth on the attached
          Exhibit B occurs, as such Exhibit B is amended from time to time,
          Invesco will waive advisory fees payable by an Investing Trust in an
          amount equal to 100% of the net advisory fee Invesco receives on the
          Uninvested Cash (defined below) from the Affiliated Money Market Fund
          (defined below) in which the Investing Trust invests (the Waiver).

          i.   Invesco's Fund Accounting Group will calculate, and apply, the
               Waiver monthly, based upon the average investment of Uninvested
               Cash made by the Investing Trust during the previous month in an
               Affiliated Money Market Fund.

          ii.  The Waiver will not apply to those investing Trusts that do not
               charge an advisory fee, either due to the terms of their advisory
               agreement, or as a result of contractual or voluntary fee
               waivers.

          iii. The Waiver will not apply to cash collateral for securities
               lending.

          For purposes of the paragraph above, the following terms shall have
          the following meanings:

          (a) Affiliated Money Market Fund - any existing or future
          Trust that holds itself out as a money market fund and complies with
          Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; and

          (b) Uninvested Cash - cash available and uninvested by a
          Trust that may result from a variety of sources, including dividends
          or interest received on portfolio securities,

<PAGE>

          unsettled securities transactions, strategic reserves, matured
          investments, proceeds from liquidation of investment securities,
          dividend payments, or new investor capital.

     2.   Neither a Trust nor Invesco may remove or amend the Waiver to a
          Trust's detriment prior to requesting and receiving the approval of
          the Board of Trustee of the applicable Fund's Trust to remove or amend
          such Waiver. Invesco will not have any right to reimbursement of any
          amount so waived.

     The Boards of Trustees and Invesco may terminate or modify this Memorandum
of Agreement prior to the Expiration Date only by mutual written consent.
Invesco will not have any right to reimbursement of any amount so waived or
reimbursed.

     Subject to the foregoing paragraphs, each of the Trusts and Invesco agree
to review the then-current waivers for each class of the Funds listed on the
Exhibits on a date prior to the Expiration Date to determine whether such
waivers should be amended, continued or terminated. The waivers will expire upon
the Expiration Date unless the Trusts and Invesco have agreed to continue them.
The Exhibits will be amended to reflect any such agreement.

     It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the Trusts hereunder shall
not be binding upon any of the Trustees, shareholders, nominees, officers,
agents or employees of the Trusts personally, but shall only bind the assets and
property of the Funds, as provided in each Trust's Agreement and Declaration of
Trust. The execution and delivery of this Memorandum of Agreement have been
authorized by the Trustees of each Trust, and this Memorandum of Agreement has
been executed and delivered by an authorized officer of each Trust acting as
such; neither such authorization by such Trustees nor such execution and
delivery by such officer shall be deemed to have been made by any of them
individually or to impose any liability on any of them personally, but shall
bind only the assets and property of the Funds, as provided in each Trust's
Agreement and Declaration of Trust.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Trusts, on behalf of itself and its Funds
listed in Exhibit A and B to this Memorandum of Agreement, and Invesco have
entered into this Memorandum of Agreement as of the Effective Date on the
attached Exhibits.

                              (EXPENSE LIMITATIONS)

     This Memorandum of Agreement is entered into as of the Effective Date on
the attached exhibits (the Exhibits), between AIM Counselor Series Trust
(Invesco Counselor Series Trust), AIM Equity Funds (Invesco Equity Funds), AIM
Funds Group (Invesco Funds Group), AIM Growth Series (Invesco Growth Series),

Municipal Trust, and Short-Term Investments Trust (each a Trust or,
collectively, the Trusts), on behalf of the funds listed on the Exhibits to
this Memorandum of Agreement (the Funds), and Invesco Advisers, Inc.
(Invesco). Invesco shall and hereby agrees to waive fees or reimburse expenses
of each Fund, on behalf of its respective classes as applicable, severally and
not jointly, as indicated in the attached Exhibits.

     For and in consideration of the mutual terms and agreements set forth
herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the Trusts and Invesco agree as follows:

     For the Contractual Limits (listed in Exhibits A - D), the Trusts and
Invesco agree until at least the expiration date set forth on the attached
Exhibits A - D (the Expiration Date) that Invesco will waive its fees or
reimburse expenses to the extent that expenses of a class of a Fund (excluding
(i) interest; (ii) taxes; (iii) dividend expense on short sales; (iv)
extraordinary or non-routine items, including litigation expenses; and (v)
expenses that each Fund has incurred but did not actually pay because of an
expense offset arrangement, if applicable) exceed the rate, on an annualized
basis, set forth on the Exhibits of the average daily net assets allocable to
such class. Acquired fund fees and expenses are not fees or expenses incurred by
a fund directly but are expenses of the investment companies in which a fund
invests. These fees and expenses are incurred indirectly through the valuation
of a fund's investment in these investment companies. Acquired fund fees and
expenses are required to be disclosed and included in the total annual fund
operating expenses in the prospectus fee table. As a result, the net total
annual fund operating expenses shown in the prospectus fee table may exceed the
expense limits reflected in Exhibits A-D. With regard to the Contractual Limits,
the Board of Trustees of the Trust and Invesco may terminate or modify this
Memorandum of Agreement prior to the Expiration Date only by mutual written
consent. Invesco will not have any right to reimbursement of any amount so
waived or reimbursed.

     For the Contractual Limits, each of the Trusts and Invesco agree to review
the then-current expense limitations for each class of each Fund listed on the
Exhibits on a date prior to the Expiration Date to determine whether such
limitations should be amended, continued or terminated. The expense limitations
will expire upon the Expiration Date unless the Trusts and Invesco have agreed
to continue them. The Exhibits will be amended to reflect any such agreement.

     For the Voluntary Limits (listed in Exhibits A - D), the Trusts and Invesco
agree that these are not contractual in nature and that Invesco may establish,
amend and/or terminate such expense limitations at any time in its sole
discretion after consultation with the Funds' Boards of Trustees. Any delay or
failure by Invesco to update this Memorandum of Agreement with regards to the
terminations, extensions, or expirations of the Voluntary Limits shall have no
effect on the term of such Voluntary Limitations; the Voluntary Limitations are
listed herein for informational purposes only.
<PAGE>
     It is expressly agreed that the obligations of each Trust hereunder shall
not be binding upon any of the Trustees, shareholders, nominees, officers,
agents or employees of the Trusts personally, but shall only bind the assets and
property of each Fund, as provided in each Trust's Agreement and Declaration of
Trust. The execution and delivery of this Memorandum of Agreement have been
authorized by the Trustees of the Trusts, and this Memorandum of Agreement has
been executed and delivered by an authorized officer of the Trusts acting as
such; neither such authorization by such Trustees nor such execution and
delivery by such officer shall be deemed to have been made by any of them
individually or to impose any liability on any of them personally, but shall
bind only the assets and property of the Funds, as provided in each Trust's
Agreement and Declaration of Trust.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Trusts and Invesco have entered into this
Memorandum of Agreement as of the Effective Dates on the attached Exhibits.

                      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (Agreement) is adopted as of this
1st day of April, 2011 by and among (i) each of the Invesco open-end registered
investment companies identified as a Target Entity on Exhibit A hereto (each a
Target Entity) separately, on behalf of its respective series identified on
Exhibit A hereto (each a Target Fund); (ii) each of the Invesco open-end
registered investment companies identified as an Acquiring Entity on Exhibit A
hereto (each an Acquiring Entity), separately on behalf of its respective
series identified on Exhibit A hereto (each an Acquiring Fund); and (iii)
Invesco Advisers, Inc. (IAI).

          WHEREAS, the parties hereto intend for each Acquiring Fund and its
corresponding Target Fund (as set forth in Exhibit A hereto) to enter into a
transaction pursuant to which: (i) the Acquiring Fund will acquire the assets
and assume the liabilities of the Target Fund in exchange for the corresponding
class or classes of shares (as applicable) of the Acquiring Fund identified on
Exhibit A of equal value to the net assets of the Target Fund being acquired,
and (ii) the Target Fund will distribute such shares of the Acquiring Fund to
shareholders of the corresponding class of the Target Fund, in connection with
the liquidation of the Target Fund, all upon the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth in this Agreement (each such transaction, a
Reorganization and collectively, the Reorganizations);

          WHEREAS, each Target Entity and each Acquiring Entity is an open-end,
registered investment company of the management type; and

          WHEREAS, this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of
reorganization and liquidation with respect to each Reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the Code).

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the covenants
and agreements hereinafter set forth, and intending to be legally bound, the
parties hereto covenant and agree as follows:

1. DESCRIPTION OF THE REORGANIZATIONS

     1.1. It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Reorganization
described herein shall be conducted separately from the others, and a party that
is not a party to a Reorganization shall incur no obligations, duties or
liabilities with respect to such Reorganization by reason of being a party to
this Agreement. If any one or more Reorganizations should fail to be
consummated, such failure shall not affect the other Reorganizations in any way.

     1.2. Provided that all conditions precedent to a Reorganization set forth
herein have been satisfied as of the Closing Date (as defined in Section 3.1),
and based on the representations and warranties each party provides to the
others, each Target Entity and its corresponding Acquiring Entity agree to take
the following steps with respect to their Reorganization(s), the parties to
which and classes of shares to be issued in connection with which are set forth
in Exhibit A:
<PAGE>
          (a) The Target Fund shall transfer all of its Assets, as defined and
     set forth in Section 1.2(b), to the Acquiring Fund, and the Acquiring Fund
     in exchange therefor shall assume the Liabilities, as defined and set forth
     in Section 1.2(c), and deliver to the Target Fund the number of full and
     fractional Acquiring Fund shares determined in the manner set forth in
     Section 2.

          (b) The assets of the Target Fund to be transferred to the Acquiring
     Fund shall consist of all assets and property, including, without
     limitation, all cash, securities, commodities and futures interests, claims
     (whether absolute or contingent, known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued and
     including, without limitation, any interest in pending or future legal
     claims in connection with past or present portfolio holdings, whether in
     the form of class action claims, opt-out or other direct litigation claims,
     or regulator or government-established investor recovery fund claims, and
     any and all resulting recoveries) and dividends or interest receivable that
     are owned by the Target Fund and any deferred or prepaid expenses shown as
     an asset on the books of the Target Fund on the Closing Date, except for
     cash, bank deposits or cash equivalent securities in an amount necessary to
     pay the estimated costs of extinguishing any Excluded Liabilities (as
     defined in Section 1.2(c)) and cash in an amount necessary to pay any
     distributions pursuant to Section 7.1(f) (collectively, Assets).

          (c) The Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the liabilities of the
     Target Fund, whether accrued or contingent, known or unknown, existing at
     the Closing Date, except for the Target Fund's Excluded Liabilities (as
     defined below), if any, pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, with
     respect to each Target Fund separately, Liabilities). If prior to the
     Closing Date the Acquiring Entity identifies a liability that the Acquiring
     Entity and the Target Entity mutually agree should not be assumed by the
     Acquiring Fund, such liability shall be excluded from the definition of
     Liabilities hereunder and shall be listed on a Schedule of Excluded
     Liabilities to be signed by the Acquiring Entity and the Target Entity at
     Closing and attached to this Agreement as Schedule 1.2(c) (the Excluded"
"4101","     Liabilities). The Assets minus the Liabilities of a Target Fund shall be
     referred to herein as the Target Fund's Net Assets.

          (d) As soon as is reasonably practicable after the Closing, the Target
     Fund will distribute to its shareholders of record (Target Fund"
"4102","     Shareholders) the shares of the Acquiring Fund of the corresponding class
     received by the Target Fund pursuant to Section 1.2(a), as set forth in
     Exhibit A, on a pro rata basis within that class, and the Target Fund will
     as promptly as practicable completely liquidate and dissolve. Such
     distribution and liquidation will be accomplished, with respect to each
     class of the Target Fund's shares, by the transfer of the Acquiring Fund
     shares of the corresponding class then credited to the account of the
     Target Fund on the books of the Acquiring Fund to open accounts on the
     share records of the Acquiring Fund in the names of the Target Fund
     Shareholders of the class. The aggregate net asset value of the Acquiring
     Fund shares to be so credited to the corresponding Target Fund Shareholders
     shall be equal to the aggregate net asset value of the corresponding Target
     Fund's shares owned by the Target Fund Shareholders on the Valuation Date.
     At the Closing, any outstanding certificates representing shares of a
     Target Fund will be cancelled. The Acquiring Fund

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
     shall not issue certificates representing shares in connection with such
     exchange,  irrespective of whether Target Fund shareholders hold their
     shares in certificated form.

     (e)  Ownership of Acquiring Fund shares will be shown on its books, as such
          are maintained by the Acquiring Fund's transfer agent.

2.   VALUATION

     2.1. With respect to each Reorganization:

          (a) The value of the Target Fund's Assets shall be the value of such
     Assets computed as of immediately after the close of regular trading on the
     New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which shall reflect the declaration of
     any dividends, on the business day next preceding the Closing Date (the
     Valuation Date), using the Target Fund's valuation procedures established
     by the Target Entity's Board of Trustees.

          (b) The net asset value per share of each class of the Acquiring Fund
     shares issued in connection with the Reorganization shall be the net asset
     value per share of the corresponding class of each class computed on the
     Valuation Date using the Acquiring Fund's valuation procedures established
     by the Acquiring Entity's Board of Trustees, which are the same as the
     Target Fund's valuation procedures.

          (c) The number of shares issued of each class of the Acquiring Fund
     (including fractional shares, if any, rounded to the nearest thousandth) in
     exchange for the Target Fund's Net Assets shall be determined by dividing
     the value of the Net Assets of the Target Fund attributable to each class
     of Target Fund shares by the net asset value per share of the corresponding
     share class of the Acquiring Fund.

          (d)  All computations of value shall be made by the Target Fund's and
     the Acquiring Fund's designated recordkeeping agent using the valuation
     procedures described in this Section 2.

3.   CLOSING AND CLOSING DATE

     3.1. Each Reorganization shall close on the date identified on Exhibit A or
such other date as the parties may agree with respect to any or all
Reorganizations (the Closing Date). All acts taking place at the closing of a
Reorganization (the Closing) shall be deemed to take place simultaneously as
of immediately prior to the opening of regular trading on the NYSE on the
Closing Date of that Reorganization unless otherwise agreed to by the parties
(the Closing Time).

     3.2. With respect to each Reorganization:

          (a) The Target Fund's portfolio securities, investments or other
     assets that are represented by a certificate or other written instrument
     shall be transferred and delivered by the Target Fund as of the Closing
     Date to the Acquiring Fund's Custodian for the account of the Acquiring
     Fund, duly endorsed in proper form for transfer and in such condition as to
     constitute good delivery thereof. The Target Fund shall direct the Target

                                       -3-
<PAGE>
     Fund's custodian (the Target Custodian) to deliver to the Acquiring
     Fund's Custodian as of the Closing Date by book entry, in accordance with
     the customary practices of Target Custodian and any securities depository
     (as defined in Rule 17f-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
     amended (the 1940 Act)), in which the Assets are deposited, the Target
     Fund's portfolio securities and instruments so held. The cash to be
     transferred by a Target Fund shall be delivered to the Acquiring Fund's
     Custodian by wire transfer of federal funds or other appropriate means on
     the Closing Date.

          (b) The Target Entity shall direct the Target Custodian for each
     Target Fund to deliver, at the Closing, a certificate of an authorized
     officer stating that (i) except as permitted by Section 3.2(a), the Assets
     have been delivered in proper form to the Acquiring Fund no later than the
     Closing Time on the Closing Date, and (ii) all necessary taxes in
     connection with the delivery of the Assets, including all applicable
     Federal, state and foreign stock transfer stamps, if any, have been paid or
     provision for payment has been made.

          (c) At such time prior to the Closing Date as the parties mutually
     agree, the Target Fund shall provide (i) instructions and related
     information to the Acquiring Fund or its transfer agent with respect to the
     Target Fund Shareholders, including names, addresses, dividend reinvestment
     elections and tax withholding status of the Target Fund Shareholders as of
     the date agreed upon (such information to be updated as of the Closing
     Date, as necessary) and (ii) the information and documentation maintained
     by the Target Fund or its agents relating to the identification and
     verification of the Target Fund Shareholders under the USA PATRIOT ACT and
     other applicable anti-money laundering laws, rules and regulations and such
     other information as the Acquiring Fund may reasonably request. The
     Acquiring Fund and its transfer agent shall have no obligation to inquire
     as to the validity, propriety or correctness of any such instruction,
     information or documentation, but shall, in each case, assume that such
     instruction, information or documentation is valid, proper, correct and
     complete.

          (d) The Target Entity shall direct each applicable transfer agent for
     a Target Fund (the Target Transfer Agent) to deliver to the Acquiring
     Fund at the Closing a certificate of an authorized officer stating that its

     addresses of the Target Fund Shareholders and the number of outstanding
     shares of each class owned by each such shareholder immediately prior to
     the Closing. The Acquiring Fund shall issue and deliver to the Secretary of
     the Target Fund a confirmation evidencing the Acquiring Fund shares to be
     credited on the Closing Date, or provide other evidence satisfactory to the

     the NYSE or another primary trading market for portfolio securities of the
     Target Fund (each, an Exchange) shall be closed to trading or trading
     thereupon shall be restricted, or (b) trading or the reporting of trading
     on such Exchange or elsewhere shall be disrupted so

                                        -4-
<PAGE>
     that, in the judgment of the Board of Trustees of the Acquiring Entity or
     the Target Entity or the authorized officers of either of such entities,
     accurate appraisal of the value of the net assets of the Acquiring Fund or
     the Target Fund, respectively, is impracticable, the Closing Date shall be
     postponed until the first business day after the day when trading shall
     have been fully resumed and reporting shall have been restored.

     the Target Fund's most recently completed fiscal year, if any, were
     prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the

     present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition of the
     Target Fund as of such date in accordance with GAAP, and there are no known
     contingent liabilities of the Target Fund required to be reflected on a
     balance sheet (including the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP as of
     such date not disclosed therein;

          (h) Since the last day of the Target Fund's most recently completed
     fiscal year, there has not been any material adverse change in the Target
     Fund's financial condition, assets, liabilities or business, other than
     changes occurring in the ordinary course of business;

          (i) On the Closing Date, all material Returns (as defined below) of
     the Target Fund required by law to have been filed by such date (including
     any extensions) shall have been filed and are or will be true, correct and
     complete in all material respects, and all Taxes (as defined below) shown
     as due or claimed to be due by any government entity shall have been paid
     or provision has been made for the payment thereof. To the Target Fund's
     knowledge, no such Return is currently under audit by any Federal, state,

     respect to such Returns; there are no levies, liens or other encumbrances
     on the Target Fund or its assets resulting from the non-payment of any
     Taxes; no waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are outstanding nor
     are any written requests for such waivers pending; and adequate provision

     returns, information returns, elections, agreements, declarations, or other
     documents of any nature

     investment company taxable income or net capital gain, the Target Fund,

     to the shareholders of Target Fund a dividend or dividends that,
     together with all previous such dividends, shall have the effect of
     distributing (i) all of its investment company taxable income
     (determined without regard to any deductions for dividends paid) and
     all of its net capital gains (after reduction for any capital loss
     carryover), if any, for the period from the close of its last fiscal
     year to the Closing Time on the Closing Date; (ii) any such investment
     company taxable income and net capital gains for its taxable year ended
     prior to the Closing Date to the extent not otherwise already
     distributed; and (iii) at least 90 percent of the excess, if any, of
     the Target Fund's interest income excludible from gross income under
     Section 103(a) of the Code over its deductions disallowed under
     Sections 265 and 171(a)(2) of the Code for its taxable year ended prior
     to the Closing Date and at least 90 percent of such net tax-exempt
     income for the period from the close of its last fiscal year to the
     Closing Time on the Closing Date.;

          (k)     All issued and outstanding shares of the Target Fund
     are, and on the Closing Date will be, duly and validly issued and
     outstanding, fully paid and non-assessable by the Target Entity and, in
     every state where offered or sold, such offers and sales have been in
     compliance in all material respects with applicable registration and/or
     notice requirements of the 1933 Act and state and District of Columbia
     securities laws;

          (l)     The execution, delivery and performance of this
     Agreement will have been duly authorized prior to the Closing Date by
     all necessary action, if any, on the part of the Board of Trustees of
     the Target Entity, on behalf of the Target Fund, and subject to the
     approval of the shareholders of the Target Fund and the due
     authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the other
     parties hereto, this Agreement will constitute

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

     a valid and binding obligation of the Target Fund, enforceable in
     accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy,

     affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles;

     all material respects and contain no material omissions with respect to
     information required to be maintained under the laws, rules and regulations
     applicable to the Target Fund;

"4104","     Declaration of Trust), to own all of its properties and assets and to
     carry on its business as it is now being, and as it is contemplated to be,
     conducted, and to enter into this Agreement and perform its obligations
     hereunder;

          (b) The Acquiring Entity is a registered investment company classified
     as a management company of the open-end type, and its registration with the
     Commission as an investment company under the 1940 Act and the registration
     of the shares of the Acquiring Fund under the 1933 Act are in full force
     and effect;

     governmental authority or FINRA is required for the consummation by the
     Acquiring Fund and the Acquiring Entity of the transactions contemplated

     Closing Date) under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, the 1940 Act and state
     securities laws;

          (d) The prospectuses and statements of additional information of the

     therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
     circumstances under which they were made, not materially misleading;

          (e) The Acquiring Fund is in compliance in all material respects with
     the applicable investment policies and restrictions set forth in the
     Acquiring Fund's prospectus and statement of additional information;

                                      -8-
<PAGE>
          (f) The financial statements of the Acquiring Fund for the Acquiring
     Fund's most recently completed fiscal year have been audited by the
     independent registered public accounting firm identified in the Acquiring
     Fund's prospectus or statement of additional information included in the
     Acquiring Fund's registration statement on Form N-1A. Such statements, as
     well as the unaudited, semi-annual financial statements for the semi-annual
     period next succeeding the Acquiring Fund's most recently completed fiscal
     year, if any, were prepared in accordance with accounting principles

     Code. None of the parties to a Reorganization shall take any action or
     cause any action to be taken (including, without

8.   FURTHER CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATIONS OF THE ACQUIRING FUND AND THE
     TARGET FUND

     With respect to each Reorganization, if any of the conditions set forth
below have not been satisfied on or before the Closing Date with respect to the
Target Fund or the Acquiring Fund, the Acquiring Entity or Target Entity,
respectively, shall, at its option, not be required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement:

     8.1. The Agreement shall have been approved by the requisite vote of the
holders of the outstanding shares of the Target Fund in accordance with the
provisions of the Target Entity's Governing Documents, Delaware law, and the
1940 Act. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Target
Fund nor the Acquiring Fund may waive the conditions set forth in this Section
8.1;

     8.2. On the Closing Date, no action, suit or other proceeding shall be
pending or, to the Target Entity's or the Acquiring Entity's knowledge,
threatened before any court or governmental agency in which it is sought to
restrain or prohibit, or obtain damages or other relief in connection with, this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein;

     8.3. All consents of other parties and all other consents, orders and
permits of Federal, state and local regulatory authorities deemed necessary by
the Acquiring Fund or the Target Fund to permit consummation, in all material
respects, of the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been obtained,
except where failure to obtain any such consent, order or permit would not
involve a risk of a material adverse effect on the assets or properties of the
Acquiring Fund or the Target Fund, provided that either party hereto may for
itself waive any of such conditions;

     8.4. A registration statement on Form N-14 under the 1933 Act properly
registering the Acquiring Fund shares to be issued in connection with the
Reorganization shall have become effective under the 1933 Act and no stop orders
suspending the effectiveness thereof shall have been issued and, to the best
knowledge of the parties hereto, no investigation or proceeding for that purpose
shall have been instituted or be pending, threatened or known to be contemplated
under the 1933 Act; and

     8.5. The Target Entity and the Acquiring Entity shall have received on or
before the Closing Date an opinion of Stradley Ronon in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Target Entity and the Acquiring Entity, as to the
matters set forth on Schedule 8.6. In rendering such opinion, Stradley Ronon may
request and rely upon representations contained in certificates of officers of
the Target Entity, the Acquiring Entity and others, and the officers of the
Target

                                      -14-
<PAGE>

Entity and the Acquiring Entity shall use their best efforts to make
available such truthful certificates.

9.   FEES AND EXPENSES

     9.1. Each Acquiring Fund will bear its expenses relating to the
Reorganizations, which IAI has estimated to be $30,000 per Reorganization. A
Target Fund will bear its costs associated with the Reorganization to the extent
that the Target Fund is expected to recoup those costs within 24 months
following the Reorganization as a result of reduced total annual fund operating
expenses based on estimates prepared by the Adviser and discussed with the
Board. IAI has agreed to bear the Reorganization costs of any Target Fund that
does not meet the foregoing threshold.

10.  FINAL TAX RETURNS AND FORMS 1099 OF TARGET FUND

     10.1. After the Closing Date, except as otherwise agreed to by the parties,
Target Entity shall or shall cause its agents to prepare any federal, state or
local tax returns, including any Forms 1099, required to be filed by Target
Entity with respect to each Target Fund's final taxable year ending with its
complete liquidation and for any prior periods or taxable years and shall
further cause such tax returns and Forms 1099 to be duly filed with the
appropriate taxing authorities.

11.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT; SURVIVAL OF WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS

     11.1. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith
shall not survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder.
The covenants to be performed after the Closing shall survive the Closing.

12.  TERMINATION

     This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby
may be abandoned with respect to one or more (or all) Reorganizations by mutual
agreement of the parties.

13.  AMENDMENTS

     This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented in a writing signed
by the parties hereto to be bound by such Amendment.

14.  HEADINGS; GOVERNING LAW; COUNTERPARTS; ASSIGNMENT; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

     14.1. The Article and Section headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

                                      -15-
<PAGE>

     14.2. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable Federal law, without regard to
its principles of conflicts of laws.

     14.3. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns, but no assignment or
transfer hereof or of any rights or obligations hereunder shall be made by any
party without the written consent of the other parties. Nothing herein expressed
or implied is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any person,
firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement.

     14.4. This agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which shall be considered an original.

     14.5. It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the parties hereunder
shall not be binding upon any of their respective directors or trustees,
shareholders, nominees, officers, agents, or employees personally, but shall
bind only the property of the applicable Target Fund or the applicable Acquiring
Fund as provided in the Governing Documents of the Target Entity or the
Agreement and Declaration of Trust of the Acquiring Entity, respectively. The
execution and delivery by such officers shall not be deemed to have been made by
any of them individually or to impose any liability on any of them personally,
but shall bind only the property of such party.

                                      -16-

this Agreement. If any one or more Reorganizations should fail to be
consummated, such failure shall not affect the other Reorganizations in any way.

     1.2. Provided that all conditions precedent to a Reorganization set forth
herein have been satisfied as of the Closing Date (as defined in Section 3.1),
and based on the representations and warranties each party provides to the
others, each Target Entity and its corresponding Acquiring Entity agree to take
the following steps with respect to their Reorganization(s), the parties to
which and classes of shares to be issued in connection with which are set forth
in Exhibit A:
<PAGE>
          (a) The Target Fund shall transfer all of its Assets, as defined and
     set forth in Section 1.2(b), to the Acquiring Fund, and the Acquiring Fund
     in exchange therefor shall assume the Liabilities, as defined and set forth
     in Section 1.2(c), and deliver to the Target Fund the number of full and
     fractional Acquiring Fund shares determined in the manner set forth in
     Section 2.

          (b) The assets of the Target Fund to be transferred to the Acquiring
     Fund shall consist of all assets, property, and goodwill including, without
     limitation, all cash, securities, commodities and futures interests, claims
     (whether absolute or contingent, known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued and
     including, without limitation, any interest in pending or future legal
     claims in connection with past or present portfolio holdings, whether in
     the form of class action claims, opt-out or other direct litigation claims,
     or regulator or government-established investor recovery fund claims, and
     any and all resulting recoveries) and dividends or interest receivable that
     are owned by the Target Fund and any deferred or prepaid expenses shown as
     an asset on the books of the Target Fund on the Closing Date, except for
     cash, bank deposits or cash equivalent securities in an amount necessary to
     pay the estimated costs of extinguishing any Excluded Liabilities (as
     defined in Section 1.2(c)) and cash in an amount necessary to pay any
     distributions pursuant to Section 7.1(f) (collectively, Assets).

          (c) The Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the liabilities of the
     Target Fund, whether accrued or contingent, known or unknown, existing at
     the Closing Date, except for the Target Fund's Excluded Liabilities (as
     defined below), if any, pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, with
     respect to each Target Fund separately, Liabilities). If prior to the
     Closing Date the Acquiring Entity identifies a liability that the Acquiring
     Entity and the Target Entity mutually agree should not be assumed by the
     Acquiring Fund, such liability shall be excluded from the definition of
     Liabilities hereunder and shall be listed on a Schedule of Excluded
     Liabilities to be signed by the Acquiring Entity and the Target Entity at
     Closing and attached to this Agreement as Schedule 1.2(c) (the Excluded"
"4105","     Liabilities). The Assets minus the Liabilities of a Target Fund shall be
     referred to herein as the Target Fund's Net Assets.

          (d) As soon as is reasonably practicable after the Closing, the Target
     Fund will distribute to its shareholders of record (Target Fund"
"4106","     Shareholders) the shares of the Acquiring Fund of the corresponding class
     received by the Target Fund pursuant to Section 1.2(a), as set forth in
     Exhibit A, on a pro rata basis within that class, and the Target Fund will
     as promptly as practicable completely liquidate and dissolve. Such
     distribution and liquidation will be accomplished, with respect to each
     class of the Target Fund's shares, by the transfer of the Acquiring Fund
     shares of the corresponding class then credited to the account of the
     Target Fund on the books of the Acquiring Fund to open accounts on the
     share records of the Acquiring Fund in the names of the Target Fund
     Shareholders of the class. The aggregate net asset value of the Acquiring
     Fund shares to be so credited to the corresponding Target Fund Shareholders
     shall be equal to the aggregate net asset value of the corresponding Target
     Fund's shares owned by the Target Fund Shareholders on the Valuation Date.
     At the Closing, any outstanding certificates representing shares of a
     Target Fund will be cancelled. The Acquiring Fund shall not issue
     certificates representing shares in connection with such exchange,

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
     irrespective of whether Target Fund shareholders hold their Target Fund
     shares in certificated form.

          (e) Ownership of Acquiring Fund shares will be shown on its books, as
     such are maintained by the Acquiring Fund's transfer agent.

2.   VALUATION

     2.1. With respect to each Reorganization:

          (a) The value of the Target Fund's Assets shall be the value of such
     Assets computed as of immediately after the close of regular trading on the
     New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which shall reflect the declaration of
     any dividends, on the business day next preceding the Closing Date (the
     Valuation Date), using the Target Fund's valuation procedures established
     by the Target Entity's Board of Trustees.

          (b) The net asset value per share of each class of the Acquiring Fund
     shares issued in connection with the Reorganization shall be the net asset
     value per share of the corresponding class of each class computed on the
     Valuation Date using the Acquiring Fund's valuation procedures established
     by the Acquiring Entity's Board of Trustees, which are the same as the
     Target Fund's valuation procedures.

          (c) The number of shares issued of each class of the Acquiring Fund
     (including fractional shares, if any, rounded to the nearest thousandth) in
     exchange for the Target Fund's Net Assets shall be determined by dividing
     the value of the Net Assets of the Target Fund attributable to each class
     of Target Fund shares by the net asset value per share of the corresponding
     share class of the Acquiring Fund.

          (d) All computations of value shall be made by the Target Fund's and
     the Acquiring Fund's designated recordkeeping agent using the valuation
     procedures described in this Section 2.

3.   CLOSING AND CLOSING DATE

     3.1. Each Reorganization shall close on the date identified on Exhibit A or
such other date as the parties may agree with respect to any or all
Reorganizations (the Closing Date). All acts taking place at the closing of a
Reorganization (the Closing) shall be deemed to take place simultaneously as
of immediately prior to the opening of regular trading on the NYSE on the
Closing Date of that Reorganization unless otherwise agreed to by the parties
(the Closing Time).

     3.2. With respect to each Reorganization:

          (a) The Target Fund's portfolio securities, investments or
     other assets that are represented by a certificate or other written
     instrument shall be transferred and delivered by the Target Fund as of the
     Closing Date to the Acquiring Fund's Custodian for the account of the
     Acquiring Fund, duly endorsed in proper form for transfer and in such
     condition as to constitute good delivery thereof. The Target Fund shall
     direct the Target

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
     Fund's custodian (the Target Custodian) to deliver to the Acquiring
     Fund's Custodian as of the Closing Date by book entry, in accordance with
     the customary practices of Target Custodian and any securities depository
     (as defined in Rule 17f-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
     amended (the 1940 Act)), in which the Assets are deposited, the Target
     Fund's portfolio securities and instruments so held. The cash to be
     transferred by a Target Fund shall be delivered to the Acquiring Fund's
     Custodian by wire transfer of federal funds or other appropriate means on
     the Closing Date.

          (b) The Target Entity shall direct the Target Custodian for each
     Target Fund to deliver, at the Closing or promptly thereafter, a
     certificate of an authorized officer stating that (i) except as permitted
     by Section 3.2(a), the Assets have been delivered in proper form to the
     Acquiring Fund no later than the Closing Time on the Closing Date, and (ii)
     all necessary taxes in connection with the delivery of the Assets,
     including all applicable Federal, state and foreign stock transfer stamps,
     if any, have been paid or provision for payment has been made.

          (c) At such time prior to the Closing Date as the parties
     mutually agree, the Target Fund shall provide (i) instructions and related
     information to the Acquiring Fund or its transfer agent with respect to the
     Target Fund Shareholders, including names, addresses, dividend reinvestment
     elections and tax withholding status of the Target Fund Shareholders as of
     the date agreed upon (such information to be updated as of the Closing
     Date, as necessary) and (ii) the information and documentation maintained
     by the Target Fund or its agents relating to the identification and
     verification of the Target Fund Shareholders under the USA PATRIOT ACT and
     other applicable anti-money laundering laws, rules and regulations and such
     other information as the Acquiring Fund may reasonably request. The
     Acquiring Fund and its transfer agent shall have no obligation to inquire
     as to the validity, propriety or correctness of any such instruction,
     information or documentation, but shall, in each case, assume that such
     instruction, information or documentation is valid, proper, correct and
     complete.

          (d) The Target Entity shall direct each applicable transfer
     agent for a Target Fund (the Target Transfer Agent) to deliver to the
     Acquiring Fund at the Closing a certificate of an authorized officer
     stating that its records, as provided to the Acquiring Entity, contain the
     names and addresses of the Target Fund Shareholders and the number of
     outstanding shares of each class owned by each such shareholder immediately
     prior to the Closing. The Acquiring Fund shall issue and deliver to the
     Secretary of the Target Fund a confirmation evidencing the Acquiring Fund
     shares to be credited on the Closing Date, or provide other evidence
     satisfactory to the Target Entity that such Acquiring Fund shares have been
     credited to the Target Fund Shareholders' accounts on the books of the
     Acquiring Fund. At the Closing, each party shall deliver to the other such
     bills of sale, checks, assignments, certificates, if any, receipts or other
     documents as such other party or its counsel may reasonably request.

          (e) In the event that on the Valuation Date or the Closing Date
     (a) the NYSE or another primary trading market for portfolio securities of
     the Target Fund (each, an Exchange) shall be closed to trading or trading
     thereupon shall be restricted, or (b) trading or the reporting of trading
     on such Exchange or elsewhere shall be disrupted so

                                        -4-
<PAGE>
     that, in the judgment of the Board of Trustees of the Acquiring Entity or
     the Target Entity or the authorized officers of either of such entities,
     accurate appraisal of the value of the net assets of the Acquiring Fund or
     the Target Fund, respectively, is impracticable, the Closing Date shall be
     postponed until the first business day after the day when trading shall
     have been fully resumed and reporting shall have been restored.

          (e) The Target Fund is in compliance in all material respects with the
     applicable investment policies and restrictions set forth in the Target
     Fund's prospectus and statement of additional information;

          (f) Except as otherwise disclosed to and accepted by or on behalf of
     the Acquiring Fund, the Target Fund will on the Closing Date have good
     title to the Assets

     prospectus or statement of additional information included in the Target
     Fund's registration statement on Form N-1A (the Prospectus and Statement"
"4108","     of Additional Information). Such statements, as well as the unaudited,
     semi-annual financial statements for the semi-annual period next succeeding
     the Target Fund's most recently completed fiscal year, if any, were
     prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
     United States of America (GAAP) consistently applied, and such statements
     present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition of the
     Target Fund as of such date in accordance with GAAP, and there are no known
     contingent liabilities of the Target Fund required to be reflected on a
     balance sheet (including the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP as of
     such date not disclosed therein;

          (h) Since the last day of the Target Fund's most recently completed
     fiscal year, there has not been any material adverse change in the Target
     Fund's financial condition, assets, liabilities or business, other than
     changes occurring in the ordinary course of business;

          (i) On the Closing Date, all material Returns (as defined below) of
     the Target Fund required by law to have been filed by such date (including
     any extensions) shall have been filed and are or will be true, correct and
     complete in all material respects, and all Taxes (as defined below) shown
     as due or claimed to be due by any government entity shall have been paid
     or provision has been made for the payment thereof. To the Target Fund's

     on the Target Fund or its assets resulting from the non-payment of any
     Taxes; no waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are outstanding nor
     are any written requests for such waivers pending; and adequate provision
     has been made in the Target Fund financial statements for all Taxes in
     respect of all periods ended on or before the date of such financial
     statements. As used in this Agreement, Tax or Taxes means (i) any tax,

     amount imposed by any governmental authority (domestic or foreign)
     responsible for the imposition of any such tax. Return means reports,
     returns, information returns, elections, agreements, declarations, or other
     documents of any nature

                                      -6-
<PAGE>
     or kind (including any attached schedules, supplements and additional or
     supporting material) filed or required to be filed with respect to Taxes,
     including any claim for refund, amended return or declaration of estimated
     Taxes (and including any amendments with respect thereto);

          (j) The Target Fund has elected to be a regulated investment company
     under Subchapter M of the Code and is a fund that is treated as a separate
     corporation under Section 851(g) of the Code. The Target Fund has qualified
     for treatment as a regulated investment company for each taxable year since
     inception that has ended prior to the Closing Date and will have satisfied
     the requirements of Part I of Subchapter M of the Code to maintain such
     qualification for the period beginning on the first day of its current
     taxable year and ending on the Closing Date. The Target Fund has no
     earnings or profits accumulated in any taxable year in which the provisions
     of Subchapter M of the Code did not apply to it. If Target Fund serves as a
     funding vehicle for variable contracts (life insurance or annuity), Target
     Fund, with respect to each of its taxable years that has ended prior to the
     Closing Date during which it has served as such a funding vehicle, has
     satisfied the diversification requirements of Section 817(h) of the Code
     and will continue to satisfy the requirements of Section 817(h) of the Code
     for the period beginning on the first day of its current taxable year and
     ending on the Closing Date. In order to (i) ensure continued qualification
     of the Target Fund for treatment as a regulated investment company for
     tax purposes and (ii) eliminate any tax liability of the Target Fund
     arising by reason of undistributed investment company taxable income or net
     capital gain, the Target Fund, before the Closing Date will declare on or
     prior to the Valuation Date to the shareholders of Target Fund a dividend
     or dividends that, together with all previous such dividends, shall have
     the effect of distributing (i) substantially all of its investment company
     taxable income (determined without regard to any deductions for dividends
     paid) and substantially all of its net capital gains (after reduction for
     any capital loss carryover), if any, for the period from the close of its
     last fiscal year to the Closing Time on the Closing Date; (ii) all of its
     investment company taxable income and net capital gains for its taxable
     year ended prior to the Closing Date to the extent not otherwise already
     distributed; and (iii) at least 90 percent of the excess, if any, of the
     Target Fund's interest income excludible from gross income under Section
     103(a) of the Code over its deductions disallowed under Sections 265 and
     171(a)(2) of the Code for its taxable year ended prior to the Closing Date
     and at least 90 percent of such net tax-exempt income for the period from
     the close of its last fiscal year to the Closing Time on the Closing Date;

          (k) All issued and outstanding shares of the Target Fund are, and on
     the Closing Date will be, duly and validly issued and outstanding, fully
     paid and non-assessable by the Target Entity and, in every state where
     offered or sold, such offers and sales have been in compliance in all
     material respects with applicable registration and/or notice requirements
     of the 1933 Act and state and District of Columbia securities laws;

          (l)  The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will
     have been duly authorized prior to the Closing Date by all necessary
     action, if any, on the part of the Board of Trustees of the Target Entity,
     on behalf of the Target Fund, and subject to the approval of the
     shareholders of the Target Fund and the due authorization, execution and
     delivery of this Agreement by the other parties hereto, this Agreement will
     constitute

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

     a valid and binding obligation of the Target Fund, enforceable in
     accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy,
     insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws relating to or
     affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles;

          (m) The books and records of the Target Fund are true and correct in
     all material respects and contain no material omissions with respect to
     information required to be maintained under the laws, rules and regulations
     applicable to the Target Fund;

          (n) The Target Fund is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a
     Title 11 or similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the
     Code; and

          (o) The Target Fund has no unamortized or unpaid organizational fees
     or expenses.

     4.2. Each Acquiring Entity, on behalf of the Acquiring Fund, represents and
warrants to the Target Entity and its corresponding Target Fund as follows:

          (a) The Acquiring Fund is duly organized as a series of the Acquiring
     Entity, which is a statutory trust duly formed, validly existing, and in
     good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with power under its
     Agreement and Declaration of Trust, as amended (the Agreement and"
"4109","     Declaration of Trust), to own all of its properties and assets and to
     carry on its business as it is now being, and as it is contemplated to be,
     conducted, and to enter into this Agreement and perform its obligations
     hereunder;

          (b) The Acquiring Entity is a registered investment company classified
     as a management company of the open-end type, and its registration with the
     Commission as an investment company under the 1940 Act and the registration
     of the shares of the Acquiring Fund under the 1933 Act are in full force
     and effect;

          (c) No consent, approval, authorization, or order of any court,
     governmental authority or FINRA is required for the consummation by the
     Acquiring Fund and the Acquiring Entity of the transactions contemplated
     herein, except such as have been or will be obtained (at or prior to the
     Closing Date) under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, the 1940 Act and state
     securities laws;

          (d) The prospectuses and statements of additional information of the
     Acquiring Fund to be used in connection with the Reorganization will
     conform at the time of their use in all material respects to the applicable
     requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations
     of the Commission thereunder and will not include any untrue statement of a
     material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
     therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
     circumstances under which they were made, not materially misleading;

          (e) The Acquiring Fund is in compliance in all material respects with
     the applicable investment policies and restrictions set forth in the
     Acquiring Fund's prospectus and statement of additional information;

                                      -8-
<PAGE>
          (f) The financial statements of the Acquiring Fund for the Acquiring
     Fund's most recently completed fiscal year have been audited by the
     independent registered public accounting firm identified in the Acquiring
     Fund's prospectus or statement of additional information included in the
     Acquiring Fund's registration statement on Form N-1A. Such statements, as
     well as the unaudited, semi-annual financial statements for the semi-annual
     period next succeeding the Acquiring Fund's most recently completed fiscal
     year, if any, were prepared in accordance with accounting principles
     generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) consistently
     applied, and such statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
     financial condition of the Acquiring Fund as of such date in accordance

     other than changes occurring in the ordinary course of business;

          (h) On the Closing Date, all material Returns of the Acquiring Fund
     required by law to have been filed by such date (including any extensions)
     shall have been filed and are or will be true, correct and complete in all
     material respects, and all Taxes shown as due or claimed to be due by any
     government entity shall have been paid or provision has been made for the
     payment thereof. To the Acquiring Fund's knowledge, no such Return is
     currently under audit by any Federal, state, local or foreign Tax
     authority; no assessment has been asserted with respect to such Returns;
     there are no levies, liens or other encumbrances on the Acquiring Fund or
     its assets resulting from the non-payment of any Taxes; and no waivers of
     the time to assess any such Taxes are outstanding nor are any written
     requests for such waivers pending; and adequate provision has been made in
     the Acquiring Fund financial statements for all Taxes in respect of all
     periods ended on or before the date of such financial statements;

          (i) The Acquiring Fund has elected to be a regulated investment
     company under Subchapter M of the Code and is a fund that is treated as a
     separate corporation under Section 851(g) of the Code. The Acquiring Fund
     has qualified for treatment as a regulated investment company for each
     taxable year since inception that has ended prior to the Closing Date and
     has satisfied the requirements of Part I of Subchapter M of the Code to
     maintain such qualification for the period beginning on the first day of
     its current taxable year and ending on the Closing Date. The Acquiring Fund
     has no earnings or profits accumulated in any taxable year in which the
     provisions of Subchapter M of the Code did not apply to it. If the
     Acquiring Fund serves as a funding vehicle for variable contracts (life
     insurance or annuity), the Acquiring Fund, with respect to each of its
     taxable years that has ended prior to the Closing Date during which it has
     served as such a funding vehicle, has satisfied the diversification
     requirements of Section 817(h) of the Code and will continue to satisfy the
     requirements of Section 817(h) of the Code for the period beginning on the
     first day of its current taxable year and ending on the Closing Date;

     Closing Date will be, duly authorized and validly issued and outstanding,
     fully paid and non-assessable by the Acquiring Entity and, in every state
     where offered or sold, such offers and sales have been in compliance in all
     material respects with applicable registration and/or notice requirements
     of the 1933 Act and state and District of Columbia securities laws;

          (k) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will
     have been duly authorized prior to the Closing Date by all necessary
     action, if any, on the part of the trustees of the Acquiring Entity, on
     behalf of the Acquiring Fund, and subject to the approval of shareholders
     of the Target Fund and the due authorization, execution and delivery of
     this Agreement by the other parties hereto, this Agreement will constitute
     a valid and binding obligation of the Acquiring Fund, enforceable in
     accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy,
     insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws relating to or
     affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles;

          (l) The shares of the Acquiring Fund to be issued and delivered to the
     Target Fund, for the account of the Target Fund Shareholders, pursuant to
     the terms of this Agreement, will on the Closing Date have been duly
     authorized and, when so issued and delivered, will be duly and validly
     issued Acquiring Fund shares, and, upon receipt of the Target Fund's Assets
     in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be fully paid and
     non-assessable by the Acquiring Entity;

          (m) The books and records of the Acquiring Fund are true and correct
     in all material respects and contain no material omissions with respect to
     information required to be maintained under laws, rules, and regulations
     applicable to the Acquiring Fund;

          (n) The Acquiring Fund is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a
     Title 11 or similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the
     Code;

          (o) The Acquiring Fund has no unamortized or unpaid organizational
     fees or expenses for which it does not expect to be reimbursed by Invesco
     or its affiliates.

SCHEDULE 8.6

                                  TAX OPINIONS

     (i) The acquisition by the Acquiring Fund of substantially all of
the assets of the Target Fund, as provided for in the Agreement, in exchange for
Acquiring Fund shares and the assumption by the Acquiring Fund of all of the
liabilities of the Target Fund, followed by the distribution by the Target Fund
to its shareholders of the Acquiring Fund shares in complete liquidation of the
Target Fund, will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a)(1) of the Code, and the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund each will be a
party to the reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code.

     (ii) No gain or loss will be recognized by the Target Fund upon the
transfer of substantially all of its assets to, and assumption of its
liabilities by, the Acquiring Fund in exchange solely for Acquiring Fund shares
pursuant to Section 361(a) and Section 357(a) of the Code.

     (iii) No gain or loss will be recognized by the Acquiring Fund upon the
receipt by it of substantially all of the assets of the Target Fund in exchange
solely for the assumption of the liabilities of the Target Fund and issuance of
the Acquiring Fund shares pursuant to Section 1032(a) of the Code.

     (iv) No gain or loss will be recognized by the Target Fund upon the
distribution of the Acquiring Fund shares by the Target Fund to its shareholders
in complete liquidation (in pursuance of the Agreement) pursuant to Section
361(c)(1) of the Code.

     (v) The tax basis of the assets of the Target Fund received by the
Acquiring Fund will be the same as the tax basis of such assets in the hands of
the Target Fund immediately prior to the transfer pursuant to Section 362(b) of
the Code.

     (vi) The holding periods of the assets of the Target Fund in the hands of
the Acquiring Fund will include the periods during which such assets were held
by the Target Fund pursuant to Section 1223(2) of the Code.

     (vii) No gain or loss will be recognized by the shareholders of the Target
Fund upon the exchange of all of their Target Fund shares for the Acquiring Fund
shares pursuant to Section 354(a) of the Code.

     (viii) The aggregate tax basis of the Acquiring Fund shares to be received
by each shareholder of the Target Fund will be the same as the aggregate tax
basis of Target Fund shares exchanged therefor pursuant to Section 358(a)(1) of
the Code.

     (ix) The holding period of Acquiring Fund shares received by a shareholder
of the Target Fund will include the holding period of the Target Fund shares
exchanged therefor, provided that the shareholder held Target Fund shares as a
capital asset on the date of the exchange pursuant to Section 1223(1) of the
Code.
<PAGE>
     (x) For purposes of Section 381 of the Code, the Acquiring Fund will
succeed to and take into account, as of the date of the transfer as defined in
Section 1.381(b)-1(b) of the income tax regulations issued by the United States
Department of the Treasury (the Income Tax Regulations), the items of the
Target Fund described in Section 381(c) of the Code, subject to the conditions
and limitations specified in Sections 381, 382, 383 and 384 of the Code and the
Income Tax Regulations thereunder.

     The foregoing opinion may state that no opinion is expressed as to the
effect of the Reorganization on a Target Fund, Acquiring Fund or any Target Fund
Shareholder with respect to any asset as to which unrealized gain or loss is
required to be recognized for federal income tax purposes at the end of a
taxable year (or on the termination or transfer thereof) under a mark-to-market
system of accounting.
