"579","and for the year ended October 31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"580","States), we considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"581","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"582","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"

"588","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"589","and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"590","A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"591","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"592","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"

"594","with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"

"598","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify>Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"599","control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"

"604","reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"605","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"606","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"607","of the Fund&rsquo;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</P>"
