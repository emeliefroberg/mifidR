"907","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"908","Firm"
"909","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"910","Nationwide Global Equity Fund and Nationwide High"
"911","Yield Bond Fund:"
"912","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"913","statements of the Nationwide Global Equity Fund and"
"914","Nationwide High Yield Bond Fund (formerly UBS Global"
"915","Equity Fund and UBS High Yield Fund, hereafter referred"
"916","to as the ?Funds?) as of and for the year ended June 30,"
"917","2013, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"918","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"919","considered the Funds? internal control over financial"
"920","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"921","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"922","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinions on"
"923","the financial statements and to comply with the"
"924","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"925","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds?"
"926","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"927","we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"928","Funds? internal control over financial reporting."
"929","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"930","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"931","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"932","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"933","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"934","company?s internal control over financial reporting is a"
"935","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"936","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"937","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"938","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"939","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"940","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"941","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"942","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"943","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"944","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"945","of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"946","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"947","the company are being made only in accordance with"
"948","authorizations of management and trustees of the company;"
"949","and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"950","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"951","disposition of a company?s assets that could have a material"
"952","effect on the financial statements."
"953","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"954","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"955","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"956","future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"957","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"958","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures"
"959","may deteriorate."
"960","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"961","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"962","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"963","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"964","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"965","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"966","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"967","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"968","the Funds? annual or interim financial statements will not"
"969","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"970","Our consideration of the Funds? internal control over"
"971","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"972","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"973","all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"974","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"975","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"976","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"977","Funds? internal control over financial reporting and its"
"978","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities"
"979","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above"
"980","as of June 30, 2013."
"981","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"982","of management and the Board of Trustees of Nationwide Mutual"
"983","Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"984","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"985","these specified parties."

"1003","POTENTIAL MATERIAL LITIGATION"
"1004","(As of June 30, 2013)"
"1005","1. Tribune Company Bankruptcy Proceeding"
"1006","(April 30, 2013 Email from Neal Troum: ntroum@stradley.com) -"
"1007","No updates as of June 30, 2013"
"1008","      In 2007, the Tribune Company (Tribune) underwent a"
"1009","leveraged buyout (LBO), in which Tribune purchased from its"
"1010","shareholders all of its outstanding stock.   Following the LBO,"
"1011","Tribune entered bankruptcy.  In connection with the bankruptcy,"
"1012","Tribune's committee of unsecured creditors filed an adversary"
"1013","action relating to the LBO (the Committee Action, sometimes"
"1014","referred to as FitzSimons, which is the first named defendant)."
"1015","Among the claims asserted in the Committee Action are fraudulent"
"1016","conveyance claims against all of the former Tribune shareholders"
"1017","that received payment from Tribune in exchange for their Tribune"
"1018","stock in connection with the LBO.  There are many other claims in"
"1019","the Committee Action against a host of other defendants --"
"1020","essentially everyone involved in the LBO -- and the fraudulent"
"1021","conveyance claims are merely one small part of this case."
"1022","      A second set of lawsuits were filed around the country in"
"1023","connection with the LBO and the tender (the Noteholder Actions,"
"1024","also called Deutsche, which is the first named plaintiff in all"
"1025","these suits).  These lawsuits are brought by holders of pre-LBO"
"1026","debt.  They too seek to disgorge all amounts received by former"
"1027","Tribune shareholders in the LBO.  The claims brought are also"
"1028","fraudulent conveyance claims, but they allege constructive"
"1029","(as opposed to intentional) fraudulent conveyance under state"
"1030","(as opposed to federal) law.  These are the only claims brought"
"1031","in this suit."
"1032","      There are four Nationwide entities that are currently"
"1033","defendants in these related lawsuits.  (A fifth, NFA, was also"
"1034"," a defendant but has since been dismissed.)  They are (1)"
"1035","Nationwide S&P 500 Index Fund (which is a defendant in both"
"1036","the Committee Action and one of the Noteholder Actions), (2)"
"1037","NVIT S&P 500 Index Fund (same), (3) Nationwide Funds (same),"
"1038","and (4) Nationwide Mutual Funds (which is a defendant only"
"1039","in the Committee Action)."
"1040","      The Committee Action and all of the Noteholder Actions"
"1041","have been transferred to the United States District Court for"
"1042","the Southern District of New York for all pre-trial purposes"
"1043","by means of a procedural mechanism called multi-district"
"1044","litigation (MDL)."
"1045","In all, there are thousands if not tens of thousands of defendants."
"1046","      The MDL has thus far moved very slowly.  The MDL judge has"
"1047","issued a few orders that have created an organizational structure,"
"1048","with certain defendants (and the law firms representing them)"
"1049","appointed to executive committees, which act as liaisons to the"
"1050","many parties involved in these cases."
"1051","      The only substantive event to take place has been briefing"
"1052","on a motion to dismiss the Noteholder Actions.  This so-called"
"1053","Phase I briefing asserts arguments on behalf of all defendants"
"1054","in these cases that, if successful, would result in the dismissal"
"1055","of the Noteholder Actions in their entirety.  (The arguments are"
"1056","specific to the constructive fraudulent conveyance state law claims"
"1057","so resolution of these arguments will have no effect on the Committee"
"1058","Action.)  This briefing is complete, and oral argument is set for"
"1059","May 24, 2013, in New York.  A ruling is expected some time"
"1060","thereafter, likely during the summer.  The gist of the argument"
"1061","is that the Noteholder plaintiffs lack standing, as only a"
"1062","bankruptcy unsecured creditors committee or trustee can bring"
"1063","such claims; and, similarly, that these state law claims are"
"1064","preempted by federal law.  This latter argument stems in part"
"1065","from the fact that the federal fraudulent conveyance claims at"
"1066","issue in the Committee Action have a safe harbor that might protect"
"1067","the former-shareholder defendants from disgorgement of the amounts"
"1068","received in the LBO; the analogous state law has no such safe harbor."
"1069"," (There are other differences as well between these two types of claims.)"
"1070","      In the event this Phase I motion is not granted, the court has"
"1071","indicated there will be Phase II dismissal briefing in connection with"
"1072","Noteholder Actions.  Phase II will allow arguments that are specific to"
"1073","different types of defendants (as opposed to the Phase I arguments,"
"1074","which seek to dismiss all defendants).  It is anticipated that we will"
"1075","at that time seek dismissal of Nationwide Funds and Nationwide Mutual"
"1076","Funds as defendants.  As to the former, plaintiffs have refused to"
"1077","identify what Funds they are referring to, and it is not believed"
"1078","that any funds other than the two identified above participated in"
"1079","the tender; as to the latter, this is not an entity that participated"
"1080","in the tender or received payments in connection therewith."
"1081","      The Committee Action, meanwhile, remains stayed in its entirety."
"1082","There has been no indication from the court as to what will take place"
"1083","other than the Phase I and Phase II dismissal briefing in the Noteholder"
"1084","Actions.  Thus, whatever the outcome of this Phase I briefing, this matter"
"1085","is not likely to be resolved in its entirety in the near future."
"1086","      A few other comments.  First, a settlement offer was made by the"
"1087","combined plaintiffs in all the MDL cases.  It is believed that not many"
"1088","accepted this offer, and none of the Nationwide defendants did either."
"1089","Second, Tribune has emerged from bankruptcy following the bankruptcy"
"1090","judge's confirmation of the plan of reorganization.  As a result, there"
"1091","is no longer a committee of unsecured creditors, and the Committee Action"
"1092","is now brought by a litigation trustee.  This changes the caption but"
"1093","nothing else."
"1094","2. Lehman Brothers Insolvency Proceeding (As of December 18, 2012 --"
"1095","Information Provided By BlackRock, which has confirmed this summary) -"
"1096","No updates as of June 30, 2013"
"1097","      The Nationwide Bond Index Fund (NBIF), a series of Nationwide"
"1098","Mutual Funds, has received a demand from the trustee in the Lehman Brothers"
"1099","insolvency proceeding (the LBI Trustee) to return $272,279.48 (which is"
"1100","76% of the full amount that NBIF received).  We understand that, as part of"
"1101","the Lehman bankruptcy proceedings, BlackRock Financial Management (BlackRock)"
"1102","on behalf of BlackRock's managed funds, including NBIF, entered into an agreement"
"1103","with Lehman Brothers, Inc. (LBI).  The agreement with LBI provided that"
"1104","BlackRock would net all of the positions that BlackRock's managed funds held"
"1105","with LBI and then either pay over the balance still due to LBI or, if payment"
"1106","was due to BlackRock, BlackRock would file a claim on behalf of BlackRock's"
"1107","managed funds.  NBIF was entitled to a payment from LBI (NBIF was in a net"
"1108","positive position).  BlackRock paid NBIF using a portion of the funds that"
"1109","BlackRock collected from BlackRock's managed funds that owed LBI money (funds"
"1110","that were net negative with LBI).  The LBI Trustee now is seeking to have NBIF"
"1111","return the funds that NBIF received because the LBI Trustee believes that this"
"1112","payment was an improper setoff.  BlackRock is representing NBIF in the"
"1113","negotiations with the LBI Trustee.  As of December 8, 2011, the LBI Trustee's"
"1114","demand was 76% of the amount received ($272,279.48)."
"1115","      BlackRock subsequently executed a settlement agreement with the LBI"
"1116","Trustee on May 29, 2012.  The material terms of the settlement agreement"
"1117","provided that participating clients of BlackRock, including NBIF, would return"
"1118","to the Trustee approximately 76% of the monies that these BlackRock clients"
"1119","received under the netting and/or assignment agreements (the Agreements)."
"1120","In return, these participating clients would receive a release from LBI from any"
"1121","liability associated with the Agreements and an unsecured claim against LBI in"
"1122","the amount that would be returned to the Trustee."
"1123","      NBIF participated in the LBI-BlackRock settlement, and, on July 6, 2012,"
"1124","wired BlackRock payment in the amount of $272,512.61 (the Required Amount)"
"1125","from NBIF's portfolio to an escrow account that has been established by BlackRock"
"1126","(the Escrow Account).  The settlement was approved by the United States"
"1127","Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court)"
"1128","on September 15, 2012.  Thus, NBIF has an unsecured claim against LBI as a result"
"1129","of the settlement in the amount of $272,512.61 and a release from liability in"
"1130","connection with the TBA transactions that were resolved pursuant to the"
"1131","settlement agreement."
