"991","<DESCRIPTION>INTERNAL CONTROL LETTER"
"992","<TEXT>"
"993","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"994","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of Aspiriant Trust:"
"995","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"996"," of the Aspiriant Trust, comprising the Aspiriant Risk-Managed"
"997","Equity Allocation Fund, Aspiriant Defensive Allocation Fund,"
"998","and Aspiriant Risk-Managed Municipal Bond Fund (collectively"
"999","the 'Funds') as of and for the year ended February 28, 2018,"
"1000"," in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1001","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"1002","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"1003","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"1004","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"1005","of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"1006","to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"1007","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"1008","of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"1009","Accordingly, we express no such opinion.The management of"
"1010","the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1011","effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1012","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments"
"1013","by management are required to assess the expected benefits"
"1014","and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"1015","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"1016","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"1017","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"1018","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1019","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"1020","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1021","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1022","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1023","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"1024","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1025","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1026","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures"
"1027","of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"1028","of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1029","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1030","acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"1031","a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its"
"1032","inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1033","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"1034","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject"
"1035","to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes"
"1036"," in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"1037","or procedures may deteriorate.A deficiency in internal control"
"1038","over financial reporting exists when the design or operation"
"1039","of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"1040","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"1041","or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness"
"1042","is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1043","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1044","possibility that a material misstatement of the fund's annual"
"1045","or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"1046","on a timely basis.Our consideration of the Funds' internal control"
"1047","over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"1048","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"1049","in internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1050","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1051","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"1052","Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1053","including controls for safeguarding securities that we consider to"
"1054","be a material weakness, as defined above, as of February 28, 2018."
"1055","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1056","management and the Board of Trustees of the Aspiriant Trust"
"1057","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"1058","to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."
