"804","<P style=margin:0px align=justify>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of RiverNorth Funds, comprising of the RiverNorth Core Opportunity Fund and RiverNorth/DoubleLine Strategic Income Fund (the &#147;Funds&#148;), as of and for the period ended September 30, 2011, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting. &nbsp;Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</P>"
"805","<P style=margin:0px align=justify><BR></P>"
"806","<P style=margin:0px align=justify>The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. &nbsp;In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. &nbsp;A fund&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. &nbsp;A fund&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and Board of Trustees of the Fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. &nbsp;</P>"
"807","<P style=margin:0px align=justify><BR></P>"
"808","<P style=margin:0px align=justify>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. &nbsp;Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"
"809","<P style=margin:0px align=justify><BR></P>"
"810","<P style=margin:0px align=justify>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. &nbsp;A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds&#146; annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</P>"
"811","<P style=margin:0px align=justify><BR></P>"
"812","<P style=margin:0px align=justify>Our consideration of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). &nbsp;However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of September 30, 2011.</P>"

"841","<DIV style=width:624px><P style=margin:0px; font-size:12pt align=justify>Trust Company of the West has commenced litigation against the DoubleLine Capital, LP (&#147;Sub-Adviser&#148;) and four employees of the Sub-Adviser. The four employees (including Jeffrey Gundlach) are former employees of Trust Company of the West or its affiliates. The suit alleges, among other things, unfair competition and misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, damages in excess of $200 million and a constructive trust on the limited partnership interests of the sub-adviser in favor of Trust Company of the West. &nbsp;Also an employee of the Sub-Adviser (who is not a party to the lawsuit) has been interviewed by personnel from a governmental agency in connection with the U.S. Treasury&#146;s Legacy Securities Public Private Investment Program (the &#147;PPIP&#148;) and in connection with the same allegations with respect to misappropriation of proprietary information made by Trust Company of the West in its litigation against the Sub-Adviser. Trust Company of the West raised a fund under the PPIP in the Fall of 2009 to be managed by Mr. Gundlach, as key person, and announced in January 2010, subsequent to the termination of Mr. Gundlach, that it had voluntarily withdrawn the fund from the PPIP and would conduct an orderly liquidation of the fund.</P>"
"842","<P style=margin:0px align=justify><BR></P>"
"843","<P style=margin:0px; font-size:12pt align=justify>Although the RiverNorth Funds are not currently a party to any litigation, litigation and investigation and defense of any governmental review or investigation are expensive and time consuming, and their results can be unpredictable. &nbsp;There can be no assurances as to the outcome of these matters. &nbsp;As well, the litigation and any governmental review or investigation could consume a material amount of the Sub-Adviser&#146;s resources thereby impairing the Sub-Adviser&#146;s ability to attract or retain talented personnel or otherwise effectively manage its portion of the Fund. &nbsp;In the event of an adverse outcome or if the expenses of litigation and related matters are greater than anticipated, the Sub-Adviser&#146;s ability to manage its portion of the RiverNorth/DoubleLine Strategic Income Fund (the &#147;Fund&#148;) may be materially impaired, and shareholders, or the viability of the Fund,<A NAME=_GoBack></A> could be adversely affected.</P>"
