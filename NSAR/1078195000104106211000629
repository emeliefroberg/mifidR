"465","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING"
"466","FIRM"
"467","ON INTERNAL CONTROL REQUIRED UNDER FORM N-SAR"
"468","To the Trustees and Shareholders of"
"469","   The Community Reinvestment Act Qualified"
"470","Investment Fund"
"471","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"472","financial statements of The Community Reinvestment"
"473","Act Qualified Investment Fund (the Fund) as of and"
"474","for the year ended May 31, 2011, in accordance with"
"475","the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"476","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"477","Funds internal control over financial reporting"
"478","(internal control), including control activities for"
"479","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"480","audit procedures for the purpose of expressing an"
"481","opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"482","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"483","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"484","effectiveness of the Funds internal control."
"485","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"486","Management of the Fund is responsible for"
"487","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"488","control.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"489","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"490","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"491","controls.  An entitys internal control over"
"492","financial reporting  is a process designed to"
"493","provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"494","reliability of financial reporting and the"
"495","preparation of financial statements for external"
"496","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"497","accounting principles.  An entitys internal control"
"498","includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"499","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"500","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"501","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"502","entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"503","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"504","preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"505","with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"506","that receipts and expenditures of the entity are"
"507","being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"508","management and trustees of the entity; and (3)"
"509","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"510","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,"
"511","or disposition of the entitys assets that could have"
"512","a material effect on the financial statements."
"513","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"514","control may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"515","Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"
"516","to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"517","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"518","conditions, or the degree of compliance with"
"519","policies and procedures may deteriorate."
"520","A deficiency in internal control exists when the"
"521","design or operation of a control does not allow"
"522","management or employees, in the normal course of"
"523","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"524","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"525","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"526","deficiencies, in internal control, such that there"
"527","is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"528","misstatement of the Funds annual or interim"
"529","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"530","detected on a timely basis."
"531","Our consideration of internal control would not"
"532","necessarily identify all deficiencies in internal"
"533","control that might be material weaknesses. Given"
"534","these limitations during our audit, we did not"
"535","identify any deficiencies in the Funds internal"
"536","control, including control activities for"
"537","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be"
"538","material weaknesses as of May 31, 2011. However,"
"539","material weaknesses may exist that were not"
"540","identified."
"541","This report is intended solely for the information"
"542","and use of management, the Board of Trustees of The"
"543","Community Reinvestment Act Qualified Investment Fund"
"544","and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and"
"545","is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"546","anyone other than these specified parties."
