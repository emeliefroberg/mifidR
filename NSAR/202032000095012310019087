"5439","             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"5440","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"5441","of AIM Growth Series:"
"5442","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of AIM Growth"
"5443","Series (the Funds) as of and for the year or period ended December 31, 2009,"
"5444","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"5445","Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"5446","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"5447","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"5448","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"5449","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"5450","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an"
"5451","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"5452","reporting."
"5453","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"5454","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"5455","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"5456","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"5457","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"5458","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"5459","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"5460","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"5461","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"5462","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"5463","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"5464","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"5465","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"5466","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"5467","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of"
"5468","the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"5469","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"5470","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"5471","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"5472","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"5473","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"5474","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"5475","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"5476","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"5477","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"5478","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"5479","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"5480","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"5481","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"5482","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"5483","on a timely basis."
"5484","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"5485","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"5486","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"5487","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"5488","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"5489","deficiencies in the Company's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"5490","operation, including controls over"
"5491","<PAGE>"
"5492","safeguarding securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"5493","above as of December 31, 2009."
"5494","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"5495","Board of Trustees of AIM Growth Series and the Securities and Exchange"
"5496","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"5497","these specified parties."

"5557","SETTLED ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO MARKET TIMING"
"5558","          On October 8, 2004, INVESCO Funds Group, Inc. (IFG), (former"
"5559","investment adviser to certain AIM Funds), Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco),"
"5560","successor by merger to Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc. and Invesco Aim Distributors,"
"5561","Inc. (Invesco Aim Distributors) reached final settlements with certain"
"5562","regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York"
"5563","Attorney General and the Colorado Attorney General, to resolve civil enforcement"
"5564","actions and/or investigations related to market timing and related activity in"
"5565","the AIM Funds, including those formerly advised by IFG. As part of the"
"5566","settlements, a $325 million fair fund ($110 million of which is civil penalties)"
"5567","was created to compensate shareholders harmed by market timing and related"
"5568","activity in funds formerly advised by IFG. Additionally, Invesco and Invesco Aim"
"5569","Distributors created a $50 million fair fund ($30 million of which is civil"
"5570","penalties) to compensate shareholders harmed by market timing and related"
"5571","activity in funds advised by Invesco, which was done pursuant to the terms of"
"5572","the settlement. The methodology of the fair funds distributions was determined"
"5573","by Invesco's independent distribution consultant (IDC Plan), in consultation"
"5574","with Invesco and the independent trustees of the AIM Funds, and approved by the"
"5575","SEC on May 23, 2008."
"5576","          The IDC Plans provide for distribution to all eligible investors, for"
"5577","the periods spanning January 1, 2000 through July 31, 2003 (for the IFG Fair"
"5578","Fund) and January 1, 2001 through September 30, 2003 (for the AIM Fair Fund),"
"5579","their proportionate share of the applicable Fair Fund to compensate such"
"5580","investors for injury they may have suffered as a result of market timing in the"
"5581","affected funds. The IDC Plans include a provision for any residual amounts in"
"5582","the Fair Funds to be distributed in the future to the affected funds. Further"
"5583","details regarding the IDC Plan and distributions thereunder are available on"
"5584","Invesco's Web site, available at http://www.invescoaim.com."
"5585","At the present time, management of Invesco and the AIM Funds are unable to"
"5586","estimate the impact, if any, that the outcome of the Pending Litigation and"
"5587","Regulatory Inquiries described herein may have on Invesco, Invesco Aim"
"5588","Distributors or the AIM Funds."
"5589","Pending Regulatory Action Alleging Market Timing"
"5590","          On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Office of the State Auditor -"
"5591","Securities Commission (WVASC) issued a Summary Order to Cease and Desist and"
"5592","Notice of Right to Hearing to Invesco and Invesco Aim Distributors (Order No."
"5593","05-1318). The WVASC makes findings of fact that Invesco and Invesco Aim"
"5594","Distributors entered into certain arrangements permitting market timing of the"
"5595","AIM Funds and failed to disclose these arrangements in the prospectuses for such"
"5596","Funds, and conclusions of law to the effect that Invesco and Invesco Aim"
"5597","Distributors violated the West Virginia securities laws. The WVASC orders"
"5598","Invesco and Invesco Aim Distributors to cease any further violations and seeks"
"5599","to impose monetary sanctions, including restitution to affected investors,"
"5600","disgorgement of fees, reimbursement of investigatory, administrative and legal"
"5601","costs and an administrative assessment, to be determined by the Commissioner."
"5602","Initial research indicates that these damages could be limited or capped by"
"5603","statute. By agreement with the Commissioner of Securities, Invesco's time to"
"5604","respond to that Order has been indefinitely suspended."
"5605","Private Civil Actions Alleging Market Timing"
"5606","          Multiple civil lawsuits, including purported class action and"
"5607","shareholder derivative suits, have been filed against various parties"
"5608","(including, depending on the lawsuit, certain AIM Funds, IFG, Invesco, Invesco"
"5609","Aim Management Group, Inc. and certain related entities, certain of their"
"5610","current and former officers and/or certain unrelated third parties) based on"

"5623","removal of certain directors and/or employees; various corrective measures under"

"5626","timing, late trading, and related issues have been transferred to the United"
"5627","States District Court for the District of Maryland (the MDL Court) for"
"5628","consolidated or coordinated pre-trial proceedings."
"5629","          Pursuant to an Order of the MDL Court, plaintiffs in these lawsuits"
"5630","consolidated their claims for pre-trial purposes into three amended complaints"
"5631","against various Invesco - and IFG-related parties. The parties in the amended"
"5632","complaints have agreed in principle to settle the actions. A list identifying"
"5633","the amended complaints in the MDL Court and details of the settlements are"

"5647","          1:04-MD-15864-FPS), filed on September 29, 2004."
"5648","          On March 1, 2006, the MDL Court dismissed all derivative causes of"
"5649","action in the Essenmacher lawsuit but two: (i) the excessive fee claim under"
"5650","Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act); and (ii) the"
"5651","control person liability claim under Section 48 of the 1940 Act, and all"
"5652","claims asserted in the Lepera class action lawsuit but three: (i) the securities"
"5653","fraud claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (ii)"
"5654","the excessive fee claim under Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act (which survived only"
"5655","insofar as plaintiffs seek recovery of fees associated with the assets involved"
"5656","in market timing); and (iii) the control person liability claim under Section"
"5657","48 of the 1940 Act. On June 14, 2006, the MDL Court entered an order dismissing"
"5658","the Section 48 claim in the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuit. Based on the MDL"
"5659","Court's March 1, 2006 and June 14, 2006 orders, all claims asserted against the"
"5660","Funds that were transferred to the MDL Court were dismissed, although certain"
"5661","Funds remain nominal defendants in the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuit. On"
"5662","January 5, 2008, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle both"
"5663","the class action (Lepera) and the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuits, subject to"
"5664","the MDL Court approval. Individual class members have the right to object."
"5665","          On September 15, 2006, Judge Motz for the MDL Court granted the"
"5666","Defendants' motion to dismiss the ERISA (Calderon) lawsuit and dismissed such"
"5667","lawsuit. The Plaintiff appealed this decision. On June 16, 2008, the Fourth"
"5668","Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal and remanded this lawsuit back"
"5669","to the MDL Court for further proceedings. On December 15, 2008, the parties"
"5670","reached an agreement in principle to settle this lawsuit, subject to the MDL"
"5671","Court approval. Individual class members have the right to object. No payments"
"5672","are required under the settlement; however, the parties agreed that certain"
"5673","limited changes to benefit plans and participants' accounts would be made."

"5677","Other Actions Involving AIM Floating Rate Fund"
"5678","          AIM Floating Rate Fund has been named as a defendant in a private"
"5679","civil action based on its position as a creditor to a certain entity that has"
"5680","filed a petition in bankruptcy court. Set forth below is a brief description of"
"5681","the civil lawsuit that was served or had service of process waived."
"5682","          ADELPHIA COMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND ITS AFFILIATE DEBTORS IN POSSESSION"
"5683","          AND OFFICIAL COMMITTEE OF UNSECURED CREDITORS OF ADELPHIA"
"5684","          COMMUNICATIONS CORP. V. BANK OF AMERICA, INDIVIDUALLY AND AS AGENT FOR"
"5685","          VARIOUS BANKS PARTY TO CREDIT AGREEMENTS, AIM FLOATING RATE FUND, ET"
"5686","          AL., in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District"
"5687","          of New York, Case No. 02-41729, filed July 6, 2003. This is an"
"5688","          adversary proceeding by Adelphia Communications Corp. (Adelphia) and"
"5689","          related parties, along with its Official Committee of Unsecured"
"5690","          Creditors, against more than 360 banks, financial services companies,"
"5691","          insurance companies, investment banks, mutual funds and other parties"
"5692","          that had arranged for the sale of, or purchased the bank debt of,"
"5693","          Adelphia or its related parties. Named defendants include AIM Floating"
"5694","          Rate Fund as a purchaser of this bank debt. The Complaint alleges that"
"5695","          the purchasers of this bank debt knew, or should have known, that the"
"5696","          loan proceeds would not benefit Adelphia, but instead would be used to"
"5697","          enrich Adelphia insiders. It seeks avoidance of the loans and recovery"
"5698","          of intentionally fraudulent transfers. AIM Floating Rate Fund and"
"5699","          similarly situated non-agent bank lenders have negotiated a resolution"
"5700","          to their claims as creditors in the Adelphia bankruptcy; however, this"
"5701","          adversary proceeding will continue. On June 11, 2007, the judge in"
"5702","          this adversary proceeding ruled on the Agent Banks' Motions to Dismiss"
"5703","          and dismissed some of the claims but left most of the suit intact."
"5704","          Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint against almost 700 defendants"
"5705","          on October 19, 2007; but made no new allegations against AIM Floating"
"5706","          Rate Fund. This latest Amended Complaint adds hundreds of new"
"5707","          defendants and makes materially different claims and is much more than"
"5708","          a repleading of the prior Complaint's allegations. AIM Floating Rate"
"5709","          Fund is still the only Invesco-related party named as a defendant. On"
"5710","          June 17, 2008, the Court granted, in its entirety, the Motion to"
"5711","          Dismiss filed by a group of defendants that includes AIM Floating Rate"
"5712","          Fund and dismissed all of Adelphia's claims against it. On July 17,"
"5713","          2008, the AIM Floating Rate Fund's group of defendants filed a Motion"
"5714","          to make the Dismissal a Final Judgment, which the court granted."
"5715","          Adelphia appealed the ruling, and the appeal is pending."
"5716","          More detailed information regarding each of the civil lawsuits"
"5717","identified above, including the parties to the lawsuits and summaries of the"
"5718","various allegations and remedies sought, can be found in the Fund's Statement of"

"5733","On September 25, 2009, AIM Growth Series (the Trust) commenced operations of"
"5734","the Class S shares for the following funds: AIM Conservative Allocation Fund,"
"5735","AIM Growth Allocation Fund and AIM Moderate Allocation Fund (each a Fund and"
"5736","collectively the Funds). Class S shares are sold at net asset value, and are"
"5737","not subject to an initial sales charge. Shares of beneficial interest of the"
"5738","Trust are redeemable at their net asset value (subject, in certain"
"5739","circumstances, to a contingent deferred sales charge or redemption fee) at the"
"5740","option of the shareholder or at the option of the Trust in certain"
"5741","circumstances. Each class of shares represents an interest in the same portfolio"
"5742","of investments. Differing sales charges and expenses will result in differing"
"5743","net asset values and dividends and distributions. Each share of a Fund generally"
"5744","has the same voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights; however, each class"
"5745","of shares of a Fund is subject to different sales loads, conversion features,"
"5746","exchange privileges and class-specific expenses. Only shareholders of a specific"
"5747","class may vote on matters relating to that class' distribution plan."
"5748","Shareholders of each Fund are entitled to one vote per share (with proportionate"
"5749","voting for fractional shares), irrespective of the relative net asset value of"
"5750","the shares of a Fund. However, on matters affecting an individual Fund or class"
"5751","of shares, a separate vote of shareholders of that Fund or class is required."
"5752","Shareholders of a Fund or class are not entitled to vote on any matter which"
"5753","does not affect that Fund or class but that requires a separate vote of another"
"5754","Fund or class. When issued, shares of each Fund are fully paid and"
"5755","nonassessable, have no preemptive or subscription rights and are freely"
"5756","transferable. Class S shares do not have conversion rights. Class S shares do"
"5757","not have cumulative voting rights, which means that in situations in which"
"5758","shareholders elect trustees, holders of more than 50% of the shares voting for"
"5759","the election of trustees can elect all of the trustees of the Trust, and the"
"5760","holders of less than 50% of the shares voting for the election of trustees will"
"5761","not be able to elect any trustees. Upon any liquidation of the Trust,"
"5762","shareholders of each class are entitled to share pro rata in the net assets"
"5763","belonging to the applicable Fund allocable to such class available for"
"5764","distribution after satisfaction of outstanding liabilities of the Fund allocable"
"5765","to such class."
"5766","Under Delaware law, shareholders of a Delaware statutory trust shall be entitled"
"5767","to the same limitations of liability extended to shareholders of private"
"5768","for-profit corporations. There is a remote possibility, however, that"
"5769","shareholders could, under certain circumstances, be held liable for the"
"5770","obligations of the Trust to the extent the courts of another state which does"
"5771","not recognize such limited liability were to apply the laws of such state to a"
"5772","controversy involving such obligations. The Amended and Restated Agreement and"
"5773","Declaration of Trust (the Trust Agreement) disclaims shareholder liability for"
"5774","acts or obligations of the Trust and requires that notice of such disclaimer be"
"5775","given in each agreement, obligation or instrument entered into or executed by"
"5776","the Trust or the trustees to all parties, and each party thereto must expressly"
"5777","waive all rights of action directly against shareholders of the Trust. The Trust"
"5778","Agreement provides for indemnification out of the property of a Fund for all"
"5779","losses and expenses of any shareholder of such Fund held liable on account of"
"5780","being or having been a shareholder. Thus, the risk of a shareholder incurring"
"5781","financial loss due to shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which"
"5782","a Fund is unable to meet its obligations and the complaining party is not held"
"5783","to be bound by the disclaimer."

"6142","     This Memorandum of Agreement is entered into as of the Effective Date on"

"6148","listed on the Exhibits to this Memorandum of Agreement (the Funds), and"
"6149","Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc. (Invesco Aim). Invesco Aim shall and hereby agrees"
"6150","to waive fees or reimburse expenses of each Fund, on behalf of its respective"
"6151","classes as applicable, severally and not jointly, as indicated in the attached"
"6152","Exhibits."
"6153","     For and in consideration of the mutual terms and agreements set forth"
"6154","herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of"
"6155","which is hereby acknowledged, the Trusts and Invesco Aim agree as follows:"
"6156","     For the Contractual Limits (listed in Exhibits A - C), the Trusts and"
"6157","Invesco Aim agree until at least the expiration date set forth on the attached"
"6158","Exhibits A - C (the Expiration Date) that Invesco Aim will waive its fees or"
"6159","reimburse expenses to the extent that expenses of a class of a Fund (excluding"

"6166","rate, on an annualized basis, set forth on the Exhibits of the average daily net"
"6167","assets allocable to such class. Acquired fund fees and expenses are not fees or"
"6168","expenses incurred by a fund directly but are expenses of the investment"
"6169","companies in which a fund invests. These fees and expenses are incurred"
"6170","indirectly through the valuation of a fund's investment in these investment"
"6171","companies. Acquired fund fees and expenses are required to be disclosed and"
"6172","included in the total annual fund operating expenses in the prospectus fee"
"6173","table. As a result, the net total annual fund operating expenses shown in the"

"6175","With regard to the Contractual Limits, the Board of Trustees of the Trust and"
"6176","Invesco Aim may terminate or modify this Memorandum of Agreement prior to the"
"6177","Expiration Date only by mutual written consent. Invesco Aim will not have any"
"6178","right to reimbursement of any amount so waived or reimbursed."
"6179","     For the Contractual Limits, each of the Trusts and Invesco Aim agree to"
"6180","review the then-current expense limitations for each class of each Fund listed"
"6181","on the Exhibits on a date prior to the Expiration Date to determine whether such"
"6182","limitations should be amended, continued or terminated. The expense limitations"
"6183","will expire upon the Expiration Date unless the Trusts and Invesco Aim have"
"6184","agreed to continue them. The Exhibits will be amended to reflect any such"
"6185","agreement."
"6186","     For the Voluntary Limits (listed in Exhibits A - C), the Trusts and Invesco"

"6189","sole discretion after consultation with the Funds' Boards of Trustees. Any delay"
"6190","or failure by Invesco Aim to update this Memorandum of Agreement with regards to"
