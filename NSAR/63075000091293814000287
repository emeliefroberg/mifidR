"1664","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1665","To the Board of Trustees of MFS Series Trust IX and the Shareholders of MFS Bond"
"1666","Fund, MFS Limited Maturity Fund, MFS Municipal Limited Maturity Fund and MFS"
"1667","Research Bond Fund:"
"1668","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of MFS Bond"
"1669","Fund, MFS Limited Maturity Fund, MFS Municipal Limited Maturity Fund and MFS"
"1670","Research Bond Fund (each a series comprising MFS Series Trust IX) (the Funds)"
"1671","as of and for the year ended April 30, 2014, in accordance with the standards of"
"1672","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1673","Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1674","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"1675","the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements and to comply"
"1676","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"1677","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1678","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1679","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1680","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1681","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1682","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"1683","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1684","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1685","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1686","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"1687","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1688","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1689","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"1690","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1691","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1692","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"1693","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and"
"1694","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1695","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"1696","a material effect on the financial statements."
"1697","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1698","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1699","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1700","inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance"
"1701","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1702","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"1703","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"1704","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1705","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1706","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1707","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1708","fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"1709","on a timely basis."
"1710","<PAGE>"
"1711","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"1712","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1713","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1714","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"1715","Oversight Board (placecountry-regionUnited States).  However, we noted no"
"1716","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and their"
"1717","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"1718","be a material weakness, as defined above, as of April 30, 2014."
"1719","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"1720","Board of Trustees of MFS Series Trust IX and the Securities and Exchange"

"1795","        SECTION 1. MEETINGS. Meetings of the  Shareholders  may be called at any"
"1796","time by a majority of the Trustees. Meetings of the Shareholders for the purpose"
"1797","of considering the removal of a person serving as Trustee shall be called by the"
"1798","Trustees  if they are requested in writing to do so by Shareholders  holding  in"
"1799","the aggregate  Shares representing not less than ten percent (10%) of the voting"
"1800","power of the outstanding  Shares  of  the  Trust  having voting rights. Any such"
"1801","meeting  shall be held within or without The Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts  on"
"1802","such day and at such time as the Trustees shall designate."
"1803","        SECTION  2.  NOTICE OF MEETINGS. Notice of all meetings of Shareholders,"
"1804","stating the time, place  and  purposes  of  the  meeting,  shall be given by the"
"1805","Trustees in accordance with the Declaration, mailed or sent  at  least  (ten) 10"
"1806","days  and  not  more than ninety (90) days before the meeting. Only the business"
"1807","stated in the notice  of  the  meeting  shall be considered at such meeting. Any"
"1808","adjourned meeting may be held as adjourned  without  further notice, even if the"
"1809","date  of such adjourned meeting is more than 90 days after  the  notice  of  the"
"1810","meeting  was  mailed  or  sent.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if either the"
"1811","President  or  Clerk  of the Trust, or in the absence or unavailability  of  the"
"1812","President and the Clerk,  any  officer of the Trust, determines that as a result"
"1813","of force majeure or an act of God or war, the date, time or place designated for"
"1814","a meeting or adjourned meeting of  Shareholders is not reasonably practicable or"
"1815","available, such officer may, without  further  notice to Shareholders, designate"
"1816","such other date, time or place for such meeting  or  adjourned  meeting  as such"
"1817","officer shall, in his or her sole discretion, determine. No notice need be given"
"1818","to  any  Shareholder  who  shall  have failed to inform the Trust of his current"
"1819","address or if a written waiver of notice,  executed  before or after the meeting"
"1820","by  the  Shareholder or his attorney thereunto authorized,  is  filed  with  the"
"1821","records of the meeting."
"1822","      SECTION  3.  RECORD  DATE FOR MEETINGS. For the purpose of determining the"
"1823","Shareholders who are entitled  to  notice  of  and to vote at any meeting, or to"
"1824","participate in any distribution, or for the purpose  of  any  other  action, the"
"1825","Trustees  may  from  time to time close the transfer books for such period,  not"
"1826","exceeding thirty (30)  days,  as  the Trustees may determine; or without closing"
"1827","the transfer books the Trustees may  fix  a  date not more than ninety (90) days"
"1828","prior to the date of any meeting of Shareholders or distribution or other action"
"1829","as  a  record  date  for  the determination of the  persons  to  be  treated  as"
"1830","Shareholders of record for  such  purpose. The Trustees also may select the time"
"1831","of  day  as  of which the calculations  for  determining  how  many  votes  each"
"1832","Shareholder is entitled to pursuant to the Declaration shall be performed."
"1833","      SECTION  4.  PROXIES. At any meeting of Shareholders, any holder of Shares"
"1834","entitled to vote thereat  may  vote  by  proxy,  provided that no proxy shall be"
"1835","voted at any meeting unless it shall have been placed on file with the Clerk, or"
"1836","with  such  other officer or agent of the Trust as the  Clerk  may  direct,  for"
"1837","verification  prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken. Pursuant to a"
"1838","vote of a majority  of the Trustees, proxies may be solicited in the name of one"
"1839","or more Trustees or one  or more of the officers of the Trust. When any Share is"
"1840","held jointly by several persons,  any  one  of  them  may vote at any meeting in"
"1841","person  or  by proxy in respect of such Share (and a proxy  shall  be  valid  if"
"1842","executed by any  one  of them), but if more than one of them shall be present at"
"1843","such meeting in person  or  by  proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so"
"1844","present disagree as to any vote to  be  cast, such vote shall not be received in"
"1845","respect of such Share. A proxy purporting  to  be  executed by or on behalf of a"
"1846","Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise,"
"1847","and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the  challenger.  The placing"
"1848","of  a  Shareholder's  name  on  a proxy pursuant to telephonic or electronically"
"1849","transmitted instructions obtained  pursuant to procedures reasonably designed to"
"1850","verify that such instructions have been  authorized  by  such  Shareholder shall"
"1851","constitute execution of such proxy by or on behalf of such Shareholder.  If  the"
"1852","holder  of any such Share is a minor or a person of unsound mind, and subject to"
"1853","guardianship  or  to the legal control of any other person as regards the charge"
"1854","or management of such  Share,  he  may vote by his guardian or such other person"
"1855","appointed or having such control, and  such  vote  may  be given in person or by"
"1856","proxy. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of a"
"1857","proxy may be substituted for or used in lieu of the original  proxy  for any and"
"1858","all  purposes  for  which  the original proxy could be used, provided that  such"
"1859","copy, facsimile telecommunication  or  other  reproduction  shall  be a complete"
"1860","reproduction of the entire original proxy or the portion thereof to  be returned"
"1861","by the Shareholder."
"1862","      SECTION  5.  QUORUM  AND  ADJOURNMENT.   Except  when  a larger quorum  is"
"1863","required by any provision of law, Shares representing a majority  of  the voting"
"1864","power  of  the outstanding Shares entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum  at"
"1865","any meeting  of  Shareholders,  except  that  where  any  provision  of law, the"
"1866","Declaration or these By-laws requires that holders of any series or class  shall"
"1867","vote  as a series or class, then Shares representing a majority (unless a larger"
"1868","quorum  is  required  as  specified  above) of the voting power of the aggregate"
"1869","number of Shares of that series or class  entitled to vote shall be necessary to"
"1870","constitute a quorum for the transaction of  business by that series or class. In"
"1871","the absence of a quorum, Shareholders entitled  to  cast  votes  representing  a"
"1872","majority  of the voting power of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote present"
"1873","in person or  by proxy, or, where any provision of law, the Declaration or these"
"1874","By-laws requires  that  holders of any series or class shall vote as a series or"
"1875","class, Shareholders entitled to cast votes representing a majority of the voting"
"1876","power of the outstanding Shares of that series or class entitled to vote present"
"1877","in person or by proxy, may  adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum"
"1878","shall be present. Only Shareholders  of  record shall be entitled to vote on any"
"1879","matter."
"1880","      SECTION 6. INSPECTION OF RECORDS. The  records  of the Trust shall be open"
"1881","to inspection by Shareholders to the same extent as is permitted shareholders of"
"1882","a Massachusetts business corporation."
"1883","      SECTION  7.  ACTION  WITHOUT MEETING. Any action which  may  be  taken  by"
"1884","Shareholders may be taken without  a  meeting  if  Shareholders  holding  Shares"
"1885","representing  a  majority of the voting power of the Shares entitled to vote  on"
"1886","the matter (or such  larger  proportion thereof as shall be required by law, the"
"1887","Declaration or these By-Laws for  approval of such matter) consent to the action"
"1888","in writing and the written consents  are  filed with the records of the meetings"
"1889","of Shareholders. Such consent shall be treated  for all purposes as a vote taken"
"1890","at a meeting of Shareholders."

"1898","place of each meeting other than  regular  or  stated meetings shall be given by"
"1899","the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the  Clerk  or an Assistant Clerk or"
"1900","by the officer, Chair of the Trustees or other Trustee calling  the  meeting and"
"1901","shall be mailed to each Trustee at least two days before the meeting,  or  shall"
"1902","be  telegraphed,  cabled, or wirelessed or sent by facsimile or other electronic"
"1903","means to each Trustee  at his usual or last known business or residence address,"
"1904","or personally delivered  to him at least one day before the meeting. Such notice"
"1905","may, however, be waived by any Trustee. Notice of a meeting need not be given to"
"1906","any Trustee if a written waiver  of  notice, executed by him before or after the"
"1907","meeting, is filed with the records of the meeting, or to any Trustee who attends"
"1908","the meeting without protesting prior thereto  or at its commencement the lack of"
"1909","notice to him. A notice or waiver of notice need  not specify the purpose of any"
"1910","meeting. Except as provided by law the Trustees may meet by means of a telephone"
"1911","conference circuit or similar communications equipment  by  means  of  which all"
"1912","persons  participating  in  the  meeting  can  hear  each other, which telephone"
"1913","conference meeting shall be deemed to have been held at  a  place  designated by"
"1914","the  Trustees  at  the meeting. Participation in a telephone conference  meeting"
"1915","shall constitute presence in person at such meeting."
"1916","      SECTION 2. QUORUM  AND  MANNER OF ACTING. A majority of the Trustees shall"
"1917","be  present at any regular or special  meeting  of  the  Trustees  in  order  to"
"1918","constitute  a quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting and (except"

"1920","majority of the Trustees present at  any  such  meeting,  at  which  a quorum is"
"1921","present,  shall  be  the  act  of  the  Trustees. In the absence of a quorum,  a"

"1941","Chair."
"1942","      SECTION 2. MEETING, QUORUM AND MANNER OF ACTING. The Trustees may:"
"1943","            (i)   provide for stated meetings of any Committee;"

"2195","                  by less than one cent per share outstanding at the record date"
"2196","                  for  the  final dividend,  the  excess  shall  be  treated  as"

"2198","                  fiscal year; and"
"2199","(ii)        in the discretion  of the Trustees, an additional amount which shall"

"2202","                  to such series or class for such fiscal year; and"

"2204","                  assets."
"2205","The decision of the Trustees as to what, in  accordance  with generally accepted"
"2206","accounting  principles,  is  income and what is principal shall  be  final,  and"
"2207","except as specifically provided  herein  the decision of the Trustees as to what"
"2208","expenses and charges of the Trust shall be  charged  against  principal and what"
"2209","against income shall be final, all subject to any applicable provisions  of  the"
"2210","1940  Act.  For the purposes of the limitation imposed by this Section 1, Shares"
"2211","issued pursuant  to  Section 2 of this Article XII shall be valued at the amount"
"2212","of cash which the Shareholders  would  have  received  if  they  had  elected to"
"2213","receive cash in lieu of such Shares."
"2214","      Inasmuch as the computation of net income and gains for federal income tax"
"2215","purposes  may  vary from the computation thereof on the books of the Trust,  the"
"2216","above provisions shall be interpreted to give to the Trustees the power in their"
"2217","discretion to distribute  for  any  fiscal  year  as  ordinary  dividends and as"
"2218","capital  gains  distributions,  respectively,  additional amounts sufficient  to"
"2219","enable the Trust to avoid or reduce liability for  taxes.  Any  payment  made to"
"2220","Shareholders pursuant to clause (ii) and/or clause (iii) of this Section 1 shall"
"2221","be  accompanied  by  a  written  statement showing the source or sources of such"
"2222","payment, and the basis of computation thereof."
"2223","      SECTION 2. DISTRIBUTIONS PAYABLE  IN  CASH  OR  SHARES. The Trustees shall"

"2225","Massachusetts but subject to the limitation as to cash distributions  imposed by"
"2226","Section  1 of this Article XII, at any time or from time to time to declare  and"

"2233","                  elects to receive, in effect at such  time  at  or  after  the"
"2234","                  election  as  the  Trustees  may specify, shall not exceed the"
"2235","                  full  amount  of  cash  to  which that  Shareholder  would  be"
"2236","                  entitled if he elected to receive only cash."
"2237","In the case of a distribution payable in cash or  Shares  at  the  election of a"
"2238","Shareholder,  the  Trustees  may  prescribe  whether  a Shareholder, failing  to"
"2239","express his election before a given time shall be deemed to have elected to take"
"2240","Shares rather than cash, or to take cash rather then Shares,  or  to take Shares"
"2241","with cash adjustment of fractions."
"2242","      The  Trustees,  in  their sole discretion, may cause the Trust to  require"
"2243","that all distributions payable to a shareholder in amounts less than such amount"
"2244","or amounts determined from  time  to  time  by  the  Trustees  be  reinvested in"
"2245","additional  shares  of  the Trust rather than paid in cash, unless a shareholder"
"2246","who, after notification that  his distributions will be reinvested in additional"
"2247","shares  in  accordance  with  the  preceding  phrase,  elects  to  receive  such"
"2248","distributions in cash. Where a shareholder  has elected to receive distributions"
"2249","in cash and the postal or other delivery service  is unable to deliver checks to"
"2250","the shareholder's address of record, the Trustees, in their sole discretion, may"
"2251","cause  the  Trust  to  require that such Shareholder's  distribution  option  be"
"2252","converted to having all distributions reinvested in additional shares."
