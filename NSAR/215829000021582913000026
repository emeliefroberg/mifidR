"1613","<P>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Fidelity"
"1614","School Street Trust: Fidelity Strategic Income Fund as of and for the year ended"
"1615","December 31, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1616","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust's internal"
"1617","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1618","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1619","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1620","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1621","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"1622","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's"
"1623","internal control over financial reporting.</P>"
"1624","<P>The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1625","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1626","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1627","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"1628","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1629","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1630","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1631","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"1632","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1633","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1634","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"1635","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1636","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"1637","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Trust are being"
"1638","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"1639","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1640","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a Trust's assets"
"1641","that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
"1642","<P>Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1643","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1644","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1645","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"1646","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>"
"1647","<P>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1648","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"1649","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1650","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1651","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1652","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1653","Trust's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"

"1658","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1659","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"1660","deficiencies in the Trust's internal control over financial reporting and its"

"1806","<P></P></FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia>"
"1807","<P>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Fidelity"
"1808","School Street Trust: Fidelity Global Bond Fund and Fidelity International Bond"
"1809","Fund as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, in accordance with the"
"1810","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1811","considered the Trust's internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1812","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1813","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"1814","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1815","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over"
"1816","financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"1817","effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting.</P>"
"1818","<P>The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1819","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1820","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1821","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"1822","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1823","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1824","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1825","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"1826","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1827","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1828","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"1829","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1830","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"1831","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Trust are being"
"1832","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"1833","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1834","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a Trust's assets"
"1835","that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
"1836","<P>Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1837","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1838","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1839","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"1840","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>"
"1841","<P>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1842","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"1843","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1844","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1845","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1846","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1847","Trust's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"

"13292","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	AGREEMENT made this 19th day of April, 2012, by and between FMR Co., Inc., a Massachusetts corporation with principal offices at 82 Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts  (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Sub-Adviser&quot;)"
"13293","and Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, a Massachusetts corporation with principal offices at 82 Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Adviser&quot;)."

"13295","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Adviser has entered into a Management Contract with Fidelity School Street Trust, a<B> </B>Massachusetts business trust which may issue one or more series of shares of beneficial interest (hereinafter called the"

"13297","is to act as investment manager and adviser to the Portfolio, and"
"13298","</P>"
"13299","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Sub-Adviser was formed for the purpose of providing investment management of equity and"

"13301","</P>"
"13302","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises hereinafter set forth, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser agree as follows:"
"13303","</P>"
"13304","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	1.	(a)  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Adviser, direct the investments of all or"
"13305","such portion of the Portfolio's assets as the Adviser shall designate in accordance with the investment objective, policies and limitations as provided in the Portfolio's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as amended from time"
"13306","to time, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and rules thereunder, as amended from time to time (the &acute;&acute;1940 Act&quot;),"
"13307","and such other limitations as the Portfolio may impose by notice in writing to the Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish for the use of the Portfolio office space and all necessary office facilities, equipment and"
"13308","personnel for servicing the investments of the Portfolio; and shall pay the salaries and fees of all personnel of the"
"13309","Sub-Adviser performing services for the Portfolio relating to research, statistical and investment activities.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with the Portfolio or the Adviser, to buy, sell,"
"13310","lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment instruments on behalf of the Portfolio.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times be subject to the control"
"13311","and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."
"13312","</P>"
"13313","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(b)  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations, information or analyses to the Fund and the"
"13314","Adviser as the Fund's Board of Trustees or the Adviser may request from time to time or as the Sub-Adviser may"
"13315","deem to be desirable.  The Sub-Adviser shall make recommendations to the Fund's Board of Trustees with respect to"
"13316","Portfolio policies, and shall carry out such policies as are adopted by the Trustees.  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to"
"13317","review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other services as the Sub-Adviser shall from time to time determine to"
"13318","be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under this Agreement and which are not otherwise furnished by the"
"13319","Adviser."
"13320","</P>"
"13321","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(c)  The Sub-Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's"
"13322","account with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the"
"13323","Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices"
"13324","which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"13325","Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser, Adviser or their affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess"
"13326","of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either"
"13327","that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to"
"13328","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the"
"13329","commissions paid by the Portfolio to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were"

"13350","the Trust or to any shareholder of the Portfolio for any act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering"
"13351","services hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security."

"14039","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	1.	(a)  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Adviser, direct the investments of all"
"14040","or such portion of the Portfolio's assets as the Adviser shall designate in accordance with the investment objective, policies and limitations as provided in the Portfolio's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as"
"14041","amended from time to time, the Investment Company Act of l940 and rules thereunder, as amended from time to"
"14042","time (the &acute;&acute;l940 Act&quot;), and such other limitations as the Portfolio may impose by notice in writing to the Adviser"

"14052","may deem to be desirable.  The Sub-Adviser shall make recommendations to the Fund's Board of Trustees with"
