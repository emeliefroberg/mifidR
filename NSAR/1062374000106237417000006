"5093","Bond Fund (fifteen funds constituting VALIC Company"
"5094","II, hereafter referred to as the Series) as of and for the"
"5095","year ended August 31, 2017, in accordance with the"
"5096","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"5097","Board (United States), we considered the Series' internal"
"5098","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"5099","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"5100","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"5101","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"
"5102","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"5103","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"5104","the Series' internal control over financial reporting."
"5105","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"5106","effectiveness of the Series' internal control over financial"
"5107","reporting."
"5108","The management of the Series is responsible for"
"5109","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"5110","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"5111","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"5112","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"5113","A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"5114","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"5115","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"5116","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"5117","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"5118","principles.  A  fund's internal control over financial"
"5119","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"5120","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"5121","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"5122","dispositions of the assets of each fund; (2) provide"
"5123","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"5124","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"5125","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"5126","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of each"
"5127","fund are being made only in accordance with"
"5128","authorizations of management and trustees of each fund;"
"5129","and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"5130","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"5131","acquisition, use or disposition of each fund's assets that"
"5132","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"5133","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"5134","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"5135","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"5136","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"5137","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"5138","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"5139","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"5140","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"5141","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"5142","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"5143","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"5144","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is"
"5145","a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"5146","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"5147","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"5148","the Series' annual or interim financial statements will"
"5149","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"5150","Our consideration of the Series' internal control over"
"5151","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"5152","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"5153","all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"5154","reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"5155","standards established by the Public Company"
"5156","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"5157","we noted no deficiencies in the Series' internal control"
"5158","over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"5159","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to"
"5160","be material weaknesses as defined above as of August 31,"
"5161","2017."

"5163","of management and the Board of Trustees of VALIC"

SUB-SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT

	This SUB-SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT is made
as of this May 30, 2017 (the Sub-Sub-Advisory Agreement),
between Janus Capital Management LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (Janus) and Perkins Investment
Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(Perkins).

	WHEREAS, THE VARIABLE ANNUITY LIFE
INSURANCE COMPANY (VALIC) is engaged as the
investment adviser of VALIC Company II, an investment
company organized under the laws of Delaware as a business
trust (VC II), pursuant to an Investment Advisory
Agreement. VC II is a series type of investment company
issuing separate classes (or series) of shares of beneficial
interest and is registered as an open-end, management
investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (1940 Act) ;

       WHEREAS, VALIC has entered into an investment
Sub-Advisory Agreement with Janus (the Sub-Advisory"
"5644","Agreement) in order for Janus to assume certain
responsibilities and obligations of  VALIC under the
Investment Advisory Agreement with respect to the Large Cap
Value Fund
(the Fund);

       WHEREAS, Janus is authorized under the Sub-
Advisory Agreement to delegate any of its duties and
obligations to any affiliated person (as such term is defined in
the 1940 Act) that is eligible to serve as an investment adviser
to an investment company registered under the 1940 Act on
such terms and conditions as Janus deems necessary or
appropriate, provided that VALIC consents to any such
delegation and to the terms and conditions thereof and such
delegation is permitted by and in conformity with the 1940
Act;

       WHEREAS, Perkins is engaged in the business of
rendering investment advisory services and is registered as an
investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of
1940, as amended
(the Advisers Act);

       WHEREAS, Janus desires to delegate to Perkins its
duties and responsibilities for providing the day to day
portfolio management of the Fund and Perkins is willing to
accept such delegation and to render such portfolio
management services;


       NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

            1.	Delegation.  Janus hereby delegates to
Perkins the following duties and responsibilities required to be
performed by Janus for the  Fund pursuant to the Sub-Advisory
Agreement with respect to the investment and reinvestment of
the assets of the Fund:  Perkins shall manage the investment
operations of the Fund, shall determine without prior
consultation with VALIC or Janus, what securities and other
assets of the Fund will be acquired, held, or disposed of , and
shall direct Janus with respect to the execution of trades in
connection with such determinations, in conformity with the
investment objectives, policies and restrictions of the Fund.
Perkins shall not issue directly to broker(s) or dealer(s)
purchase or sell orders with respect to the securities of the Fund
and shall not be responsible for aggregating purchase or sell
orders for the Fund.  Perkins hereby accepts such delegation
and agrees to perform such duties and assume such
responsibilities, subject to the oversight of Janus.


2.	Further Obligations of Perkins.
                  (a)	In all matters relating to the
performance of this Sub-Sub-Advisory Agreement with
respect to the Fund, all of Perkins' acts or omissions shall be
in conformity with: (i) the Sub-Advisory Agreement between
VALIC and Janus; (ii) the investment goals and restrictions
specified by VALIC and the Fund documents (prospectus and
SAI) provided to Perkins; (iii) the Advisers Act; and (iv) all
other applicable federal and state laws governing the Fund's
operations and investments.
                  (b)	Perkins shall provide timely
reports to Janus on its activities under this Sub-Sub-Advisory
Agreement as agreed on from time to time, and shall provide
Janus with all information or documents that Janus may
reasonably request in connection with this Sub-Sub-Advisory
Agreement.
                  (c)	Perkins shall maintain all books
and records required to be maintained by Perkins pursuant to
the Advisers Act and shall make such records available to
Janus upon reasonable request.
                  (d)	Except to the extent otherwise
required by any applicable federal or state laws or by any
direction of VALIC or Janus, Perkins shall keep confidential
any and all information concerning the affairs of the Fund.
                  (e)	Perkins at its expense will make
available to VALIC at reasonable times its portfolio managers
and other appropriate personnel, either in person or, at the
mutual convenience of VALIC, Janus and Perkins, by
telephone, in order to review the investment policies,
performance and other investment related information
regarding the Fund and to consult with the VC II's Board of
Trustees (the Board) and VALIC regarding the Fund's
investment affairs, including economic, statistical and
investment matters related to Perkins' duties hereunder, and
will provide periodic reports as requested to VALIC relating
to the investment strategies it employs as well as Perkins'
duties hereunder.  Perkins and its personnel shall also
cooperate fully with counsel and auditors for, and the Chief
Compliance Officers of, Janus, VALIC, the Fund and the
Board.
                  (f)	In accordance with procedures
adopted by the Board, as amended from time to time, Perkins
will provide assistance to Janus and the Fund in the fair
valuation of Fund securities for security prices that are not
readily available.  Any valuation assistance provided is for
informational purposes only and is not a recommendation by
Perkins.  Perkins will use its reasonable efforts to provide,
based upon its own expertise, and to arrange with parties
independent of Perkins such as broker-dealers for the
provision of, valuation information or prices for securities for
which prices are deemed by VALIC or Fund's accounting
agent not to be readily available in the ordinary course of
business from an automated pricing service.  In addition,
Perkins will assist the Fund and its agents in determining
whether prices obtained for valuation purposes accurately
reflect market price information relating to the assets of the
Fund at such times as Janus or VALIC shall reasonably
request, including but not limited to, the hours after the close
of a securities market and prior to the daily determination of
the Fund's net asset value per share.  VALIC's designated
pricing agent, and not Janus or Perkins, is responsible for
providing valuation of the assets in the Fund.
                  (g)	Perkins at its expense will provide
Janus, VALIC and/or the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer
with such compliance reports as may be reasonably requested
from time to time.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Perkins
will promptly report to Janus and VALIC any material
violations of the federal securities laws (as defined in Rule
38a-1 of the 1940 Act) that it is aware of or of any material
violation of Perkin's compliance policies and procedures that
pertain to the Fund, as well as any change in portfolio
manager(s) of the Fund.
                  (h)	Perkins will (i) assist in the
preparation of disclosures regarding factors that have affected
the Fund's performance, including the relevant market
conditions and the investment strategies and techniques used
by Perkins, for each period as requested by Janus or VALIC;
and (ii) review draft reports to shareholders and other
documents provided or available to it and provide comments
on a timely basis.
                  (i)	Perkins shall immediately notify
Janus and VALIC in the event that Perkins or any of its
affiliates becomes aware:
i.	that it is subject to a
statutory disqualification
that prevents Perkins from
serving as an investment
manager pursuant to this
Sub-Sub-Advisory
Agreement; or
ii.	that it is the subject of an
administration proceeding
or enforcement action by
the Securities and
Exchange Commission
(the Commission) or
other regulatory authority.
                   (j)	Perkins shall use the same skill and
care in providing services to the Fund as it uses in providing
services to fiduciary accounts for which it has investment
responsibility.
                   (k)	Perkins is hereby prohibited from
consulting with any other sub-advisers of the Fund, other sub-
advisers to another portfolio of VC II, or other sub-advisers to
a portfolio under common control with the Fund concerning
transactions of the Fund in securities or other assets.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Perkins may consult with
Janus regarding transactions of the Fund in securities or other
assets, or as otherwise consistent with the terms of this Sub-
Sub-Advisory Agreement.
3.	Obligations of Janus.
                  (a)	No provision of this Agreement
shall relieve Janus of its duties or responsibilities under the
Sub-Advisory Agreement and Janus shall appropriately
oversee, monitor and evaluate Perkins performance of its"
"5645","duties and responsibilities under this Sub-Sub-Advisory"
"5646","Agreement."
"5647","                  (b)	Janus shall be responsible for the"

"5651","and the party with which the transaction will be consummated."
"5652","                   (c)	Janus shall be responsible for"
"5653","providing accurate and current information with respect to"
"5654","records maintained for the Fund."
"5655","                    (d)	Janus shall be responsible for"
"5656","ensuring that all of Janus' acts or omissions under this Sub-"
"5657","Sub-Advisory Agreement comply with all applicable federal"
"5658","and state laws."
"5659","            4.	Compensation.  Perkins shall be paid by"
"5660","Janus for its services under the Sub-Sub-Advisory Agreement"
"5661","with respect to the Fund a fee at an annual rate equal to (i) fifty"
"5662","percent (50%) of the advisory fees Janus receives from VALIC."
"5663","            5.	Expenses and Excluded Expenses.  Perkins"
"5664","shall pay all its own costs and expenses incurred in rendering"
"5665","the services required under this Sub-Sub-Advisory Agreement."
"5666","Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, it is expressly"
"5667","agreed that Perkins shall not be responsible to pay any"
"5668","expenses of Janus or the Fund, including but not limited to"
"5669","organizational, operational or business expenses of Janus or the"
"5670","Fund, such as, (a) brokerage commissions and other costs in"
"5671","connection with the purchase or sale of securities or other"
"5672","investment instruments with respect to the Fund; (b) custodian"
"5673","fees and expenses of the Fund; and (c) interest and taxes of the"
"5674","Fund."
"5675","            6.	Term of Agreement.   This Sub-Sub-"
"5676","Advisory Agreement shall become effective on the date hereof."
"5677","Unless sooner terminated as provided herein, this Sub-Sub-"
"5678","Advisory Agreement shall continue in effect for two years from"
"5679","its effective date.  Thereafter, this Sub-Sub-Advisory"
"5680","Agreement shall continue in effect, subject to the termination"
"5681","provisions and all other terms and conditions hereof, only so"
"5682","long as such continuance is approved at least annually by the"
"5683","vote of a majority of the VC II trustees who are not parties to"
"5684","this Sub-Sub-Advisory Agreement or interested persons of any"

"5686","of voting on such approval, and by a vote of a majority of the"
"5687","Board or a majority of the Fund's outstanding voting securities."
"5688","This Sub-Sub-Advisory Agreement shall automatically"
"5689","terminate in the event of its assignment as that term is defined"
"5690","in the 1940 Act or in the event of the termination of the Sub-"
"5691","Advisory Agreement.  The Sub-Sub-Advisory Agreement may"
"5692","be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty,"
"5693","by vote of the Board or by vote of a majority of the Fund's"
"5694","outstanding voting securities, or by Janus, on not more than 60"

"6123","and obligations hereunder to any affiliated person (as"
"6124","such term is defined in the 1940 Act) that is eligible"
"6125","to serve as an investment adviser to an investment"
"6126","company registered under the 1940 Act on such"
"6127","terms and conditions as it deems necessary or"
"6128","appropriate, provided that VALIC and the Board"
"6129","consent to any such delegation and to the terms and"
"6130","conditions thereof and such delegation is permitted"
"6131","by and in conformity with the 1940 Act. The SUB-"
"6132","ADVISER shall be liable to VALIC for any loss or"
"6133","damage arising out of, in connection  with or related"
"6134","to the actions or omissions to act of any delegee"
"6135","utilized hereunder. In determining liability, the"
"6136","limitation of liability set forth in Section 7 of this"
"6137","Agreement shall apply to the actions or omissions to"
"6138","act of a delegee."
"6139","VALIC acknowledges that the SUB-ADVISER shall,"
"6140","pursuant to a separate Sub-Sub-Advisory Agreement,"
"6141","delegate the day-to-day portfolio management of the"
"6142","Covered Fund to Perkins. The SUB-ADVISER shall"
"6143","notify VALIC of any material amendments to the"
"6144","Sub-Sub-Advisory Agreement."
"6145","The SUB-ADVISER makes no representation or"
"6146","warranty, express or implied, that any level of"
"6147","performance or investment results will be achieved"
"6148","by the Covered Fund (or portion thereof) or that the"
"6149","Covered Fund will perform comparably with any"
"6150","standard or index, including other clients of the SUB-"
"6151","ADVISER."
"6152","The SUB-ADVISER will assist the Covered Fund(s)"
"6153","and its agents in determining whether prices obtained"
"6154","for valuation purposes accurately reflect the prices on"
"6155","the SUB-ADVISER's portfolio records relating to the"
"6156","assets of the Covered Fund(s) for which the SUB-"
"6157","ADVISER has responsibility at such times as VALIC"
"6158","shall reasonably request; provided, however, that the"
"6159","parties acknowledge that the SUB-ADVISER is not"
"6160","the fund accounting agent for the Covered Fund(s)"
"6161","and is not responsible for pricing determinations or"
"6162","calculations and any information provided pursuant"
"6163","to this position by the SUB-ADVISER will be"
"6164","provided for information purposes only."
"6165","In performing the services described in paragraph (b)"
"6166","above, the SUB-ADVISER shall use its best efforts"
"6167","to obtain for the Covered Fund(s) the best execution"
"6168","of portfolio transactions determined by SUB-"
"6169","ADVISER's best execution policy. Subject to"
"6170","approval by the Board of appropriate policies and"
"6171","procedures that may be adopted by the Board and"
"6172","Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,"
"6173","as amended (the 1934 Act), the SUB-ADVISER"
"6174","may cause the Covered Fund(s) to pay to a broker a"
"6175","commission, for effecting a portfolio transaction, in"
"6176","excess of the commission another broker would have"
"6177","charged for effecting the same transaction, if the first"
"6178","broker provided brokerage and/or research products"
"6179","or services, including statistical data, to the SUB-"
"6180","ADVISER. The SUB-ADVISER shall not be deemed"
"6181","to have acted unlawfully, or to have breached any"
"6182","duty created by this Agreement, or otherwise, solely"
"6183","by reason of acting in accordance with such"
"6184","authorization. In accordance with Section II(a) of the"
"6185","1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder, and subject"
"6186","to any other applicable laws and regulations"
"6187","including Section 17(e) of the 1940 Act and Rule"
"6188","17e-l thereunder, the SUB-ADVISER may engage its"
"6189","affiliates, the VALIC and its affiliates or any other"
"6190","sub-adviser to VC II and its respective affiliates, as"
"6191","broker-dealers or futures commission merchants to"
"6192","effect Covered Fund transactions in securities and"
"6193","other investments for a Covered Fund."
"6194","Furthermore, on occasions when the SUB-ADVISER"
"6195","deems the purchase or sale of a security to be in the"
"6196","best interest of one or more of the Covered Fund(s)"
"6197","as well as other clients of the SUB-ADVISER, it may"
"6198","allocate such transactions in the manner it considers"
"6199","to be the most equitable and consistent with its"
"6200","fiduciary obligation to the Covered Fund(s) and to"
"6201","such other clients. The SUB-ADVISER shall not be"
"6202","deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to have breached"
"6203","any duty created by this Agreement, or otherwise,"
"6204","solely by reason of acting in accordance with such"
"6205","authorization."
"6206","The SUB-ADVISER may aggregate sales and"
"6207","purchase orders of securities held by the Covered"
"6208","Fund(s) with similar orders being made"
"6209","simultaneously for other accounts managed by the"
"6210","SUB-ADVISER or with accounts of the affiliates of"
"6211","the SUB-ADVISER, if in the SUB-ADVISER's"
"6212","reasonable judgment such aggregation is fair and"
"6213","reasonable and consistent with the SUB-ADVISER'S"
"6214","fiduciary obligations to the Covered Fund(s) and its"
"6215","other clients, considering factors such as the"
"6216","advantageous selling or purchase price, brokerage"
"6217","commission and other expenses. In accounting for"
"6218","such aggregated order price, commission and other"
"6219","expenses shall be averaged on a per bond or share"
"6220","basis daily. VALIC acknowledges that the"
"6221","determination of such economic benefit to the"
"6222","Covered Fund(s) by the SUB-ADVISER is subjective"
"6223","and represents the SUB-ADVISER's evaluation that"
"6224","the Covered Fund(s) is benefited by relatively better"
"6225","purchase or sales prices, lower commission expenses"
"6226","and beneficial timing of transactions or a"
"6227","combination of these and other factors."
"6228","VALIC authorizes and empowers the SUB-"
"6229","ADVISER to direct the Covered Fund's Custodian to"
"6230","open and maintain brokerage accounts for securities"
"6231","and other property, including financial and"
"6232","commodity futures and commodities and options"
"6233","thereon (all such accounts hereinafter called"
"6234","brokerage accounts) for and in the name of the"
"6235","Covered Fund(s) and to execute for the Covered"
"6236","Fund(s) as its agent and attorney-in-fact reasonable"
"6237","and customary customer agreements and other"
"6238","documentation in connection with such broker or"
"6239","brokers as the SUB-ADVISER shall select as"
"6240","provided above. With respect to brokerage accounts"
"6241","for financial and commodity futures and commodities"
"6242","and options thereon, the SUB-ADVISER shall select"
"6243","such brokers, as approved by VALIC, prior to the"
"6244","establishment of such brokerage account. The SUB-"
"6245","ADVISER may, using such of the securities and"
"6246","other property in the Covered Fund as the SUB-"
"6247","ADVISER deems necessary or desirable, direct the"
"6248","Covered Fund's Custodian to deposit for the Covered"
"6249","Fund original and maintenance brokerage and margin"
"6250","deposits and otherwise direct payments of cash, cash"
"6251","equivalents and securities and other property into"
"6252","such brokerage accounts and to such brokers as the"
"6253","SUB-ADVISER deems desirable or appropriate and"
"6254","as required by applicable law."
"6255","The SUB-ADVISER shall maintain records"
"6256","adequately demonstrating compliance with its"
"6257","obligations under this Agreement and report"
"6258","periodically to VALIC and the Board regarding the"
"6259","performance of its services under this Agreement."
"6260","The SUB-ADVISER will make available to VALIC"
"6261","and VC II promptly upon their reasonable written"
"6262","request all of the Covered Fund(s)'s investment"
"6263","records and ledgers to assist VALIC and VC II in"
"6264","compliance with respect to the Covered Fund(s)'s"
"6265","securities transactions as required by the 1940 Act"
"6266","and the Advisers Act, as well as other applicable"
"6267","laws. The SUB-ADVISER will furnish the Board"
"6268","with quarterly reports and such special reports as"
"6269","VALIC and the Board may reasonably request. The"
"6270","SUB-ADVISER will furnish to regulatory authorities"
"6271","any information or reports in connection with such"
"6272","services which may be requested in order to ascertain"
"6273","whether the operations of the Covered Fund(s) are"
"6274","being conducted in a manner consistent with"
"6275","applicable laws and regulations."
"6276","Should VALIC at any time make any definite"
"6277","determination as to any investment policy and notify"
"6278","the SUB-ADVISER in writing of such determination,"
"6279","the SUB-ADVISER shall be bound by such"
"6280","determination for the period, if any, specified in such"
"6281","notice or until similarly notified that such"
"6282","determination has been revoked, provided such"
"6283","determination will permit SUB-ADVISER to comply"
"6284","with the first paragraph of this Section."
"6285","The SUB-ADVISER will not hold money or"
"6286","investments on behalf of the Covered Fund(s). The"
"6287","money and investments will be held by the Custodian"
"6288","of VC II. The SUB-ADVISER will arrange for the"
"6289","transmission to the Custodian for the Covered"
"6290","Fund(s), on a daily basis, such confirmation, trade"
"6291","tickets and other documents as may be necessary to"
"6292","enable it to perform its administrative responsibilities"
"6293","with respect to the Covered Fund(s). The SUB-"
"6294","ADVISER further shall have the authority to instruct"
"6295","the custodian of the Covered Fund(s) (i) to pay cash"
"6296","for securities and other property delivered to the"
"6297","Custodian for the Covered Fund(s) (ii) to deliver"
"6298","securities and other property against payment for the"
"6299","Covered Fund(s), and (iii) to transfer assets and funds"
"6300","to such brokerage accounts as the SUB-ADVISER"
"6301","may designate, all consistent with the powers,"
"6302","authorities and limitations set forth herein. The SUB-"
"6303","ADVISER shall not have the authority to cause the"
"6304","Custodian to deliver securities and other property"
"6305","except as expressly provided for in this Agreement."
"6306","VALIC will vote proxies relating to securities held"
"6307","by the Covered Fund(s). VALIC will vote all such"
"6308","proxies in accordance with such proxy voting"
"6309","guidelines and procedures adopted by the Board of"
"6310","Trustees. VALIC may, on certain non-routine"
"6311","matters, consult with the SUB-ADVISER before"
"6312","voting proxies relating to securities held by the"
"6313","Covered Fund(s). VALIC will instruct the Custodian"
"6314","and other parties providing services to VC II"
"6315","promptly to forward to the proxy voting service"
"6316","copies of all proxies and shareholder communications"
"6317","relating to securities held by each Covered Fund(s)."
"6318","The SUB-ADVISER shall not be responsible for"
"6319","taking any action on behalf of the Covered Funds in"
"6320","connection with any claim or potential claim in any"
"6321","bankruptcy proceedings, class action securities"
"6322","litigation, or other litigation or proceeding affecting"
"6323","securities held at any time in the Covered Fund(s)"
"6324","including, without limitation, to file proofs of claim"
"6325","or other documents related to such proceedings (the"
"6326","Litigation) or to investigate, initiate, supervise, or"
"6327","monitor the Litigation involving the Covered Funds'"
"6328","assets."
"6329","The SUB-ADVISER shall for all purposes herein be"
"6330","deemed to be an independent contractor and shall,"
"6331","unless otherwise provided or authorized, have no"
"6332","authority to act or represent VALIC or VC II other"
"6333","than in furtherance of the SUB-ADVISER's duties"
"6334","and responsibilities as set forth in this Agreement."
"6335","Except as otherwise agreed, or as otherwise provided"
"6336","herein, the SUB-ADVISER shall bear the expense of"
"6337","discharging its responsibilities hereunder and VALIC"
"6338","shall pay, or arrange for others to pay, all VALIC's"
"6339","expenses, except that VALIC shall in all events pay"
"6340","the compensation described in Section 2 of the"
"6341","Agreement. VALIC and the SUB-ADVISER"
"6342","acknowledge that VC II will be ultimately"
"6343","responsible for all brokerage commissions, taxes,"
"6344","custodian fees and other transaction-related fees"
"6345","incurred on behalf of the Covered Fund(s)."
"6346","The SUB-ADVISER also represents and warrants"
"6347","that in furnishing services hereunder, the SUB-"
"6348","ADVISER will not consult with any other sub-"
"6349","adviser, other than Perkins, of the Covered Fund(s) or"
"6350","other series of VC II, to the extent any other sub-"
"6351","advisers are engaged by VALIC, or any other sub-"
"6352","advisers to other investment companies that are under"
"6353","common control with VC II, concerning transactions"
"6354","of the Covered Fund(s) in securities or other assets,"
"6355","other than for purposes of complying with the"
"6356","conditions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of rule 12d3-l"
"6357","under the 1940 Act."
"6358","2.	Confidentiality"
"6359","The SUB-ADVISER will not disclose or use any"
"6360","records or information obtained pursuant to this"
"6361","Agreement in any manner whatsoever except as"
"6362","expressly authorized in this Agreement or as"
"6363","reasonably required to execute transactions on behalf"
"6364","of the Covered Fund(s), and will keep confidential"
"6365","any non-public information obtained directly as a"
"6366","result of this service relationship, and disclose such"
"6367","non-public information only if VALIC or the VC II"
"6368","Board of Trustees has authorized in writing such"
"6369","disclosure, or if such information is or hereafter"
"6370","becomes ascertainable from public or published"
"6371","information or trade sources, or if such information is"
"6372","or hereafter otherwise is lawfully know by the SUB-"
"6373","ADVISER, or if such disclosure is expressly required"
"6374","or requested by applicable federal or state authorities"
"6375","(including the SUB-ADVISER'S regulatory"
"6376","examiners) or court of law of competent jurisdiction"
"6377","or to the extent such disclosure is reasonably required"
"6378","by auditors or attorneys of the SUB-ADVISER in"
"6379","connection with the performance of their professional"
"6380","services or as may otherwise be contemplated by this"
"6381","Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the SUB-"
"6382","ADVISER may disclose the total return earned by the"
"6383","Covered Fund(s) and may include such total return in"
"6384","the calculation of composite performance"
"6385","information."
"6386","VALIC will not disclose or use any records or"
"6387","information belonging to the SUB-ADVISER"
"6388","obtained pursuant to this Agreement in any manner"
"6389","whatsoever except as expressly authorized in this"
"6390","Agreement or as reasonably required in performance"
"6391","of its advisory services to the Covered Funds, and"
"6392","will keep confidential any information obtained"
"6393","pursuant to this service relationship, and disclose"
"6394","such information only if the SUB-ADVISER has"
"6395","authorized in writing such disclosure, or if such"
"6396","information is or hereafter becomes ascertainable"
"6397","from public or published information or trade"
"6398","sources, or if such information is expressly required"
"6399","or requested by applicable federal or state authorities"
"6400","(including VALIC's regulatory examiners) or court of"
"6401","law of competent jurisdiction or to the extent such"
"6402","disclosure is reasonably required by auditors or"
"6403","attorneys of VALIC in connection with the"
"6404","performance of their professional services or as may"
"6405","otherwise be contemplated by this Agreement."
"6406","3. 	Compensation of the SUB-ADVISER"
"6407","VALIC shall pay to the SUB-ADVISER, as"
"6408","compensation for the services rendered and expenses"
"6409","paid by the SUB-ADVISER, a monthly fee or fees"
"6410","based on the Covered Fund(s)'s average daily net"
"6411","asset value computed for each of the Covered"
"6412","Fund(s) including cash or cash equivalents as"
"6413","provided for herein and in the fee schedule attached"
"6414","hereto as Schedule A. Schedule A may be amended"
"6415","from time to time, provided that amendments are"
"6416","made in conformity with applicable laws and"
"6417","regulations and the Declaration and Bylaws. Any"
"6418","change in Schedule A pertaining to any new or"
"6419","existing Covered Fund(s) shall not be deemed to"
"6420","affect the interest of any other Covered Fund(s) and"
"6421","shall not require the approval of shareholders of any"
"6422","other Covered Fund(s)."
"6423","The average daily net asset value shall be determined"
"6424","by taking the mean average of all of the"
"6425","determinations of net asset value, made in the manner"
"6426","provided in the Declaration, as applicable, for each"
"6427","business day during a given calendar month. VALIC"
"6428","shall pay this fee for each calendar month as soon as"
"6429","practicable after the end of that month."
"6430","If the SUB-ADVISER serves for less than a whole"
"6431","month, the foregoing compensation shall be prorated."
"6432","The payment of advisory fees related to the services"
"6433","of the SUB-ADVISER under this Agreement shall be"
"6434","the sole responsibility of VALIC and shall not be the"
"6435","responsibility of VC II or the Covered Fund(s). Any"
"6436","reimbursement of management fees required by any"
"6437","expense limitation provision and any liability arising"
"6438","out of a violation of Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act"
"6439","shall be the sole responsibility of VALIC."
"6440","4.	Scope of the SUB-ADVISER's Activities"
"6441","VALIC understands that the SUB-ADVISER and its"
"6442","affiliates now act, will continue to act and may act in"
"6443","the future as investment adviser to fiduciary and"
"6444","other managed accounts and as investment adviser to"
"6445","other investment companies, and VALIC has no"
"6446","objection to the SUB-ADVISER so acting, provided"
"6447","that whenever the Covered Fund(s) and one or more"
"6448","other accounts or investment companies advised by"
"6449","the SUB-ADVISER have available funds for"
"6450","investment, investments suitable and appropriate for"
"6451","each will be allocated in accordance with a"
"6452","methodology believed to be equitable to each entity."
"6453","The SUB-ADVISER similarly agrees to allocate"
"6454","opportunities to sell securities on an equitable basis."
"6455","VALIC recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure"
"6456","may limit the size of the position that may be"
"6457","acquired or sold for the Covered Fund(s). In addition,"
"6458","VALIC understands that the persons employed by the"
"6459","SUB-ADVISER to assist in the performance of the"
"6460","SUB-ADVISER's duties hereunder will not devote"
"6461","their full time to such service and nothing contained"
"6462","herein shall be deemed to limit or restrict the right of"
"6463","the SUB-ADVISER or any affiliate of the SUB-"
"6464","ADVISER to engage in and devote time and attention"
"6465","to other business or to render services of whatever"
"6466","kind or nature. The SUB-ADVISER may provide"
"6467","advice to or take action with respect to other clients,"
"6468","which advice or action, including the timing and"
"6469","nature of such action, may differ from or be identical"
"6470","to advice given or action taken with respect to the"
"6471","Covered Fund."
"6472","Except as otherwise required by the 1940 Act, any of"
"6473","the shareholders, directors, officers and employees of"
"6474","VALIC may be a shareholder, director, officer or"
"6475","employee of, or be otherwise interested in, the"
"6476","SUB-ADVISER, and in any person controlling,"
"6477","controlled by or under common control with the"
"6478","SUB-ADVISER; and the SUB-ADVISER, and any"
"6479","person controlling, controlled by or under common"
"6480","control with the SUB-ADVISER, may have an"
"6481","interest in VALIC."
"6482","VALIC shall perform quarterly and annual tax"
"6483","compliance tests and promptly furnish reports of such"
"6484","tests to the SUB-ADVISER after each quarter end to"
"6485","ensure that the Covered Fund(s) is in compliance"
"6486","with Subchapter M of the Code and Section 817(h) of"
"6487","the Code. VALIC shall apprise the SUB-ADVISER"
"6488","promptly after each quarter end of any potential non-"
"6489","compliance with the diversification requirements in"
"6490","such Code provisions. If so advised, the SUB-"
"6491","ADVISER shall take prompt action so that the"
"6492","Covered Fund(s) complies with such Code"
"6493","diversification provisions, as directed by VALIC."
"6494","5.	Representations of the SUB-ADVISER and"
"6495","VALIC"
"6496","The SUB-ADVISER represents, warrants, and agrees"

"6669","Covered Fund, which records are not also maintained"
"6670","by or otherwise available to the SUB-ADVISER"
"6671","upon reasonable request. VALIC shall indemnify the"
"6672","Indemnified Parties from any liability arising from"
"6673","the conduct of VALIC and any other sub-adviser"

"6682","investment adviser separate from the SUB-ADVISER"

"6698","preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2"
"6699","under the 1940 Act the records required to be"
"6700","maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act. The"
