"506","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"507","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"508","Putnam New York Tax Exempt Income Fund:"
"509","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"510","of Putnam New York Tax Exempt Income Fund (the Fund) as of and"
"511","for the year ended November 30, 2014, in accordance with the"
"512","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"513","(United States), we considered the Funds internal control over"
"514","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"515","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"516","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"517","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form NSAR, but"
"518","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"519","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"520","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"521","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"522","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"523","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"524","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"525","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"526","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"527","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"528","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"529","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"530","A companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"531","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"532","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"533","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"534","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"535","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"536","financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"537","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"538","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"539","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"540","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"541","or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material"
"542","effect on the financial statements."
"543","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"544","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"545","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"546","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"547","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"548","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"549","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"550","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"551","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"552","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"553","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"554","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"555","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"556","material misstatement of a funds annual or interim financial"
"557","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"558","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"559","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"560","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"561","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"562","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"563","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"564","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"565","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"566","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"567","November 30, 2014."
"568","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"569","management and the Board of Trustees of Putnam New York Tax"
"570","Exempt Income Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"571","and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"572","than these specified parties."

"694","      1.1  Agreement and Declaration of Trust.  These Bylaws"
"695","shall be subject to the Agreement and Declaration of Trust, as"
"696","from time to time in effect (the Declaration of Trust), of the"
"697","Massachusetts business trust established by the Declaration of"
"698","Trust (the Trust).  Capitalized terms used but not defined in"
"699","these Bylaws have the meanings given to them in the Declaration"
"700","of Trust."
"701","      1.2  Principal Office of the Trust.  The principal office"
"702","of the Trust shall be located in Boston, Massachusetts.  The"

"705","time determine."
"706","ARTICLE 2"
"707","Meetings of Trustees"
"708","      2.1  Regular Meetings.  Regular meetings of the Trustees"
"709","may be held without call or notice at such places and at such"
"710","times as the Trustees may from time to time determine, provided"
"711","that notice of the first regular meeting following any such"
"712","determination shall be given to absent Trustees."
"713","      2.2  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Trustees"
"714","may be held at any time and at any place designated in the call"
"715","of the meeting when called by the Chair of the Trustees, the"
"716","President, the Executive Vice President or the Treasurer or by"
"717","two or more Trustees, sufficient notice thereof being given to"
"718","each Trustee by the Clerk or an Assistant Clerk or by the"
"719","officer or the Trustees calling the meeting."
"720","      2.3  Notice of Special Meetings.  It shall be sufficient"
"721","notice to a Trustee of a special meeting: (a) to send notice (i)"
"722","by mail at least forty eight hours before the meeting, (ii) by"
"723","courier at least forty eight hours before the meeting, (iii) by"
"724","electronic mail (email), facsimile or other electronic means at"
"725","least twentyfour hours before the meeting, in each case,"
"726","addressed to the Trustee at his or her usual or last known"
"727","business or residence address (or email address, facsimile"
"728","number or other appropriate address); or (b) to give notice to"
"729","him or her in person or by telephone at least twentyfour hours"
"730","before the meeting.  Notice of a special meeting need not be"
"731","given to any Trustee if a written waiver of notice, executed by"
"732","him or her before or after the meeting, is filed with the"
"733","records of the meeting, or to any Trustee who attends the"
"734","meeting without protesting before or at its commencement the"
"735","lack of notice to him or her.  Any written waiver of notice may"
"736","be provided and delivered to the Trust by mail, courier, email,"
"737","facsimile or other electronic means. Neither notice of a meeting"
"738","nor a waiver of a notice need specify the purposes of the"
"739","meeting.  All notices shall be deemed to be given when sent."
"740","      2.4  Quorum.  At any meeting of the Trustees a majority of"
"741","the Trustees then in office shall constitute a quorum.  Once a"
"742","quorum has been validly established for a meeting, it cannot be"
"743","broken by Trustees withdrawing from the meeting.  Any meeting"
"744","may be adjourned from time to time by a majority of the votes"

"746","the meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice."
"747","      2.5  Telephone Meeting; Action Without a Meeting.  Except"
"748","as otherwise provided in the Declaration of Trust and these"
"749","Bylaws, any action to be taken by the Trustees may be taken by a"
"750","majority of the Trustees present at the meeting of the Trustees"
"751","(a quorum being present), including any meeting held by means of"
"752","a conference telephone or other communications equipment by"
"753","means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear"
"754","each other at the same time and participation by such means"
"755","shall constitute presence in person at a meeting. Any action to"
"756","be taken by the Trustees may also be taken without a meeting if"
"757","one or more written consents thereto are signed by a majority of"
"758","the Trustees.  Any written consent may be given by mail,"
"759","courier, email, facsimile or other electronic means.  Copies of"
"760","such written consents shall be filed with the minutes of the"
"761","proceedings of the Trustees.  Such consents shall be treated for"
"762","all purposes as a vote taken at a meeting of the Trustees.  If"
"763","in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Trust"
"764","and these Bylaws any action is taken by the Trustees by written"
