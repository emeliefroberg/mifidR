"525","LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"526","Since February 2004,"
"527","Federated and related"
"528","entities (collectively, Federated)"
"529"," have been named as"
"530","defendants in several lawsuits"
"531","that are now pending in the"
"532","United States District Court"
"533","for the Western"
"534","District of Pennsylvania. These"
"535","lawsuits have been consolidated"
"536","into a single action alleging"
"537","excessive"
"538","advisory fees involving one of"
"539","the Federated-sponsored mutual"
"540","funds (Funds)."
"541","       Federated and its counsel"
"542","have been defending this litigation."
"543","Additional lawsuits based upon"
"544","similar allegations may be filed"
"545","in the future. The potential impact"
"546"," of these lawsuits, all of which seek"
"547","monetary damages, attorneys' fees"
"548","and expenses, and future potential"
"549","similar suits is uncertain. Although"
"550","we do not believe that these lawsuits"
"551","will have a material adverse effect"
"552","on the Funds, there can be no"
"553","assurance that these suits, ongoing"
"554","adverse publicity and/or other developments"
"555","resulting from the"
"556","allegations in these matters will"
"557","not result in increased redemptions,"
"558","or reduced sales, of shares of the"
"559","Funds or other adverse consequences"

"568","Report of Independent Registered"
"569","Public Accounting Firm"
"570","To the Shareholders and Board"
"571","of Trustees of"
"572","Federated U.S. Government"
"573","Securities Fund: 1-3 Years:"
"574","In planning and performing"
"575","our audit of the financial"
"576"," statements of Federated U.S."
"577","Government Securities Fund: 1-3 Years"
"578","(the Fund) as of and for the year"
"579"," ended"
"580","February 28, 2011, in accordance"
"581","with the standards of the Public"
"582"," Company Accounting"
"583","Oversight Board (United States),"
"584","we considered the Fund's internal"
"585"," control over financial"
"586","reporting, including controls"
"587","over safeguarding securities,"
"588","as a basis for designing our"
"589","auditing procedures for the"
"590"," purpose of expressing our"
"591","opinion on the financial"
"592","statements"
"593","and to comply with the"
"594","requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"595","but not for the purpose of"
"596","expressing an opinion on the"
"597","effectiveness of the Fund's"
"598","internal control over financial"
"599","reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"600","express no such opinion."
"601","The management of the Fund is"
"602"," responsible for establishing"
"603"," and maintaining effective"
"604","internal control over financial"
"605","reporting. In fulfilling this"
"606","responsibility, estimates and"
"607","judgments by management are"
"608","required to assess the expected"
"609"," benefits and related costs"
"610","of controls. A company's"
"611","internal control over financial"
"612","reporting is a process designed to"
"613","provide reasonable assurance"
"614"," regarding the reliability of"
"615"," financial reporting and the"
"616","preparation of financial"
"617","statements for external purposes"
"618","in accordance with generally"
"619","accepted accounting principles."
"620","A company's internal control"
"621"," over financial reporting"
"622","includes those policies and"
"623","procedures that (1) pertain"
"624","to the maintenance of records"
"625"," that,"
"626","in reasonable detail,"
"627","accurately and fairly reflect"
"628","the"
"629","transactions and dispositions of"
"630","the"
"631","assets of the company; (2)"
"632","provide reasonable assurance"
"633","that transactions are recorded as"
"634","necessary to permit preparation"
"635","of financial statements in accordance"
"636","with generally"
"637","accepted accounting principles,"
"638","and that receipts and expenditures"
"639","of the company are"
"640","being made only in accordance with"
"641","authorizations of management and"
"642"," directors of the"
"643","company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"644","assurance regarding prevention or"
"645","timely detection"
"646","of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"647","or disposition of a company's"
"648","assets that could have a"
"649","material effect on the financial"
"650","statements."
"651","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"652","internal control over financial"
"653"," reporting"
"654","may not"
"655","prevent or detect misstatements."
"656"," Also, projections of any evaluation"
"657","of effectiveness to"
"658","future periods are subject to the"
"659","risk that controls may become"
"660","inadequate because of"
"661","changes in conditions, or that"
"662","the"
"663","degree of compliance with the"
"664","policies or procedures"
"665","may deteriorate."
"666","A deficiency in internal control"
"667","over financial reporting exists"
"668","when the design or"
"669","operation of a control does not"
"670","allow management or employees, in"
"671","the normal course of"
"672","performing their assigned functions,"
"673","to prevent or detect misstatements"
"674","on a timely basis."
"675","A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"676","or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"677","internal control"
"678","over financial reporting, such that"
"679","there is a reasonable possibility"
"680","that a material"
"681","misstatement of the company's annual"
"682","or interim financial statements will"
"683","not be"
"684","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"685","Our consideration of the Fund's"
"686","internal control over financial"
"687","reporting was for the"
"688","limited purpose described in the"
"689","first paragraph and would not"
"690","necessarily disclose all"
"691","deficiencies in internal control"
"692","that might be material weaknesses"
"693","under standards"
"694","established by the Public Company"
"695","Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"696","States)."
"697","However, we noted no deficiencies"
"698","in the Fund's internal control"
"699","over financial reporting"
"700","and its operation, including"
"701","controls over safeguarding"
"702","securities that we consider to be a"
"703","material weakness as defined"
"704","above as of February 28, 2011."
"705","This report is intended solely"
"706","for the information and use of"
"707","management and the Board"
"708","of Trustees of the Fund and the"
"709","Securities and Exchange Commission"
"710"," and is not intended"
"711","to be, and should not be, used by"
"712","anyone other than these specified parties."
