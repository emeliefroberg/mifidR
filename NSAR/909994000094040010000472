"2393","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2394","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"2395","Old Westbury Funds, Inc."
"2396","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Old"
"2397","Westbury Funds, Inc. (comprising, respectively, U.S. Large Cap Fund,"
"2398","Non-U.S. Large Cap Fund, Global Small & Mid Cap Fund, Global"
"2399","Opportunities Fund, Real Return Fund (consolidated), Fixed Income Fund,"
"2400","and Municipal Bond Fund) (the Company) as of and for the year ended"
"2401","October 31, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"2402","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Company's"
"2403","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"2404","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"2405","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"2406","(consolidated) financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"2407","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"2408","effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial"
"2409","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2410","The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and"
"2411","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"2412","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"2413","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"2414","controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"2415","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"2416","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"2417","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2418","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"2419","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2420","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2421","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"2422","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2423","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"2424","with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"2425","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"2426","authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)"
"2427","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"2428","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"2429","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2430","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2431","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"2432","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"2433","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2434","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"2435","procedures may deteriorate."
"2436","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"2437","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"2438","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"2439","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"2440","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2441","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"2442","possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or"
"2443","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"2444","timely basis."
"2445","Our consideration of the Company's internal control over financial"
"2446","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"2447","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"2448","that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"2449","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we"
"2450","noted no deficiencies in the Company's internal control over financial"
"2451","reporting and its operation, including controls for safeguarding"
"2452","securities that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above"
"2453","as of October 31, 2010."
"2454","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"2455","and the Board of Directors of Old Westbury Funds, Inc. and the"
"2456","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should"
"2457","not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"2545","conditions hereinafter set forth;"
"2546","    NOW, THEREFORE, the Fund and Adviser agree as follows:"
"2547","    Section 1. The Fund. The Fund is engaged in the business of"

"2549","and in accordance with the limitations specified in its Articles"
"2550","of Incorporation, By-Laws and Registration Statement filed with"

"2552","the 1940 Act and the Securities Act of 1933, including the"
"2553","Prospectuses forming a part thereof and Statements of Additional"
"2554","Information relating to the Portfolios contained therein, and as"
"2555","may be supplemented from time to time, all in such manner and to"
"2556","such extent as may from time to time be authorized by the Fund's"
"2557","Board of Directors (the Board). The Board is authorized to"
"2558","issue any unissued shares in any number of additional classes or"
"2559","series. The Fund has delivered copies of the documents listed in"
"2560","this Section to the Adviser and will from time to time furnish"
"2561","the Adviser with any amendments thereof."
"2562","    Section 2. Appointment. The Fund hereby appoints the Adviser,"
"2563","subject to the direction and control of the Board, to manage the"
"2564","investment and reinvestment of the assets in the Portfolios and,"
"2565","without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to provide the"
"2566","services specified in Section 3 hereof."
"2567","    Section 3. Duties of the Adviser."
"2568","    (a) The Adviser shall provide investment advisory services,"
"2569","including but not limited to, making decisions with respect to"
"2570","all purchases and sales of securities and other investment"
"2571","assets for the Portfolios. Among other things, the Adviser shall"
"2572","make all decisions with respect to the Portfolios' investments"
"2573","in various securities or other assets, in investment styles and,"
"2574","if applicable, in other investment companies or pooled vehicles"
"2575","in which the Portfolios may invest. To carry out the services"
"2576","hereunder, the Adviser is hereby authorized, as agent and"
"2577","attorney-in-fact for the Fund, for the account of, at the risk"
"2578","of and in the name of the Portfolios, to place orders and issue"
"2579","instructions with respect to transactions of the Portfolios. In"
"2580","all purchases, sales and other transactions for the Portfolios,"
"2581","the Adviser is authorized to exercise full discretion and act"
"2582","for the Fund in the same manner and with the same force and"
"2583","effect as the Fund might or could do with respect to such"
"2584","purchases, sales or other transactions, as well as with respect"
"2585","to all other things necessary or incidental to the furtherance"
"2586","or performance of its duties and obligations under this"
"2587","Agreement including, but not limited to, executing on behalf of"
"2588","the Portfolios and the Fund such agreements and other"
"2589","documentation in connection with such purchases, sales or other"
"2590","transactions.  The Fund acknowledges that the Fund and the"
"2591","Portfolios will be bound by such trading accounts established,"
"2592","and agreements and other documents executed."
"2593","    (b) The Adviser will report to the Board at each regular"
"2594","meeting thereof all material changes in the Portfolios since the"
"2595","prior report, and will also keep the Board informed of important"
"2596","developments affecting the Fund, the Portfolios and the Adviser,"
"2597","and on its own initiative will furnish the Board from time to"
"2598","time with such information as the Adviser may believe"
"2599","appropriate, whether concerning the individual companies whose"
"2600","securities are held by the Portfolios, the industries in which"
"2601","they engage, or the economic, social or political conditions"
"2602","prevailing in each country in which the Portfolios maintain"
"2603","investments. The Adviser will also furnish the Board with such"
"2604","statistical and analytical information with respect to"
"2605","securities in the Portfolios as the Adviser may believe"
"2606","appropriate or as the Board reasonably may request."
"2607","    (c) The Adviser will from time to time employ or associate"
"2608","with such persons as the Adviser believes to be appropriate or"
"2609","necessary to assist in the execution of the Adviser's duties"
"2610","hereunder; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided"
"2611","herein, the employment of or sub-contracting with any such"
"2612","person shall not relieve the Adviser of its responsibilities or"
"2613","liabilities hereunder; and provided further that the Adviser"
"2614","shall not have the authority to subcontract advisory"
"2615","responsibilities without the consent of the Fund. The cost of"
"2616","performance of such duties shall be borne and paid by the"
"2617","Adviser. No obligation may be imposed on the Fund in any such"
"2618","respect."
"2619","    (d) The Adviser shall pay its own expenses in connection with"
"2620","the services to be provided by it pursuant to this Agreement."
"2621","    Section 4.  Delegation of Responsibilities. The Adviser may"
"2622","carry out any of its obligations under this Agreement by"
"2623","employing, subject to supervision by the Adviser, one or more"
"2624","sub-advisers who are registered as investment advisers pursuant"
"2625","to the Advisers Act (each, a Sub-Adviser). Each Sub-Adviser's"
"2626","employment will be evidenced by a separate written agreement"
"2627","approved by the Board and, if required under the 1940 Act, by"
"2628","the shareholders of the Portfolios (unless the Commission or its"
"2629","staff has given authorization or issued an interpretation or no-"
"2630","action letter dispensing with the requirement of shareholder"
"2631","approval). The Adviser shall not be liable hereunder for any act"
"2632","or omission of any Sub-Adviser, except for failure to exercise"
"2633","good faith in the employment of the Sub-Adviser and for failure"
"2634","to exercise appropriate supervision of such Sub-Adviser, and as"
"2635","may otherwise be agreed in writing. The Adviser shall be solely"
"2636","responsible for compensating any Sub-Adviser for services"
"2637","rendered under any sub-advisory agreement. The Adviser may, from"
"2638","time to time and at any time, terminate any Sub-Adviser and"
"2639","recommend to the Board the appointment of another Sub-Adviser or"
"2640","reassume the responsibilities assigned to any Sub-Adviser with"
"2641","respect to the Portfolios without obtaining the approval of the"
"2642","shareholders of the Portfolios unless expressly required by the"
"2643","federal securities laws."
"2644","    Section 5. Compliance with Applicable Requirements. In"
"2645","carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, the Adviser"
"2646","shall at all times comply with:"
"2647","    (a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules"
"2648","and regulations adopted thereunder;"
"2649","    (b) the provisions of the Registration Statement of the Fund,"
"2650","as it may be amended from time to time, under the 1940 Act;"
"2651","    (c) the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation of the"
"2652","Fund, as they may be amended from time to time;"
"2653","    (d) the provisions of the By-Laws of the Fund, as they may be"
"2654","amended from time to time, or resolutions of the Board that may"
"2655","be adopted from time to time;"
"2656","    (e) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"
"2657","amended, applicable to the Fund or the Portfolios; and"
"2658","    (f) any other applicable provisions of state or federal law."
"2659","    Section 6. Broker-Dealer Relationships. In connection with"
"2660","the performance of its services hereunder, the Adviser is"
"2661","responsible for opening accounts with brokers,  dealers and"
"2662","futures commission merchants (broker-dealers), selecting"
"2663","brokers, dealers and futures commission merchants to effect all"
"2664","transactions for the Portfolios, placing all necessary orders"
"2665","with broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated broker-"
"2666","dealers), and negotiating commissions, if applicable. To the"
"2667","extent consistent with applicable law and the investment"
"2668","objectives of the Portfolios, the Adviser may purchase or sell"
"2669","orders for the Portfolios with contemporaneous purchase or sell"
"2670","orders of other clients of the Adviser and its affiliates. In"
"2671","such event, allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as"
"2672","well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made"
"2673","by the Adviser in the manner the Adviser considers to be the"
"2674","most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to"
"2675","the Portfolios and to other clients. The Adviser will seek to"
"2676","obtain best execution of transactions for the Portfolios at"
"2677","prices which are advantageous to the Portfolios and at"
"2678","commission rates that are reasonable in relation to the benefits"
"2679","received. To the extent consistent with Section 28(e) of the"
"2680","Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Adviser may pay a broker-"
"2681","dealer an amount of commission for effecting a securities"
"2682","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another"
"2683","broker-dealer would have charged for effecting such transaction"
"2684","if the Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of"
"2685","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"2686","brokerage and research products and/or services provided by such"
"2687","broker-dealer.  This determination, with respect to brokerage"
"2688","and research products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of"
"2689","either that particular transaction or the overall"
"2690","responsibilities which the Adviser has with respect to the"
"2691","Portfolio, as well as to other accounts over which the Adviser"
"2692","exercises investment discretion. Not all such services or"
"2693","products need be used by the Adviser in managing the Portfolios."
"2694","    Section 7. Expenses of the Portfolios. All of the ordinary"
"2695","business expenses incurred in the operations of the Portfolios"
"2696","and the offering of their shares shall be borne by the"
"2697","Portfolios unless specifically provided otherwise in this"
"2698","Agreement or another written agreement between the Adviser and"
"2699","the Fund. These expenses borne by the Portfolios include, but"
"2700","are not limited to, brokerage commissions, taxes, legal,"
"2701","auditing and governmental fees, expenses relating to trustees"
"2702","and shareholder meetings, the cost of preparing and distributing"
"2703","reports and notices to shareholders, the fees and other expenses"
"2704","incurred by the Portfolios and the cost of printing copies of"
"2705","the Prospectuses and Statements of Additional Information"
"2706","distributed to the Portfolios' shareholders."
"2707","    Section 8. Compensation. As compensation for the advisory"
"2708","services provided under this Agreement, the Fund shall pay the"
"2709","Adviser fees at the annual rates indicated on Schedule A hereto,"
"2710","as such Schedule A may be amended or supplemented from time to"
"2711","time. The Adviser's fee shall be accrued for each calendar day"
"2712","and the sum of the daily fee accruals shall be paid monthly in"
"2713","arrears to the Adviser."
"2714","    Section 9. Standard of Care. The Fund shall expect of the"
"2715","Adviser, and the Adviser will give the Fund the benefit of, the"
"2716","Adviser's best judgment and efforts in rendering its services to"
"2717","the Fund. As an inducement to the Adviser's undertaking these"
"2718","services at the compensation level specified, the Adviser shall"
"2719","not be liable hereunder for any error of judgment or mistake of"
"2720","law or for any loss suffered by the Fund in connection with the"
"2721","performance of this Agreement, except a loss resulting from a"
"2722","breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of"
"2723","compensation for services or a loss resulting from willful"
"2724","misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of the"
"2725","Adviser, or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents,"
"2726","in the performance of its duties or from reckless disregard by"
"2727","it of its obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"2728","    Section 10. Non-Exclusivity. The services of the Adviser to"
"2729","the Portfolios are not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the"
"2730","Adviser shall be free to render investment advisory or other"
"2731","services to others (including other investment companies) and to"
"2732","engage in other activities. It is understood and agreed that"
"2733","officers or directors of the Adviser may serve as officers or"
"2734","directors of the Fund, and that officers or directors of the"
"2735","Fund may serve as officers or directors of the Adviser, to the"
"2736","extent that such services may be permitted by law, and that the"
"2737","officers and directors of the Adviser are not prohibited from"
"2738","engaging in any other business activity or from rendering"
"2739","services to any other person, or from serving as partners,"
"2740","officers, directors or trustees of any other firm or trust,"
"2741","including other investment advisory companies."
"2742","    Section 11. Books and Records. The Adviser shall, with"
"2743","respect to orders the Adviser places for the purchase and sale"
"2744","of portfolio securities of the Portfolios, maintain or arrange"
"2745","for the maintenance of the documents and records required"
"2746","pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act as well as such"
"2747","records as the Fund's Administrator reasonably requests to be"
"2748","maintained, including, but not limited to, trade tickets and"
"2749","confirmations for portfolio trades. All such records shall be"
"2750","maintained in a form acceptable to the Fund and in compliance"
"2751","with the provisions of Rule 31a-1 or any successor rule. All"
"2752","such records will be the property of the Fund and will be"
"2753","available for inspection and use by the Fund. The Adviser will"
"2754","promptly notify the Fund's Administrator if it experiences any"
"2755","difficulty in maintaining the records in an accurate and"
"2756","complete manner."
"2757","    Section 12. Term of the Agreement. This Agreement shall"
"2758","become effective with respect to each of the respective"
"2759","Portfolios on such date as it is approved in accordance with the"
"2760","requirements of the 1940 Act, and shall initially continue for"
"2761","one year, and thereafter continue from year to year, provided"
