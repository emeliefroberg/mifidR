"645","SHAREHOLDER SERVICES PLAN"
"646","Cohen & Steers Dividend Value Fund, Inc,"
"647","The above-captioned investment company (the Fund) adopts this"
"648","Shareholder Services Plan (the Plan) pursuant to which the Fund"
"649","pays Cohen & Steers Securities, LLC, the Fund's distributor"
"650","(the Distributor), fees as set forth on Exhibit A hereto and as may"
"651","be modified from time to time for shareholder account service and"
"652","maintenance (Services).  The Distributor may enter into agreements"
"653","with certain qualified financial institutions, including securities"
"654","dealers and other industry professionals (collectively,"
"655","Service Agents), to perform Services, and the Distributor is"
"656","responsible for payment to the Service Agents. Services may vary by"
"657","Class and based on the Services offered by Service Agents."
"658","The material aspects of the Plan are as follows:"
"659","1. The Distributor shall determine the amounts to be paid to Service Agents"
"660","and the basis on which such payments will be made.  Payments to a Service"
"661","Agent are subject to compliance by the Service Agent with the terms of any"
"662","related Plan agreement between the Service Agent and the Distributor or the"
"663","Fund."
"664","2. For the purpose of determining the fees payable under the Plan, the value"
"665","of the Fund's net assets attributable to each Class shall be computed in the"
"666","manner specified in the Fund's charter documents and registration statement"
"667","for the computation of net asset value."
"668","3. The Fund's Board of Directors (the Board) shall be provided, at least"
"669","quarterly, with a written report of all amounts expended pursuant to the"
"670","Plan. The report shall state the purpose for which the amounts were expended."
"671","4. The Plan has been approved by a majority of the Fund Board members,"
"672"," including  a majority of the Board members who are not interested persons"
"673"," (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund (Independent Directors) and have"
"674"," no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of the Plan or"
"675"," in any agreements related to the Plan (Qualified Directors), pursuant to"
"676"," a vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on"
"677"," the approval of the Plan."
"678"," In voting to approve the implementation of the Plan, the Board has"
"679"," concluded, in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment and in"
"680"," light of applicable fiduciary duties, that there is a reasonable likelihood"
"681"," that the Plan will benefit the Fund and shareholders of each Class."
"682","5. As to each Class, the Plan shall continue for a period of no more than"
"683"," one year, unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, and"
"684"," thereafter shall continue automatically for succesive annual periods,"
"685"," provided such continuance is approved at least annualy in the manner"
"686"," provided in paragraph 4 hereof."
"687","6. As to each Class, the Plan may be amended at any time by the Board,"
"688"," provided that any material amendments of the terms of the Plan shall"
"689"," become  effective only upon approval as provided in paragraph 4 hereof."
"690","7. As to each Class, the Plan is terminable without penalty at any time by"
"691"," vote of a majority of the Qualified Directors."
"692","8. While the Plan is in effect, the selection and nomination of the"
"693"," Independent Directors shall be committed to the discretion of the"
"694"," Independent Directors then in office."
"695","9. The provisions of this Plan are severable for each Class and if"
"696"," provisions of the Plan applicable to a particular Class are terminated,"
"697"," the remainder of the Plan provisions applicable to the other remaining"
"698"," Classes shall not be invalidated thereby and shall be given full force"

"716","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"717","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders"
"718","of Cohen & Steers Dividend Value Fund, Inc."
"719","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Cohen &"
"720"," Steers Dividend Value Fund, Inc. (the Fund) as of and for the year ended"
"721"," February 29, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"722","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"723"," control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"724","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"725","of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"726","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"727","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"728","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"729","internal control over financial reporting."
"730","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"731","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"732","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"733","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal"
"734","controlover financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"735","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"736","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"737","generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over"
"738","financial reportingincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"739","to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"740","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"741","(2) provide reasonable"
"742"," assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"743","of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"744","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made"
"745","only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"746"," fund; and"
"747","(3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"748","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could"
"749","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"750","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"751","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"752","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"753","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"

"756","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"757","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"758","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"759","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"760"," or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"761","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"762","misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"763"," be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"764","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"765","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"766","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"767","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"768","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"769","we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"770","reporting and its operation,including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"771","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of"
"772","February 29, 2012."
