"525","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"526","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"527","Federated Income Trust:"
"528","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"529","financial statements of Federated Income Trust (the"
"530","Fund) as of and for the year ended January 31, 2010,"
"531","in accordance with the standards of the"
"532","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"533","we considered the Fund's internal"
"534","control over financial reporting, including controls"
"535","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"536","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"537","expressing our opinion on the financial"
"538","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"539","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"540","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"541","Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"542","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"543","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"544","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"545","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"546","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"547","management are required to assess the expected"
"548","benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"549","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"550","is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"551","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"552","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"553","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"554","generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"555","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"556","includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"557","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"558","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"559","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"560","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"561","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"562","preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"563","with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"564","that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"565","are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"566","of management and trustees of the"
"567","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"568","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"569","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"570","company's assets that could have a material"
"571","effect on the financial statements."
"572","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"573","over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"574","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"575","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"576","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"577","because of changes in conditions, or that"
"578","the degree of compliance with the policies"
"579","or procedures may deteriorate."
"580","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"581","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"582","control does not allow management or employees,"
"583","in the normal course of performing their"
"584","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"585","on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"586","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"587","internal control over financial reporting, such that"
"588","there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"589","misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"590","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"591","detected on a timely basis."
"592","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control"
"593","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"594","purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"595","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"596","internal control that might be material weaknesses"
"597","under standards established by the Public"
"598","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"599","However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"600","Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"601","and its operation, including controls over"
"602","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"603","material weakness as defined above as of January"
"604","31, 2010."
"605","This report is intended solely for the information"
"606","and use of management and the Board of"
"607","Trustees of the Fund and the Securities and"
"608","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"609","should not be used by anyone other than"
"610","these specified parties."

"621","LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"622","Since October 2003, Federated and related"
"623","entities (collectively, Federated), and"
"624","various Federated funds (Funds), have been named"
"625","as defendants in several class action lawsuits"
"626","now pending in the United States District Court"
"627","for the District of Maryland. The lawsuits"
"628","were purportedly filed on behalf of people who"
"629","purchased, owned and/or redeemed shares of"
"630","Federated-sponsored mutual funds during"
"631","specified periods beginning November 1, 1998."
"632","The suits are generally similar in alleging that"
"633","Federated engaged in illegal and"
"634","improper trading practices including market timing"
"635","and late trading in concert with certain institutional"
"636","traders, which allegedly caused"
"637","financial injury to the mutual fund shareholders."
"638","These lawsuits began to be filed shortly after"
"639","Federated's first public announcement"
"640","that it had received requests for information on"
"641","shareholder trading activities in the Funds"
"642","from the SEC, the Office of the New York"
"643","State Attorney General (NYAG), and other authorities."
"644","In that regard, on November 28, 2005,"
"645","Federated announced that it had"
"646","reached final settlements with the SEC and the"
"647","NYAG with respect to those matters. Specifically,"
"648","the SEC and NYAG settled"
"649","proceedings against three Federated subsidiaries"
"650","involving undisclosed market timing arrangements"
"651","and late trading. The SEC made"
"652","findings: that Federated Investment Management"
"653","Company (FIMC), an SEC-registered investment"
"654","adviser to various Funds, and"
"655","Federated Securities Corp., an SEC-registered"
"656","broker-dealer and distributor for the Funds,"
"657","violated provisions of the Investment Advisers"
"658","Act and Investment Company Act by approving, but"
"659","not disclosing, three market timing arrangements,"
"660","or the associated conflict of"
"661","interest between FIMC and the funds involved in the"
"662","arrangements, either to other fund shareholders"
"663","or to the funds' board; and that"
"664","Federated Shareholder Services Company, formerly"
"665","an SEC-registered transfer agent, failed to prevent"
"666","a customer and a Federated"
"667","employee from late trading in violation of provisions"
"668","of the Investment Company Act. The NYAG found"
"669","that such conduct violated"
"670","provisions of New York State law. Federated"
"671","entered into the settlements without admitting or"
"672","denying the regulators' findings. As"
"673","Federated previously reported in 2004, it has"
"674","already paid approximately $8.0 million to certain"
"675","funds as determined by an independent"
"676","consultant. As part of these settlements, Federated"
"677","agreed to pay disgorgement and a civil money penalty"
"678","in the aggregate amount of"
"679","an additional $72 million and, among other things,"
"680","agreed that it would not serve as investment adviser"
"681","to any registered investment"
"682","company unless (i) at least 75% of the fund's directors"
"683","are independent of Federated, (ii) the"
"684","chairman of each such fund is"
"685","independent of Federated, (iii) no action may be"
"686","taken by the fund's board or any committee thereof"
"687","unless approved by a majority of"
"688","the independent trustees of the fund or committee,"
"689","respectively, and (iv) the fund appoints"
"690","a senior officer who reports to the"
"691","independent trustees and is responsible for"
"692","monitoring compliance by the fund with applicable"
"693","laws and fiduciary duties and for"
"694","managing the process by which management fees"
"695","charged to a fund are approved. The settlements"
"696","are described in Federated's"
"697","announcement which, along with previous press"
"698","releases and related communications on those matters,"
"699","is available in the About Us"
"700","section of Federated's website at FederatedInvestors.com."
"701","Federated entities have also been named as"
"702","defendants in several additional lawsuits that"
"703","are now pending in the United States"
"704","District Court for the Western District of"
"705","Pennsylvania, alleging, among other things,"
"706","excessive advisory and Rule 12b-1 fees."
"707","The Board of the Funds retained the law firm of"
"708","Dickstein Shapiro LLP to represent the Funds"
"709","in each of the lawsuits described in"
"710","the preceding two paragraphs. Federated and"
"711","the Funds, and their respective counsel, have"
"712","been defending this litigation, and none of"
"713","the Funds remains a defendant in any of the"
"714","lawsuits (though some could potentially receive"
"715","any recoveries as nominal defendants)."
"716","Additional lawsuits based upon similar allegations"
"717","may be filed in the future. The potential impact"
"718","of these lawsuits, all of which seek"
"719","unquantified damages, attorneys' fees, and expenses,"
"720","and future potential similar suits is uncertain."
"721","Although we do not believe that"
"722","these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect"
"723","on the Funds, there can be no assurance that"
"724","these suits, ongoing adverse publicity"
"725","and/or other developments resulting from the"
"726","regulatory investigations will not result in"
"727","increased Fund redemptions, reduced sales of"
"728","Fund shares, or other adverse"
"729","consequences for the Funds."
