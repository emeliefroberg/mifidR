"1444","<TEXT>"
"1445","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1446","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"1447","Rydex Series Funds"
"1448","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Rydex"
"1449","Series Funds (the Trust) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013,"
"1450","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1451","Board (United States), we considered the Trusts internal control over"
"1452","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"1453","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1454","expressing our opinions on the financial statements and to comply with"
"1455","the requirements of Form NSAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"1456","opinion on the effectiveness of the Trusts internal control over financial"
"1457","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1458","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1459","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1460","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1461","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A companys internal"
"1462","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1463","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1464","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1465","accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial"
"1466","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1467","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1468","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company"
"1469","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"1470","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1471","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1472","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1473","and directors of the company and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1474","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1475","of a companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1476","statements."
"1477","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1478","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1479","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1480","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1481","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1482","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1483","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"1484","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1485","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1486","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1487","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1488","companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1489","detected on a timely basis."
"1490","Our consideration of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting"
"1491","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1492","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"1493","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1494","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1495","in the Trusts internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1496","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"1497","material weakness as defined above as of December 31, 2013."
"1498","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"1499","and the Board of Trustees of Rydex Series Funds and the Securities and"
"1500","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"1501","anyone other than these specified parties."

"1511","<DESCRIPTION>LITIGATION"
"1512","<TEXT>"
"1513","Legal Proceedings"
"1514","Tribune Company"
"1515","Rydex Series Funds has been named as a defendant and a putative member"
"1516","of the proposed defendant class of shareholders in the case entitled"
"1517","Kirschner v. FitzSimons, No. 12-2652 (S.D.N.Y.) (formerly Official"
"1518","Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Tribune Co. v. FitzSimons, Adv."
"1519","Pro. No. 10-54010 (Bankr. D. Del.)) (the FitzSimons action), as a result"
"1520","of ownership by certain series of the Rydex Series Funds of shares in the"
"1521","Tribune Company (Tribune) in 2007, when Tribune effected a leveraged"
"1522","buyout transaction (LBO) by which Tribune converted to a privately-held"
"1523","company.  In his complaint, the plaintiff has alleged that, in connection"
"1524","with the LBO, Tribune insiders and shareholders were overpaid for their"
"1525","Tribune stock using financing that the insiders knew would, and ultimately"
"1526","did, leave the Tribune Company insolvent.  The plaintiff has asserted"
"1527","claims against certain insiders, major shareholders, professional"
"1528","advisers, and others involved in the LBO.  The plaintiff is also"
"1529","attempting to obtain from former Tribune shareholders, including the Rydex"
"1530","Series Funds, the proceeds  they received in connection with the LBO."
"1531","In June 2011, a group of Tribune creditors filed multiple actions against"
"1532","former Tribune shareholders involving state law constructive fraudulent"
"1533","conveyance claims arising out of the 2007 LBO (the SCLFC actions)."
"1534","Rydex Series Funds has been named as a defendant in one or more of these"
"1535","suits.  In those actions, the creditors seek to recover from Tribunes"
"1536","former shareholders the proceeds received in connection with the 2007 LBO."
"1537","The FitzSimons action and the SLCFC actions have been consolidated with the"
"1538","majority of the other Tribune LBO-related lawsuits in a multidistrict"
"1539","litigation proceeding captioned In re Tribune Company Fraudulent Conveyance"
"1540","Litig., No. 11-md-2696 (S.D.N.Y.) (the MDL Proceeding)."
"1541","On September 23, 2013, the District Court granted the defendants omnibus"
"1542","motion to dismiss the SLCFC actions, on the basis that the creditors lacked"
"1543","standing.  On September 30, 2013, the creditors filed a notice of appeal of"
"1544","the September 23 order.  On October 28, 2013, the defendants filed a joint"
"1545","notice of cross-appeal of that same order."
"1546","On November 20, 2013, the District Court ordered the parties in the"
"1547","FitzSimons action to meet and confer regarding a potential protocol for the"
"1548","briefing and argument of motions to dismiss to be filed in that action.  On"
"1549","January 24, 2014, the Court extended the time for service of summonses and"
"1550","complaints in the FitzSimons action to February 28, 2014."
"1551","None of these lawsuits alleges any wrongdoing on the part of Rydex Series"
"1552","Funds. The following series of Rydex Series Funds held shares of Tribune"
"1553","and tendered these shares as part of Tribunes LBO Nova Fund, S&P 500 Pure"
"1554","Value Fund, Multi-Cap Core Equity Fund, S&P 500 Fund, Multi-Hedge"
"1555","Strategies Fund and Hedged Equity Fund (the Funds). The value of the"
"1556","proceeds received by the foregoing Funds was $28,220, $109,242, $9,860,"
"1557","$3,400, $1,181,160, and $10,880, respectively. At this stage of the"
"1558","proceedings, Rydex Series Funds is not able to make a reliable predication"
"1559","as to the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect, if any, on a Funds net"
"1560","asset value."
"1561","Lyondell Chemical Company"
"1562","In December 2011, Rydex Series Funds was named as a defendant in Weisfelner,"
"1563","as Trustee of the LB Creditor Trust, v. Fund 1 (In re Lyondell Chemical"
"1564","Co.), Adv. Pro. No. 10-4609 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.)."
"1565","Similar to the claims made in the Tribune matter, the Weisfelner complaint"
"1566","seeks to have set aside and recovered as fraudulent transfers from former"
"1567","Lyondell Chemical Company (Lyondell) shareholders the consideration paid"
"1568","to them pursuant to the cash out merger of Lyondell shareholders in"
"1569","connection with the combination of Lyondell and Basell AF in 2007."
"1570","Lyondell filed for bankruptcy in 2008."
"1571","On January 14, 2014, the Court granted in part and denied in part the"
"1572","defendants motion to dismiss the Creditor Trust action.  In particular,"
"1573","the Court dismissed all defendants who were conduits for the proceeds from"
"1574","the merger transaction, and also ruled that the plaintiff could not bring"
"1575","any claims on behalf of certain entities who had ratified the merger"
"1576","transaction.  The Court also dismissed without prejudice the plaintiffs"
"1577","claims for intentional fraudulent transfer against the remaining defendants,"
"1578","and gave the Credit Trustee leave to replead these claims.  Finally, the"
"1579","Court denied the motion to dismiss with respect to the plaintiffs claims"
"1580","for constructive fraudulent transfer against the remaining defendants."
"1581","This lawsuit does not allege any wrongdoing on the part of Rydex Series"
"1582","Funds. The following series of Rydex Series Funds received cash proceeds"
"1583","from the cash out merger in the following amounts Basic Materials Fund -"
"1584","$1,725,168; U.S. Long Short Momentum Fund - $2,193,600; Global 130/30"
"1585","Strategy Fund - $37,920; Hedged Equity Fund - $1,440; and Multi-Hedge"
"1586","Strategies Fund - $1,116,480. At this stage of the proceedings, Rydex Series"
"1587","Funds is not able to make a reliable predication as to the outcome of these"
"1588","lawsuits or the effect, if any, on a Funds net asset value."
