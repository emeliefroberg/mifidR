"1543","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1544","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1545","The Arbitrage Funds"
"1546","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"1547","The Arbitrage Funds (comprising The Arbitrage Fund, The Arbitrage"
"1548","Event-Driven Fund, The Arbitrage Credit Opportunities Fund, and The"
"1549","Arbitrage Tactical Equity Fund) (the Funds) as of and for the year"
"1550","ended May 31, 2017, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1551","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1552","Funds internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"1553","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1554","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1555","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"1556","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1557","Funds internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"1558","express no such opinion."
"1559","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"1560","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1561","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"1562","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1563","controls. A funds internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1564","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1565","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1566","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1567","accepted accounting principles. A funds internal control over"
"1568","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1569","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1570","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1571","assets of the fund (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"1572","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1573","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1574","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"1575","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1576","directors of the fund and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1577","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"1578","disposition of a funds assets that could have a material effect on"
"1579","the financial statements."
"1580","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1581","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"1582","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"1583","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1584","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1585","procedures may deteriorate."
"1586","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1587","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"1588","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1589","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"1590","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1591","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1592","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"1593","of the Funds annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1594","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1595","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"1596","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1597","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1598","internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"1599","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1600","(United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds"
"1601","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1602","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider"
"1603","to be a material weakness as defined above as of May 31, 2017."
"1604","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1605","management and the Board of Trustees of The Arbitrage Funds and the"
"1606","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"1607","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1652","<TEXT>"
"1653","INFORMATION REGARDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"1654","The Arbitrage Fund and dozens of other entities and individuals have"
"1655","been named as defendants in an adversary proceeding pending in the"
"1656","United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York"
"1657","(Weisfelner, as Trustee of the LB Creditor Trust v. Fund 1, et al.,"
"1658","Adv. Pro. No. 1004609).  The complaint alleges that payments made to"
"1659","shareholders of Lyondell Chemical Company (Lyondell) in connection"
"1660","with the acquisition of Lyondell by Basell AF S.C.A. in a cash-out"
"1661","merger in or around December, 2007 constituted constructive or"
"1662","intentional fraudulent transfers under applicable state law and seeks"
"1663","to recover from the former Lyondell shareholders the payments"
"1664","received for the shares."
"1665","On January 14, 2014, the Court issued a decision and order on motions"
"1666","to dismiss granting in part, and denying in part, the motions. On"
"1667","April 9, 2014, plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint continuing"
"1668","to assert constructive or intentional fraudulent transfer claims"
"1669","under applicable state law. On August 1, 2014, defendants filed a"
"1670","motion to dismiss the Third Amended Complaint, and oral arguments on"
"1671","the motion to dismiss were held on January 14, 2015. On November 18,"
"1672","2015, the Court issued a decision dismissing the intentional"
"1673","fraudulent transfer claim. The plaintiff appealed the November 18,"
"1674","2015 decision, which was entered as a Final Judgment. On May 4, 2016,"
"1675","based on the March 29, 2016 decision of the U.S. Court of Appeal for"
"1676","the Second Circuit in In re Tribune Fraudulent Conveyance Litigation,"
"1677","defendants moved to dismiss the remaining constructive fraudulent"
"1678","transfer claims in the Creditor Action, or alternatively, to stay all"
"1679","discovery in that action pending the exhaustion of all appeal periods"
"1680","in the Tribune matter. On July 27, 2016 the District Court denied the"
"1681","defendants motion for dismissal and remanded the claim to the"
"1682","Bankruptcy Court. On April 21, 2017 the Bankruptcy Court issued an"
"1683","Opinion and Order in the related Blatvanik trial, granting judgement"
"1684","for the defendants on virtually all claims, including both the"
"1685","intentional and constructive fraudulent transfer claims. In"
"1686","particular, the Court found that the Trustee had not established that"
"1687","the merger left Lyondell (or its successor LBI) insolvent (under any"
"1688","test of insolvency) or that Dan Smith, Lyondells CEO, intended the"
"1689","merger to hinder, delay or defraud Lyondells (or LBIs) creditors."
"1690","On May 30, 2017 the defendants filed motions to dismiss the remaining"
"1691","causes of action on collateral estoppel grounds."
"1692","At this stage in the proceedings, it is not possible to assess with"
"1693","any reasonable certainty the probable outcome of the pending litigation."
