"1171","considered the Funds internal control over financial"
"1172","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1173","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1174","procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1175","opinions on the financial statements and to comply"

"1177","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1178","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"1179","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no"
"1180","such opinion."
"1181","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"1182","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1183","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"

"1187","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1188","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1189","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1190","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"1191","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1192","accounting principles.  A companys internal control"
"1193","over financial reporting includes those policies and"

"1195","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1196","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"1197","the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1198","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1199","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1200","statements in accordance with generally accepted"

"1205","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"1206","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"1207","companys assets that could have a material effect on"
"1208","the financial statements."
"1209","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"

"1214","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"1215","the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1216","procedures may deteriorate."
"1217","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1218","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1219","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1220","the normal course of performing their assigned"

"1225","a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1226","misstatement of the companys annual or interim"

"1229","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
