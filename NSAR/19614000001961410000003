"1061","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1062","The Board of Directors and Shareholders"
"1063","AllianceBernstein Mid-Cap Growth Fund, Inc."
"1064","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"1065","AllianceBernstein Mid-Cap Growth Fund, Inc., as of and for the year ended"
"1066","July 31, 2008, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1067","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds"
"1068","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1069","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"1070","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"1071","to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1072","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control"
"1073","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1074","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1075","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1076","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"1077","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A funds"
"1078","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1079","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"1080","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"1081","purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting"
"1082","principles. A funds internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1083","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1084","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1085","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1086","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1087","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1088","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1089","fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1090","and directors of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1091","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"1092","disposition of the funds assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1093","financial statements."
"1094","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1095","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"1096","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"1097","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"1098","that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1099","deteriorate."
"1100","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1101","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"1102","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"1103","or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"1104","deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"1105","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1106","material misstatement of the Funds annual or interim financial"
"1107","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1108","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial reporting"
"1109","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"1110","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might"
"1111","be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1112","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"1113","deficiencies in the Funds internal control over financial reporting and"
"1114","their operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we"
"1115","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of July 31, 2008."
"1116","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"1117","and the Board of Directors of AllianceBernstein Mid-Cap Growth Fund, Inc."
"1118","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"

"1133","Legal Proceedings"
"1134","On October 2, 2003, a purported class action complaint entitled Hindo,"
"1135","et al. v. AllianceBernstein Growth & Income Fund, et al. (Hindo Complaint)"
"1136","was filed against the Adviser, Alliance Capital Management Holding L.P."
"1137","(Alliance Holding), Alliance Capital Management Corporation, AXA Financial,"
"1138","Inc., the AllianceBernstein Funds, certain officers of the Adviser"
"1139","(AllianceBernstein defendants), and certain other unaffiliated defendants,"
"1140","as well as unnamed Doe defendants. The Hindo Complaint was filed in the"
"1141","United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by"
"1142","alleged shareholders of two of the AllianceBernstein Funds. The Hindo"
"1143","Complaint alleges that certain of the AllianceBernstein defendants failed"
"1144","to disclose that they improperly allowed certain hedge funds and other"
"1145","unidentified parties to engage in late trading and market timing of"
"1146","AllianceBernstein Fund securities, violating Sections 11 and 15 of the"
"1147","Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Sections"
"1148","206 and 215 of the Advisers Act. Plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of"
"1149","compensatory damages and rescission of their contracts with the Adviser,"
"1150","including recovery of all fees paid to the Adviser pursuant to such"
"1151","contracts."
"1152","Following October 2, 2003, 43 additional lawsuits making factual allegations"
"1153","generally similar to those in the Hindo Complaint were filed in various"
"1154","federal and state courts against the Adviser and certain other defendants."
"1155","On September 29, 2004, plaintiffs filed consolidated amended complaints with"
"1156","respect to four claim types: mutual fund shareholder claims; mutual fund"
"1157","derivative claims; derivative claims brought on behalf of Alliance Holding;"
"1158","and claims brought under ERISA by participants in the Profit Sharing Plan"
"1159","for Employees of the Adviser. All four complaints include substantially"
"1160","identical factual allegations, which appear to be based in large part on"
"1161","the Order of the SEC dated December 18, 2003 as amended and restated January"
"1162","15, 2004 (SEC Order) and the New York State Attorney General Assurance of"
"1163","Discontinuance dated September 1, 2004 (NYAG Order)."
"1164","On April 21, 2006, the Adviser and attorneys for the plaintiffs in the mutual"
"1165","fund shareholder claims, mutual fund derivative claims, and ERISA claims"
"1166","entered into a confidential memorandum of understanding containing their"
"1167","agreement to settle these claims. The agreement will be documented by a"
"1168","stipulation of settlement and will be submitted for court approval at a"
"1169","later date. The settlement amount ($30 million) which the Adviser previously"
"1170","accrued and disclosed, has been disbursed. The derivative claims brought on"
"1171","behalf of Alliance Holding, in which plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount"
"1172","of damages, remain pending."
"1173","It is possible that these matters and/or other developments resulting from"
"1174","these matters could result in increased redemptions of the AllianceBernstein"
"1175","Mutual Funds shares or other adverse consequences to the AllianceBernstein"
"1176","Mutual Funds. This may require the AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds to sell"
"1177","investments held by those funds to provide for sufficient liquidity and could"
"1178","also have an adverse effect on the investment performance of the"
"1179","AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds. However, the Adviser believes that these"
"1180","matters are not likely to have a material adverse effect on its ability to"
"1181","perform advisory services relating to the AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds."
