"5422","<TEXT>"
"5423","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"5424","To the Shareholders and"
"5425","Board of Trustees of Munder Series Trust"
"5426","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Munder"
"5427","Series Trust (the Trust) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2011, in"
"5428","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"5429","(United States), we considered the Trust's internal control over financial"
"5430","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"5431","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"5432","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"5433","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"5434","Trust's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"5435","such opinion."
"5436","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"5437","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"5438","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"5439","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal"
"5440","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"5441","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"5442","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"5443","accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"5444","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"5445","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"5446","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"5447","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"5448","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"5449","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"5450","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"5451","and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"5452","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"5453","of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"5454","statements."
"5455","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"5456","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"5457","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"5458","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"5459","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"5460","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"5461","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"5462","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"5463","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"5464","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"5465","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"5466","company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"5467","detected on a timely basis."
"5468","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting was"
"5469","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"5470","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"5471","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"5472","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"5473","Trust's internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"5474","controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material"
"5475","weakness as defined above as of June 30, 2011."
"5476","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"5477","Board of Trustees of Munder Series Trust and the Securities and Exchange"
"5478","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"

"5654","      PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES"

"5656","      in securities of companies in countries represented in the Morgan"
"5657","      Stanley Capital International All Country World (MSCI ACWI) Index ex"

"5664","      Fund means net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment"
"5665","      purposes."
"5666","      The advisor employs a bottom-up investment approach that emphasizes"
"5667","      individual stock selection.  The advisor's investment process uses a"
"5668","      combination of quantitative and traditional qualitative, fundamental"
"5669","      analysis to identify attractive stocks with low relative price multiples"
"5670","      and positive trends in earnings forecasts.  The stock selection process"
"5671","      is designed to produce a diversified portfolio that, relative to the"

"5675","      approximate the country and sector allocations of the MSCI ACWI Index"
"5676","      ex U.S., which concentrates its exposure in one or more countries,"
"5677","      regions or sectors. The Fund will, however, be invested in a minimum of"
"5678","      ten countries."
"5679","      There is no limit on the market capitalization in which the Fund may"
"5680","      invest; therefore, the Fund's investments may include small-, mid-"
"5681","      and large-capitalization companies."

"5683","      exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to manage cash."

"5728","Effective upon the date of this Supplement, on page 2 of the Prospectus, the"
"5729","Principal Investment Strategies of the Fund are hereby deleted in their"
"5730","entirety and replaced with the following:"
"5731","PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES"
"5732","The advisor pursues its investment objective by investing, under normal"
"5733","circumstances, at least 80% of the Fund's assets in equity securities (i.e.,"
"5734","common stocks, preferred stocks, convertible securities and rights and"
"5735","warrants) of small-capitalization companies. This investment strategy may not"
"5736","be changed without 60 days' prior notice to shareholders. For purposes of this"
"5737","investment strategy, assets of the Fund means net assets plus the amount of"
"5738","any borrowings for investment purposes. Small-capitalization companies means"
"5739","those companies with market capitalizations within the range of companies"
"5740","included in the Russell 2000 Index ($10 million to $5.2 billion as of"
"5741","December 31, 2010). The Fund may, however, also invest (i) in equity"
"5742","securities of larger companies and (ii) up to 25% of its assets in foreign"
"5743","securities."
"5744","When selecting securities to invest in, the advisor seeks out companies that"
"5745","appear to be undervalued according to certain financial measurements of their"
"5746","intrinsic net worth or business prospects. The Fund typically holds a"
"5747","diversified portfolio of 100 to 150 companies. The advisor chooses the Fund's"
"5748","investments by employing a value-oriented approach that focuses on securities"
"5749","that offer value with improving sentiment. The advisor finds these"
"5750","value-oriented investments by, among other things: (i) rigorously analyzing"
"5751","the company's financial characteristics and assessing the quality of the"
"5752","company's management; (ii) considering comparative price-to-book,"
"5753","price-to-sales and price-to-cash flow ratios; and (iii) analyzing cash flows"
"5754","to identify stocks with the most attractive potential returns."
"5755","The advisor regularly reviews the Fund's investments and will sell securities"
"5756","when the advisor believes the securities are no longer attractive because"
"5757","(i) of price appreciation, (ii) of a significant change in the fundamental"
"5758","outlook of the company or (iii) other investments available are considered to"
"5759","be more attractive."

"6708","       the corresponding class received by the Acquired Fund pursuant to"
"6709","       paragraph 1.1, and (b) completely liquidate the Acquired Fund. Such"
"6710","       distribution and liquidation will be accomplished, with respect to each"
"6711","       class of the Acquired Fund's shares, by the transfer of the Acquiring"
"6712","       Fund Shares then credited to the account of the Acquired Fund on the"

"6719","       corresponding class owned by Acquired Fund Shareholders on the Closing"
"6720","       Date. All issued and outstanding Acquired Fund Shares will simultaneously"
"6721","       be canceled on the books of the Acquired Fund. The Acquiring Fund will"
