"877","Effective August 1, 2012, Class R1 shares will be closed to new purchases."
"878","The following amends anything to the contrary in the section of the Prospectus"
"879","titled Choosing a class of
shares to buy to the extent that such fund offers such classes:"
"880","When choosing between Class A and Class C shares, you should be aware that,"
"881","generally speaking, the larger the size of your investment and the longer your"
"882","investment horizon, the more likely it will be that Class C shares will not be"
"883","as advantageous as Class A shares. The annual distribution and/or service fees"
"884","on Class C shares may cost you more over the longer term than the front-end"
"885","sales charge and service fees you would have paid for larger purchases of"
"886","Class A shares. If you are eligible to purchase Class I shares, you should be"
"887","aware that Class I shares are not subject to a front-end sales charge and"
"888","generally have lower annual expenses than Class A or Class C shares."
"889","More information about the fund's classes of shares is available through the"
"890","Legg Mason funds' website."
"891","You'll find detailed information about sales charges and ways you can qualify"

"894","The contingent deferred sales charges that apply to the redemption of Class"
"895","B shares, Class C"
"896","shares and certain Class A shares"
"897","The following amends anything to the contrary in the section of the Prospectus"
"898","titled Comparing the fund's classes to the extent that such fund offers such"

"900","Contingent deferred sales charge"
"901","Class A: 1.00% on purchases of $1 million or more if you redeem within 18"
"902","months of purchase (or within 12 months for shares purchased prior to August"
"903","1, 2012); waived for certain investors"
"904","The following amends anything to the contrary in the section of the Prospectus"
"905","titled Sales charges - Investments of $1 million or more; the section of the"
"906","SAI titled Purchase of Shares for each fund listed on Schedule A; and the"
"907","section of the SAI titled Additional Purchase and Redemption Information for"
"908","each fund listed on Schedule B:"
"909","You do not pay an initial sales charge when you buy $1,000,000 or more of"
"910","Class A shares. However, if you redeem these Class A shares within 18 months"
"911","of purchase (or within 12 months for shares purchased prior to August 1,"

"921","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"922","The Board of Trustees"
"923","Legg Mason Partners Equity Trust:"
"924","In planning and performing our audits of the ClearBridge Large Cap"
"925","Growth Fund (formerly, Legg Mason ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Fund)"
"926","and Legg Mason Batterymarch U.S. Large Cap Equity Fund (collectively,"
"927","the ?Funds?), each a series of Legg Mason Partners Equity Trust, as"
"928","of and for the year ended November 30, 2012, in accordance with the"
"929","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"930","States), we considered the Funds? internal control over financial"
"931","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"932","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"933","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"
"934","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"935","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds? internal control over"
"936","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"937","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"938","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"939","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"940","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"941","costs of controls.  A fund?s internal control over financial"
"942","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"943","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"944","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"945","generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund?s internal control"
"946","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"947","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"948","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"949","the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"950","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"951","financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted"
"952","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"953","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"954","and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"955","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"956","acquisition, use, or disposition of the fund?s assets that could have"
"957","a material effect on the financial statements."
"958","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"959","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"960","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"961","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"962","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"963","procedures may deteriorate."
"964","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"965","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"966","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"967","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"968","material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,"
"969","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"970","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds?"
"971","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"972","detected on a timely basis."
"973","Our consideration of the Funds? internal control over financial"
"974","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"975","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"976","internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"977","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"978","States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds? internal"
"979","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"980","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"981","material weakness as defined above as of November 30, 2012."
"982","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"983","management and the Board of Trustees of Legg Mason Partners Equity"
"984","Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"985","to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"986","parties."
