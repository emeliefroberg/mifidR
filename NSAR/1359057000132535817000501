The Trust has selected BBD, LLP (BBD) to serve as the Fund's independent

The decision to select BBD was recommended by the Trust's Audit Committee on February 6, 2017 and was approved by the Trust's Board of Trustees on February 6, 2017. During the Fund's two most recent fiscal years and through March 14, 2017, neither the Fund, nor anyone on its behalf, consulted with BBD on items which: (i) concerned the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Fund's financial statements; or (ii) concerned the subject of a disagreement (as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of said Item 304). The selection of BBD does not reflect any disagreements with or dissatisfaction by the Fund or the Trust's Board of Trustees with the performance of the Fund's prior independent registered public accounting firm, PwC.

The Trust has provided a copy of the foregoing disclosures to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) and requested that PwC furnish it with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether or not it agrees with the above Statements. A copy of such letter, dated May 30, 2017, is filed as Exhibit 77K to this Form NSAR.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


To the Board of Trustees of Manager Directed Portfolios
and the Shareholders of Pemberwick Fund


In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Pemberwick Fund, a series of Manager Directed Portfolios (the Fund), as of March 31, 2017 and for the period then ended, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB.  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as of March 31, 2017.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of management, the shareholders of Pemberwick Fund, the Board of Trustees of Manager Directed Portfolios and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.
