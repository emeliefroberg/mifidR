"606","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"607","Firm"
"608","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"609","Morgan Stanley U.S. Government Securities Trust:"
"610","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"611","statements of Morgan Stanley U.S. Government"
"612","Securities Trust (the Fund) as of and for the year"
"613","ended December 31, 2015, in accordance with the"
"614","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"615","Oversight Board (United States), we considered its"
"616","internal control over financial reporting, including"
"617","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"618","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"619","expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"620","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"621","SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"622","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"623","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"624","express no such opinion."
"625","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"626","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"627","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"628","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"629","management are required to assess the expected"
"630","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"631","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"632","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"633","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"634","preparation of financial statements for external"
"635","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"636","accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"637","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"638","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"639","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"640","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"641","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"642","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"643","to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"644","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"645","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"646","company are being made only in accordance with"
"647","authorizations of management and directors of the"
"648","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"649","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"650","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"651","company's assets that could have a material effect"
"652","on the financial statements."
"653","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"654","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"655","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"656","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"657","risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"658","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"659","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"660","deteriorate."
"661","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"662","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"663","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"664","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"665","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"666","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"667","a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"668","over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"669","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"670","the company's annual or interim financial statements"
"671","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"672","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"673","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"674","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"675","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"676","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"677","standards established by the Public Company"
"678","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"679","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"680","internal control over financial reporting and its"
"681","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"682","securities that we consider to be a material weakness"
"683","as defined above as of December 31, 2015."
"684","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"685","use of management and the Board of Trustees of"
"686","Morgan Stanley U.S. Government Securities Trust"
"687","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"688","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
"689","other than these specified parties."

"755","preceding twelve months."
"756","   SECTION 3.3. Notice of Meetings. Written or"
"757","printed notice of every Shareholders' meeting stating the"
"758","place, date, and purpose or purposes thereof, shall be"
"759","given by the Secretary not less than ten (10) nor more"
"760","than ninety (90) days before such meeting to each"

"765","the Trust."
"766","   SECTION 3.4 Quorum and Adjournment of"
"767","Meetings. Except as otherwise provided by law, by the"
"768","Declaration or by these By-Laws, at all meetings of"
"769","Shareholders, the holders of a majority of the Shares"
"770","issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat,"
"771","present in person or represented by proxy, shall be"
"772","requisite and shall constitute a quorum for the"
"773","transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum, the"

"775","Shareholders present or represented by proxy and"
"776","entitled to vote thereat shall have the power to adjourn"
"777","the meeting from time to time. If the power of"

"779","vote of the holders of a majority of the Shares then"
"780","present in person or represented by proxy shall be"
"781","required to adjourn any meeting. Any adjourned meeting"
"782","may be reconvened without further notice or change in"
"783","record date. At any reconvened meeting at which a"
"784","quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted"
"785","that might have been transacted at the meeting as"
"786","originally called. The chairman of the meeting, an"

"791","or reject any proposal described in the original notice of"
"792","such meeting is not obtained (with proxies being voted"
"793","for or against adjournment consistent with the votes for"
"794","and against the proposal for which the required vote has"
"795","not been obtained)."
"796","    SECTION 3.5. Voting Rights, Proxies. At each"
"797","meeting of Shareholders, each holder of record of"
"798","Shares entitled to vote thereat shall be entitled to one"
"799","vote in person or by proxy for each Share of beneficial"
"800","interest of the Trust and for the fractional portion of"
"801","one vote for each fractional Share entitled to vote so"
"802","registered in his or her name on the records of the"
"803","Trust on the date fixed as the record date for the"
"804","determination of Shareholders entitled to vote at such"
"805","meeting. Without limiting the manner in which a"
"806","Shareholder may authorize another person or persons"
"807","to act for such Shareholder as proxy pursuant hereto,"
"808","the following shall constitute a valid means by which"
"809","a Shareholder may grant such authority:"
"810","(i)	A Shareholder may execute a writing"
"811","authorizing another person or persons to act for"
"812","such Shareholder as proxy. Execution may be"
"813","accomplished by the Shareholder or such"
"814","Shareholder's authorized officer, director,"
"815","employee, attorney-in-fact or another agent signing"
"816","such writing or causing such person's signature to"
"817","be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means"
"818","including, but not limited to, by facsimile or"
"819","telecopy signature. No written evidence of authority"
"820","of a Shareholder's authorized officer, director,"
"821","employee, attorney-in-fact or other agent shall be"
"822","required; and"
"823","(ii)	A Shareholder may authorize another person or"
"824","persons to act for such Shareholder as proxy by"
"825","transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a"
"826","telegram or cablegram or by other means of"
"827","telephonic, electronic or computer transmission to"
"828","the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to"
"829","a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service"
"830","organization or like agent duly authorized by the"
"831","person who will be the holder of the proxy to"
"832","receive such transmission, provided that any such"
"833","telegram or cablegram or other means of telephonic,"
"834","electronic or computer transmission must either set"
"835","forth or be submitted with information from which"
"836","it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or"
"837","other transmission was authorized by the"
"838","Shareholder."
"839","No proxy shall be valid after eleven months from its"
"840","date, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. At all"
"841","meetings of Shareholders, unless the voting is conducted"
"842","by inspectors, all questions relating to the qualification"
"843","of voters and the validity of proxies and the acceptance"
"844","or rejection of votes shall be decided by the chairman of"
"845","the meeting. In determining whether a telegram,"
"846","cablegram or other electronic transmission is valid, the"
"847","chairman or inspector, as the case may be, shall specify"
"848","the information upon which he or she relied. Pursuant to"
"849","a resolution of a majority of the Trustees, proxies may"
"850","be solicited in the name of one or more Trustees or"
"851","Officers of the Trust. Proxy solicitations may be made in"
"852","writing or by using telephonic or other electronic"
"853","solicitation procedures that include appropriate methods"
"854","of verifying the identity of the Shareholder and"
"855","confirming any instructions given thereby."
"856","    SECTION 3.6. Vote Required. Except as otherwise"
"857","provided by law, by the Declaration of Trust, or by these"
"858","By-Laws, at each meeting of Shareholders at which a"
"859","quorum is present, all matters shall be decided by"
"860","Majority Shareholder Vote."
"861","    SECTION 3.7. Inspectors of Election. In advance of"
"862","any meeting of Shareholders, the Trustees may appoint"
"863","Inspectors of Election to act at the meeting or any"
"864","adjournment thereof. If Inspectors of Election are not so"
"865","appointed, the chairman of any meeting of Shareholders"
"866","may, and on the request of any Shareholder or his proxy"
"867","shall, appoint Inspectors of Election of the meeting. In"
"868","case any person appointed as Inspector fails to appear or"
"869","fails or refuses to act, the vacancy may be filled by"
"870","appointment made by the Trustees in advance of the"
"871","convening of the meeting or at the meeting by the person"
"872","acting as chairman. The Inspectors of Election shall"
"873","determine the number of Shares outstanding, the Shares"
"874","represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum,"
"875","the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies, shall"
"876","receive votes, ballots or consents, shall hear and"
"877","determine all challenges and questions in any way"
"878","arising in connection with the right to vote, shall count"
"879","and tabulate all votes or consents, determine the results,"
"880","and do such other acts as may be proper to conduct the"
"881","election or vote with fairness to all Shareholders. On"
"882","request of the chairman of the meeting, or of any"
"883","Shareholder or his proxy, the Inspectors of Election shall"
"884","make a report in writing of any challenge or question or"
"885","matter determined by them and shall execute a certificate"
"886","of any facts found by them."
"887","   SECTION 3.8. Inspection of Books and Records."
"888","Shareholders shall have such rights and procedures of"
"889","inspection of the books and records of the Trust as are"
"890","granted to Shareholders under Section 32 of the Business"
"891","Corporation Law of the Commonwealth of"
"892","Massachusetts."
"893","   SECTION 3.9. Action by Shareholders Without"
"894","Meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law, the"
"895","provisions of these By-Laws relating to notices and"
"896","meetings to the contrary notwithstanding, any action"
"897","required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of"
"898","Shareholders may be taken without a meeting if a"
"899","majority of the Shareholders entitled to vote upon the"
"900","action consent to the action in writing and such consents"
"901","are filed with the records of the Trust. Such consent shall"
"902","be treated for all purposes as a vote taken at a meeting of"
"903","Shareholders."
"904","   SECTION 3.10. Presence at Meetings. Presence at"
"905","meetings of shareholders requires physical attendance by"
"906","the shareholder or his or her proxy at the meeting site"

"910","Trustees"
"911","   SECTION 4.1. Meetings of the Trustees. The"
"912","Trustees may in their discretion provide for regular or"
"913","special meetings of the Trustees. Regular meetings of"
"914","the Trustees may be held at such time and place as shall"
"915","be determined from time to time by the Trustees without"
"916","further notice. Special meetings of the Trustees may be"
"917","called at any time by the President and shall be called by"

"919","any two (2) Trustees."
"920","   SECTION 4.2. Notice of Special Meetings. Written"
"921","notice of special meetings of the Trustees, stating the"

"927","given when deposited in the United States mail,"
"928","postage prepaid, directed to the Trustee at his address"
"929","as it appears on the records of the Trust. Subject to the"

"936","any such committee, as the case may be, by means of a"
"937","conference telephone or similar communications"
"938","equipment if all persons participating in the meeting can"
"939","hear each other at the same time. Participation in a"
"940","meeting by these means constitutes presence in person at"
"941","the meeting."
"942","   SECTION 4.4. Quorum, Voting and Adjournment"
"943","of Meetings. At all meetings of the Trustees, a majority"
"944","of the Trustees shall be requisite to and shall constitute"
"945","a quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum is"
"946","present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the"
"947","Trustees present shall be the act of the Trustees, unless"
"948","the concurrence of a greater proportion is expressly"
"949","required for such action by law, the Declaration or"
"950","these By-Laws. If at any meeting of the Trustees there"
"951","be less than a quorum present, the Trustees present"
"952","thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time,"
"953","without notice other than announcement at the meeting,"
"954","until a quorum shall have been obtained."
"955","   SECTION 4.5. Action by Trustees Without Meeting."
"956","The provisions of these By-Laws covering notices and"
"957","meetings to the contrary notwithstanding, and except as"
"958","required by law, any action required or permitted to be"
"959","taken at any meeting of the Trustees may be taken"
"960","without a meeting if a consent in writing setting forth the"
"961","action shall be signed by all of the Trustees entitled to"

"964","   SECTION 4.6. Expenses and Fees. Each Trustee"
"965","may be allowed expenses, if any, for attendance at each"

"971","compensation as may be fixed by the Trustees. Nothing"
"972","herein contained shall be construed to preclude any"
"973","Trustee from serving the Trust in any other capacity and"
"974","receiving compensation therefor."
"975","    SECTION 4.7. Execution of Instruments and"
"976","Documents and Signing of Checks and Other"

"984","President or the Treasurer or by any one or more"
"985","officers or agents of the Trust as shall be designated"
"986","for that purpose by vote of the Trustees;"
"987","notwithstanding the above, nothing in this Section 4.7"
"988","shall be deemed to preclude the electronic"
"989","authorization, by designated persons, of the Trust's"
"990","Custodian (as described herein in Section 9.1) to"

"993","    SECTION 4.8. Indemnification of Trustees,"
"994","Officers, Employees and Agents. (a) The Trust shall"

"997","pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding,"
"998","whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative"
"999","(other than an action by or in the right of the Trust) by"
"1000","reason of the fact that he is or was a Trustee, officer,"
"1001","employee, or agent of the Trust. The indemnification"
"1002","shall be against expenses, including attorneys' fees,"
"1003","judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement,"
"1004","actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection"
"1005","with the action, suit, or proceeding, if he acted in good"
"1006","faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in"
"1007","or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and,"
"1008","with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had"
"1009","no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was"
"1010","unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or"
"1011","proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction,"
"1012","or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent,"
"1013","shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person"
"1014","did not act in good faith and in a manner which he"
"1015","reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best"
"1016","interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal"
"1017","action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe"
"1018","that his conduct was unlawful."
"1019","    (b)	The Trust shall indemnify any person who was"
"1020","or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any"
"1021","threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or on"
"1022","behalf of the Trust to obtain a judgment or decree in its"
"1023","favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Trustee,"
"1024","officer, employee, or agent of the Trust. The"
"1025","indemnification shall be against expenses, including"
"1026","attorneys' fees actually and reasonably incurred by him"
"1027","in connection with the defense or settlement of the"
"1028","action or suit, if he acted in good faith and in a manner"
"1029","he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the"
"1030","best interests of the Trust; except that no"
"1031","indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim,"
"1032","issue, or matter as to which the person has been"
"1033","adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in"
"1034","the performance of his duty to the Trust, except to the"
"1035","extent that the court in which the action or suit was"
"1036","brought, or a court of equity in the county in which the"
"1037","Trust has its principal office, determines upon"
"1038","application that, despite the adjudication of liability but"
"1039","in view of all circumstances of the case, the person is"
"1040","fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for those"
"1041","expenses which the court shall deem proper, provided"
"1042","such Trustee, officer, employee or agent is not adjudged"
"1043","to be liable by reason of his willful misfeasance, bad"
"1044","faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the"
"1045","duties involved in the conduct of his office."
"1046","    (c)	To the extent that a Trustee, officer, employee,"
"1047","or agent of the Trust has been successful on the merits or"
"1048","otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding"
"1049","referred to in subsection (a) or (b) or in defense of any"
"1050","claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified"
"1051","against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and"
"1052","reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith."
"1053","    (d)	(1) Unless a court orders otherwise, any"
"1054","indemnification under subsections (a) or (b) of this"
"1055","section may be made by the Trust only as authorized in"
"1056","the specific case after a determination that"
"1057","indemnification of the Trustee, officer, employee, or"
"1058","agent is proper in the circumstances because he has"
"1059","met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in"
"1060","subsections (a) or (b)."
"1061","(2) The determination shall be made:"
"1062","     (i) By the Trustees, by a majority vote of a"
"1063","quorum which consists of Trustees who were not"
"1064","parties to the action, suit or proceeding; or"
"1065","     (ii) If the required quorum is not"
"1066","obtainable, or if a quorum of disinterested"
"1067","Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel"
"1068","in a written opinion; or"
"1069","(iii) By the Shareholders."
"1070","    (3) Notwithstanding any provision of this"
"1071","Section 4.8, no person shall be entitled to indemnifi-"
"1072","cation for any liability, whether or not there is an"
"1073","adjudication of liability, arising by reason of willful"
"1074","misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless"
"1075","disregard of duties as described in Section 17(h) and"
"1076","(i) of the Investment Company Act of 1940"
"1077","(disabling conduct). A person shall be deemed not"
"1078","liable by reason of disabling conduct if, either:"
"1079","    (i)	a final decision on the merits is made"
"1080","by a court or other body before whom the"
"1081","proceeding was brought that the person to be"
"1082","indemnified (indemnitee) was not liable by"
"1083","reason of disabling conduct; or"
"1084","    (ii)	 in the absence of such a decision, a"
"1085","reasonable determination, based upon a review"
"1086","of the facts, that the indemnitee was not liable"
"1087","by reason of disabling conduct, is made by"
"1088","either-"
"1089","    (A)	a majority of a quorum of"
"1090","Trustees who are neither interested
persons of the Trust, as defined in Section"
"1091","2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act"
"1092","of 1940, nor parties to the action, suit or"
"1093","proceeding, or"
"1094","    (B)	 	an independent legal counsel"
"1095","in a written opinion."
"1096","   (e) Expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by"
"1097","a Trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Trust in"
"1098","defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding"
"1099","may be paid by the Trust in advance of the final"
"1100","disposition thereof if:"
"1101","    (1)	authorized in the specific case by the"
"1102","Trustees; and"
"1103","    (2)	the Trust receives an undertaking by or on"
"1104","behalf of the Trustee, officer, employee or agent of"
"1105","the Trust to repay the advance if it is not ultimately"
"1106","determined that such person is entitled to be"
"1107","indemnified by the Trust; and"
"1108","    (3)	either, (i) such person provides a security"
"1109","for his undertaking, or (ii) the Trust is insured"
"1110","against losses by reason of any lawful advances, or"
"1111","	(iii) a determination, based on a review of"
"1112","readily available facts, that there is reason to"
"1113","believe that such person ultimately will be"
"1114","found entitled to indemnification, is made by"
"1115","either-"
"1116","    (A)	a majority of a quorum which"
"1117","consists of Trustees who are neither"
"1118","interested persons of the Trust, as"
"1119","defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940"
"1120","Act, nor parties to the action, suit or"
"1121","proceeding, or"
"1122","    (B)	 	an independent legal counsel"
"1123","in a written opinion."
"1124","   (f) The indemnification provided by this Section"
"1125","shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to"
"1126","which a person may be entitled under any by-law,"
"1127","agreement, vote of Shareholders or disinterested"
"1128","Trustees or otherwise, both as to action in his official"
"1129","capacity and as to action in another capacity while"
"1130","holding the office, and shall continue as to a person"
"1131","who has ceased to be a Trustee, officer, employee, or"
"1132","agent and inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors"
"1133","and administrators of such person; provided that no"
"1134","person may satisfy any right of indemnity or"
"1135","reimbursement granted herein or to which he may be"
"1136","otherwise entitled except out of the property of the"
"1137","Trust, and no Shareholder shall be personally liable"
"1138","with respect to any claim for indemnity or"
"1139","reimbursement or otherwise."
"1140","   (g) The Trust may purchase and maintain insurance"
"1141","on behalf of any person who is or was a Trustee, officer,"
"1142","employee, or agent of the Trust, against any liability"
"1143","asserted against him and incurred by him in any such"
"1144","capacity, or arising out of his status as such. However, in"
"1145","no event will the Trust purchase insurance to indemnify"
"1146","any officer or Trustee against liability for any act for"
"1147","which the Trust itself is not permitted to indemnify him."
"1148","   (h) Nothing contained in this Section shall be"
"1149","construed to protect any Trustee or officer of the Trust"
"1150","against any liability to the Trust or to its security holders"
"1151","to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of"
"1152","willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or"
"1153","reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct"
"1154","of his office."
"1155","ARTICLE V"
"1156","Committees"
"1157","   SECTION 5.1. Executive and Other Committees."
"1158","The Trustees, by resolution adopted by a majority of the"
"1159","Trustees, may designate an Executive Committee and/or"

"1162","such committees, in the intervals between meetings of"
