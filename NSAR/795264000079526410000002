"1053","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1054","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Thompson Plumb Funds"
"1055","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Thompson"
"1056","Plumb Funds (comprised of Thompson Plumb Bond Fund, Thompson Plumb Growth"
"1057","Fund, and Thompson Plumb MidCap Fund, hereafter referred to as the Funds) as"
"1058","of and for the year ended November 30, 2009, in accordance with the standards"
"1059","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1060","considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1061","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1062","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1063","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1064","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"1065","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion"
"1066","on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"1067","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1068","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1069","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1070","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal"
"1071","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1072","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1073","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1074","accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"1075","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1076","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1077","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"1078","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1079","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1080","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"1081","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1082","directors of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1083","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1084","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1085","statements."
"1086","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1087","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1088","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1089","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1090","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1091","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1092","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"1093","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1094","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1095","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1096","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"1097","the Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1098","detected on a timely basis."
"1099","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"1100","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1101","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"1102","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1103","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"1104","no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and"
"1105","its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"1106","consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of November 30, 2009."
"1107","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"1108","the Board of Directors of Thompson Plumb Funds and the Securities and Exchange"
"1109","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"1110","than these specified parties."

"1125","Supplement Dated July 28, 2009 to"
"1126","Prospectus Dated March 31, 2009"
"1127","Change in Non-Fundamental Investment Objectives of the Funds"
"1128","The Board of Directors of Thompson Plumb Funds, Inc. has approved a change"
"1129","to a non-fundamental investment objective of each of the Thompson Plumb"
"1130","Growth Fund (the Growth Fund), the Thompson Plumb MidCap Fund (the MidCap
Fund) and the Thompson Plumb Bond Fund (the Bond Fund) (each a Fund and"
"1131","together, the Funds).  As a result, beginning September 30, 2009, each Fund"
"1132","will modify its investment strategy from that described in its current"
"1133","Prospectus dated March 31, 2009, as follows:"
"1134","Growth Fund.  The Growth Fund will normally invest at least 65% of its net,"
"1135","rather than total, assets in a diversified portfolio of common stocks."
"1136","MidCap Fund.  The MidCap Fund will invest, under normal circumstances, at"
"1137","least 80% of its net, rather than total, assets in common stocks of"
"1138","medium-sized companies with market capitalizations at the time of purchase"
"1139","between $1.0 billion and $12.0 billion."
"1140","Bond Fund.  The Bond Fund will normally invest at least 80% of its net,"
"1141","rather than total, assets in a diversified portfolio of bonds, will be"
"1142","permitted to invest up to 10% of its net, rather than total, assets in bonds"
"1143","rated below investment grade, and will be permitted to invest up to 20% of"
"1144","its net, rather than total, assets in other non-debt securities."
"1145","Other aspects and restrictions relating to the composition of each Fund's"
"1146","securities portfolio also will be measured by the Fund's net assets, rather"
"1147","than by its total assets.  The Board of Directors determined to make this"
"1148","change to simplify administration of compliance with these quantifiable"
"1149","investment strategies and to bring the Funds' policies in line with more"
"1150","widely followed industry practices.  In particular, because of accounting"
"1151","treatment of purchases and sales of portfolio securities, each Fund's total"
"1152","assets tend to fluctuate somewhat artificially while those purchases and sales"
"1153","remain pending (generally a period of three days from the trade date to the"
"1154","settlement date).  These fluctuations in the level of a Fund's total assets"
"1155","tend to complicate managing its securities portfolio in compliance with the"
"1156","Fund's strategy.  The measure of a Fund's net assets, on the other hand, is"
"1157","not affected by unsettled trades of portfolio securities, making net assets a"
"1158","more stable and less complex measure for the implementation of the Funds'"
"1159","strategies.  The Advisor anticipates this change will eliminate some of these"
"1160","short-term fluctuations that occur in the construction of each Fund's"
"1161","securities portfolio, but at the same time will not materially affect the"
"1162","composition or risk attributes of the Funds' securities portfolios over the"
"1163","longer term."
