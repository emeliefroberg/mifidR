"945","<P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of InvestEd Portfolios (the &#147;Funds&#148;), including InvestEd Growth Portfolio,"
"946","InvestEd Balanced Portfolio, and InvestEd Conservative Portfolio, as of and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds&#146;"
"947","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"948","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting.&nbsp;Accordingly, we express no such opinion. </P>"
"949","<P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"950","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"951","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"952","policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that"
"953","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"954","of management and trustees of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the"
"955","financial statements. </P> <P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"956","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>"
"957","<P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"958","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"959","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company&#146;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. </P>"
"960","<P STYLE=margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman>Our consideration of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"961","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds&#146; internal"
"962","control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as of December&nbsp;31, 2014. </P>"

"988","Reed Advisors International Growth Fund</FONT></B> seeks to achieve its objective of seeking to provide growth of capital by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of common stocks of growth-oriented U.S. and foreign companies that WRIMCO"
"989","believes are competitively well-positioned, gaining market share, have the potential for long-term growth and/or operate in regions or countries that WRIMCO believes possess attractive growth characteristics. Growth securities are those whose"
"990","earnings, WRIMCO believes, are likely to have strong growth over several years. The fund primarily invests in issuers of developed countries, including the U.S., although the fund has the ability to invest in issuers domiciled in or doing business"
"991","in any country or region around the globe, including emerging markets. While the fund primarily invests in securities issued by large capitalization companies (typically, companies with market capitalizations of at least $10 billion at the time of"
"992","acquisition), it may invest in securities issued by companies of any size and in any geographic area and within various sectors. Many companies have diverse operations, with products or services in foreign markets. Therefore, the fund may have an"
"993","indirect exposure to additional foreign markets through investments in these companies. There is no guarantee, however, that the fund will achieve its investment objective. Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 40% (or, if the"
"994","portfolio manager deems it warranted by market conditions, at least 30%) of its total assets in foreign securities. The fund may invest up to 100% of its total assets in foreign securities. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will allocate its"
"995","assets among at least three different countries (one of which may be the United States). </P>"
