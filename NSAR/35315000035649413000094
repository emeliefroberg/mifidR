"1655","<P>To the Trustees of Fidelity Salem Street Trust and Shareholders of Fidelity"
"1656","Municipal Income 2015 Fund, Fidelity Municipal Income 2017 Fund, Fidelity"
"1657","Municipal Income 2019 Fund, Fidelity Municipal Income 2021 Fund and Fidelity"
"1658","Municipal Income 2023 Fund: </P>"
"1659","<P>In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Fidelity"
"1660","Municipal Income 2015 Fund, Fidelity Municipal Income 2017 Fund, Fidelity"
"1661","Municipal Income 2019 Fund, Fidelity Municipal Income 2021 Fund and Fidelity"
"1662","Municipal Income 2023 Fund (the Funds), each a fund of Fidelity Salem Street"
"1663","Trust, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2013 (period from April 23, 2012"
"1664","(commencement of operations) to June 30, 2013 for Fidelity Municipal Income 2023"
"1665","Fund), in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1666","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds&rsquo; internal control over"
"1667","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"1668","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"1669","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1670","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1671","Funds&rsquo; internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"1672","such opinion.</P>"
"1673","<P>The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1674","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1675","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1676","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund&rsquo;s internal control over"
"1677","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1678","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1679","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1680","accounting principles. A fund&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting"
"1681","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1682","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1683","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"1684","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1685","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1686","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"1687","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and"
"1688","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1689","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund&rsquo;s assets that could have"
"1690","a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
"1691","<P>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1692","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"1693","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1694","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"1695","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"
"1696","<P>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1697","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"1698","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1699","misstatements on a timely basis.&nbsp; A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1700","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1701","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a fund&rsquo;s"
"1702","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"1703","timely basis.</P>"
"1704","<P>Our consideration of the Funds&rsquo; internal control over financial reporting was"
"1705","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1706","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1707","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"1708","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds&rsquo;"
"1709","internal control over financial reporting and their operations, including"
"1710","controls for safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material weakness,"
"1711","as defined above, as of June 30, 2013.</P>"
"1712","<P>This report is intended solely for the information and use of management, the"
"1713","Trustees of Fidelity Salem Street Trust, including Fidelity Municipal Income"

"4510","research, statistical and investment activities.  The Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with"
"4511","the Fund, to buy, sell, lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment instruments on behalf"
"4512","of the Fund.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Fund are and shall at all times be subject to the control and"
"4513","direction of the Trust's Board of Trustees."
"4514","</P>"
"4515","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(b)	Management Services.  The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for the performance by its affiliates"
"4516","of) the management and administrative services necessary for the operation of the Trust.  The Adviser shall, subject to the"
"4517","supervision of the Board of Trustees, perform various services for the Fund, including but not limited to: (i) providing the"
"4518","Fund with office space, equipment and facilities (which may be its own) for maintaining its organization; (ii) on behalf of the"

"4531","Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Fund and at"
"4532","commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute"
"4533","a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms"
"4534","are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the Fund and/or the other accounts over which the"
"4535","Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such"
"4536","brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Fund which is in excess of the"
"4537","amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Adviser determines in"
"4538","good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"4539","responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Trust shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Fund to determine if the commissions"
"4540","paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Fund."

"4565","term of this Contract, interfere, in a material manner, with the Adviser's ability to meet all of its obligations with respect to"
"4566","rendering services to the Fund hereunder. In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of obligations or duties hereunder on the part of the Adviser, the Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Fund or to"
"4567","any shareholder of the Fund for any act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering services hereunder or for"
"4568","any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security or other investment instrument."

"4581","the Trust who are not parties to the Contract or interested persons of any such party, cast in person at a meeting called"
