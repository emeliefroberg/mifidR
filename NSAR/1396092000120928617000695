"1166"," Growth RMS Fund (the &#147;Funds&#148;), each a series of World Funds Trust, as"
"1167"," of and for the year ended September 30, 2017, in accordance with the standards of"
"1168"," the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1169"," Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1170"," securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1171"," expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"1172"," of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"1173"," of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express"
"1174"," no such opinion.</font></p>"
"1175","<p align=justify><font face=Arial size=2>The management of the Funds is responsible"
"1176"," for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1177"," In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required"
"1178"," to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund&#146;s internal"
"1179"," control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1180"," regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1181"," statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1182"," principles (GAAP). A fund&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1183"," those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"1184"," in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"1185"," of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1186"," recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"1187"," with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"1188"," accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"1189"," reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1190"," use or disposition of a fund&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on"
"1191"," the financial statements.</font></p>"
"1192","<p align=justify><font face=Arial size=2>Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1193"," control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"1194"," projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"1195"," the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"1196"," that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</font></p>"
"1197","<p align=justify><font face=Arial size=2>A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1198"," reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"1199"," or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"1200"," or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1201"," or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1202"," that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds&#146; annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on"
"1203"," a timely basis.</font></p>"
"1204","<p align=justify><font face=Arial size=2>Our consideration of the Funds&#146; internal"
"1205"," control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1206"," paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"1207"," that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1208"," Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"1209"," the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"1210"," controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness"
"1211"," as defined above as of September 30, 2017.</font></p>"
