"568","<DESCRIPTION>INTERNAL CONTROL LETTER"
"569","<TEXT>"
"570","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"571","To the Board of Trustees of the Mutual Fund Series Trust and"
"572","the Shareholders of the Day Hagan Tactical Allocation Fund of ETFs"
"573","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"574","of the Day Hagan Tactical Allocation Fund of ETFs (the Fund),"
"575"," a series of shares of beneficial interest of the Mutual Fund Series"
"576","Trust , as of and for the year ended June 30, 2012, in accordance"
"577","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"578"," (United States), we considered its internal control over financial"
"579","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"580","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"581","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"582","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"583","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"584","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such"
"585","opinion."
"586","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"587","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"588","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"589","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"590","benefits and related costs of controls.  A companys internal"
"591","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"592","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"593","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"594","for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles"
"595"," generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP)."
"596"," A companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"597","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"598"," of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"599","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"600","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"601"," recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial"
"602","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"603","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"604","with authorizations of management and trustees of the company;"
"605","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"606","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"607","of the companys assets that could have a material effect on"
"608","the financial statements."
"609","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"610","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"611"," Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"612","future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"613","become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that"
"614","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"615","deteriorate.  A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"616","reporting exists when the design or operation of a control"
"617","does not allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"618","of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"619","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"620","deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"621","over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"622","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds annual"
"623","or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"624","on a timely basis."
"625","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"626","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"627","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"628","in internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"629","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"630","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the internal"
"631","control over financial reporting and its operations, including controls"
"632","over safeguarding securities that we consider to be material weaknesses,"
"633","as defined above, as of June 30, 2012."
"634","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management,"
"635"," the shareholders of the Day Hagan Tactical Allocation Fund of ETFs"
"636","and the Board of Trustees of the Mutual Fund Series Trust, and the"
"637","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"638","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."
