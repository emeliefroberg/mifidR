"5608","File number 811-8764"
"5609","SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT"
"5610","Agreement dated as of March 23, 2011 between UBS Global Asset"
"5611","Management (Americas) Inc. (UBS Global AM), a Delaware corporation,"
"5612","and William Blair & Company L.L.C. (Sub- Adviser), a Delaware"
"5613","Limited Liability Company (the Agreement)."
"5614","RECITALS"
"5615","(1)	UBS Global AM has entered into a Management Agreement dated as"
"5616","of August 1, 2008  (Management Agreement), with PACE(r) Select"
"5617","Advisors Trust (Trust), an open-end"
"5618"," management investment company registered under the Investment"
"5619","Company Act of 1940, as amended (1940 Act), with respect to PACE(r)"
"5620","International Emerging Markets Equity Investments  (Portfolio); and"
"5621","(2) 	UBS Global AM is authorized to retain one or more sub-advisers"
"5622","to furnish certain investment advisory services to UBS Global AM and"
"5623","the Portfolio;"
"5624","(3)	UBS Global AM desires to retain the Sub-Adviser to furnish"
"5625","certain investment advisory services to UBS Global AM and the"
"5626","Portfolio or a designated portion of the assets (Segment) of"
"5627"," the Portfolio; and"
"5628","(4)	The Sub-Adviser is willing to furnish such services;"
"5629","Now therefore, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants"
"5630","herein contained, UBS"
"5631","Global AM and the Sub-Adviser agree as follows:"
"5632","1.	Appointment.  UBS Global AM hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser as"
"5633","an investment sub-adviser with respect to the Portfolio or Segment"
"5634","for the period and on the terms set forth in this Agreement. The Sub-"
"5635","Adviser accepts that appointment and agrees to render the services"
"5636","herein"
"5637","set forth, for the compensation herein provided."
"5638","2.	Duties as Sub-Adviser."
"5639","(a)	Subject to the supervision and direction of the Trust's Board"
"5640","of Trustees (the Board) and review by UBS Global AM, and any"
"5641","written guidelines adopted by the Board or UBS Global AM the Sub-"
"5642","Adviser will provide a continuous investment program for the"
"5643","Portfolio or Segment, including investment research and discretionary"
"5644","management with respect to all securities and investments"
"5645","and cash equivalents in the Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-Adviser"
"5646","will determine from time to"
"5647","time what investments will be purchased, retained or sold by the"
"5648","Portfolio or Segment.  The Sub-Adviser will be responsible for"
"5649","placing purchase and sell orders for investments and for other"
"5650","related transactions for the Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-Adviser"
"5651","understands that the Portfolio's assets need to be managed so as to"
"5652","permit the Portfolio to qualify or to continue to qualify as a"
"5653","regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal"
"5654","Revenue Code, as amended (Code).  The Sub-Adviser will provide"
"5655","services under this Agreement in accordance with the Portfolio's"
"5656","investment objective, policies and restrictions as stated in the"
"5657","Trust's currently effective registration statement under the 1940"
"5658","Act, and any amendments or supplements thereto (Registration
Statement).  The Sub-Adviser, on each business day, shall provide"
"5659","UBS Global AM and the Trust's custodian such information as UBS Global"
"5660","AM and the Trust's custodian may reasonably request relating to all"
"5661","transactions concerning the Portfolio or Segment."
"5662","UBS Global AM hereby designates and appoints the Sub-Adviser as its"
"5663","and the Portfolio's limited purpose agent and attorney-in-fact,"
"5664","without further prior approval of UBS Global AM (except as expressly"
"5665","provided for herein or as may be required by law) to make and"
"5666","execute, in the name and on behalf of the Portfolio, all agreements,"
"5667","instruments and other documents and to take all such other action"
"5668","which the Sub-Adviser considers necessary or advisable to carry out"
"5669","its duties hereunder. By way of example and not by way of limitation,"
"5670","in connection with any purchase for the  Portfolio or Segment of"
"5671","securities or instruments that are not registered under the U.S."
"5672","Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), the Sub-"
"5673","Adviser shall have the full power and authority, among other things,"
"5674","to: (i) commit to purchase such securities for the Portfolio on the"
"5675","terms and conditions under which such securities are offered; (ii)"
"5676","execute such account opening and other agreements, instruments and"
"5677","documents (including, without limitation, purchase agreements,"
"5678","subscription documents, ISDA and other swap and derivative"
"5679","documents), and make such commitments, as may be required in"
"5680","connection with the purchase and sale of such securities or"
"5681","instruments; (iii) represent that the Portfolio is an accredited
investor as defined in Rule 501 (a) of Regulation D under the"
"5682","Securities Act and a Qualified Institutional Buyer as defined in"
"5683","Rule 144A (a) (1) (i) under the Securities Act; and (iv) commit that"
"5684","such securities will not be offered or sold by the Portfolio except"
"5685","in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities"
"5686","Act or an exemption therefrom. This power-of-attorney is a continuing"
"5687","power-of-attorney and shall remain in full force and effect until"
"5688","revoked by UBS Global AM or the Trust in writing, but any such"
"5689","revocation shall not affect any transaction initiated prior to"
"5690","receipt by the Sub-Adviser of such notice."
"5691","(b)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not consult with any other"
"5692","sub-adviser (Other Sub-Adviser) for the Trust or Portfolio"
"5693","concerning any transaction by the Portfolio or Segment in securities"
"5694","or other assets, including (i) the purchase by the Portfolio or"
"5695","Segment of a security issued by the Other Sub-Adviser, or an"
"5696","affiliate of the Other Sub-Adviser, to the Trust or Portfolio except"
"5697","as permitted by the 1940 Act or (ii) transactions by the Portfolio or"
"5698","Segment in any security for which the Other Sub-Adviser, or its"
"5699","affiliate, is the principal underwriter."
"5700","(c)	Unless otherwise instructed by UBS Global AM or the Trust, the"
"5701","Sub-Adviser agrees that it will be responsible for voting proxies of"
"5702","issuers of securities held by the Portfolio or Segment.  The Sub-"
"5703","Adviser further agrees that it will adopt written proxy voting"
"5704","procedures that shall comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act"
"5705","and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (Advisers Act)"
"5706","(Proxy Voting Policy), and that shall be acceptable to the Board."
"5707","The Sub-Adviser shall also provide its Proxy Voting Policy, and if"
"5708","requested by UBS Global AM, a summary of such Proxy Voting Policy for"
"5709","inclusion in the Trust's registration statement, and will provide UBS"
"5710","Global AM with any material amendment to the Proxy Voting Policy"
"5711","within a reasonable time after such amendment has taken effect.  The"
"5712","Sub-Adviser further agrees that it will provide the Board on or"
"5713","before August 1st of each year, or more frequently as the Board may"
"5714","reasonably request, with a written report of the proxies voted during"
"5715","the most recent 12-month period ending June 30, or such other period"
"5716","as the Board may designate, in a format that shall comply with the"
"5717","1940 Act and that shall be acceptable to the Board."
"5718","(d) The Sub-Adviser agrees that upon the request of UBS Global AM or"
"5719","the Board, Sub-Adviser shall exercise the rights incident to the"
"5720","securities held by the Portfolio or Segment in the context of a"
"5721","bankruptcy or other reorganization.  The Sub-Adviser further agrees"
"5722","that it will keep UBS Global AM fully informed about any such actions"
"5723","that it intends to take."
"5724","(e)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will place orders with brokers"
"5725","in accordance with best execution policies, taking into account best"
"5726","price as an important factor in this decision, provided that, on"
"5727","behalf of the Portfolio or Segment, the Sub-Adviser may, in its"
"5728","discretion, use brokers that provide the Sub-Adviser with research,"
"5729","analysis, advice and similar services to execute portfolio"
"5730","transactions on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment, and the Sub-"
"5731","Adviser may pay to those brokers in return for brokerage and research"
"5732","services a higher commission than may be charged by other brokers,"
"5733","subject to the Sub-Adviser's determination in good faith that such"
"5734","commission is reasonable in terms either of the particular"
"5735","transaction or of the overall responsibility of the Sub-Adviser to"
"5736","the Portfolio or Segment and its other clients and that the total"
"5737","commissions paid by the Portfolio or Segment will be reasonable in"
"5738","relation to the benefits to the Portfolio or Segment over the long"
"5739","term.  In no instance will portfolio securities be purchased from or"
"5740","sold to UBS Global AM or the Sub-Adviser, the Trust's principal"
"5741","underwriter, or any affiliated person thereof, except in accordance"
"5742","with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations"
"5743","thereunder.  The Sub-Adviser may aggregate sales and purchase orders"
"5744","with respect to the assets of the Portfolio or Segment with similar"
"5745","orders being made simultaneously for other accounts advised by the"
"5746","Sub-Adviser or its affiliates.  Whenever the Sub-Adviser"
"5747","simultaneously places orders to purchase or sell the same security on"
"5748","behalf of the Portfolio or Segment and one or more other accounts"
"5749","advised by the Sub-Adviser, the orders will be allocated as to price"
"5750","and amount among all such accounts in a manner believed to be"
"5751","equitable over time to each account.  UBS Global AM recognizes that"
"5752","in some cases this procedure may adversely affect the results"
"5753","obtained for the Portfolio or Segment."
"5754","Subject to the Sub-Adviser's obligations to seek best execution, UBS"
"5755","Global AM agrees that the Sub-Adviser, in its sole discretion, may"
"5756","place transactions on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment and the"
"5757","Trust with any broker-dealer deemed to be an affiliate (including"
"5758","affiliated FCMs) of the Sub-Adviser (the Affiliated Broker-Dealers)"
"5759","so long as such transactions are effected in conformity with the"
"5760","requirements (including any applicable exemptions and administrative"
"5761","interpretations set forth in Part II of the Sub-Adviser's Form ADV"
"5762","Registration Statement on file with the Securities and Exchange"
"5763","Commission (Form ADV)) of Section 11(a)(1)(H) of the Securities"
"5764","Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act), and in compliance with Rules"
"5765","17e-1 or 10f-3 under the 1940 Act or other applicable rules and the"
"5766","Trust's policies and procedures thereunder.  In all such dealings,"
"5767","the Affiliated Broker-Dealers shall be authorized and entitled to"
"5768","retain any commissions, remuneration or profits which may be made in"
"5769","such transactions and shall not be liable to account for the same to"
"5770","UBS Global AM, the Portfolio or the Trust.  In the event Sub-Adviser"
"5771","becomes affiliated (as deemed under the federal securities laws) with"
"5772","a broker-dealer during the term of this Agreement, Sub-Adviser shall"
"5773","obtain the approval of the Trust's Board of Trustees prior to"
"5774","commencement of transactions with such broker-dealer on behalf of the"
"5775","Portfolio or the Trust."
"5776","UBS Global AM further authorizes the Sub-Adviser and its Affiliated"
"5777","Broker-Dealers to execute agency cross transactions (the Cross
Transactions) on behalf of the Portfolio and the Trust. Cross"
"5778","Transactions are transactions which may be effected by the Affiliated"
"5779","Broker-Dealers acting for both the Portfolio or the Trust and the"
"5780","counterparty to the transaction.  Cross Transactions enable the Sub-"
"5781","Adviser to purchase or sell a block of securities for the Portfolio"
"5782","or the Trust at a set price and possibly avoid an unfavorable price"
"5783","movement that may be created through entrance into the market with"
"5784","such purchase or sale order.  As such, the Sub-Adviser believes that"
"5785","Cross Transactions can provide meaningful benefits for the Portfolio"
"5786","and the Trust and its clients generally.  UBS Global AM, the"
"5787","Portfolio and the Trust should be aware, however, that in a Cross"
"5788","Transaction an Affiliated Broker-Dealer will be receiving commissions"
"5789","from both sides of the trade and, therefore, there is a potentially"
"5790","conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities.  Sub-Adviser"
"5791","shall effect such Cross Transactions in compliance with Rule 206(3)-2"
"5792","under the Advisers Act, Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act, and any other"
"5793","applicable provisions of the federal securities laws and shall"
"5794","provide UBS Global AM with periodic reports describing such agency"
"5795","cross transactions.  UBS Global AM understands that the authority of"
"5796","the Sub-Adviser to execute agency Cross Transactions for the"
"5797","Portfolio is terminable at will without penalty, effective upon"
"5798","receipt by the Sub-Adviser of written notice from UBS Global AM, and"
"5799","that the failure to terminate such authorization will result in its"
"5800","continuation."
"5801","(f)	The Sub-Adviser shall maintain separate detailed records of all"
"5802","matters pertaining to the Portfolio or Segment, including, without"
"5803","limitation, brokerage and other records of all securities"
"5804","transactions.  Any records required to be maintained and preserved"
"5805","pursuant to the provisions of Rule 31a-1 and Rule 31a-2 promulgated"
"5806","under the 1940 Act that are prepared or maintained by the Sub-Adviser"
"5807","on behalf of the Trust are the property of the Trust and will be"
"5808","surrendered promptly to the Trust upon request. The Sub-Adviser"
"5809","further agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed in"
"5810","Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the records required to be maintained"
"5811","under Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and will furnish the Board and"
"5812","UBS Global AM with such periodic and special reports as the Board or"
"5813","UBS Global AM may request."
"5814","(g)	At such times as shall be reasonably requested by the Board or"
"5815","UBS Global AM, the Sub-Adviser will provide the Board and UBS Global"
"5816","AM with economic and investment analyses and reports as well as"
"5817","quarterly reports setting forth the performance of the Portfolio or"
"5818","Segment and make available to the Board and UBS Global AM any"
"5819","economic, statistical and investment services that the Sub-Adviser"
"5820","normally makes available to its institutional or other customers."
"5821","(h)	In accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, as amended"
"5822","from time to time, the Sub-Adviser is responsible for assisting the"
"5823","Board and UBS Global AM in the fair valuation of all portfolio"
"5824","securities in the Portfolio or Segment and will use its reasonable"
"5825","efforts to arrange for the provision of a price or prices from one or"
"5826","more parties independent of the Sub-Adviser for each portfolio"
"5827","security for which the custodian does not obtain prices in the"
"5828","ordinary course of business from an automated pricing service."
"5829","The Sub-Adviser also will provide such information or perform such"
"5830","additional acts as are customarily performed by a Sub-Adviser and may"
"5831","be required for the Trust or UBS Global AM to comply with their"
"5832","respective obligations under applicable federal securities laws,"
"5833","including, without limitation, the"
"5834","1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the 1934 Act, the Securities Act, and any"
"5835","rule or regulation thereunder."
"5836","3.	Further Duties.  In all matters relating to the performance of"
"5837","this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will seek to act in conformity with"
"5838","the Trust's Trust Instrument, By-Laws and Registration Statement, the"
"5839","Trust's policies and procedures for compliance by the Trust with the"
"5840","Federal Securities Laws (as that term is defined in Rule 38a-1 under"
"5841","the 1940 Act) provided to the Sub-Adviser (together, the Trust
Compliance Procedures) and with the written instructions and written"
"5842","directions of the Board and UBS Global AM, and will comply with the"
"5843","requirements of the 1940 Act, and the Advisers Act, and the rules"
"5844","under each, the Code, and all other federal and state laws and"
"5845","regulations applicable to the Trust and the Portfolio. UBS Global AM"
"5846","agrees to provide to the Sub-Adviser copies of the Trust's Trust"
"5847","Instrument, By-Laws, Registration Statement, Trust's Compliance"
"5848","Procedures, written instructions and directions of the Board and UBS"
"5849","Global AM, and any amendments or supplements to any of these"
"5850","materials as soon as practicable after such materials become"
"5851","available.  UBS Global AM further agrees to identify to the Sub-"
"5852","Adviser in writing any broker-dealers that are affiliated with UBS"
"5853","Global AM (other than UBS Financial Services Inc. and UBS Global"
"5854","Asset Management (US) Inc.)."
"5855","In order to assist the Trust and the Trust's Chief Compliance Officer"
"5856","(the Trust CCO) to satisfy the requirements contained in Rule 38a-1"
"5857","under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Adviser shall provide to the Trust CCO:"
"5858","(i) direct access to the Sub-Adviser's chief compliance officer"
"5859","and/or other senior compliance personnel, as reasonably requested by"
"5860","the Trust CCO; (ii) quarterly reports confirming that the Sub-Adviser"
"5861","has complied with the Trust Compliance Procedures in managing the"
"5862","Portfolio or Segment; and (iii) quarterly certifications that there"
"5863","were no Material Compliance Matters (as that term is defined by"
"5864","Rule 38a-1(e)(2)) that arose under the Trust Compliance Procedures"
"5865","that related to the Sub-Adviser's management of the Portfolio or Segment."
"5866","The Sub-Adviser shall promptly provide the Trust CCO with copies of:"
"5867","(i) the Sub-Adviser's policies and procedures for compliance by the"
"5868","Sub-Adviser with the Federal Securities Laws (together, the Sub-
Adviser Compliance Procedures), and (ii) any material changes to the"
"5869","Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures.  The Sub-Adviser shall cooperate"
"5870","fully with the Trust CCO so as to facilitate the Trust CCO's"
"5871","performance of the Trust CCO's responsibilities under Rule 38a-1 to"
"5872","review, evaluate and report to the Trust's Board on the operation of"
"5873","the Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures, and shall promptly report to"
"5874","the Trust CCO any Material Compliance Matter arising under the Sub-"
"5875","Adviser Compliance Procedures involving the Portfolio or Segment."
"5876","The Sub-Adviser shall provide to the Trust CCO:  (i) quarterly"
"5877","reports confirming the Sub-Adviser's compliance with the Sub-Adviser"
"5878","Compliance Procedures in managing the Portfolio or Segment, and (ii)"
"5879","certifications that there were no Material Compliance Matters"
"5880","involving the Sub-Adviser that arose under the Sub-Adviser Compliance"
"5881","Procedures that affected the Portfolio or Segment.  At least"
"5882","annually, the Sub-Adviser shall provide a certification to the Trust"
"5883","CCO to the effect that the Sub-Adviser has in place and has"
"5884","implemented policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to"
"5885","ensure compliance by the Sub-Adviser with any applicable Federal"
"5886","Securities Laws, subject to such interpretations as may be contained"
"5887","in the Trust Compliance Procedures."
"5888","The Sub-Adviser will promptly provide UBS Global AM with information"
"5889","(including information that is required to be disclosed in the"
"5890","Trust's registration statement) with respect to the portfolio"
"5891","managers responsible for the Portfolio or Segment and any changes in"
"5892","the portfolio managers responsible for the Portfolio or Segment."
"5893","The Sub-Adviser will promptly notify UBS Global AM of any pending"
"5894","investigation, material litigation, administrative proceeding or any"
"5895","other significant regulatory inquiry."
"5896","The Sub-Adviser will cooperate promptly and fully with UBS Global AM"
"5897","and/or the Trust in responding to any regulatory or compliance"
"5898","examinations or inspections (including information requests) relating"
"5899","to the Trust, the Portfolio or UBS Global AM brought by any"
"5900","governmental or regulatory authorities having appropriate"
"5901","jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, the Securities and"
"5902","Exchange Commission (SEC))."
"5903","4.	Expenses.  During the term of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser"
"5904","will bear all expenses incurred by it in connection with its services"
"5905","under this Agreement.  The Sub-Adviser shall not be responsible for"
"5906","any expenses incurred by the Trust, the Portfolio or UBS Global AM,"
"5907","except as otherwise specifically provided herein."
"5908","Upon request by UBS Global AM, Sub-Adviser agrees to reimburse UBS"
"5909","Global AM or the Trust for costs associated with generating and"
"5910","distributing any Registration Statement (as defined herein)  for when"
"5911","the Sub-Adviser is given a copy of a draft of such Registration"
"5912","Statement and fails to promptly disclose to UBS Global AM facts then"
"5913","known to the Sub-Adviser or its personnel that would require"
"5914","disclosure (or amendments to disclosure) in the Fund's Registration"
"5915","Statement in time for such disclosure or amendments to disclosure to"
"5916","be included in such Registration Statement.  The Sub-Adviser shall"
"5917","bear all reasonable expenses of the Trust, if any, arising out of an"
"5918","assignment or change in control of the Sub-Adviser."
"5919","5.	Compensation."
"5920","(a)	For the services provided and the expenses assumed by the Sub-"
"5921","Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, UBS Global AM, not the Portfolio,"
"5922","will pay to the Sub-Adviser a fee, computed daily and payable"
"5923","monthly, at an annual rate of 0.60% on the first $100 million, and"
"5924","0.55% on assets in excess of $100 million of the average daily net"
"5925","assets of the Portfolio or Segment allocated to its management"
"5926","(computed in the manner specified in the Management Agreement), and"
"5927","will provide the Sub-Adviser with a schedule showing the manner in"
"5928","which the fee was computed.  If the Sub-Adviser is managing a"
"5929","Segment, its fees will be based on the value of the assets of the"
"5930","Portfolio within the Sub-Adviser's Segment."
"5931","(b)	The fee shall be accrued daily and payable monthly to the Sub-"
"5932","Adviser on or before the last business day of the next succeeding"
"5933","calendar month."
"5934","(c)	For those periods in which UBS Global AM has agreed to waive"
"5935","all or a portion of its management fee, UBS Global AM may ask the"
"5936","Sub-Adviser to waive the same proportion of its fees, but the Sub-"
"5937","Adviser is under no obligation to do so."
"5938","(d)	If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates before the"
"5939","end of any month, the fee for the period from the effective date to"
"5940","the end of the month or from the beginning of such month to the date"
"5941","of termination, as the case may be, shall be pro-rated according to"
"5942","the proportion which such period bears to the full month in that such"
"5943","effectiveness or termination occurs."
"5944","6. Limitation of Liability."
"5945","(a) 	The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any error of judgment"
"5946","or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Portfolio, the"
"5947","Trust or its shareholders or by UBS Global AM in connection with the"
"5948","matters to which this Agreement relates, except a loss resulting from"
"5949","willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the"
"5950","performance of its duties or from reckless disregard by it of its"
"5951","obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"5952","(b)	In no event will the Sub-Adviser have any responsibility for"
"5953","any other portfolio of the Trust, for any portion of the Portfolio"
"5954","not managed by the Sub-Adviser or for the acts or omissions of any"
"5955","Other Sub-Adviser to the Trust or Portfolio. In particular, in the"
"5956","event the Sub-Adviser shall manage only a Segment of the Portfolio,"
"5957","the Sub-Adviser shall have no responsibility for the Portfolio's"
"5958","being in violation of any applicable law or regulation or investment"
"5959","policy or restriction applicable to the Portfolio as a whole or for"
"5960","the Portfolio's failing to qualify as a regulated investment company"
"5961","under the Code, if the securities and other holdings of the Segment"
"5962","of the Portfolio managed by the"
"5963","Sub-Adviser are such that such Segment would not be in such violation"
"5964","or fail to so qualify if such Segment were deemed a separate series"
"5965","of the Trust or a separate regulated investment company under the"
"5966","Code, unless such violation was due to the Sub-Advisers failure to"
"5967","comply with written guidelines adopted by the Board or UBS Global AM"
"5968","and provided to the Sub-Adviser."
"5969","Nothing in this section shall be deemed a limitation or waiver of any"
"5970","obligation or duty that may not by law be limited or waived."
"5971","7.	Representations of Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser represents,"
"5972","warrants and agrees as follows:"
"5973","(a)	The Sub-Adviser (i) is registered as an investment adviser"
"5974","under the Advisers Act and will continue to be so registered for so"
"5975","long as this Agreement remains in effect; (ii) is not prohibited by"
"5976","the 1940 Act or the Advisers Act from performing the services"
"5977","contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) has met, and will seek to"

"5981","self-regulatory agency, necessary to be met in order to perform the"
"5982","services contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) has the authority to"
"5983","enter into and perform the services contemplated by this Agreement;"
"5984","and (v) will promptly notify UBS Global AM of the occurrence of any"
"5985","event that would disqualify the Sub-Adviser from serving as an"
"5986","investment adviser of an investment company pursuant to Section 9(a)"
"5987","of the 1940 Act or otherwise."
"5988","(b)	The Sub-Adviser has adopted a written code of ethics complying"
"5989","with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-"
"5990","1 under the Advisers Act and will provide UBS Global AM and the Board"
"5991","with a copy of such code of ethics, together with evidence of its"
"5992","adoption. Within fifteen days of the end of the last calendar quarter"
"5993","of each year that this Agreement is in effect, a duly authorized"
"5994","officer of the Sub-Adviser shall certify to UBS Global AM that the"
"5995","Sub-Adviser has complied with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 during"
"5996","the previous year and that there has been no material violation of"
"5997","the Sub-Adviser's code of ethics or, if such a violation has"
"5998","occurred, that appropriate action was taken in response to such"
"5999","violation. Upon the written request of UBS Global AM, the Sub-Adviser"
"6000","shall permit UBS Global AM, its employees or its agents to examine"
"6001","the reports required to be made by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to Rule"
"6002","17j-1(c)(1) and all other records relevant to the Sub-Adviser's code"
"6003","of ethics."
"6004","(c)	The Sub-Adviser has provided UBS Global AM with a copy of its"
"6005","Form ADV, as most recently filed with the SEC, and promptly will"
"6006","furnish a copy of all amendments to UBS Global AM at least annually."
"6007","(d)	The Sub-Adviser will notify UBS Global AM of any change of"
"6008","control of the Sub-Adviser, including any change of its general"
"6009","partners or 25% shareholders or 25% limited partners, as applicable,"
"6010","and any changes in the key personnel who are either the portfolio"
"6011","manager(s) of the Portfolio or senior management of the Sub-Adviser,"
"6012","in each case prior to or as soon after such change as possible."
"6013","(e)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that neither it nor any of its"
"6014","affiliates, will in any way refer directly or indirectly to its"
"6015","relationship with the Trust, the Portfolio, UBS Global AM or any of"
"6016","their respective affiliates in offering, marketing or other"
"6017","promotional materials without the express written consent of UBS"
"6018","Global AM."
"6019","(f)	The Sub-Adviser hereby represents that it has implemented"
"6020","policies and procedures that will prevent the disclosure by it, its"
"6021","employees or its agents of the Trust's portfolio holdings to any"
"6022","person or entity other than UBS Global AM, the Trust's custodian, or"
"6023","other persons expressly designated by UBS Global AM.  The Sub-Adviser"
"6024","further represents that it implemented policies and procedures to"
"6025","prevent it, its employees and agents from trading on the basis of any"
"6026","material non-public information provided by UBS Global AM, the Trust,"
"6027","their affiliates or agents."
"6028","8.	Services Not Exclusive. The services furnished by the Sub-"
"6029","Adviser hereunder are not to be deemed exclusive, and except as the"
"6030","Sub-Adviser may otherwise agree in writing, the Sub-Adviser shall be"
"6031","free to furnish similar services to others so long as its services"
"6032","under this Agreement are not impaired thereby.  Nothing in this"
"6033","Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any director, officer"
"6034","or employee of the Sub-Adviser, who may also be a trustee, officer or"
"6035","employee of the Trust, to engage in any other business or to devote"
"6036","his or her time and attention in part to the management or other"
"6037","aspects of any other business, whether of a similar nature or a"
"6038","dissimilar nature."
"6039","9.	Duration and Termination."
"6040","(a)	This Agreement shall become effective upon the date first above"
"6041","written, provided that this Agreement shall not take effect unless it"
"6042","has first been approved (i) by a vote of a majority of those trustees"
"6043","of the Trust who are not parties to this Agreement or interested"
"6044","persons of any such party (Independent Trustees), cast in person at"
"6045","a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval, and (ii)"
"6046","by vote of a majority of the Portfolio's outstanding voting"
"6047","securities, unless UBS Global AM has authority to enter into this"
"6048","Agreement pursuant to exemptive relief from the SEC without a vote of"
"6049","the Portfolio's outstanding voting securities."
"6050","(b)	Unless sooner terminated as provided herein, this Agreement"
"6051","shall continue in effect for two years from its effective date."
"6052","Thereafter, if not terminated, this Agreement shall continue"
"6053","automatically for successive periods of twelve months each, provided"
"6054","that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually (i)"
"6055","by a vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees,"
"6056","cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such"
"6057","approval, and (ii) by the Board or by vote of a majority of the"
"6058","outstanding voting securities of the Portfolio."
"6059","(c)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated"
"6060","at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by vote of the Board"
"6061","or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of"
"6062","the Portfolio on 30 days written notice to the Sub-Adviser. This"
"6063","Agreement may also be terminated, without the payment of any penalty,"
"6064","by UBS Global AM; (i) upon 120 days written notice to the Sub-"
"6065","Adviser; (ii) upon material breach by the Sub-Adviser of any of the"
"6066","representations, warranties and agreements set forth in Paragraph 7"
"6067","of this Agreement; or (iii) immediately if, in the reasonable"
"6068","judgment of UBS Global AM, the Sub-Adviser becomes unable to"
"6069","discharge its duties and obligations under this Agreement, including"
"6070","circumstances such as financial insolvency of the Sub- Adviser or"
"6071","other circumstances that could adversely affect the Portfolio.  The"
"6072","Sub-Adviser may terminate this Agreement at any time, without the"
"6073","payment of any penalty, on 120 days written notice to UBS Global AM."
"6074","This Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of its"
"6075","assignment or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement,"
"6076","as it relates to this Portfolio."
"6077","10.	Amendment of this Agreement.  No provision of this Agreement"
"6078","may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, but only by"
"6079","an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement"
"6080","of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought.  To the"
"6081","extent required by applicable law, no amendment of this Agreement"
"6082","shall be effective until approved (i) by a vote of a majority of the"
"6083","Independent Trustees, and (ii) if the terms of this Agreement shall"
"6084","have changed, by a vote of a majority of the Portfolio's outstanding"
"6085","voting securities (except in the case of (ii), pursuant to the terms"
"6086","and conditions of the SEC order permitting it to modify the Agreement"
"6087","without such vote)."
"6088","11.	Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be construed in accordance"
"6089","with the 1940 Act and the laws of the State of New York, without"
"6090","giving effect to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. To the"
"6091","extent that the applicable laws of the State of New York conflict"
"6092","with the applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, the latter shall"
"6093","control."
"6094","12.	Confidentiality.  The Sub-Adviser will treat as proprietary and"
"6095","confidential any information obtained in connection with its duties"
"6096","hereunder, including all records and information pertaining to the"
"6097","Portfolio and its prior, present or potential shareholders.  The Sub-"
"6098","Adviser will not use such information for any purpose other than the"
"6099","performance of its responsibilities and duties hereunder. Such"
"6100","information may not be disclosed except after prior notification to"
"6101","and approval in writing by the Portfolio or if such disclosure is"
"6102","expressly required or requested by applicable federal or state or"
"6103","other regulatory authorities."
"6104","13.	Use of Name."
"6105","(a)  It is understood that the names UBS and PACE or any derivative"
"6106","thereof or logo associated with that name is the valuable property of"
"6107","UBS Global AM and/or its affiliates, and that Sub-Adviser has the"
"6108","right to use such name (or derivative or logo) only with the approval"
"6109","of UBS Global AM and only so long as UBS Global AM is Manager to the"
"6110","Trust and/or the Portfolio."
"6111","(b)  It is understood that the name William Blair & Company L.L.C. or"
"6112","any derivative thereof or logo associated with those names, are the"
"6113","valuable property of the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates and that the"
"6114","Trust and/or the Portfolio have the right to use such names (or"
"6115","derivative or logo) in offering materials of the Trust with the"
"6116","approval of the Sub-Adviser and for so long as the Sub-Adviser is a"
"6117","Sub-Adviser to the Portfolio.  Upon termination of this Agreement,"
"6118","the Trust shall forthwith cease to use such names (or derivatives or"
"6119","logo)."
"6120","14.	Miscellaneous.  The captions in this Agreement are included for"
"6121","convenience of reference only and in no way define or delimit any of"
"6122","the provisions hereof or otherwise affect their construction or"
"6123","effect. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or made"
"6124","invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or otherwise, the"
"6125","remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. This"
"6126","Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the"
"6127","parties hereto and their respective successors. As used in this"
"6128","Agreement, the terms majority of the outstanding voting securities,"
"6129","affiliated person, interested person, assignment, broker, investment"
"6130","adviser, net assets, sale, sell and security shall have the same"
"6131","meanings as such terms have in the 1940 Act, subject to such"
"6132","exemption as may be granted by the SEC by any rule, regulation or"
"6133","order. Where the effect of a requirement of the federal securities"
"6134","laws reflected in any provision of this Agreement is made less"
"6135","restrictive by a rule, regulation or order of the SEC, whether of"
"6136","special or general application, such provision shall be deemed to"
"6137","incorporate the effect of such rule, regulation or order.  This"
"6138","Agreement may be signed in counterpart."
"6139","15.	Notices.  Any notice herein required is to be in writing and is"
"6140","deemed to have been given to the Sub-Adviser or UBS Global AM upon"
"6141","receipt of the same at their respective addresses set forth below."
"6142","All written notices required or permitted to be given under this"

"6170","File number 811-8764"
"6171","INTERIM SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT"
"6172","Interim agreement made as of June 12, 2011 between UBS GLOBAL ASSET"
"6173","MANAGEMENT (AMERICAS) INC. (UBS Global Americas), a Delaware"
"6174","corporation, and MONDRIAN INVESTMENT PARTNERS LIMITED (Sub-
Adviser), a limited company organized under the laws of the United"
"6175","Kingdom (the Agreement)."
"6176","RECITALS"
"6177","(1) UBS Global Americas has entered into a Management"
"6178","Agreement dated as of August 1, 2008 (Management Agreement) with"
"6179","PACE Select Advisors Trust, an open-end management investment company"
"6180","registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended"
"6181","(1940 Act), with respect to PACE International Equity Investments"
"6182","(Portfolio);"
"6183","(2) UBS Global Americas has been notified by the Sub-Adviser"
"6184","that a transaction will occur on or about July 12, 2011 which will"
"6185","result in an assignment of the prior agreement between the parties"
"6186","and will thus terminate the prior agreement;"
"6187","(3) UBS Global Americas desires to continue to retain the"
"6188","Sub-Adviser to furnish certain investment advisory services to UBS"
"6189","Global Americas and the Portfolio or a designated portion of the"
"6190","assets (Segment) of the Portfolio; and"
"6191","(4) The Sub-Adviser is willing to continue to furnish such services;"
"6192","NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual"
"6193","covenants herein contained, UBS Global Americas and the Sub-Adviser"
"6194","agree as follows:"
"6195","1. APPOINTMENT. Effective as of the assignment referred to"
"6196","above, UBS Global Americas hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser as an"
"6197","investment sub-adviser with respect to the Portfolio or Segment for"
"6198","the period and on the terms set forth in this Agreement. The Sub-"
"6199","Adviser accepts that appointment and agrees to render the services"
"6200","herein set forth, for the compensation herein provided."
"6201","2. DUTIES AS SUB-ADVISER."
"6202","(a) Subject to the supervision and direction of the Trust's"
"6203","Board of Trustees (the Board) and review by UBS Global Americas,"
"6204","and any written guidelines adopted by the Board or UBS Global"
"6205","Americas, the Sub-Adviser will provide a continuous investment"
"6206","program for the Portfolio or Segment, including investment research"
"6207","and discretionary management with respect to all securities and"
"6208","investments and cash equivalents in the Portfolio or Segment. The"
"6209","Sub-Adviser will determine from time to time what investments will be"
"6210","purchased, retained or sold by the Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-"
"6211","Adviser will be responsible for placing purchase and sell orders for"
"6212","investments and for other related transactions for the Portfolio or"
"6213","Segment. The Sub-Adviser understands that the Portfolio's assets need"
"6214","to be managed so as to permit the Portfolio to qualify or to continue"
"6215","to qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of"
"6216","the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (Code). The Sub-Adviser will"
"6217","provide services under this Agreement in accordance with the"
"6218","Portfolio's investment objective, policies and restrictions as stated"
"6219","in the Trust's currently effective registration statement under the"
"6220","1940 Act, and any amendments or supplements thereto (Registration
Statement)."
"6221","(b) The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not consult with any"
"6222","other sub-adviser (Other Sub-Adviser) for the Trust or Portfolio"
"6223","concerning any transaction by the Portfolio or Segment in securities"
"6224","or other assets, including (i) the purchase by the Portfolio or"
"6225","Segment of a security issued by the Other Sub-Adviser, or an"
"6226","affiliate of the Other Sub-Adviser, to the Trust or Portfolio except"
"6227","as permitted by the 1940 Act or (ii) transactions by the Portfolio or"
"6228","Segment in any security for which the Other Sub-Adviser, or its"
"6229","affiliate, is the principal underwriter."
"6230","(c) The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will be responsible for"
"6231","voting proxies of issuers of securities held by the Portfolio or"
"6232","Segment. The Sub-Adviser further agrees that it will adopt written"
"6233","proxy voting procedures that shall comply with the requirements of"
"6234","the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended"
"6235","(Advisers Act), and that shall be acceptable to the Board. The Sub-"
"6236","Adviser further agrees that it will provide the Board on or before"
"6237","August 1st of each year, or more frequently as the Board may"
"6238","reasonably request, with a written report of the proxies voted during"
"6239","the most recent 12-month period ending June 30, or such other period"
"6240","as the Board may designate, in a format that shall comply with the"
"6241","1940 Act and that shall be acceptable to the Board."
"6242","(d) The Sub-Adviser agrees that, in placing orders with"
"6243","brokers, it will seek to obtain the best net result in terms of price"
"6244","and execution; provided that, on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment,"
"6245","the Sub-Adviser may, in its discretion, use brokers that provide the"
"6246","Sub-Adviser with research, analysis, advice and similar services to"
"6247","execute portfolio transactions on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment,"
"6248","and the Sub-Adviser may pay to those brokers in return for brokerage"
"6249","and research services a higher commission than may be charged by"
"6250","other brokers, subject to the Sub-Adviser's determination in good"
"6251","faith that such commission is reasonable in terms either of the"
"6252","particular transaction or of the overall responsibility of the Sub-"
"6253","Adviser to the Portfolio or Segment and its other clients and that"
"6254","the total commissions paid by the Portfolio or Segment will be"
"6255","reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio or Segment"
"6256","over the long term. In no instance will portfolio securities be"
"6257","purchased from or sold to UBS Global Americas or the Sub-Adviser, or"
"6258","any affiliated person thereof, except in accordance with the federal"
"6259","securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Sub-"
"6260","Adviser may aggregate sales and purchase orders with respect to the"
"6261","assets of the Portfolio or Segment with similar orders being made"
"6262","simultaneously for other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser or its"
"6263","affiliates. Whenever the Sub-Adviser simultaneously places orders to"
"6264","purchase or sell the same security on behalf of the Portfolio or"
"6265","Segment and one or more other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser,"
"6266","the orders will be allocated as to price and amount among all such"
"6267","accounts in a manner believed to be equitable over time to each"
"6268","account. UBS Global Americas recognizes that in some cases this"
"6269","procedure may adversely affect the results obtained for the Portfolio"
"6270","or Segment."
"6271","Subject to the Sub-Adviser's obligations to seek best"
"6272","execution, UBS Global Americas agrees that the Sub-Adviser, in its"
"6273","sole discretion, may place transactions on behalf of the Portfolio or"
"6274","Segment and the Trust with any broker-dealer deemed to be an"
"6275","affiliate of the Sub-Adviser (the Affiliated Broker-Dealers) so"
"6276","long as such transactions are effected in conformity with the"
"6277","requirements (including any applicable exemptions and administrative"
"6278","interpretations set forth in Part II of the Sub-Adviser's Form ADV"
"6279","Registration Statement on file with the Securities and Exchange"
"6280","Commission (Form ADV)) of Section 11(a)(1)(H) of the Securities"
"6281","Exchange Act of 1934. In all such dealings, the Affiliated Broker-"
"6282","Dealers shall be authorized and entitled to retain any commissions,"
"6283","remuneration or profits which may be made in such transactions and"
"6284","shall not be liable to account for the same to UBS Global Americas,"
"6285","the Series or the Trust."
"6286","UBS Global Americas further authorizes the Sub-Adviser and"
"6287","its Affiliated Broker-Dealers to execute agency cross transactions"
"6288","(the Cross Transactions) on behalf of the Series and the Trust."
"6289","Cross Transactions are transactions which may be effected by the"
"6290","Affiliated Broker-Dealers acting for both the Series or the Trust and"
"6291","the counterparty to the transaction. Cross Transactions enable the"
"6292","Sub-Adviser to purchase or sell a block of securities for the Series"
"6293","or the Trust at a set price and possibly avoid an unfavorable price"
"6294","movement that may be created through entrance into the market with"
"6295","such purchase or sale order. As such, the Sub-Adviser believes that"
"6296","Cross Transactions can provide meaningful benefits for the Series and"
"6297","the Trust and its clients generally. UBS Global Americas, the Series"
"6298","and the Trust should be aware, however, that in a Cross Transaction"
"6299","an Affiliated Broker-Dealer will be receiving commissions from both"
"6300","sides of the trade and, therefore, there is a potentially conflicting"
"6301","division of loyalties and responsibilities."
"6302","(e) The Sub-Adviser will maintain all books and records"
"6303","required to be maintained pursuant to Rule 31a-1(b)(2)(ii), (3), (5),"
"6304","(6), (7), (9) and (10) under the 1940 Act and the rules and"
"6305","regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to transactions by"
"6306","the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment, and will"
"6307","furnish the Board and UBS Global Americas with such periodic and"
"6308","special reports as the Board or UBS Global Americas reasonably may"
"6309","request. In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the"
"6310","1940 Act, the Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that all records which it"
"6311","maintains for the Portfolio or Segment are the property of the Trust,"
"6312","agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the"
"6313","1940 Act any records that it maintains for the Portfolio or Segment"
"6314","and that are required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940"
"6315","Act, and further agrees to surrender promptly to the Trust any"
"6316","records which it maintains for the Portfolio or Segment upon request"
"6317","by the Trust."
"6318","(f) At such times as shall be reasonably requested by the"
"6319","Board or UBS Global Americas, the Sub-Adviser will provide the Board"
"6320","and UBS Global Americas with economic and investment analyses and"
"6321","reports as well as quarterly reports setting forth the performance of"
"6322","the Portfolio or Segment and make available to the Board and UBS"
"6323","Global Americas any economic, statistical and investment services"
"6324","that the Sub-Adviser normally makes available to its institutional or"
"6325","other customers."
"6326","(g) In accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, as"
"6327","amended from time to time, the Sub-Adviser is responsible for"
"6328","assisting in the fair valuation of all portfolio securities in the"
"6329","Portfolio or Segment and will use its reasonable efforts to arrange"
"6330","for the provision of a price or prices from one or more parties"
"6331","independent of the Sub-Adviser for each portfolio security for which"
"6332","the custodian does not obtain prices in the ordinary course of"
"6333","business from an automated pricing service."
"6334","3. FURTHER DUTIES. In all matters relating to the performance"
"6335","of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will seek to act in conformity"
"6336","with the Trust's Trust Instrument, By-Laws and Registration Statement"
"6337","and with the written instructions and written directions of the Board"
"6338","and UBS Global Americas; and will comply with the requirements of the"
"6339","1940 Act, and the Advisers Act, and the rules under each, the Code,"
"6340","and all other federal and state laws and regulations applicable to"
"6341","the Trust and the Portfolio. UBS Global Americas agrees to provide to"
"6342","the Sub-Adviser copies of the Trust's Trust Instrument, By-Laws,"
"6343","Registration Statement, written instructions and directions of the"
"6344","Board and UBS Global Americas, and any amendments or supplements to"
"6345","any of these materials as soon as practicable after such materials"
"6346","become available; and further agrees to identify to the Sub-Adviser"
"6347","in writing any broker-dealers that are affiliated with UBS Global"
"6348","Americas (other than UBS Financial Services Inc.)."
"6349","4. EXPENSES. During the term of this Agreement, the Sub-"
"6350","Adviser will bear all expenses incurred by it in connection with its"
"6351","services under this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser shall not be"
"6352","responsible for any expenses incurred by the Trust, the Portfolio or"
"6353","UBS Global Americas."
"6354","5. COMPENSATION. For the services provided and the expenses"
"6355","assumed by the Sub-Adviser during the term of this Agreement, the"
"6356","Sub-Adviser shall not be entitled to receive any compensation from"
"6357","UBS Global Americas or the Portfolio."
"6358","6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY."
"6359","(a) The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any error of"
"6360","judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Portfolio,"
"6361","the Trust or its shareholders or by UBS Global Americas in connection"
"6362","with the matters to which this Agreement relates, except a loss"
"6363","resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on"
"6364","its part in the performance of its duties or from reckless disregard"
"6365","by it of its obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"6366","(b) In no event will the Sub-Adviser have any responsibility"
"6367","for any other portfolio of the Trust, for any portion of the"
"6368","Portfolio not managed by the Sub-Adviser or for the acts or omissions"
"6369","of any Other Sub-Adviser to the Trust or Portfolio."
"6370","In particular, in the event the Sub-Adviser shall manage only"
"6371","a Segment of the Portfolio, the Sub-Adviser shall have no"
"6372","responsibility for the Portfolio's being in violation of any"
"6373","applicable law or regulation or investment policy or restriction"
"6374","applicable to the Portfolio as a whole or for the Portfolio's failing"
"6375","to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Code, if the"
"6376","securities and other holdings of the Segment of the Portfolio managed"
"6377","by the Sub-Adviser are such that such Segment would not be in such"
"6378","violation or fail to so qualify if such Segment were deemed a"
"6379","separate series of the Trust or a separate regulated investment
company under the Code."
"6380","Nothing in this section shall be deemed a limitation or"
"6381","waiver of any obligation or duty that may not by law be limited or"
"6382","waived."
"6383","7. REPRESENTATIONS OF SUB-ADVISER. The Sub-Adviser"
"6384","represents, warrants and agrees as follows:"
"6385","(a) The Sub-Adviser (i) is registered as an investment"
"6386","adviser under the Advisers Act and will continue to be so registered"
"6387","for so long as this Agreement remains in effect; (ii) is not"
"6388","prohibited by the 1940 Act or the Advisers Act from performing the"
"6389","services contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) has met, and will seek"
"6390","to continue to meet for so long as this Agreement remains in effect,"
"6391","any other applicable federal or state requirements, or the applicable"
"6392","requirements of any regulatory or industry self-regulatory agency,"
"6393","necessary to be met in order to perform the services contemplated by"
"6394","this Agreement; (iv) has the authority to enter into and perform the"
"6395","services contemplated by this Agreement; and (v) will promptly notify"
"6396","UBS Global Americas of the occurrence of any event that would"
"6397","disqualify the Sub-Adviser from serving as an investment adviser of"
"6398","an investment company pursuant to Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act or"
"6399","otherwise."
"6400","(b) The Sub-Adviser has adopted a written code of ethics"
"6401","complying with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and"
"6402","will provide UBS Global Americas and the Board with a copy of such"
"6403","code of ethics, together with evidence of its adoption. Within"
"6404","fifteen days of the end of the last calendar quarter of each year"
"6405","that this Agreement is in effect, a duly authorized officer of the"
"6406","Sub-Adviser shall certify to UBS Global Americas that the Sub-Adviser"
"6407","has complied with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 during the previous"
"6408","year and that there has been no material violation of the Sub-"
"6409","Adviser's code of ethics or, if such a violation has occurred, that"
"6410","appropriate action was taken in response to such violation. Upon the"
"6411","written request of UBS Global Americas, the Sub-Adviser shall permit"
"6412","UBS Global Americas, its employees or its agents to examine the"
"6413","reports required to be made by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to Rule 17j-1"
"6414","and all other records relevant to the Sub-Adviser's code of ethics."
"6415","(c) The Sub-Adviser has provided UBS Global Americas with a"
"6416","copy of its Form ADV, as most recently filed with the Securities and"
"6417","Exchange Commission (SEC), and promptly will furnish a copy of all"
"6418","amendments to UBS Global Americas at least annually. In addition, the"
"6419","Sub-Adviser has provided UBS Global Americas with certain disclosures"
"6420","required by the U.K. Financial Services Authority."
"6421","(d) The Sub-Adviser will notify UBS Global Americas of any"
"6422","change of control of the Sub-Adviser, including any change of its"
"6423","general partners or 25% shareholders or 25% limited partners, as"
"6424","applicable, and any changes in the key personnel who are either the"
"6425","portfolio manager(s) of the Portfolio or senior management of the"
"6426","Sub-Adviser, in each case prior to or promptly after such change."
"6427","(e) UBS Global Americas and the Sub-Adviser agree that"
"6428","neither of them nor any of their affiliates, will in any way refer"
"6429","directly or indirectly to their relationship with one another or any"
"6430","of their respective affiliates in offering, marketing or other"
"6431","promotional materials without the express written consent of the"
"6432","other, which consent will be promptly provided and not unreasonably"
"6433","withheld."
"6434","8. SERVICES NOT EXCLUSIVE. The services furnished by the Sub-"
"6435","Adviser hereunder are not to be deemed exclusive, and except as the"
"6436","Sub-Adviser may otherwise agree in writing, the Sub-Adviser shall be"
"6437","free to furnish similar services to others so long as its services"
"6438","under this Agreement are not impaired thereby. Nothing in this"
"6439","Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any director, officer"
"6440","or employee of the Sub-Adviser, who may also be a trustee, officer or"
"6441","employee of the Trust, to engage in any other business or to devote"
"6442","his or her time and attention in part to the management or other"
"6443","aspects of any other business, whether of a similar nature or a"
"6444","dissimilar nature."
"6445","9. DURATION AND TERMINATION."
"6446","(a) This Agreement shall become effective upon the date first"
"6447","above written, provided that this Agreement shall not take effect"
"6448","unless it has first been approved (i) by a vote of a majority of"
"6449","those trustees of the Trust who are not parties to this Agreement or"
"6450","interested persons of any such party (Independent Trustees), cast"
"6451","in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such"
"6452","approval, and (ii) by vote of a majority of the Portfolio's"
"6453","outstanding voting securities, unless UBS Global Americas has"
"6454","authority to enter into this Agreement pursuant to exemptive relief"
"6455","from the SEC without a vote of the Portfolio's outstanding voting"
"6456","securities."
"6457","(b) Unless sooner terminated as provided herein, this"
"6458","Agreement shall continue in effect for one hundred and fifty (150)"
"6459","days from its effective date."
"6460","(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be"
"6461","terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by vote"
"6462","of the Board or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting"
"6463","securities of the Portfolio on 10 days' written notice to the Sub-"
"6464","Adviser. This Agreement may also be terminated, without the payment"
"6465","of any penalty, by UBS Global Americas: (i) upon 120 days' written"
"6466","notice to the Sub-Adviser; (ii) upon material breach by the Sub-"
"6467","Adviser of any of the representations, warranties and agreements set"
"6468","forth in Paragraph 7 of this Agreement; or (iii) immediately if, in"
"6469","the reasonable judgment of UBS Global Americas, the Sub-Adviser"
"6470","becomes unable to discharge its duties and obligations under this"
"6471","Agreement, including circumstances such as financial insolvency of"
"6472","the Sub-Adviser or other circumstances that could adversely affect"
"6473","the Portfolio. The Sub-Adviser may terminate this Agreement at any"
"6474","time, without the payment of any penalty, on 120 days' written notice"
"6475","to UBS Global Americas. This Agreement will terminate automatically"
"6476","in the event of its assignment or upon termination of the Management"
"6477","Agreement, as it relates to this Portfolio."
"6478","10. AMENDMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. No provision of this"
"6479","Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally,"
"6480","but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom"
"6481","enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is"
"6482","sought. To the extent required by applicable law, no amendment of"
"6483","this Agreement shall be effective until approved (i) by a vote of a"
"6484","majority of the Independent Trustees, and (ii) if the terms of this"
"6485","Agreement shall have changed, by a vote of a majority of the"
"6486","Portfolio's outstanding voting securities (except in the case of"
"6487","(ii), pursuant to the terms and conditions of the SEC order"
"6488","permitting it to modify the Agreement without such vote)."
"6489","11. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be construed in"
"6490","accordance with the 1940 Act and the laws of the State of New York,"
"6491","without giving effect to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. To"
"6492","the extent that the applicable laws of the State of New York conflict"
"6493","with the applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, the latter shall"
"6494","control."
"6495","12. MISCELLANEOUS. The captions in this Agreement are"
"6496","included for convenience of reference only and in no way define or"
"6497","delimit any of the provisions hereof or otherwise affect their"
"6498","construction or effect. If any provision of this Agreement shall be"
"6499","held or made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or otherwise,"
"6500","the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. This"
"6501","Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the"
"6502","parties hereto and their respective successors. As used in this"
"6503","Agreement, the terms majority of the outstanding voting securities,"
"6504","affiliated person, interested person, assignment, broker,"
"6505","investment adviser, net assets, sale, sell and security"
"6506","shall have the same meanings as such terms have in the 1940 Act,"
"6507","subject to such exemption as may be granted by the SEC by any rule,"

"6563","INTERIM SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT"
"6564","Interim agreement made as of June 12, 2011 between UBS GLOBAL"
"6565","ASSET MANAGEMENT (AMERICAS) INC., a Delaware corporation (UBS Global
Americas), and MONDRIAN INVESTMENT PARTNERS LIMITED (Sub-Adviser),"
"6566","a limited company organized under the laws of the United Kingdom (the"
"6567","Agreement)."
"6568","RECITALS"
"6569","(1) UBS Global Americas has entered into a Management"
"6570","Agreement dated as of August 1, 2008 (Management Agreement) with"
"6571","PACE Select Advisors Trust, an open-end management investment company"
"6572","registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended"
"6573","(1940 Act), with respect to PACE International Emerging Markets"
"6574","Equity Investments (Portfolio);"
"6575","(2) UBS Global Americas has been notified by the Sub-Adviser"
"6576","that a transaction will occur on or about July 12, 2011 which will"
"6577","result in an assignment of the prior agreement between the parties"
"6578","and will thus terminate the prior agreement;"
"6579","(3) UBS Global Americas desires to continue to retain the"
"6580","Sub-Adviser to furnish certain investment advisory services to UBS"
"6581","Global Americas and the Portfolio or a designated portion of the"
"6582","assets (Segment) of the Portfolio; and"
"6583","(4) The Sub-Adviser is willing to continue to furnish such"
"6584","services;"
"6585","NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual"
"6586","covenants herein contained, UBS Global Americas and the Sub-Adviser"
"6587","agree as follows:"
"6588","1. APPOINTMENT. Effective as of the assignment referred to"
"6589","above, UBS Global Americas hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser as an"
"6590","investment Sub-Adviser with respect to the Portfolio or Segment for"
"6591","the period and on the terms set forth in this Agreement. The Sub-"
"6592","Adviser accepts that appointment and agrees to render the services"
"6593","herein set forth, for the compensation herein provided."
"6594","2. DUTIES AS SUB-ADVISER."
"6595","(a) Subject to the supervision and direction of the Trust's"
"6596","Board of Trustees (the Board) and review by UBS Global Americas,"
"6597","and any written guidelines adopted by the Board or UBS Global"
"6598","Americas, the Sub-Adviser will provide a continuous investment"
"6599","program for the Portfolio or Segment, all or a designated portion of"
"6600","the assets, including investment research and discretionary"
"6601","management with respect to all securities and investments and cash"
"6602","equivalents in the Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-Adviser will"
"6603","determine from time to time what investments will be purchased,"
"6604","retained or sold by the Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-Adviser will be"
"6605","responsible for placing purchase and sell orders for investments and"
"6606","for other related transactions for the Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-"
"6607","Adviser understands that the Portfolio's assets need to be managed so"
"6608","as to permit the Portfolio to qualify or to continue to qualify as a"
"6609","regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal"
"6610","Revenue Code, as amended (Code). The Sub-Adviser will provide"
"6611","services under this Agreement in accordance with the Portfolio's"
"6612","investment objective, policies and restrictions as stated in the"
"6613","Trust's currently effective registration statement under the 1940"
"6614","Act, and any amendments or supplements thereto (Registration
Statement)."
"6615","(b) The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not consult with any"
"6616","other Sub-Adviser (Other Sub-Adviser) for the Trust or Portfolio"
"6617","concerning any transaction by the Portfolio or Segment in securities"
"6618","or other assets, including (i) the purchase by the Portfolio or"
"6619","Segment of a security issued by the Other Sub-Adviser, or an"
"6620","affiliate of the Other Sub-Adviser, to the Trust or Portfolio except"
"6621","as permitted by the 1940 Act or (ii) transactions by the Portfolio or"
"6622","Segment in any security for which the Other Sub-Adviser, or its"
"6623","affiliate, is the principal underwriter."
"6624","(c) The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will be responsible for"
"6625","voting proxies of issuers of securities held by the Portfolio or"
"6626","Segment. The Sub-Adviser further agrees that it will adopt written"
"6627","proxy voting procedures that shall comply with the requirements of"
"6628","the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended"
"6629","(Advisers Act), and that shall be acceptable to the Board.  The"
"6630","Sub-Adviser further agrees that it will provide the Board on or"
"6631","before August 1st of each year, or more frequently as the Board may"
"6632","reasonably request, with a written report of the proxies voted during"
"6633","the most recent 12-month period ending June 30, or such other period"
"6634","as the Board may designate, in a format that shall comply with the"
"6635","1940 Act and that shall be acceptable to the"
"6636","Board."
"6637","(d) The Sub-Adviser agrees that, in placing orders with"
"6638","brokers, it will obtain the best net result in terms of price and"
"6639","execution. The Sub-Adviser may aggregate sales and purchase orders"
"6640","with respect to the assets of the Portfolio or Segment with similar"
"6641","orders being made simultaneously for other accounts advised by the"
"6642","Sub-Adviser or its affiliates. Whenever the Sub-Adviser"
"6643","simultaneously places orders to purchase or sell the same security on"
"6644","behalf of the Portfolio or Segment and one or more other accounts"
"6645","advised by the Sub-Adviser, the orders will be allocated as to price"
"6646","and amount among all such accounts in a manner believed to be"
"6647","equitable over time to each account. UBS Global Americas recognizes"
"6648","that in some cases this procedure may adversely affect the results"
"6649","obtained for the Portfolio or Segment."
"6650","Subject to the Sub-Adviser's obligations to seek best"
"6651","execution, UBS Global Americas agrees that the Sub-Adviser, in its"
"6652","sole discretion, may place transactions on behalf of the Portfolio or"
"6653","Segment and the Trust with any broker-dealer deemed to be an"
"6654","affiliate of the Sub-Adviser (the Affiliated Broker-Dealers) so"
"6655","long as such transactions are effected in conformity with the"
"6656","requirements (including any applicable exemptions and administrative"
"6657","interpretations set forth in Part II of the Sub-Adviser's Form ADV"
"6658","Registration Statement on file with the Securities and Exchange"
"6659","Commission (Form ADV)) of Section 11(a)(1)(H) of the Securities"
"6660","Exchange Act of 1934. In all such dealings, the Affiliated Broker-"
"6661","Dealers shall be authorized and entitled to retain any commissions,"
"6662","remuneration or profits which may be made in such transactions and"
"6663","shall not be liable to account for the same to UBS Global Americas,"
"6664","the Portfolio or the Trust."
"6665","UBS Global Americas further authorizes the Sub-Adviser and"
"6666","its Affiliated Broker-Dealers to execute agency cross transactions"
"6667","(the Cross Transactions) on behalf of the Portfolio and the Trust."
"6668","Cross Transactions are transactions which may be effected by the"
"6669","Affiliated Broker-Dealers acting for both the Portfolio or the Trust"
"6670","and the counterparty to the transaction. Cross Transactions enable"
"6671","the Sub-Adviser to purchase or sell a block of securities for the"
"6672","Portfolio or the Trust at a set price and possibly avoid an"
"6673","unfavorable price movement that may be created through entrance into"
"6674","the market with such purchase or sale order. As such, the Sub-Adviser"
"6675","believes that Cross Transactions can provide meaningful benefits for"
"6676","the Portfolio and the Trust and its clients generally. UBS Global"
"6677","Americas, the Portfolio and the Trust should be aware, however, that"
"6678","in a Cross Transaction an Affiliated Broker-Dealer will be receiving"
"6679","commissions from both sides of the trade and, therefore, there is a"
"6680","potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities."
"6681","(e) The Sub-Adviser will maintain all books and records"
"6682","required to be maintained pursuant to Rule 31a-1(b)(2)(ii)(3), (5),"
"6683","(6), (7), (9) and (10) under the 1940 Act and the rules and"
"6684","regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to transactions by"
"6685","the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment, and will"
"6686","furnish the Board and UBS Global Americas with such periodic and"
"6687","special reports as the Board or UBS Global Americas reasonably may"
"6688","request. In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the"
"6689","1940 Act, the Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that all records which it"
"6690","maintains for the Portfolio or Segment are the property of the Trust,"
"6691","agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the"
"6692","1940 Act any records which it maintains for the Portfolio or Segment"
"6693","and which are required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940"
"6694","Act, and further agrees to surrender promptly to the Trust any"
"6695","records which it maintains for the Portfolio or Segment upon request"
"6696","by the Trust."
"6697","(f) At such times as shall be reasonably requested by the"
"6698","Board or UBS Global Americas, the Sub-Adviser will provide the Board"
"6699","and UBS Global Americas with economic and investment analyses and"
"6700","reports as well as quarterly reports setting forth the performance of"
"6701","the Portfolio or Segment and make available to the Board and UBS"
"6702","Global Americas any economic, statistical and investment services"
"6703","that the Sub-Adviser normally makes available to its institutional or"
"6704","other customers."
"6705","(g) In accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, as"
"6706","amended from time to time, the Sub-Adviser is responsible for"
"6707","assisting in the fair valuation of all portfolio securities in the"
"6708","Portfolio or Segment and will use its reasonable efforts to arrange"
"6709","for the provision of a price or prices from one or more parties"
"6710","independent of the Sub-Adviser for each portfolio security for which"
"6711","the custodian does not obtain prices in the ordinary course of"
"6712","business from an automated pricing service."
"6713","3. FURTHER DUTIES. In all matters relating to the performance"
"6714","of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will seek to act in conformity"
"6715","with the Trust's Trust Instrument, By-Laws and Registration Statement"
"6716","and with the written instructions and written directions of the Board"
"6717","and UBS Global Americas and will comply with the applicable"
"6718","requirements of the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, and the rules under"
"6719","each, the Code, and all other federal and state laws and regulations"
"6720","applicable to the Trust and the Portfolio. UBS Global Americas agrees"
"6721","to provide to the Sub-Adviser copies of the Trust's Trust Instrument,"
"6722","By-Laws, Registration Statement, written instructions and directions"
"6723","of the Board and UBS Global Americas, and any amendments or"
"6724","supplements to any of these materials as soon as practicable after"
"6725","such materials become available; provided, however, that the Sub-"
"6726","Adviser's duty under this Agreement to act in conformity with any"
"6727","document, instruction or guideline produced by the Trust or UBS"
"6728","Global Americas shall not arise until it has been delivered to the"
"6729","Sub-Adviser. Any changes to the objectives, policies and restrictions"
"6730","will make due allowance for the time within which the Sub-Adviser"
"6731","shall have to come into compliance. UBS Global Americas further"
"6732","agrees to identify to the Sub-Adviser in writing any broker-dealers"
"6733","that are affiliated with UBS Global Americas (other than UBS"
"6734","Financial Services Inc.)."
"6735","4. EXPENSES. During the term of this Agreement, the Sub-"
"6736","Adviser will bear all expenses incurred by it in connection with its"
"6737","services under this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser shall not be"
"6738","responsible for any expenses incurred by the Trust, the Portfolio or"
"6739","UBS Global Americas."
"6740","5. COMPENSATION.  For the services provided and the expenses"
"6741","assumed by the Sub-Adviser during the term of this Agreement, the"
"6742","Sub-Adviser shall not be entitled to receive any compensation from"
"6743","UBS Global Americas or the Portfolio."
"6744","6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY."
"6745","(a) The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any error of"
"6746","judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Portfolio,"
"6747","the Trust or its shareholders or by UBS Global Americas in connection"
"6748","with the matters to which this Agreement relates, except a loss"
"6749","resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on"
"6750","its part in the performance of its duties or from reckless disregard"
"6751","by it of its obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"6752","(b) In no event will the Sub-Adviser have any responsibility"
"6753","for any other portfolio of the Trust, for any portion of the"
"6754","Portfolio not managed by the Sub-Adviser or for the acts or omissions"
"6755","of any Other Sub-Adviser to the Trust or Portfolio."
"6756","In particular, in the event the Sub-Adviser shall manage only"
"6757","a portion of the Portfolio's Segment of the Portfolio, the Sub-"
"6758","Adviser shall have no responsibility for the Portfolio's being in"
"6759","violation of any applicable law or regulation or investment policy or"
"6760","restriction applicable to the Portfolio as a whole or for the"
"6761","Portfolio's failing to qualify as a regulated investment company"
"6762","under the Code, if the securities and other holdings of the Segment"
"6763","of the Portfolio managed by the Sub-Adviser are such that such"
"6764","Segment would not be in such violation or fail to so qualify if such"
"6765","Segment were deemed a separate series of the Trust or a separate"
"6766","regulated investment company under the Code."
"6767","7. REPRESENTATIONS OF SUB-ADVISER. The Sub-Adviser"
"6768","represents, warrants and agrees as follows:"
"6769","(a) The Sub-Adviser (i) is registered as an investment"
"6770","adviser under the Advisers Act and will continue to be so registered"
"6771","for so long as this Agreement remains in effect; (ii) is not"
"6772","prohibited by the 1940 Act or the Advisers Act from performing the"
"6773","services contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) has met, and will seek"
"6774","to continue to meet for so long as this Agreement remains in effect,"
"6775","any other applicable federal or state requirements, or the applicable"
"6776","requirements of any regulatory or industry self-regulatory agency,"
"6777","necessary to be met in order to perform the services contemplated by"
"6778","this Agreement; (iv) has the authority to enter into and perform the"
"6779","services contemplated by this Agreement; and (v) will promptly notify"
"6780","UBS Global Americas of the occurrence of any event that would"
"6781","disqualify the Sub-Adviser from serving as an investment adviser of"
"6782","an investment company pursuant to Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act or"
"6783","otherwise."
"6784","(b) The Sub-Adviser has adopted a written code of ethics"
"6785","complying with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and"
"6786","will provide UBS Global Americas and the Board with a copy of such"
"6787","code of ethics, together with evidence of its adoption. Within"
"6788","fifteen days of the end of the last calendar quarter of each year"
"6789","that this Agreement is in effect, a duly authorized officer of the"
"6790","Sub-Adviser shall certify to UBS Global Americas that the Sub-Adviser"
"6791","has complied with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 during the previous"
"6792","year and that there has been no violation of the Sub-Adviser's code"
"6793","of ethics or, if such a violation has occurred, that appropriate"
"6794","action was taken in response to such violation. Upon the written"
"6795","request of UBS Global Americas, the Sub-Adviser shall permit UBS"
"6796","Global Americas, its employees or its agents to examine the reports"
"6797","required to be made by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to Rule 17j-1(c)(1)"
"6798","and all other records relevant to the Sub-Adviser's code of ethics."
"6799","(c) The Sub-Adviser has provided UBS Global Americas with a"
"6800","copy of its Form ADV as most recently filed with the Securities and"
"6801","Exchange Commission (SEC) and promptly will furnish a copy of all"
"6802","amendments to UBS Global Americas at least annually."
"6803","(d) The Sub-Adviser will notify UBS Global Americas of any"
"6804","change of control of the Sub-Adviser, including any change of its"
"6805","general partners or 25% shareholders or 25% limited partners, as"
"6806","applicable, and any changes in the key personnel who are either the"
"6807","portfolio manager(s) of the Portfolio or senior management of the"
"6808","Sub-Adviser, in each case prior to or promptly after such change."
"6809","(e) UBS Global Americas and the Sub-Adviser agree that"
"6810","neither of them nor any of their affiliates, will in any way refer"
"6811","directly or indirectly to their relationship with one another or any"
"6812","of their respective affiliates in offering, marketing or other"
"6813","promotional materials without the express written consent of the"
"6814","other, which consent will be promptly provided and not unreasonably"
"6815","withheld."
"6816","8. SERVICES NOT EXCLUSIVE. The services furnished by the Sub-"
"6817","Adviser hereunder are not to be deemed exclusive, and except as the"
"6818","Sub-Adviser may otherwise agree in writing, the Sub-Adviser shall be"
"6819","free to furnish similar services to others so long as its services"
"6820","under this Agreement are not impaired thereby. Nothing in this"
"6821","Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any director, officer"
"6822","or employee of the Sub-Adviser, who may also be a trustee, officer or"
"6823","employee of the Trust, to engage in any other business or to devote"
"6824","his or her time and attention in part to the management or other"
"6825","aspects of any other business, whether of a similar nature or a"
"6826","dissimilar nature."
"6827","9. DURATION AND TERMINATION."
"6828","(a) This Agreement shall become effective upon the date first"
"6829","above written, provided that this Agreement shall not take effect"
"6830","unless it has first been approved (i) by a vote of a majority of"
"6831","those trustees of the Trust who are not parties to this Agreement or"
"6832","interested persons of any such party (Independent Trustees), cast"
"6833","in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such"
"6834","approval, and (ii) by vote of a majority of the Portfolio's"
"6835","outstanding voting securities; unless UBS Global Americas has"
"6836","authority to enter into this Agreement pursuant to exemptive relief"
"6837","from the SEC without a vote of the Portfolio's outstanding voting"
"6838","securities."
"6839","(b) Unless sooner terminated as provided herein, this"
"6840","Agreement shall continue in effect for one hundred and fifty (150)"
"6841","days from its effective date."
"6842","(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be"
"6843","terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by vote"
"6844","of the Board or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting"
"6845","securities of the Portfolio on 10 days' written notice to the Sub-"
"6846","Adviser. This Agreement may also be terminated, without the payment"
"6847","of any penalty, by UBS Global Americas: (i) upon 120 days' written"
"6848","notice to the Sub-Adviser; (ii) upon material breach by the Sub-"
"6849","Adviser of any of the representations, warranties and agreements set"
"6850","forth in Paragraph 7 of this Agreement; or (iii) immediately if, in"
"6851","the reasonable judgment of UBS Global Americas, the Sub-Adviser"
"6852","becomes unable to discharge its duties and obligations under this"
"6853","Agreement, including circumstances such as financial insolvency of"
"6854","the Sub-Adviser or other circumstances that could adversely affect"
"6855","the Portfolio. The Sub-Adviser may terminate this Agreement at any"
"6856","time, without the payment of any penalty, on 120 days' written notice"
"6857","to UBS Global Americas.  This Agreement will terminate automatically"
"6858","in the event of its assignment or upon termination of the Management"
"6859","Agreement, as it related to this Portfolio."
"6860","10. AMENDMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. No provision of this"
"6861","Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally,"
"6862","but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom"
"6863","enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is"
"6864","sought. To the extent required by applicable law, no amendment of"
"6865","this Agreement shall be effective until approved (i) by a vote of a"
"6866","majority of the Independent Trustees, and (ii) if the terms of this"
"6867","Agreement shall have changed, by a vote of a majority of the"
"6868","Portfolio's outstanding voting securities (except in the case of"
"6869","(ii), pursuant to the terms and conditions of the SEC order"
"6870","permitting it to modify the Agreement without such vote)."
"6871","11. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be construed in"
"6872","accordance with the 1940 Act and the laws of the State of New York,"
"6873","without giving effect to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. To"
"6874","the extent that the applicable laws of the State of New York conflict"
"6875","with the applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, the latter shall"
"6876","control."
"6877","12. MISCELLANEOUS. The captions in this Agreement are"
"6878","included for convenience of reference only and in no way define or"
"6879","delimit any of the provisions hereof or otherwise affect their"
"6880","construction or effect. If any provision of this Agreement shall be"

"6947","SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT"
"6948","Agreement made as of July 20, 2011 between UBS GLOBAL ASSET"
"6949","MANAGEMENT"
"6950","(AMERICAS) INC. (UBS Global Americas), a Delaware corporation, and"
"6951","MONDRIAN INVESTMENT PARTNERS LIMITED (Sub-Adviser), a limited"
"6952","company organized under the laws of the United Kingdom (the"
"6953","Agreement)."
"6954","RECITALS"
"6955","(1) UBS Global Americas has entered into a Management"
"6956","Agreement dated as of August 1, 2008 (Management Agreement) with"
"6957","PACE Select Advisors Trust, an open-end management investment company"
"6958","registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended"
"6959","(1940 Act), with respect to PACE International Equity Investments"
"6960","(Portfolio);"
"6961","(2) UBS Global Americas desires to continue to retain the"
"6962","Sub-Adviser (formerly known as Delaware International Advisers Ltd.)"
"6963","to furnish certain investment advisory services to UBS Global"
"6964","Americas and the Portfolio or a designated portion of the assets"
"6965","(Segment) of the Portfolio; and"
"6966","(3) The Sub-Adviser is willing to continue to furnish such"
"6967","services;"
"6968","NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual"
"6969","covenants herein contained, UBS Global Americas and the Sub-Adviser"
"6970","agree as follows:"
"6971","1. APPOINTMENT. UBS Global Americas hereby appoints the Sub-"
"6972","Adviser as an investment sub-adviser with respect to the Portfolio or"
"6973","Segment for the period and on the terms set forth in this Agreement."
"6974","The Sub-Adviser accepts that appointment and agrees to render the"
"6975","services herein set forth, for the compensation herein provided."
"6976","2. DUTIES AS SUB-ADVISER."
"6977","(a) Subject to the supervision and direction of the Trust's"
"6978","Board of Trustees (the Board) and review by UBS Global Americas,"
"6979","and any written guidelines adopted by the Board or UBS Global"
"6980","Americas, the Sub-Adviser will provide a continuous investment"
"6981","program for the Portfolio or Segment, including investment research"
"6982","and discretionary management with respect to all securities and"
"6983","investments and cash equivalents in the Portfolio or Segment. The"
"6984","Sub-Adviser will determine from time to time what investments will be"
"6985","purchased, retained or sold by the Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-"
"6986","Adviser will be responsible for placing purchase and sell orders for"
"6987","investments and for other related transactions for the Portfolio or"
"6988","Segment. The Sub-Adviser understands that the Portfolio's assets need"
"6989","to be managed so as to permit the Portfolio to qualify or to continue"
"6990","to qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of"
"6991","the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (Code). The Sub-Adviser will"
"6992","provide services under this Agreement in accordance with the"
"6993","Portfolio's investment objective, policies and restrictions as stated"
"6994","in the Trust's currently effective registration statement under the"
"6995","1940 Act, and any amendments or supplements thereto (Registration
Statement)."
"6996","(b) The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not consult with any"
"6997","other sub-adviser (Other Sub-Adviser) for the Trust or Portfolio"
"6998","concerning any transaction by the Portfolio or Segment in securities"
"6999","or other assets, including (i) the purchase by the Portfolio or"
"7000","Segment of a security issued by the Other Sub-Adviser, or an"
"7001","affiliate of the Other Sub-Adviser, to the Trust or Portfolio except"
"7002","as permitted by the 1940 Act or (ii) transactions by the Portfolio or"
"7003","Segment in any security for which the Other Sub-Adviser, or its"
"7004","affiliate, is the principal underwriter."
"7005","(c) The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will be responsible for"
"7006","voting proxies of issuers of securities held by the Portfolio or"
"7007","Segment. The Sub-Adviser further agrees that it will adopt written"
"7008","proxy voting procedures that shall comply with the requirements of"
"7009","the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended"
"7010","(Advisers Act), and that shall be acceptable to the Board. The Sub-"
"7011","Adviser further agrees that it will provide the Board on or before"
"7012","August 1st of each year, or more frequently as the Board may"
"7013","reasonably request, with a written report of the proxies voted during"
"7014","the most recent 12-month period ending June 30, or such other period"
"7015","as the Board may designate, in a format that shall comply with the"
"7016","1940 Act and that shall be acceptable to the Board."
"7017","(d) The Sub-Adviser agrees that, in placing orders with"
"7018","brokers, it will seek to obtain the best net result in terms of price"
"7019","and execution; provided that, on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment,"
"7020","the Sub-Adviser may, in its discretion, use brokers that provide the"
"7021","Sub-Adviser with research, analysis, advice and similar services to"
"7022","execute portfolio transactions on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment,"
"7023","and the Sub-Adviser may pay to those brokers in return for brokerage"
"7024","and research services a higher commission than may be charged by"
"7025","other brokers, subject to the Sub-Adviser's determination in good"
"7026","faith that such commission is reasonable in terms either of the"
"7027","particular transaction or of the overall responsibility of the Sub-"
"7028","Adviser to the Portfolio or Segment and its other clients and that"
"7029","the total commissions paid by the Portfolio or Segment will be"
"7030","reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio or Segment"
"7031","over the long term. In no instance will portfolio securities be"
"7032","purchased from or sold to UBS Global Americas or the Sub-Adviser, or"
"7033","any affiliated person thereof, except in accordance with the federal"
"7034","securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Sub-"
"7035","Adviser may aggregate sales and purchase orders with respect to the"
"7036","assets of the Portfolio or Segment with similar orders being made"
"7037","simultaneously for other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser or its"
"7038","affiliates. Whenever the Sub-Adviser simultaneously places orders to"
"7039","purchase or sell the same security on behalf of the Portfolio or"
"7040","Segment and one or more other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser,"
"7041","the orders will be allocated as to price and amount among all such"
"7042","accounts in a manner believed to be equitable over time to each"
"7043","account. UBS Global Americas recognizes that in some cases this"
"7044","procedure may adversely affect the results obtained for the Portfolio"
"7045","or Segment."
"7046","Subject to the Sub-Adviser's obligations to seek best"
"7047","execution, UBS Global Americas agrees that the Sub-Adviser, in its"
"7048","sole discretion, may place transactions on behalf of the Portfolio or"
"7049","Segment and the Trust with any broker-dealer deemed to be an"
"7050","affiliate of the Sub-Adviser (the Affiliated Broker-Dealers) so"
"7051","long as such transactions are effected in conformity with the"
"7052","requirements (including any applicable exemptions and administrative"
"7053","interpretations set forth in Part II of the Sub-Adviser's Form ADV"
"7054","Registration Statement on file with the Securities and Exchange"
"7055","Commission (Form ADV)) of Section 11(a)(1)(H) of the Securities"
"7056","Exchange Act of 1934. In all such dealings, the Affiliated Broker-"
"7057","Dealers shall be authorized and entitled to retain any commissions,"
"7058","remuneration or profits which may be made in such transactions and"
"7059","shall not be liable to account for the same to UBS Global Americas,"
"7060","the Series or the Trust."
"7061","UBS Global Americas further authorizes the Sub-Adviser and"
"7062","its Affiliated Broker-Dealers to execute agency cross transactions"
"7063","(the Cross Transactions) on behalf of the Series and the Trust."
"7064","Cross Transactions are transactions which may be effected by the"
"7065","Affiliated Broker-Dealers acting for both the Series or the Trust and"
"7066","the counterparty to the transaction. Cross Transactions enable the"
"7067","Sub-Adviser to purchase or sell a block of securities for the Series"
"7068","or the Trust at a set price and possibly avoid an unfavorable price"
"7069","movement that may be created through entrance into the market with"
"7070","such purchase or sale order. As such, the Sub-Adviser believes that"
"7071","Cross Transactions can provide meaningful benefits for the Series and"
"7072","the Trust and its clients generally. UBS Global Americas, the Series"
"7073","and the Trust should be aware, however, that in a Cross Transaction"
"7074","an Affiliated Broker-Dealer will be receiving commissions from both"
"7075","sides of the trade and, therefore, there is a potentially conflicting"
"7076","division of loyalties and responsibilities."
"7077","(e) The Sub-Adviser will maintain all books and records"
"7078","required to be maintained pursuant to Rule 31 a-1 (b)(2)(ii), (3),"
"7079","(5), (6), (7), (9) and (10) under the 1940 Act and the rules and"
"7080","regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to transactions by"
"7081","the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment, and will"
"7082","furnish the Board and UBS Global Americas with such periodic and"
"7083","special reports as the Board or UBS Global Americas reasonably may"
"7084","request. In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31 a-3 under the"
"7085","1940 Act, the Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that all records which it"
"7086","maintains for the Portfolio or Segment are the property of the Trust,"
"7087","agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31 a-2 under"
"7088","the 1940 Act any records that it maintains for the Portfolio or"
"7089","Segment and that are required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under"
"7090","the 1940 Act, and further agrees to surrender promptly to the Trust"
"7091","any records which it maintains for the Portfolio or Segment upon"
"7092","request by the Trust."
"7093","(f) At such times as shall be reasonably requested by the"
"7094","Board or UBS Global Americas, the Sub-Adviser will provide the Board"
"7095","and UBS Global Americas with economic and investment analyses and"
"7096","reports as well as quarterly reports setting forth the performance of"
"7097","the Portfolio or Segment and make available to the Board and UBS"
"7098","Global Americas any economic, statistical and investment services"
"7099","that the Sub-Adviser normally makes available to its institutional or"
"7100","other customers."
"7101","(g) In accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, as"
"7102","amended from time to time, the Sub-Adviser is responsible for"
"7103","assisting in the fair valuation of all portfolio securities in the"
"7104","Portfolio or Segment and will use its reasonable efforts to arrange"
"7105","for the provision of a price or prices from one or more parties"
"7106","independent of the Sub-Adviser for each portfolio security for which"
"7107","the custodian does not obtain prices in the ordinary course of"
"7108","business from an automated pricing service."
"7109","3. FURTHER DUTIES. In all matters relating to the performance"
"7110","of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will seek to act in conformity"
"7111","with the Trust's Trust Instrument, By-Laws and Registration Statement"
"7112","and with the written instructions and written directions of the Board"
"7113","and UBS Global Americas; and will comply with the requirements of the"
"7114","1940 Act, and the Advisers Act, and the rules under each, the Code,"
"7115","and all other federal and state laws and regulations applicable to"
"7116","the Trust and the Portfolio. UBS Global Americas agrees to provide to"
"7117","the Sub-Adviser copies of the Trust's Trust Instrument, By-Laws,"
"7118","Registration Statement, written instructions and directions of the"
"7119","Board and UBS Global Americas, and any amendments or supplements to"
"7120","any of these materials as soon as practicable after such materials"
"7121","become available; and further agrees to identify to the Sub-Adviser"
"7122","in writing any broker-dealers that are affiliated with UBS Global"
"7123","Americas (other than UBS Financial Services Inc.)."
"7124","4. EXPENSES. During the term of this Agreement, the Sub-"
"7125","Adviser will bear all expenses incurred by it in connection with its"
"7126","services under this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser shall not be"
"7127","responsible for any expenses incurred by the Trust, the Portfolio or"
"7128","UBS Global Americas."
"7129","5. COMPENSATION."
"7130","(a) For the services provided and the expenses assumed by the"
"7131","Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, UBS Global Americas, not the"
"7132","Portfolio, will pay to the Sub-Adviser a fee, computed daily and"
"7133","payable monthly at the annual rates set forth below based on the"
"7134","average daily net assets of the Portfolio or Segment allocated to the"
"7135","Sub-Adviser's management:"
"7136","PORTFOLIO OR SEGMENT ASSETS           	  	SUB-ADVISORY FEE AS A"
"7137","MANAGED BY SUB-ADVISER        		PERCENTAGE OF AVERAGE DAILY NET ASSETS"
"7138","---------------------------------   	--------------------------------------"
"7139","First $150 million                                      0.35%"
"7140","Amounts in excess of $150 million             		0.30%"
"7141","(b) UBS Global Americas will compute the fees payable to the"
"7142","Sub-Adviser in the manner specified in the Management Agreement and"
"7143","will provide the Sub-Adviser with a schedule showing the manner in"
"7144","which the fee was computed. If the Sub-Adviser is managing a Segment,"
"7145","its fees will be based on the value of the assets of the Portfolio"
"7146","within the Sub-Adviser's Segment."
"7147","(c) The fee shall be accrued daily and payable monthly to the"
"7148","Sub-Adviser on or before the last business day of the next succeeding"
"7149","calendar month."
"7150","(d) If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates before"
"7151","the end of any month, the fee for the period from the effective date"
"7152","to the end of the month or from the beginning of such month to the"
"7153","date of termination, as the case may be, shall be pro-rated according"
"7154","to the proportion which such period bears to the full month in that"
"7155","such effectiveness or termination occurs."
"7156","6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY."
"7157","(a) The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any error of"
"7158","judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Portfolio,"
"7159","the Trust or its shareholders or by UBS Global Americas in connection"
"7160","with the matters to which this Agreement relates, except a loss"
"7161","resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on"
"7162","its part in the performance of its duties or from reckless disregard"
"7163","by it of its obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"7164","(b) In no event will the Sub-Adviser have any responsibility"
"7165","for any other portfolio of the Trust, for any portion of the"
"7166","Portfolio not managed by the Sub-Adviser or for the acts or omissions"
"7167","of any Other Sub-Adviser to the Trust or Portfolio."
"7168","In particular, in the event the Sub-Adviser shall manage only"
"7169","a Segment of the Portfolio, the Sub-Adviser shall have no"
"7170","responsibility for the Portfolio's being in violation of any"
"7171","applicable law or regulation or investment policy or restriction"
"7172","applicable to the Portfolio as a whole or for the Portfolio's failing"
"7173","to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Code, if the"
"7174","securities and other holdings of the Segment of the Portfolio managed"
"7175","by the Sub-Adviser are such that such Segment would not be in such"
"7176","violation or fail to so qualify if such Segment were deemed a"
"7177","separate series of the Trust or a separate regulated investment
company under the Code."
"7178","Nothing in this section shall be deemed a limitation or"
"7179","waiver of any obligation or duty that may not by law be limited or"
"7180","waived."
"7181","7. REPRESENTATIONS OF SUB-ADVISER. The Sub-Adviser"
"7182","represents, warrants and agrees as follows:"
"7183","(a) The Sub-Adviser (i) is registered as an investment"
"7184","adviser under the Advisers Act and will continue to be so registered"
"7185","for so long as this Agreement remains in effect; (ii) is not"
"7186","prohibited by the 1940 Act or the Advisers Act from performing the"
"7187","services contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) has met, and will seek"
"7188","to continue to meet for so long as this Agreement remains in effect,"
"7189","any other applicable federal or state requirements, or the applicable"
"7190","requirements of any regulatory or industry self-regulatory agency,"
"7191","necessary to be met in order to perform the services contemplated by"
"7192","this Agreement; (iv) has the authority to enter into and perform the"
"7193","services contemplated by this Agreement; and (v) will promptly notify"
"7194","UBS Global Americas of the occurrence of any event that would"
"7195","disqualify the Sub-Adviser from serving as an investment adviser of"
"7196","an investment company pursuant to Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act or"
"7197","otherwise."
"7198","(b) The Sub-Adviser has adopted a written code of ethics"
"7199","complying with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and"
"7200","will provide UBS Global Americas and the Board with a copy of such"
"7201","code of ethics, together with evidence of its adoption. Within"
"7202","fifteen days of the end of the last calendar quarter of each year"
"7203","that this Agreement is in effect, a duly authorized officer of the"
"7204","Sub-Adviser shall certify to UBS Global Americas that the Sub-Adviser"
"7205","has complied with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 during the previous"
"7206","year and that there has been no material violation of the Sub-"
"7207","Adviser's code of ethics or, if such a violation has occurred, that"
"7208","appropriate action was taken in response to such violation. Upon the"
"7209","written request of UBS Global Americas, the Sub-Adviser shall permit"
"7210","UBS Global Americas, its employees or its agents to examine the"
"7211","reports required to be made by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to Rule 17j-1"
"7212","and all other records relevant to the Sub-Adviser's code of ethics."
"7213","(c) The Sub-Adviser has provided UBS Global Americas with a"
"7214","copy of its Form ADV, as most recently filed with the Securities and"
"7215","Exchange Commission (SEC), and promptly will furnish a copy of all"
"7216","amendments to UBS Global Americas at least annually. In addition, the"
"7217","Sub-Adviser has provided UBS Global Americas with certain disclosures"
"7218","required by the U.K. Financial Services Authority."
"7219","(d) The Sub-Adviser will notify UBS Global Americas of any"
"7220","change of control of the Sub-Adviser, including any change of its"
"7221","general partners or 25% shareholders or 25% limited partners, as"
"7222","applicable, and any changes in the key personnel who are either the"
"7223","portfolio manager(s) of the Portfolio or senior management of the"
"7224","Sub-Adviser, in each case prior to or promptly after such change."
"7225","(e) UBS Global Americas and the Sub-Adviser agree that"
"7226","neither of them nor any of their affiliates, will in any way refer"
"7227","directly or indirectly to their relationship with one another or any"
"7228","of their respective affiliates in offering, marketing or other"
"7229","promotional materials without the express written consent of the"
"7230","other, which consent will be promptly provided and not unreasonably"
"7231","withheld."
"7232","8. SERVICES NOT EXCLUSIVE. The services furnished by the Sub-"
"7233","Adviser hereunder are not to be deemed exclusive, and except as the"
"7234","Sub-Adviser may otherwise agree in writing, the Sub-Adviser shall be"
"7235","free to furnish similar services to others so long as its services"
"7236","under this Agreement are not impaired thereby. Nothing in this"
"7237","Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any director, officer"
"7238","or employee of the Sub-Adviser, who may also be a trustee, officer or"
"7239","employee of the Trust, to engage in any other business or to devote"
"7240","his or her time and attention in part to the management or other"
"7241","aspects of any other business, whether of a similar nature or a"
"7242","dissimilar nature."
"7243","9. DURATION AND TERMINATION."
"7244","(a) This Agreement shall become effective upon the date first"
"7245","above written, provided that this Agreement shall not take effect"
"7246","unless it has first been approved (i) by a vote of a majority of"
"7247","those trustees of the Trust who are not parties to this Agreement or"
"7248","interested persons of any such party (Independent Trustees), cast"
"7249","in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such"
"7250","approval, and (ii) by vote of a majority of the Portfolio's"
"7251","outstanding voting securities, unless UBS Global Americas has"
"7252","authority to enter into this Agreement pursuant to exemptive relief"
"7253","from the SEC without a vote of the Portfolio's outstanding voting"
"7254","securities."
"7255","(b) Unless sooner terminated as provided herein, this"
"7256","Agreement shall continue in effect for two years from its effective"
"7257","date. Thereafter, if not terminated, this Agreement shall continue"
"7258","automatically for successive periods of twelve months each, provided"
"7259","that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually (i)"
"7260","by a vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees, cast in person"
"7261","at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval, and"
"7262","(ii) by the Board or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting"
"7263","securities of the Portfolio."
"7264","(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be"
"7265","terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by vote"
"7266","of the Board or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting"
"7267","securities of the Portfolio on 30 days' written notice to the Sub-"
"7268","Adviser. This Agreement may also be terminated, without the payment"
"7269","of any penalty, by UBS Global Americas: (i) upon 120 days' written"
"7270","notice to the Sub-Adviser; (ii) upon material breach by the Sub-"
"7271","Adviser of any of the representations, warranties and agreements set"
"7272","forth in Paragraph 7 of this Agreement; or (iii) immediately if, in"
"7273","the reasonable judgment of UBS Global Americas, the Sub-Adviser"
"7274","becomes unable to discharge its duties and obligations under this"
"7275","Agreement, including circumstances such as financial insolvency of"
"7276","the Sub-Adviser or other circumstances that could adversely affect"
"7277","the Portfolio. The Sub-Adviser may terminate this Agreement at any"
"7278","time, without the payment of any penalty, on 120 days' written notice"
"7279","to UBS Global Americas. This Agreement will terminate automatically"
"7280","in the event of its assignment or upon termination of the Management"
"7281","Agreement, as it relates to this Portfolio."
"7282","10. AMENDMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. No provision of this"
"7283","Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally,"
"7284","but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom"
"7285","enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is"
"7286","sought. To the extent required by applicable law, no amendment of"
"7287","this Agreement shall be effective until approved (i) by a vote of a"
"7288","majority of the Independent Trustees, and (ii) if the terms of this"
"7289","Agreement shall have changed, by a vote of a majority of the"
"7290","Portfolio's outstanding voting securities (except in the case of"
"7291","(ii), pursuant to the terms and conditions of the SEC order"
"7292","permitting it to modify the Agreement without such vote)."
"7293","11. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be construed in"
"7294","accordance with the 1940 Act and the laws of the State of New York,"
"7295","without giving effect to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. To"
"7296","the extent that the applicable laws of the State of New York conflict"
"7297","with the applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, the latter shall"
"7298","control."
"7299","12. MISCELLANEOUS. The captions in this Agreement are"
"7300","included for convenience of reference only and in no way define or"
"7301","delimit any of the provisions hereof or otherwise affect their"
"7302","construction or effect. If any provision of this Agreement shall be"
"7303","held or made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or otherwise,"
"7304","the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. This"
"7305","Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the"
"7306","parties hereto and their respective successors. As used in this"
"7307","Agreement, the terms majority of the outstanding voting securities,"
"7308","affiliated person, interested person, assignment, broker,"
"7309","investment adviser, net assets, sale, sell and security"
"7310","shall have the same meanings as such terms have in the 1940 Act,"
"7311","subject to such exemption as may be granted by the SEC by any rule,"
"7312","regulation or order. Where the effect of a requirement of the federal"
"7313","securities laws reflected in any provision of this Agreement is made"
"7314","less restrictive by a rule, regulation or order of the SEC, whether"
"7315","of special or general application, such provision shall be deemed to"

"7368","SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT"
"7369","Agreement made as of July 20, 2011 between UBS GLOBAL ASSET"
"7370","MANAGEMENT (AMERICAS) INC., a Delaware corporation (UBS Global
Americas), and MONDRIAN INVESTMENT PARTNERS LIMITED (Sub-Adviser),"
"7371","a limited company organized under the laws of the United Kingdom (the"
"7372","Agreement)."
"7373","RECITALS"
"7374","(1) UBS Global Americas has entered into a Management"
"7375","Agreement dated as of August 1, 2008 (Management Agreement) with"
"7376","PACE Select Advisors Trust, an open-end management investment company"
"7377","registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended"
"7378","(1940 Act), with respect to PACE International Emerging Markets"
"7379","Equity Investments (Portfolio);"
"7380","(2) UBS Global Americas desires to continue to retain the"
"7381","Sub-Adviser to furnish certain investment advisory services to UBS"
"7382","Global Americas and the Portfolio or a designated portion of the"
"7383","assets (Segment) of the Portfolio; and"
"7384","(3) The Sub-Adviser is willing to continue to furnish such"
"7385","services;"
"7386","NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual"
"7387","covenants herein contained, UBS Global Americas and the Sub-Adviser"
"7388","agree as follows:"
"7389","1. APPOINTMENT. UBS Global Americas hereby appoints the Sub-"
"7390","Adviser as an investment Sub-Adviser with respect to the Portfolio or"
"7391","Segment for the period and on the terms set forth in this Agreement."
"7392","The Sub-Adviser accepts that appointment and agrees to render the"
"7393","services herein set forth, for the compensation herein provided."
"7394","2. DUTIES AS SUB-ADVISER."
"7395","(a) Subject to the supervision and direction of the Trust's"
"7396","Board of Trustees (the Board) and review by UBS Global Americas,"
"7397","and any written guidelines adopted by the Board or UBS Global"
"7398","Americas, the Sub-Adviser will provide a continuous investment"
"7399","program for the Portfolio or Segment, all or a designated portion of"
"7400","the assets, including investment research and discretionary"
"7401","management with respect to all securities and investments and cash"
"7402","equivalents in the Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-Adviser will"
"7403","determine from time to time what investments will be purchased,"
"7404","retained or sold by the Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-Adviser will be"
"7405","responsible for placing purchase and sell orders for investments and"
"7406","for other related transactions for the Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-"
"7407","Adviser understands that the Portfolio's assets need to be managed so"
"7408","as to permit the Portfolio to qualify or to continue to qualify as a"
"7409","regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal"
"7410","Revenue Code, as amended (Code). The Sub-Adviser will provide"
"7411","services under this Agreement in accordance with the Portfolio's"
"7412","investment objective, policies and restrictions as stated in the"
"7413","Trust's currently effective registration statement under the 1940"
"7414","Act, and any amendments or supplements thereto (Registration
Statement)."
"7415","(b) The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not consult with any"
"7416","other Sub-Adviser (Other Sub-Adviser) for the Trust or Portfolio"
"7417","concerning any transaction by the Portfolio or Segment in securities"
"7418","or other assets, including (i) the purchase by the Portfolio or"
"7419","Segment of a security issued by the Other Sub-Adviser, or an"
"7420","affiliate of the Other Sub-Adviser, to the Trust or Portfolio except"
"7421","as permitted by the 1940 Act or (ii) transactions by the Portfolio or"
"7422","Segment in any security for which the Other Sub-Adviser, or its"
"7423","affiliate, is the principal underwriter."
"7424","(c) The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will be responsible for"
"7425","voting proxies of issuers of securities held by the Portfolio or"
"7426","Segment. The Sub-Adviser further agrees that it will adopt written"
"7427","proxy voting procedures that shall comply with the requirements of"
"7428","the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended"
"7429","(Advisers Act), and that shall be acceptable to the Board.  The"
"7430","Sub-Adviser further agrees that it will provide the Board on or"
"7431","before August 1st of each year, or more frequently as the Board may"
"7432","reasonably request, with a written report of the proxies voted during"
"7433","the most recent 12-month period ending June 30, or such other period"
"7434","as the Board may designate, in a format that shall comply with the"
"7435","1940 Act and that shall be acceptable to the"
"7436","Board."
"7437","(d) The Sub-Adviser agrees that, in placing orders with"
"7438","brokers, it will obtain the best net result in terms of price and"
"7439","execution. The Sub-Adviser may aggregate sales and purchase orders"
"7440","with respect to the assets of the Portfolio or Segment with similar"
"7441","orders being made simultaneously for other accounts advised by the"
"7442","Sub-Adviser or its affiliates. Whenever the Sub-Adviser"
"7443","simultaneously places orders to purchase or sell the same security on"
"7444","behalf of the Portfolio or Segment and one or more other accounts"
"7445","advised by the Sub-Adviser, the orders will be allocated as to price"
"7446","and amount among all such accounts in a manner believed to be"
"7447","equitable over time to each account. UBS Global Americas recognizes"
"7448","that in some cases this procedure may adversely affect the results"
"7449","obtained for the Portfolio or Segment."
"7450","Subject to the Sub-Adviser's obligations to seek best"
"7451","execution, UBS Global Americas agrees that the Sub-Adviser, in its"
"7452","sole discretion, may place transactions on behalf of the Portfolio or"
"7453","Segment and the Trust with any broker-dealer deemed to be an"
"7454","affiliate of the Sub-Adviser (the Affiliated Broker-Dealers) so"
"7455","long as such transactions are effected in conformity with the"
"7456","requirements (including any applicable exemptions and administrative"
"7457","interpretations set forth in Part II of the Sub-Adviser's Form ADV"
"7458","Registration Statement on file with the Securities and Exchange"
"7459","Commission (Form ADV)) of Section 11(a)(1)(H) of the Securities"
"7460","Exchange Act of 1934. In all such dealings, the Affiliated Broker-"
"7461","Dealers shall be authorized and entitled to retain any commissions,"
"7462","remuneration or profits which may be made in such transactions and"
"7463","shall not be liable to account for the same to UBS Global Americas,"
"7464","the Portfolio or the Trust."
"7465","UBS Global Americas further authorizes the Sub-Adviser and"
"7466","its Affiliated Broker-Dealers to execute agency cross transactions"
"7467","(the Cross Transactions) on behalf of the Portfolio and the Trust."
"7468","Cross Transactions are transactions which may be effected by the"
"7469","Affiliated Broker-Dealers acting for both the Portfolio or the Trust"
"7470","and the counterparty to the transaction. Cross Transactions enable"
"7471","the Sub-Adviser to purchase or sell a block of securities for the"
"7472","Portfolio or the Trust at a set price and possibly avoid an"
"7473","unfavorable price movement that may be created through entrance into"
"7474","the market with such purchase or sale order. As such, the Sub-Adviser"
"7475","believes that Cross Transactions can provide meaningful benefits for"
"7476","the Portfolio and the Trust and its clients generally. UBS Global"
"7477","Americas, the Portfolio and the Trust should be aware, however, that"
"7478","in a Cross Transaction an Affiliated Broker-Dealer will be receiving"
"7479","commissions from both sides of the trade and, therefore, there is a"
"7480","potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities."
"7481","(e) The Sub-Adviser will maintain all books and records"
"7482","required to be maintained pursuant to Rule 31a-1(b)(2)(ii)(3), (5),"
"7483","(6), (7), (9) and (10) under the 1940 Act and the rules and"
"7484","regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to transactions by"
"7485","the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment, and will"
"7486","furnish the Board and UBS Global Americas with such periodic and"
"7487","special reports as the Board or UBS Global Americas reasonably may"
"7488","request. In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the"
"7489","1940 Act, the Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that all records which it"
"7490","maintains for the Portfolio or Segment are the property of the Trust,"
"7491","agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31 a-2 under"
"7492","the 1940 Act any records which it maintains for the Portfolio or"
"7493","Segment and which are required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under"
"7494","the 1940 Act, and further agrees to surrender promptly to the Trust"
"7495","any records which it maintains for the Portfolio or Segment upon"
"7496","request by the Trust."
"7497","(f) At such times as shall be reasonably requested by the"
"7498","Board or UBS Global Americas, the Sub-Adviser will provide the Board"
"7499","and UBS Global Americas with economic and investment analyses and"
"7500","reports as well as quarterly reports setting forth the performance of"
"7501","the Portfolio or Segment and make available to the Board and UBS"
"7502","Global Americas any economic, statistical and investment services"
"7503","that the Sub-Adviser normally makes available to its institutional or"
"7504","other customers."
"7505","(g) In accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, as"
"7506","amended from time to time, the Sub-Adviser is responsible for"
"7507","assisting in the fair valuation of all portfolio securities in the"
"7508","Portfolio or Segment and will use its reasonable efforts to arrange"
"7509","for the provision of a price or prices from one or more parties"
"7510","independent of the Sub-Adviser for each portfolio security for which"
"7511","the custodian does not obtain prices in the ordinary course of"
"7512","business from an automated pricing service."
"7513","3. FURTHER DUTIES. In all matters relating to the performance"
"7514","of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will seek to act in conformity"
"7515","with the Trust's Trust Instrument, By-Laws and Registration Statement"
"7516","and with the written instructions and written directions of the Board"
"7517","and UBS Global Americas and will comply with the applicable"
"7518","requirements of the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, and the rules under"
"7519","each, the Code, and all other federal and state laws and regulations"
"7520","applicable to the Trust and the Portfolio. UBS Global Americas agrees"
"7521","to provide to the Sub-Adviser copies of the Trust's Trust Instrument,"
"7522","By-Laws, Registration Statement, written instructions and directions"
"7523","of the Board and UBS Global Americas, and any amendments or"
"7524","supplements to any of these materials as soon as practicable after"
"7525","such materials become available; provided, however, that the Sub-"
"7526","Adviser's duty under this Agreement to act in conformity with any"
"7527","document, instruction or guideline produced by the Trust or UBS"
"7528","Global Americas shall not arise until it has been delivered to the"
"7529","Sub-Adviser. Any changes to the objectives, policies and restrictions"
"7530","will make due allowance for the time within which the Sub-Adviser"
"7531","shall have to come into compliance. UBS Global Americas further"
"7532","agrees to identify to the Sub-Adviser in writing any broker-dealers"
"7533","that are affiliated with UBS Global Americas (other than UBS"
"7534","Financial Services Inc.)."
"7535","4. EXPENSES. During the term of this Agreement, the Sub-"
"7536","Adviser will bear all expenses incurred by it in connection with its"
"7537","services under this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser shall not be"
"7538","responsible for any expenses incurred by the Trust, the Portfolio or"
"7539","UBS Global Americas."
"7540","5. COMPENSATION."
"7541","(a) For the services provided and the expenses assumed by the"
"7542","Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, UBS Global Americas, not the"
"7543","Portfolio, will pay to the Sub-Adviser a fee, computed daily and"
"7544","payable monthly, at an annual rate of 0.65% up to $150 million, 0.55%"
"7545","next $100 million and 0.50% on assets in excess of $250 million of"
"7546","the average daily net assets of the Portfolio or Segment (computed in"
"7547","the manner specified in the Management Agreement), and will provide"
"7548","the Sub-Adviser with a schedule showing the manner in which the fee"
"7549","was computed. If the Sub-Adviser is managing a Segment, its fees will"
"7550","be based on the value of the assets of the Portfolio within the Sub-"
"7551","Adviser's Segment."
"7552","(b) The fee shall be accrued daily and payable monthly to the"
"7553","Sub-Adviser on or before the last business day of the next succeeding"
"7554","calendar month."
"7555","(c) For those periods in which UBS Global Americas has agreed"
"7556","to waive all or a portion of its management fee, UBS Global Americas"
"7557","may ask the. Sub-Adviser to waive the same proportion of its fees,"
"7558","but the Sub-Adviser is under no obligation to do so."
"7559","(d) If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates before"
"7560","the end of any month, the fee for the period from the effective date"
"7561","to the end of the month or from the beginning of such month to the"
"7562","date of termination, as the case may be, shall be pro-rated according"
"7563","to the proportion which such period bears to the full month in that"
"7564","such effectiveness or termination occurs."
"7565","6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY."
"7566","(a) The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any error of"
"7567","judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Portfolio,"
"7568","the Trust or its shareholders or by UBS Global Americas in connection"
"7569","with the matters to which this Agreement relates, except a loss"
"7570","resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on"
"7571","its part in the performance of its duties or from reckless disregard"
"7572","by it of its obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"7573","(b) In no event will the Sub-Adviser have any responsibility"
"7574","for any other portfolio of the Trust, for any portion of the"
"7575","Portfolio not managed by the Sub-Adviser or for the acts or omissions"
"7576","of any Other Sub-Adviser to the Trust or Portfolio."
"7577","In particular, in the event the Sub-Adviser shall manage only"
"7578","a portion of the Portfolio's Segment of the Portfolio, the Sub-"
"7579","Adviser shall have no responsibility for the Portfolio's being in"
"7580","violation of any applicable law or regulation or investment policy or"
"7581","restriction applicable to the Portfolio as a whole or for the"
"7582","Portfolio's failing to qualify as a regulated investment company"
"7583","under the Code, if the securities and other holdings of the Segment"
"7584","of the Portfolio managed by the Sub-Adviser are such that such"
"7585","Segment would not be in such violation or fail to so qualify if such"
"7586","Segment were deemed a separate series of the Trust or a separate"
"7587","regulated investment company under the Code."
"7588","7. REPRESENTATIONS OF SUB-ADVISER. The Sub-Adviser"
"7589","represents, warrants and agrees as follows:"
"7590","(a) The Sub-Adviser (i) is registered as an investment"
"7591","adviser under the Advisers Act and will continue to be so registered"
"7592","for so long as this Agreement remains in effect; (ii) is not"
"7593","prohibited by the 1940 Act or the Advisers Act from performing the"
"7594","services contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) has met, and will seek"
"7595","to continue to meet for so long as this Agreement remains in effect,"
"7596","any other applicable federal or state requirements, or the applicable"
"7597","requirements of any regulatory or industry self-regulatory agency,"
"7598","necessary to be met in order to perform the services contemplated by"
"7599","this Agreement; (iv) has the authority to enter into and perform the"
"7600","services contemplated by this"
"7601","Agreement; and (v) will promptly notify UBS Global Americas of the"
"7602","occurrence of any event that would disqualify the Sub-Adviser from"
"7603","serving as an investment adviser of an investment company pursuant to"
"7604","Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act or otherwise."
"7605","(b) The Sub-Adviser has adopted a written code of ethics"
"7606","complying with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and"
"7607","will provide UBS Global Americas and the Board with a copy of such"
"7608","code of ethics, together with evidence of its adoption. Within"
"7609","fifteen days of the end of the last calendar quarter of each year"
"7610","that this Agreement is in effect, a duly authorized officer of the"
"7611","Sub-Adviser shall certify to UBS Global Americas that the Sub-Adviser"
"7612","has complied with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 during the previous"
"7613","year and that there has been no violation of the Sub-Adviser's code"
"7614","of ethics or, if such a violation has occurred, that appropriate"
"7615","action was taken in response to such violation. Upon the written"
"7616","request of UBS Global Americas, the Sub-Adviser shall permit UBS"
"7617","Global Americas, its employees or its agents to examine the reports"
"7618","required to be made by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to Rule 17j-1(c)(1)"
"7619","and all other records relevant to the Sub-Adviser's code of ethics."
"7620","(c) The Sub-Adviser has provided UBS Global Americas with a"
"7621","copy of its Form ADV as most recently filed with the Securities and"
"7622","Exchange Commission (SEC) and promptly will furnish a copy of all"
"7623","amendments to UBS Global Americas at least annually."
"7624","(d) The Sub-Adviser will notify UBS Global Americas of any"
"7625","change of control of the Sub-Adviser, including any change of its"
"7626","general partners or 25% shareholders or 25% limited partners, as"
"7627","applicable, and any changes in the key personnel who are either the"
"7628","portfolio manager(s) of the Portfolio or senior management of the"
"7629","Sub-Adviser, in each case prior to or promptly after such change."
"7630","(e) UBS Global Americas and the Sub-Adviser agree that"
"7631","neither of them nor any of their affiliates, will in any way refer"
"7632","directly or indirectly to their relationship with one another or any"
"7633","of their respective affiliates in offering, marketing or other"
"7634","promotional materials without the express written consent of the"
"7635","other, which consent will be promptly provided and not unreasonably"
"7636","withheld."
"7637","8. SERVICES NOT EXCLUSIVE. The services furnished by the Sub-"
"7638","Adviser hereunder are not to be deemed exclusive, and except as the"
"7639","Sub-Adviser may otherwise agree in writing, the Sub-Adviser shall be"
"7640","free to furnish similar services to others so long as its services"
"7641","under this Agreement are not impaired thereby. Nothing in this"
"7642","Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any director, officer"
"7643","or employee of the Sub-Adviser, who may also be a trustee, officer or"
"7644","employee of the Trust, to engage in any other business or to devote"
"7645","his or her time and attention in part to the management or other"
"7646","aspects of any other business, whether of a similar nature or a"
"7647","dissimilar nature."
"7648","9. DURATION AND TERMINATION."
"7649","(a) This Agreement shall become effective upon the date first"
"7650","above written, provided that this Agreement shall not take effect"
"7651","unless it has first been approved (i) by a vote of a majority of"
"7652","those trustees of the Trust who are not parties to this Agreement or"
"7653","interested persons of any such party (Independent Trustees), cast"
"7654","in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such"
"7655","approval, and (ii) by vote of a majority of the Portfolio's"
"7656","outstanding voting securities; unless UBS Global Americas has"
"7657","authority to enter into this Agreement pursuant to exemptive relief"
"7658","from the SEC without a vote of the Portfolio's outstanding voting"
"7659","securities."
"7660","(b) Unless sooner terminated as provided herein, this"
"7661","Agreement shall continue in effect for two years from its effective"
"7662","date. Thereafter, if not terminated, this Agreement shall continue"
"7663","automatically for successive periods of twelve months each, provided"
"7664","that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually (i)"
"7665","by a vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees, cast in person"
"7666","at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval, and"
"7667","(ii) by the Board or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting"
"7668","securities of the Portfolio."
"7669","(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be"
"7670","terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by vote"
"7671","of the Board or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting"
"7672","securities of the Portfolio on 30 days' written notice to the Sub-"
"7673","Adviser. This Agreement may also be terminated, without the payment"
"7674","of any penalty, by UBS Global Americas: (i) upon 120 days' written"
"7675","notice to the Sub-Adviser; (ii) upon material breach by the Sub-"
"7676","Adviser of any of the representations, warranties and agreements set"
"7677","forth in Paragraph 7 of this Agreement; or (iii) immediately if, in"
"7678","the reasonable judgment of UBS Global Americas, the Sub-Adviser"
"7679","becomes unable to discharge its duties and obligations under this"
"7680","Agreement, including circumstances such as financial insolvency of"
"7681","the Sub-Adviser or other circumstances that could adversely affect"
"7682","the Portfolio. The Sub-Adviser may terminate this Agreement at any"
"7683","time, without the payment of any penalty, on 120 days' written notice"
"7684","to UBS Global Americas.  This Agreement will terminate automatically"
"7685","in the event of its assignment or upon termination of the Management"
"7686","Agreement, as it related to this Portfolio."
"7687","10. AMENDMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. No provision of this"
"7688","Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally,"
"7689","but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom"
"7690","enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is"
"7691","sought. To the extent required by applicable law, no amendment of"
"7692","this Agreement shall be effective until approved (i) by a vote of a"
"7693","majority of the Independent Trustees, and (ii) if the terms of this"
"7694","Agreement shall have changed, by a vote of a majority of the"
"7695","Portfolio's outstanding voting securities (except in the case of"
"7696","(ii), pursuant to the terms and conditions of the SEC order"
"7697","permitting it to modify the Agreement without such vote)."
"7698","11. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be construed in"
"7699","accordance with the 1940 Act and the laws of the State of New York,"
"7700","without giving effect to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. To"
"7701","the extent that the applicable laws of the State of New York conflict"
"7702","with the applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, the latter shall"
"7703","control."
"7704","12. MISCELLANEOUS. The captions in this Agreement are"
"7705","included for convenience of reference only and in no way define or"
"7706","delimit any of the provisions hereof or otherwise affect their"
"7707","construction or effect. If any provision of this Agreement shall be"
"7708","held or made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or otherwise,"
"7709","the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. This"
"7710","Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the"
"7711","parties hereto and their respective successors. As used in this"
"7712","Agreement, the terms majority of the outstanding voting securities,"
"7713","affiliated person, interested person, assignment, broker,"
"7714","investment adviser, net assets, sale, sell and security"
"7715","shall have the same meanings as such terms have in the 1940 Act,"
"7716","subject to such exemption as may be granted by the SEC by any rule,"
"7717","regulation or order. Where the effect of a requirement of the federal"
"7718","securities laws reflected in any provision of this Agreement is made"
"7719","less restrictive by a rule, regulation or order of the SEC, whether"
"7720","of special or general application, such provision shall be deemed to"

"7773","SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT"
"7774","Agreement dated as of July 1, 2011 between UBS Global Asset"
"7775","Management (Americas) Inc. (UBS Global AM), a Delaware corporation,"
"7776","and CBRE Clarion Securities, LLC (Sub- Adviser), a Delaware limited"
"7777","liability company (the Agreement)."
"7778","RECITALS"
"7779","(1)	UBS Global AM has entered into a Management Agreement dated as"
"7780","of August 1, 2008  (Management Agreement), with PACE(r) Select"
"7781","Advisors Trust (Trust), an open-end management investment company"
"7782","registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended"
"7783","(1940 Act), with respect to PACE(r) Global Real Estate Securities"
"7784","Investments  (Portfolio); and"
"7785","(2) 	UBS Global AM is authorized to retain one or more sub-advisers"
"7786","to furnish certain investment advisory services to UBS Global AM and"
"7787","the Portfolio;"
"7788","(3)	UBS Global AM desires to retain the Sub-Adviser to furnish"
"7789","certain investment advisory services to UBS Global AM and the"
"7790","Portfolio or a designated portion of the assets (Segment) of the"
"7791","Portfolio; and"
"7792","(4)	The Sub-Adviser is willing to furnish such services;"
"7793","Now therefore, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants"
"7794","herein contained, UBS Global AM and the Sub-Adviser agree as follows:"
"7795","1.	Appointment.  UBS Global AM hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser as"
"7796","an investment sub-adviser with respect to the Portfolio or Segment"
"7797","for the period and on the terms set forth in this Agreement. The Sub-"
"7798","Adviser accepts that appointment and agrees to render the services"
"7799","herein set forth, for the compensation herein provided."
"7800","2.	Duties as Sub-Adviser."
"7801","(a)	Subject to the supervision and direction of the Trust's Board"
"7802","of Trustees (the Board) and review by UBS Global AM, and any"
"7803","written guidelines adopted by the Board or UBS Global AM the Sub-"
"7804","Adviser will provide a continuous investment program for the"
"7805","Portfolio or Segment, including investment research and discretionary"
"7806","management with respect to all securities and investments and cash"
"7807","equivalents in the Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-Adviser will"
"7808","determine from time to time what investments will be purchased,"
"7809","retained or sold by the Portfolio or Segment.  The Sub-Adviser"
"7810","will be responsible for placing purchase and sell orders for"
"7811","investments and for other related transactions for the Portfolio or"
"7812","Segment. The Sub-Adviser understands that the Portfolio's assets need"
"7813","to be managed so as to permit the Portfolio to qualify or to continue"
"7814","to qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of"
"7815","the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (Code).  The Sub-Adviser will"
"7816","provide services under this Agreement in accordance with the"
"7817","Portfolio's investment objective, policies and restrictions as stated"
"7818","in the Trust's currently effective registration statement under the"
"7819","1940 Act, and any amendments or supplements thereto (Registration
Statement).  The Sub-Adviser, on each business day, shall provide"
"7820","UBS Global AM and the Trust's custodian such information as UBS"
"7821","Global AM and the Trust's custodian may reasonably request relating"
"7822","to all transactions concerning the Portfolio or Segment."
"7823","UBS Global AM hereby designates and appoints the Sub-Adviser as its"
"7824","and the Portfolio's limited purpose agent and attorney-in-fact,"
"7825","without further prior approval of UBS Global AM (except as expressly"
"7826","provided for herein or as may be required by law) to make and"
"7827","execute, in the name and on behalf of the Portfolio, all agreements,"
"7828","instruments and other documents and to take all such other action"
"7829","which the Sub-Adviser considers necessary or advisable to carry out"
"7830","its duties hereunder. By way of example and not by way of limitation,"
"7831","in connection with any purchase for the  Portfolio or Segment of"
"7832","securities or instruments that are not registered under the U.S."
"7833","Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), the Sub-"
"7834","Adviser shall have the full power and authority, among other things,"
"7835","to: (i) commit to purchase such securities for the Portfolio on the"
"7836","terms and conditions under which such securities are offered; (ii)"
"7837","execute such account opening and other agreements, instruments and"
"7838","documents (including, without limitation, purchase agreements,"
"7839","subscription documents, ISDA and other swap and derivative"
"7840","documents), and make such commitments, as may be required in"
"7841","connection with the purchase and sale of such securities or"
"7842","instruments; (iii) represent that the Portfolio is an accredited
investor as defined in Rule 501 (a) of Regulation D under the"
"7843","Securities Act and a Qualified Institutional Buyer as defined in"
"7844","Rule 144A (a) (1) (i) under the Securities Act; and (iv) commit that"
"7845","such securities will not be offered or sold by the Portfolio except"
"7846","in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities"
"7847","Act or an exemption therefrom. This power-of-attorney is a continuing"
"7848","power-of-attorney and shall remain in full force and effect until"
"7849","revoked by UBS Global AM or the Trust in writing, but any such"
"7850","revocation shall not affect any transaction initiated prior to"
"7851","receipt by the Sub-Adviser of such notice."
"7852","(b)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not consult with any other"
"7853","sub-adviser (Other Sub-Adviser) for the Trust or Portfolio"
"7854","concerning any transaction by the Portfolio or Segment in securities"
"7855","or other assets, including (i) the purchase by the Portfolio or"
"7856","Segment of a security issued by the Other Sub-Adviser, or an"
"7857","affiliate of the Other Sub-Adviser, to the Trust or Portfolio except"
"7858","as permitted by the 1940 Act or (ii) transactions by the Portfolio or"
"7859","Segment in any security for which the Other Sub-Adviser, or its"
"7860","affiliate, is the principal underwriter."
"7861","(c)	Unless otherwise instructed by UBS Global AM or the Trust, the"
"7862","Sub-Adviser agrees that it will be responsible for voting proxies of"
"7863","issuers of securities held by the Portfolio or Segment.  The Sub-"
"7864","Adviser further agrees that it will adopt written proxy voting"
"7865","procedures that shall comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act"
"7866","and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (Advisers Act)"
"7867","(Proxy Voting Policy), and that shall be acceptable to the Board."
"7868","The Sub-Adviser shall also provide its Proxy Voting Policy, and if"
"7869","requested by UBS Global AM, a summary of such Proxy Voting Policy for"
"7870","inclusion in the Trust's registration statement, and will provide UBS"
"7871","Global AM with any material amendment to the Proxy Voting Policy"
"7872","within a reasonable time after such amendment has taken effect.  The"
"7873","Sub-Adviser further agrees that it will provide the Board on or"
"7874","before August 1st of each year, or more frequently as the Board may"
"7875","reasonably request, with a written report of the proxies voted during"
"7876","the most recent 12-month period ending June 30, or such other period"
"7877","as the Board may designate, in a format that shall comply with the"
"7878","1940 Act and that shall be acceptable to the Board."
"7879","(d) The Sub-Adviser agrees that upon the request of UBS Global AM or"
"7880","the Board, Sub-Adviser shall exercise the rights incident to the"
"7881","securities held by the Portfolio or Segment in the context of a"
"7882","bankruptcy or other reorganization.  The Sub-Adviser further agrees"
"7883","that it will keep UBS Global AM fully informed about any such actions"
"7884","that it intends to take."
"7885","(e)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will place orders with brokers"
"7886","in accordance with best execution policies, taking into account best"
"7887","price as an important factor in this decision, provided that, on"
"7888","behalf of the Portfolio or Segment, the Sub-Adviser may, in its"
"7889","discretion, use brokers that provide the Sub-Adviser with research,"
"7890","analysis, advice and similar services to execute portfolio"
"7891","transactions on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment, and the Sub-"
"7892","Adviser may pay to those brokers in return for brokerage and research"
"7893","services a higher commission than may be charged by other brokers,"
"7894","subject to the Sub-Adviser's determination in good faith that such"
"7895","commission is reasonable in terms either of the particular"
"7896","transaction or of the overall responsibility of the Sub-Adviser to"
"7897","the Portfolio or Segment and its other clients and that the total"
"7898","commissions paid by the Portfolio or Segment will be reasonable in"
"7899","relation to the benefits to the Portfolio or Segment over the long"
"7900","term.  In no instance will portfolio securities be purchased from or"
"7901","sold to UBS Global AM or the Sub-Adviser, the Trust's principal"
"7902","underwriter, or any affiliated person thereof, except in accordance"
"7903","with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations"
"7904","thereunder.  The Sub-Adviser may aggregate sales and purchase orders"
"7905","with respect to the assets of the Portfolio or Segment with similar"
"7906","orders being made simultaneously for other accounts advised by the"
"7907","Sub-Adviser or its affiliates.  Whenever the Sub-Adviser"
"7908","simultaneously places orders to purchase or sell the same security on"
"7909","behalf of the Portfolio or Segment and one or more other accounts"
"7910","advised by the Sub-Adviser, the orders will be allocated as to price"
"7911","and amount among all such accounts in a manner believed to be"
"7912","equitable over time to each account.  UBS Global AM recognizes that"
"7913","in some cases this procedure may adversely affect the results"
"7914","obtained for the Portfolio or Segment."
"7915","Subject to the Sub-Adviser's obligations to seek best execution, UBS"
"7916","Global AM agrees that the Sub-Adviser, in its sole discretion, may"
"7917","place transactions on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment and the"
"7918","Trust with any broker-dealer deemed to be an affiliate (including"
"7919","affiliated FCMs) of the Sub-Adviser (the Affiliated Broker-Dealers)"
"7920","so long as such transactions are effected in conformity with the"
"7921","requirements (including any applicable exemptions and administrative"
"7922","interpretations set forth in Part II of the Sub-Adviser's Form ADV"
"7923","Registration Statement on file with the Securities and Exchange"
"7924","Commission (Form ADV)) of Section 11(a)(1)(H) of the Securities"
"7925","Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act), and in compliance with Rules"
"7926","17e-1 or 10f-3 under the 1940 Act or other applicable rules and the"
"7927","Trust's policies and procedures thereunder.  In all such dealings,"
"7928","the Affiliated Broker-Dealers shall be authorized and entitled to"
"7929","retain any commissions, remuneration or profits which may be made in"
"7930","such transactions and shall not be liable to account for the same to"
"7931","UBS Global AM, the Portfolio or the Trust.  In the event Sub-Adviser"
"7932","becomes affiliated (as deemed under the federal securities laws) with"
"7933","a broker-dealer during the term of this Agreement, Sub-Adviser shall"
"7934","obtain the approval of the Trust's Board of Trustees prior to"
"7935","commencement of transactions with such broker-dealer on behalf of the"
"7936","Portfolio or the Trust."
"7937","UBS Global AM further authorizes the Sub-Adviser and its Affiliated"
"7938","Broker-Dealers to execute agency cross transactions (the Cross
Transactions) on behalf of the Portfolio and the Trust. Cross"
"7939","Transactions are transactions which may be effected by the Affiliated"
"7940","Broker-Dealers acting for both the Portfolio or the Trust and the"
"7941","counterparty to the transaction.  Cross Transactions enable the Sub-"
"7942","Adviser to purchase or sell a block of securities for the Portfolio"
"7943","or the Trust at a set price and possibly avoid an unfavorable price"
"7944","movement that may be created through entrance into the market with"
"7945","such purchase or sale order.  As such, the Sub-Adviser believes that"
"7946","Cross Transactions can provide meaningful benefits for the Portfolio"
"7947","and the Trust and its clients generally.  UBS Global AM, the"
"7948","Portfolio and the Trust should be aware, however, that in a Cross"
"7949","Transaction an Affiliated Broker-Dealer will be receiving commissions"
"7950","from both sides of the trade and, therefore, there is a potentially"
"7951","conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities.  Sub-Adviser"
"7952","shall effect such Cross Transactions in compliance with Rule 206(3)-2"
"7953","under the Advisers Act, Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act, and any other"
"7954","applicable provisions of the federal securities laws and shall"
"7955","provide UBS Global AM with periodic reports describing such agency"
"7956","cross transactions.  UBS Global AM understands that the authority of"
"7957","the Sub-Adviser to execute agency Cross Transactions for the"
"7958","Portfolio is terminable at will without penalty, effective upon"
"7959","receipt by the Sub-Adviser of written notice from UBS Global AM, and"
"7960","that the failure to terminate such authorization will result in its"
"7961","continuation."
"7962","(f)	The Sub-Adviser shall maintain separate detailed records of all"
"7963","matters pertaining to the Portfolio or Segment, including, without"
"7964","limitation, brokerage and other records of all securities"
"7965","transactions.  Any records required to be maintained and preserved"
"7966","pursuant to the provisions of Rule 31a-1 and Rule 31a-2 promulgated"
"7967","under the 1940 Act that are prepared or maintained by the Sub-Adviser"
"7968","on behalf of the Trust are the property of the Trust and will be"
"7969","surrendered promptly to the Trust upon request. The Sub-Adviser"
"7970","further agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed in"
"7971","Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the records required to be maintained"
"7972","under Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and will furnish the Board and"
"7973","UBS Global AM with such periodic and special reports as the Board or"
"7974","UBS Global AM may request."
"7975","(g)	At such times as shall be reasonably requested by the Board or"
"7976","UBS Global AM, the Sub-Adviser will provide the Board and UBS Global"
"7977","AM with economic and investment analyses and reports as well as"
"7978","quarterly reports setting forth the performance of the Portfolio or"
"7979","Segment and make available to the Board and UBS Global AM any"
"7980","economic, statistical and investment services that the Sub-Adviser"
"7981","normally makes available to its institutional or other customers."
"7982","(h)	In accordance with procedures adopted by the Board, as amended"
"7983","from time to time, the Sub-Adviser is responsible for assisting the"
"7984","Board and UBS Global AM in the fair valuation of all portfolio"
"7985","securities in the Portfolio or Segment and will use its reasonable"
"7986","efforts to arrange for the provision of a price or prices from one or"
"7987","more parties independent of the Sub-Adviser for each portfolio"
"7988","security for which the custodian does not obtain prices in the"
"7989","ordinary course of business from an automated pricing service."
"7990","The Sub-Adviser also will provide such information or perform such"
"7991","additional acts as are customarily performed by a Sub-Adviser and may"
"7992","be required for the Trust or UBS Global AM to comply with their"
"7993","respective obligations under applicable federal securities laws,"
"7994","including, without limitation, the"
"7995","1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the 1934 Act, the Securities Act, and any"
"7996","rule or regulation thereunder."
"7997","3.	Further Duties.  In all matters relating to the performance of"
"7998","this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will seek to act in conformity with"

"8085","monthly, at an annual rate of 0.40% of the average daily net assets"
"8086","of the Portfolio or Segment allocated to its management (computed in"
"8087","the manner specified in the Management Agreement), and will provide"
"8088","the Sub-Adviser with a schedule showing the manner in which the fee"
"8089","was computed.  If the Sub-Adviser is managing a Segment, its fees"

"8091","Sub-Adviser's Segment."
"8092","(b)	The fee shall be accrued daily and payable monthly to the Sub-"

"8096","all or a portion of its management fee, UBS Global AM may ask the"
"8097","Sub-Adviser to waive the same proportion of its fees, but the Sub-"
"8098","Adviser is under no obligation to do so."
"8099","(d)	If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates before the"
"8100","end of any month, the fee for the period from the effective date to"
"8101","the end of the month or from the beginning of such month to the date"
"8102","of termination, as the case may be, shall be pro-rated according to"
"8103","the proportion which such period bears to the full month in that such"
"8104","effectiveness or termination occurs."
"8105","6. Limitation of Liability."
"8106","(a) 	The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any error of judgment"
"8107","or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Portfolio, the"
"8108","Trust or its shareholders or by UBS Global AM in connection with the"
"8109","matters to which this Agreement relates, except a loss resulting from"
"8110","willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the"

"8112","obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"8113","(b)	In no event will the Sub-Adviser have any responsibility for"
"8114","any other portfolio of the Trust, for any portion of the Portfolio"
"8115","not managed by the Sub-Adviser or for the acts or omissions of any"
"8116","Other Sub-Adviser to the Trust or Portfolio. In particular, in the"
"8117","event the Sub-Adviser shall manage only a Segment of the Portfolio,"
"8118","the Sub-Adviser shall have no responsibility for the Portfolio's"
"8119","being in violation of any applicable law or regulation or investment"
"8120","policy or restriction applicable to the Portfolio as a whole or for"
"8121","the Portfolio's failing to qualify as a regulated investment company"
"8122","under the Code, if the securities and other holdings of the Segment"
"8123","of the Portfolio managed by the"
"8124","Sub-Adviser are such that such Segment would not be in such violation"
"8125","or fail to so qualify if such Segment were deemed a separate series"
"8126","of the Trust or a separate regulated investment company under the"
"8127","Code, unless such violation was due to the Sub-Advisers failure to"
"8128","comply with written guidelines adopted by the Board or UBS Global AM"
"8129","and provided to the Sub-Adviser."
"8130","Nothing in this section shall be deemed a limitation or waiver of any"
"8131","obligation or duty that may not by law be limited or waived."
"8132","7.	Representations of Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser represents,"
"8133","warrants and agrees as follows:"

"8148","of the 1940 Act or otherwise."
"8149","(b)	The Sub-Adviser has adopted a written code of ethics complying"
"8150","with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-"

"8172","manager(s) of the Portfolio or senior management of the Sub-Adviser,"
"8173","in each case prior to or as soon after such change as possible."
"8174","(e)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that neither it nor any of its"
"8175","affiliates, will in any way refer directly or indirectly to its"
"8176","relationship with the Trust, the Portfolio, UBS Global AM or any of"
"8177","their respective affiliates in offering, marketing or other"
"8178","promotional materials without the express written consent of UBS"
"8179","Global AM."
"8180","(f)	The Sub-Adviser hereby represents that it has implemented"

"8354","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"

"8367","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"8368","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"8369","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's"
"8370","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"8371","procedures that (1) pertain to the  maintenance of records that, in"
"8372","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"8373","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"8374","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"8375","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"8376","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being"
"8377","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of"
"8378","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"8379","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"8380","company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"8381","statements."
"8382","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"8383","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"8384","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"8385","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"8386","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"8387","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"8388","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"8389","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"8390","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"8391","deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"8392","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"8393","material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial"
"8394","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"8395","Our consideration of the Company's internal control over financial"
"8396","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"8397","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that"
"8398","might be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses under standards"
"8399","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"8400","States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Company's internal"
"8401","control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"8402","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as"
"8403","defined above as of July 31, 2011."
