"2812","<P>To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Fidelity Rutland Square Trust"
"2813","II:</P>"
"2814","<P></P>"
"2815","<P>In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Fidelity"
"2816","Rutland Square Trust II: Strategic Advisers Core Fund, Strategic Advisers Core"
"2817","Multi-Manager Fund, Strategic Advisers Short Duration Fund, Strategic Advisers"
"2818","Growth Fund, Strategic Advisers Growth Multi-Manager Fund, Strategic Advisers"
"2819","Value Fund, and Strategic Advisers Value Multi-Manager Fund<FONT face=Georgia>"
"2820","</FONT>(collectively, the Trust) as of and for the year ended May 31, 2012, in"
"2821","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"2822","(United States), we considered the Trust&rsquo;s internal control over financial"
"2823","reporting, including control activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"2824","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"2825","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"2826","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"2827","Trust&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not"
"2828","express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust&rsquo;s internal control over"
"2829","financial reporting.</P>"
"2830","<P>The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"2831","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"2832","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"2833","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company&rsquo;s internal control"
"2834","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2835","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"2836","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2837","accounting principles. A company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting"
"2838","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"2839","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"2840","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"2841","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2842","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"2843","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Trust are being"
"2844","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"2845","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"2846","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a Trust&rsquo;s assets"
"2847","that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
"2848","<P>Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2849","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2850","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2851","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"2852","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"

"2857","<P>&nbsp;</P>"
"2858","<P></P>"
"2859","<P></P>"
"2860","<P>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"2861","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"2862","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2863","misstatements on a timely basis. material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2864","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"2865","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2866","Trust&rsquo;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"2867","on a timely basis.</P>"
"2868","<P>Our consideration of the Trust&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting"
"2869","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"2870","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"2871","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"2872","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"2873","deficiencies in the Trust&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting and its"
"2874","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"2875","be material weaknesses as defined above as of May 31, 2012.</P>"

"7182","efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes"
"7183","brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such"

"7185","broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act.
