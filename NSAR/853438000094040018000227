"532","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"533","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Gabelli Value"
"534","25 Fund Inc.:"
"535","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"536","of The Gabelli Value 25 Fund Inc. (hereafter referred to as the"
"537","Fund) as of and for the period ended December 31, 2017, in"
"538","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"539","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's"
"540","internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"541","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"542","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"543","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"544","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"545","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"546","reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"547","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"548","reporting."
"549","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"550","maintaining effective internal control"
"551","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"552","estimates and judgments by management are"
"553","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"554","controls. A fund's internal control over"
"555","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"556","assurance regarding the reliability of"
"557","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"558","for external purposes in accordance with"
"559","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal"
"560","control over financial reporting includes those"
"561","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"562","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"563","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"564","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"565","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"566","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"567","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"568","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"569","fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"570","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"571","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect"
"572","on the financial statements."
"573","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"574","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"575","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"576","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"577","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"578","conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"579","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"580","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"581","when the design or operation of a control"
"582","does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"583","performing their assigned functions, to"
"584","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"585","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"586","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"587","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"588","misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial statements"
"589","will not be prevented or"
"590","detected on a timely basis."
"591","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"592","reporting was for the limited purpose"
"593","described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily"
"594","disclose all deficiencies in internal control over"
"595","financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"596","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"597","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"598","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"599","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that"
"600","we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of"
"601","December 31, 2017."
"602","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"603","management and the Board of Directors of the"
"604","Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"605","intended to be and should not be used by"
"606","anyone other than these specified parties."

"620","PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION PURSUANT TO RULE 12b-1"
"621","OF"
"622","THE GABELLI VALUE 25 FUND INC."
"623","  WHEREAS, THE GABELLI VALUE 25 FUND INC., a Maryland"
"624","corporation (the Fund), engages in business as an open-"
"625","end management investment company and is registered as such"
"626","under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the"
"627","Act);"
"628","  WHEREAS, the Fund has issued and is authorized to issue"
"629","shares of Common Stock (Shares);"
"630","  WHEREAS, G.distributors, LLC (the Distributor)"
"631","presently serves as the principal distributor of the Shares"
"632","pursuant to the distribution agreement between the Fund and"
"633","the Distributor, which distribution agreement, as amended,"
"634","has been duly approved by the Board of Directors of the"
"635","Fund (the Board), in accordance with the requirements of"
"636","the Act (the Distribution Agreement);"
"637","  WHEREAS, the Fund has established and plans to offer"
"638","shares of its common stock denominated as Class T Series"
"639","Shares (the Class T Series Shares), pursuant to Rule 18f-"
"640","3 under the Act that permits the Fund to implement a"
"641","multiple distribution system providing investors with the"
"642","option of purchasing shares of various classes;"
"643","  WHEREAS, the Board as a whole, and the directors who are"
"644","not interested persons of the Fund (as defined in the Act)"
"645","and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in"
"646","the operation of the plan of distribution pursuant to Rule"
"647","12b-1 under the Act (the Plan) or any agreements related"
"648","to the Plan (the Disinterested Directors), in considering"
"649","whether the Fund should implement this Plan, have evaluated"
"650","such information as they deemed necessary to make an"
"651","informed determination as to whether a written Class T Plan"
"652","should be implemented and have considered such pertinent"
"653","factors as they deemed necessary to form the basis for a"
"654","decision to use Fund assets attributable to the Fund for"
"655","such purpose; and"
"656","  WHEREAS, this Plan governs the Class T Series Shares and"
"657","does not relate to any class of shares which may be offered"
"658","and sold by the Fund other than the Class T Series Shares;"
"659","  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the"
"660","Fund hereby adopts the Plan in accordance with Rule 12b-1"
"661","under the Act on the following terms and conditions:"
"662","1. In consideration of the services to be provided, and the"
"663","expenses to be incurred, by the Distributor pursuant to the"
"664","Distribution Agreement, the Fund will pay to the"
"665","Distributor as distribution payments (the Payments) in"
"666","connection with the distribution of Class T Series Shares"
"667","an aggregate amount at a rate of 0.25% per year of the"
"668","average daily net assets of the Class T Series Shares. Such"
"669","Payments shall be accrued daily and paid monthly in arrears"
"670","or shall be accrued and paid at such other intervals as the"
"671","Board shall determine. The Fund's obligation hereunder"
"672","shall be limited to the assets of the Class T Series Shares"
"673","and shall not constitute an obligation of the Fund except"
"674","out of such assets and shall not constitute an obligation"
"675","of any shareholder of the Fund."
"676","2. It is understood that the Payments made by the Fund"
"677","under this Plan will be used by the Distributor for the"
"678","purpose of financing or assisting in the financing of any"
"679","activity which is primarily intended to result in the sale"
"680","of Class T Series Shares. The scope of the foregoing shall"
"681","be interpreted by the Board, whose decision shall be"
"682","conclusive except to the extent it contravenes established"
"683","legal authority. Without in any way limiting the discretion"
"684","of the Board, the following activities are hereby declared"
"685","to be primarily intended to result in the sale of Class T"
"686","Series Shares: advertising the Class T Series Shares or the"
"687","Fund's investment adviser's mutual fund activities;"
"688","compensating underwriters, dealers, brokers, banks and"
"689","other selling entities (including the Distributor and its"
"690","affiliates) and sales and marketing personnel of any of"
"691","them for sales of Class T Series Shares, whether in a lump"
"692","sum or on a continuous, periodic, contingent, deferred or"
"693","other basis; compensating underwriters, dealers, brokers,"
"694","banks and other servicing entities and servicing personnel"
"695","(including the Fund's investment adviser and its personnel)"
"696","of any of them for providing services to shareholders of"
"697","the Fund relating to their investment in the Class T Series"
"698","Shares, including assistance in connection with inquiries"
"699","relating to shareholder accounts; the production and"
"700","dissemination of prospectuses (including statements of"
"701","additional information) of the Fund and the preparation,"
"702","production and dissemination of sales, marketing and"
"703","shareholder servicing materials; and the ordinary or"
"704","capital expenses, such as equipment, rent, fixtures,"
"705","salaries, bonuses, reporting and recordkeeping and third"
"706","party consultancy or similar expenses relating to any"
"707","activity for which Payment is authorized by the Board; and"
"708","the financing of any activity for which Payment is"
"709","authorized by the Board; and profit to the Distributor and"
"710","its affiliates arising out of their provision of"
"711","shareholder services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this"
"712","Plan does not require the Distributor or any of its"
"713","affiliates to perform any specific type or level of"
"714","distribution activities or shareholder services or to incur"
"715","any specific level of expenses for activities covered by"
"716","this Section 2. In addition, Payments made in a particular"
"717","year shall not be refundable whether or not such Payments"
"718","exceed the expenses incurred for that year pursuant to this"
"719","Section 2."
"720","3. The Fund is hereby authorized and directed to enter into"
"721","appropriate written agreements with the Distributor and"
"722","each other person to whom the Fund intends to make any"
"723","Payment, and the Distributor is hereby authorized and"
"724","directed to enter into appropriate written agreements with"
"725","each person to whom the Distributor intends to make any"
"726","payments in the nature of a Payment. The foregoing"
"727","requirement is not intended to apply to any agreement or"
"728","arrangement with respect to which the party to whom Payment"
"729","is to be made does not have the purpose set forth in"
"730","Section 2 above (such as the printer in the case of the"
"731","printing of a prospectus or a newspaper in the case of an"
"732","advertisement) unless the Board determines that such an"
"733","agreement or arrangement should be treated as a related"
"734","agreement for purposes of Rule 12b-1 under the Act."
"735","4. Each agreement required to be in writing by Section 3"
"736","must contain the provisions required by Rule 12b-1 under"
"737","the Act and must be approved by a majority of the Board"
"738","(Board Approval) and by a majority of the Disinterested"
"739","Directors (Disinterested Director Approval), by vote cast"
"740","in person at a meeting called for the purposes of voting on"
"741","such agreement. All determinations or authorizations of the"
"742","Board hereunder shall be made by Board Approval and"
"743","Disinterested Director Approval."
"744","5. The officers, investment adviser or Distributor of the"
"745","Fund, as appropriate, shall provide to the Board and the"
"746","Board shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of"
"747","the amounts expended pursuant to this Plan and the purposes"
"748","for which such Payments were made."
"749","6. To the extent any activity is covered by Section 2 and"
"750","is also an activity which the Fund may pay for on behalf of"
"751","the Class T Series Shares without regard to the existence"
"752","or terms and conditions of a plan of distribution under"
"753","Rule 12b-1 of the Act, this Plan shall not be construed to"
"754","prevent or restrict the Fund from paying such amounts"
"755","outside of this Plan and without limitation hereby and"
"756","without such payments being included in calculation of"
"757","Payments subject to the limitation set forth in Section 1."
"758","7. This Plan may not be amended in any material respect"
"759","without Board Approval and Disinterested Director Approval"
"760","and may not be amended to increase the maximum level of"
"761","Payments permitted hereunder without such approvals and"
"762","further approval by a vote of at least a majority of the"
"763","Class T Series Shares. This Plan may continue in effect for"
"764","longer than one year after its approval by a majority of"
"765","the Class T Series Shares only as long as such continuance"
"766","is specifically approved at least annually by Board"
