"1819","To the Board of Trustees of Deutsche Institutional Funds"
"1820","and Shareholders of Deutsche EAFE(r) Equity Index Fund:"
"1821","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1822","statements of Deutsche EAFE(r) Equity Index Fund (the"
"1823","Fund), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015,"
"1824","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1825","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1826","considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1827","reporting, including control activities for safeguarding"
"1828","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"1829","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1830","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"1831","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"1832","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"1833","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"1834","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"1835","over financial reporting."
"1836","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"1837","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1838","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1839","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"1840","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"1841","A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1842","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1843","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1844","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1845","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1846","principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"1847","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1848","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1849","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1850","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1851","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1852","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1853","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"1854","and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"1855","made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1856","management and trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide"
"1857","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1858","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1859","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1860","financial statements."
"1861","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1862","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1863","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1864","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1865","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1866","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1867","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1868","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1869","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1870","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1871","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1872","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1873","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1874","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1875","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1876","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1877","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1878","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"1879","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"1880","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1881","all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting"

"2144","Item 77E - Deutsche Institutional Funds"
"2145","(formerly DWS Institutional Funds)"
"2146","On December 7, 2010, Deutsche Institutional Funds"
"2147","(formerly DWS Institutional Funds) (the Trust)"
"2148","was named as a defendant in the First Amended"
"2149","Complaint filed by the Official Committee of"
"2150","Unsecured Creditors in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court"
"2151","for the District of Delaware in the lawsuit styled"
"2152","Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of"
"2153","Tribune Company, et al., v. Fitzsimons et al. (the"
"2154","Lawsuit).  The Lawsuit arises out of a leveraged"
"2155","buyout transaction (LBO) in 2007 by which loans"
"2156","were made to the Tribune Company to fund the"
"2157","LBO and shares of the Tribune Company held by"
"2158","shareholders were tendered for or were converted to"
"2159","a right to receive cash.  Following the completion of"
"2160","the LBO in 2007, the Tribune Company filed for"
"2161","bankruptcy.  The Lawsuit seeks to recover all"
"2162","payments made to the shareholders in the LBO."
"2163","The Lawsuit has been consolidated in a multi-"
"2164","district litigation in the United States District Court"
"2165","for the Southern District of New York, case no. 12-"
"2166","MC-2296.  At the outset of the Lawsuit, the Court"
"2167","issued a scheduling order which stayed all"
"2168","substantive proceedings in the Lawsuit until after"
"2169","the decision on motions to dismiss based on certain"
"2170","defenses common to the defendants filed in related"
"2171","cases.  On September 23, 2013, the District Court"
"2172","entered an order granting the defendants' motion to"
"2173","dismiss in those related cases due to the pendency"
"2174","of the Lawsuit seeking recoveries on similar"
"2175","grounds, and the plaintiffs in the related cases have"
"2176","appealed that order to the United States Court of"
"2177","Appeals for the Second Circuit.  That appeal has"
"2178","been fully briefed and oral arguments were held in"
"2179","November 2014, but a decision remains pending."
"2180","Accordingly, the Lawsuit will continue to seek"
"2181","recovery of all amounts that the Trust received on a"
"2182","theory of intentional fraudulent conveyance.  On"
"2183","November 21, 2013, the District Court entered"
"2184","Master Case Order No. 4 (MCO 4) setting forth"
"2185","the procedures to govern the Lawsuit and"
"2186","effectively lifting the above-referenced stay. Among"
"2187","other things, MCO 4 requires the parties to present"
"2188","proposals for a structure to govern the upcoming"
"2189","pre-answer motions to dismiss stage of the"
"2190","Lawsuit.  On April 25, 2014, the District Court"
"2191","entered an order governing the upcoming stage of"
"2192","the Lawsuit, which directed Ropes & Gray, as"
"2193","Liaison Counsel to the Shareholder Defendants, to"
"2194","file a global motion to dismiss (the Global Motion
to Dismiss) the Lawsuit on behalf of all"
"2195","shareholder defendants named in Exhibit A to the"
"2196","current Fifth Amended Complaint (including the"
"2197","Trust).  Briefing of the Global Motion to Dismiss"
"2198","has concluded, and the District Court has not yet"
"2199","scheduled a date for oral argument.  The District"
"2200","Court has also deferred all other proposed motions"
"2201","to dismiss the Lawsuit, if necessary, until a later"
"2202","date to be determined. Management is currently"
"2203","assessing the Lawsuit and has not yet determined"
"2204","the effect, if any, on any series of the Trust."
