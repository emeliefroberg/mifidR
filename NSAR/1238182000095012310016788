"944","             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"945","To the Shareholders and"
"946","Board of Directors of the Seligman LaSalle Real Estate Fund Series, Inc."
"947","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of the funds"
"948","listed in the accompanying Attachment A which comprise the Seligman LaSalle Real"
"949","Estate Fund Series, Inc. as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009, in"
"950","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"951","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"952","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"953","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"954","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"955","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"956","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"957","opinion."
"958","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"959","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"960","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"961","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"962","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"963","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"964","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"965","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"966","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"967","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"968","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"969","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"970","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"971","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"972","in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the fund; and"
"973","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"974","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"975","a material effect on the financial statements."
"976","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"977","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"978","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"979","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"980","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"981","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"982","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"983","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"984","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"985","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"986","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"987","fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"988","on a timely basis."
"989","<PAGE>"
"990","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"991","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"992","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"993","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"994","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"995","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"996","over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as"
"997","defined above as of December 31, 2009."

"1020","At a Board meeting held on June 10-11, 2009, the Board approved a resolution to"
"1021","revise the nonfundamental policy regarding investment in foreign securities for"
"1022","RiverSource LaSalle Monthly Dividend Real Estate Fund. The existing"
"1023","nonfundamental policy on foreign securities was revised to state that the Fund"

"1027","At a Board meeting held Sept. 8-10, 2009, the Board of Directors approved"
"1028","changes that, effective March 1, 2010, eliminated the fund's nonfundamental"
"1029","investment policies as follows:"
"1030","     -    that no more than 10% of the fund's net assets may be invested in"
"1031","          exchange-traded funds;"
"1032","     -    that limited the fund's exposure to access trades to 5% of total"

"1034","     -    that the fund may not invest for the purpose of controlling or"

"1036","     -    that the fund may not acquire any securities of a registered open-end"
"1037","          investment company or a registered unit investment trust in reliance"
"1038","          on subparagraph (F) or subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1) of the"
"1039","          1940 Act;"
"1040","     -    that under normal circumstances, the fund will limit forward foreign"
"1041","          currency contracts to not greater than 75% of the fund's portfolio"
"1042","          position in any one country as of the date the contract is entered"
"1043","          into. This limitation will be measured at the point the hedging"
"1044","          transaction is entered into by the fund. Under extraordinary"
"1045","          circumstances, the fund may enter into forward currency contracts in"
"1046","          excess of 75% of the fund's portfolio position in any one country as"
"1047","          of the date the contract is entered into."
"1048","          The fund will also not enter into such forward contracts or maintain a"
"1049","          net exposure to such contracts where the consummation of the contracts"
