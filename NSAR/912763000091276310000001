"631","LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"632","Since October 2003, Federated and related entities (co"
"633","llectively, Federated), and various"
"634","Federated funds (Funds), have been named as defendan"
"635","ts in several class action lawsuits now"
"636","pending in the United States District Court for the Dis"
"637","trict of Maryland. The lawsuits were"
"638","purportedly filed on behalf of people who purchased, ow"
"639","ned and/or redeemed shares of"
"640","Federated-sponsored mutual funds during specified perio"
"641","ds beginning November 1, 1998. The"
"642","suits are generally similar in alleging that Federated"
"643","engaged in illegal and improper trading"
"644","practices including market timing and late trading in c"
"645","oncert with certain institutional traders,"
"646","which allegedly caused financial injury to the mutual f"
"647","und shareholders. These lawsuits began to"
"648","be filed shortly after Federated's first public announc"
"649","ement that it had received requests for"
"650","information on shareholder trading activities in the Fu"
"651","nds from the SEC, the Office of the New"
"652","York State Attorney General (NYAG), and other author"
"653","ities. In that regard, on November 28,"
"654","2005, Federated announced that it had reached final set"
"655","tlements with the SEC and the NYAG"
"656","with respect to those matters. Specifically, the SEC and"
"657"," NYAG settled proceedings against three"
"658","Federated subsidiaries involving undisclosed market tim"
"659","ing arrangements and late trading. The"
"660","SEC made findings: that Federated Investment Management"
"661"," Company (FIMC), an SEC-"
"662","registered investment adviser to various Funds, and Fede"
"663","rated Securities Corp., an SEC-"
"664","registered broker-dealer and distributor for the Funds,"
"665","violated provisions of the Investment"
"666","Advisers Act and Investment Company Act by approving, but"
"667"," not disclosing, three market"
"668","timing arrangements, or the associated conflict of inter"
"669","est between FIMC and the funds involved"
"670","in the arrangements, either to other fund shareholders or"
"671"," to the funds' board; and that Federated"
"672","Shareholder Services Company, formerly an SEC-registered"
"673","transfer agent, failed to prevent a"
"674","customer and a Federated employee from late trading in vi"
"675","olation of provisions of the Investment"
"676","Company Act. The NYAG found that such conduct violated pr"
"677","ovisions of New York State law."
"678","Federated entered into the settlements without admitting o"
"679","r denying the regulators' findings. As"
"680","Federated previously reported in 2004, it has already paid"
"681"," approximately $8.0 million to certain"
"682","funds as determined by an independent consultant. As part"
"683"," of these settlements, Federated"
"684","agreed to pay disgorgement and a civil money penalty in t"
"685","he aggregate amount of an additional"
"686","$72 million and, among other things, agreed that it would"
"687"," not serve as investment adviser to any"
"688","registered investment company unless (i) at least 75% of"
"689","the fund's directors are independent of"
"690","Federated, (ii) the chairman of each such fund is independ"
"691","ent of Federated, (iii) no action may be"
"692","taken by the fund's board or any committee thereof unless"
"693","approved by a majority of the"
"694","independent trustees of the fund or committee, respectivel"
"695","y, and (iv) the fund appoints a senior
officer who reports to the independent trustees and is re"
"696","sponsible for monitoring compliance by"
"697","the fund with applicable laws and fiduciary duties and for"
"698","managing the process by which"
"699","management fees charged to a fund are approved. The settlem"
"700","ents are described in Federated's"
"701","announcement which, along with previous press releases and"
"702","related communications on those"
"703","matters, is available in the About Us section of Federat"
"704","ed's website at FederatedInvestors.com."
"705","Federated entities have also been named as defendants in se"
"706","veral additional lawsuits that are"
"707","now pending in the United States District Court for the We"
"708","stern District of Pennsylvania,"
"709","alleging, among other things, excessive advisory and Rule 1"
"710","2b-1 fees."
"711","The Board of the Funds retained the law firm of Dickstein Sh"
"712","apiro LLP to represent the Funds in"
"713","each of the lawsuits described in the preceding two paragrap"
"714","hs. Federated and the Funds, and"
"715","their respective counsel, have been defending this litigatio"
"716","n, and none of the Funds remains a"
"717","defendant in any of the lawsuits (though some could potentia"
"718","lly receive any recoveries as"
"719","nominal defendants). Additional lawsuits based upon similar"
"720","allegations may be filed in the"
"721","future. The potential impact of these lawsuits, all of which"
"722","seek unquantified damages, attorneys'"
"723","fees, and expenses, and future potential similar suits is un"
"724","certain. Although we do not believe"
"725","that these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the"
"726"," Funds, there can be no assurance"
"727","that these suits, ongoing adverse publicity and/or other deve"
"728","lopments resulting from the"
"729","regulatory investigations will not result in increased Fund r"
"730","edemptions, reduced sales of Fund"
"731","shares, or other adverse consequences for the Funds."

"748","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"749","we considered the Fund's internal control"
"750","over financial reporting, including controls over sa"
"751","feguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"752","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"753","our opinion on the financial statements and"

"756","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control ov"

"758","express no such opinion."
"759","The management of the Fund is responsible for establis"

"768","ng and the preparation of financial statements"
"769","for external purposes in accordance with generally accep"
"770","ted accounting principles.  A company's"
"771","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"772"," policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"773","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, ac"
"774","curately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"775","and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provid"
"776","e reasonable assurance that transactions"
"777","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financ"
"778","ial statements in accordance with"
"779","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receip"
"780","ts and expenditures of the company are"
"781","being made only in accordance with authorizations of mana"
"782","gement and directors of the company;"
"783","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"784","or timely detection of unauthorized"
"785","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"786"," could have a material effect on the"
"787","financial statements."
"788","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"789"," financial reporting may not prevent or"
"790","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"791","of effectiveness to future periods are"
"792","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate be"
"793","cause of changes in conditions, or that"
"794","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures m"
"795","ay deteriorate."
"796","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"797","exists when the design or operation of a"
"798","control does not allow management or employees, in the norm"
"799","al course of performing their"
"800","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"801"," timely basis.  A material weakness is"
"802","a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"803"," control over financial reporting, such that"
"804","there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatem"
"805","ent of the company's annual or interim"
"806","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"807"," timely basis."
"808","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financ"
"809","ial reporting was for the limited"
"810","purpose described in the first paragraph and would not neces"
"811","sarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"812","internal control that might be material weaknesses under sta"
"813","ndards established by the Public"
"814","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"815"," we noted no deficiencies in the"
"816","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its ope"
"817","ration, including controls over"
"818","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material w"
"819","eakness as defined above as of"
