"2264","The board of trustees of Vanguard European Stock Index Fund,"

"2266","Stock Index Fund has approved the adoption of new target indexes"
"2267","as outlined in the table below. These new indexes will add"

"2269","In addition, the new index for the Emerging Markets Stock Index"

"2281","The Funds are expected to begin implementation of the changes in"
"2282","the third or fourth quarter of 2015, with the change to the Emerging"
"2283","Markets Stock Index Fund occurring in two phases."
"2284","The phase approach is intended to enable the Emerging Markets Stock"
"2285","Index Fund's advisor, The Vanguard Group, Inc., to make the necessary"
"2286","adjustments to portfolio holdings in a manner that minimizes impact"
"2287","to Fund shareholders. In the first phase, the Fund will track the"
"2288","FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China A Inclusion Transition Index, an"
"2289","interim index that will gradually increase exposure to small-capitalization"
"2290","stocks and China A-Shares while proportionately reducing exposure to other"
"2291","stocks based on their weightings in the new index. In the second phase,"
"2292","the Fund will begin tracking the FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China A"
"2293","Inclusion Index, which will be quota-adjusted by FTSE to take into"
"2294","account the quota amount allocated to foreign investors by the Chinese"
"2295","regulator. During both the transition and final benchmark phases, the Fund"
"2296","will invest by sampling the index, meaning that it will hold a broadly"
"2297","diversified collection of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates"
"2298","the full index in terms of key characteristics."
"2299","To protect the Funds from the potential for harmful front running by"
"2300","traders, the exact timing of the index changes will not be disclosed to"
"2301","investors. In the meantime, the Funds will continue seeking to track their"
"2302","current indexes."
"2303","The adjustments to the Funds' portfolio holdings are expected to result in"
"2304","modest, temporary increases in each Fund's transaction costs and turnover"
"2305","rate. It is important to note that the actual transaction costs, turnover"
"2306","rate, and any other costs will be highly dependent upon a number of factors,"
"2307","including the market environment at the time of the portfolio adjustments."
"2308","These changes are not expected to increase the expense ratios of the Funds."
"2309","Description of China A-Shares"
"2310","China A-Shares are shares of Chinese companies that are traded locally"
"2311","on the Shanghai and/or Shenzhen stock exchanges. In order to invest in"
"2312","China A-Shares, a foreign (i.e., not Chinese) investor must have access"
"2313","to quota through a Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) or a"
"2314","Renminbi QFII (RQFII) license holder. China A-Shares are also available"
"2315","for purchase through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect Program. Investing"
"2316","in China A-Shares involves unique risks related to tracking a benchmark"
"2317","index, since a fund must obtain a quota from the Chinese regulator prior to"
"2318","investing and then must continue to apply for additional quota to meet its"
"2319","investment needs."

"2402","The Fund employs an indexing investment approach by investing all, or"

"2407","small-cap companies located in Japan, Australia, South Korea, Hong"
"2408","Kong, Singapore, and New Zealand."
"2409","Prospectus Text Changes"
"2410","In the More on the Funds section under the heading Market Exposure,"
"2411","the following is added as the second paragraph after the Foreign
Stock Market Returns table:"
"2412","Keep in mind that the MSCI EAFE Index tracks mainly large- and"
"2413","mid-cap stocks. Historically, small-cap stocks (such as those held"
"2414","by the European and Pacific Stock Index Funds) have been more volatile"
"2415","than-and at times have performed quite differently from-the large-"
"2416","and mid-cap stocks of the MSCI EAFE Index."
"2417","In addition, the following replaces similar text under the same heading:"
"2418","Also note that the MSCI EAFE Index does not take into account returns for"
"2419","emerging markets, which can be substantially more volatile and substantially"
"2420","less liquid than the more developed markets included in the Index. In"
"2421","addition, because the MSCI EAFE Index tracks the European and Pacific"
"2422","developed markets collectively, the returns in the preceding table do not"
"2423","reflect the variability of returns for these markets individually. To"
"2424","illustrate this variability, the following table shows returns for different"
"2425","foreign markets-as well as for the U.S. market for comparison-from 2005"
"2426","through 2014, as measured by their respective indexes."
"2427","Also in the More on the Funds section under the heading Market Exposure,"
"2428","the following is added as the second paragraph after the Returns for
Various Stock Markets table:"
"2429","Stocks of publicly traded companies and funds that invest in stocks are"
"2430","often classified according to market value, or market capitalization."
"2431","These classifications typically include small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap."
"2432","It is important to understand that, for both companies and stock funds,"
"2433","market-capitalization ranges change over time. Also, interpretations of"
"2434","size vary, and there are no official definitions of small-, mid-, and"
"2435","large-cap, even among Vanguard fund advisors."
"2436","Within the same section under the heading Security Selection, the"
"2437","following replaces similar text:"
"2438","European Stock Index Fund. The Fund invests in the common stocks included"
"2439","in the FTSE Developed Europe All Cap Index, which is made up of"
"2440","approximately 1,250 common stocks of large-, mid-, and small-cap companies"
"2441","located in 16 European countries. Four countries-the United Kingdom,"
"2442","Germany, France, and Switzerland-represent a large percentage of the Index."
"2443","The other countries represented in the Index are much less significant to"
"2444","the Index and, consequently, to the Fund. The Fund's heavy exposure to four"
"2445","countries subjects the Fund to a higher degree of country risk than that of"
"2446","more geographically diversified international funds."
"2447","Pacific Stock Index Fund. The Fund invests in the common stocks included"
"2448","in the FTSE Developed Asia Pacific All Cap Index, which is made up of"
"2449","approximately 2,150 common stocks of large-, mid-, and small-cap Pacific"
"2450","Basin companies. The Japanese and Australian stock markets represent a"
"2451","large portion of the Index. The four other markets represented in the Index"
"2452","are South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, and New Zealand. The Fund?s large"
"2453","investment in the Japanese and Australian stock markets subjects the Fund"
