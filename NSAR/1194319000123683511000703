"745","<TEXT>"
"746","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"747","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"748","Alpine Series Trust and Alpine Income Trust:"
"749","In planning and performing our audits of"
"750","the financial statements of Alpine Series Trust,"
"751","including the Alpine Dynamic Balance Fund,"
"752","Alpine Dynamic Dividend Fund, Alpine Dynamic"
"753","Financial Services Fund, Alpine Dynamic"
"754","Innovators Fund, Alpine Dynamic Transformations"
"755","Fund, and Alpine Accelerating Dividend Fund;"
"756","and Alpine Income Trust, including the Alpine"
"757","Municipal Money Market Fund and Alpine Ultra"
"758","Short Tax Optimized Income Fund"
"759","(collectively the Funds) as of and for"
"760","the year ended October 31, 2011, in accordance"
"761","with the standards of the Public Company"
"762","Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"763","we considered the Funds internal control over"
"764","financial reporting, including control over"
"765","safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"766","designing our auditing procedures for"
"767","the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"768","the financial statements and to comply with"
"769","the requirements of Form NSAR, but not for"
"770","the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"771","the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"772","control over financial reporting."
"773","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"774","The management of the Funds is responsible"
"775","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"776","internal control over financial reporting."
"777","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"778","and judgments by management are required"
"779","to assess the expected benefits and related"
"780","costs of controls. A companys internal control"
"781","over financial reporting is a process designed"
"782","to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"783","the reliability of financial reporting and"
"784","the preparation of financial statements for"
"785","external purposes in accordance with generally"
"786","accepted accounting principles. A companys"
"787","internal control over financial reporting"
"788","includes those policies and procedures that"
"789","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"790","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"791","reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"792","of the assets of the company;"
"793","(2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"794","transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"795","permit preparation of financial statements"
"796","in accordance with generally accepted"
"797","accounting principles, and that receipts"
"798","and expenditures of the company are being"
"799","made only in accordance with authorizations"
"800","of management and directors of the company; and"
"801","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"802","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"803","acquisition, use, or disposition of a companys"
"804","assets that could have a material"
"805","effect on the financial statements."
"806","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"807","internal control over financial reporting"
"808","may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"809","Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"810","effectiveness to future periods are subject"
"811","to the risk that controls may become"
"812","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"813","or that the degree of compliance with"
"814","the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"815","A deficiency in internal control over"
"816","financial reporting exists when the design"
"817","or operation of a control does not allow"
"818","management or employees, in the normal"
"819","course of performing their assigned functions,"
"820","to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"821","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"822","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"823","control over financial reporting, such that"
"824","there is a reasonable possibility that"
"825","a material misstatement of the companys"
"826","annual or interim financial statements will not"
"827","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"828","Our consideration of the Funds internal"
"829","control over financial reporting was for"
"830","the limited purpose described in the first"
"831","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"832","all deficiencies in internal control that might"
"833","be material weaknesses under standards"
"834","established by the Public Company Accounting"
"835","Oversight Board (United States). However,"
"836","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal"
"837","control over financial reporting and its"
"838"," operation, including controls for safeguarding"
"839","securities, that we consider to be a material"
"840","weakness, as defined above, as of October 31, 2011."
"841","This report is intended solely for the"
"842","information and use of management and the"
"843","Board of Trustees of the Funds and the Securities"
"844","and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"845","to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"846","than these specified parties."
