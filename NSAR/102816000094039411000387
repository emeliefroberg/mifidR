"1478","(United States), we considered the Trust's"
"1479","internal control over financial reporting,"
"1480","including controls over safeguarding"
"1481","securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1482","auditing procedures for the purpose of"

"1484","statements and to comply with the"
"1485","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"1486","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1487","effectiveness of the Trust's internal control"
"1488","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"1489","express no such opinion."
"1490","The management of the Trust is responsible"
"1491","for establishing and maintaining effective"

"1493","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1494","judgments by management are required to"

"1498","to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1499","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1500","preparation of financial statements for"
"1501","external purposes in accordance with"
"1502","generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1503","trust's internal control over financial"

"1507","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1508","transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"1509","the trust; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"1510","that transactions are recorded as necessary to"

"1517","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1518","prevention or timely detection of"
"1519","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition"
"1520","of a trust's assets that could have a material"
"1521","effect on the financial statements."
"1522","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"

"1527","the risk that controls may become"
"1528","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"1529","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1530","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1531","A deficiency in internal control over"

"1534","management or employees, in the normal"
"1535","course of performing their assigned"
"1536","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"1537","on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1538","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"1539","in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1540","such that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"1541","a material misstatement of a trust's annual or"

"1544","Our consideration of the Trust's internal"
