"5039","             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"5040","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM Investment Funds (Invesco"
"5041","Investment Funds):"
"5042","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Invesco"
"5043","Endeavor Fund, Invesco Small Companies Fund, Invesco Developing Markets Fund,"
"5044","Invesco China Fund and Invesco Pacific Growth Fund as of and for the year ended"
"5045","October 31, 2011, and the Invesco Global Advantage Fund, as of and for the"
"5046","period ended October 31, 2011, (six separate series of the AIM Investment Fund"
"5047","Funds (Invesco Investment Funds), hereafter referred to as the Funds), in"
"5048","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"5049","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"5050","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"5051","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"5052","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"5053","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"5054","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an"
"5055","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"5056","reporting."
"5057","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"5058","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"5059","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"5060","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"5061","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"5062","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"5063","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"5064","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"5065","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"5066","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"5067","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"5068","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"5069","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"5070","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"5071","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and"
"5072","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"5073","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"5074","a material effect on the financial statements."
"5075","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"5076","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"5077","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"5078","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"5079","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"5080","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"5081","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"5082","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"5083","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"5084","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"5085","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"5086","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"5087","on a timely basis."

"5104","             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"5105","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM Investment Funds (Invesco"
"5106","Investment Funds):"
"5107","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Invesco"
"5108","Global Health Care Fund, Invesco International Total Return Fund, Invesco"
"5109","Emerging Market Local Currency Debt Fund and Invesco Balanced-Risk Allocation"
"5110","Fund as of and for the year ended October 31, 2011, and the Invesco Emerging"
"5111","Markets Equity Fund, Invesco Commodities Strategy Fund and Invesco Balanced-Risk"
"5112","Commodity Strategy Fund as of and for the period ended October 31, 2011, (seven"
"5113","separate series of the AIM Investment Fund Funds (Invesco Investment Funds),"
"5114","hereafter referred to as the Funds), in accordance with the standards of the"
"5115","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"5116","Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"5117","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"5118","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"5119","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"5120","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"5121","reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"5122","Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"5123","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"5124","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"5125","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"5126","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"5127","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"5128","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"5129","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"5130","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"5131","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"5132","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"5133","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"5134","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"5135","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"5136","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"5137","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and"
"5138","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"5139","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"5140","a material effect on the financial statements."
"5141","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"5142","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"5143","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"5144","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"5145","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"5146","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"5147","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"5148","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"5149","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"5150","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"5151","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"5152","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"5153","on a timely basis."
"5154","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"5155","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"5156","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"5157","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"5158","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"5159","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"

"5239","     On October 8, 2004, Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco), successor by merger"
"5240","to Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc. and INVESCO Funds Group, Inc. (IFG), both former"
"5241","investment advisers, along with Invesco Aim Distributors, n/k/a Invesco"
"5242","Distributors, Inc. (Invesco Distributors) reached final settlements with certain"
"5243","regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York"
"5244","Attorney General and the Colorado Attorney General, to resolve civil enforcement"
"5245","actions and/or investigations related to market timing and related activity in"
"5246","the AIM Funds (n/k/a the Invesco Funds), including those formerly advised by"
"5247","IFG. As part of the settlements, a $325 million fair fund ($110 million of which"
"5248","is civil penalties) was created to compensate shareholders harmed by market"
"5249","timing and related activity in funds formerly advised by IFG. Additionally,"
"5250","Invesco and Invesco Distributors created a $50 million fair fund ($30 million of"
"5251","which is civil penalties) to compensate shareholders harmed by market timing and"
"5252","related activity in funds advised by Invesco, which was done pursuant to the"
"5253","terms of the settlement. The methodology of the fair funds distributions was"
"5254","determined by Invesco's independent distribution consultant (IDC Plan), in"
"5255","consultation with Invesco and the independent trustees of the Invesco Funds, and"
"5256","approved by the SEC on May 23, 2008."
"5257","     On May 23, 2008, the SEC posted its final approval of the plans for"
"5258","distributing market timing settlement proceeds to adversely impacted AIM and"
"5259","INVESCO Fund shareholders. The AIM Fair Fund began distribution of settlement"
"5260","monies to impacted former shareholders on June 1, 2009. After receipt of SEC"
"5261","approval, undistributed residual amounts left in the AIM Fair Fund were"
"5262","deposited in the appropriate fund. The Invesco Fair Fund began distribution of"
"5263","settlement monies to impacted former shareholders on December 11, 2009 and the"
"5264","distribution of checks concluded on September 21, 2010. After receipt of SEC"
"5265","approval, undistributed residual amounts totaling approximately $55 million left"
"5266","in the Invesco Fair Fund were distributed to the appropriate funds. On May 11,"
"5267","2011, the SEC issued an order that amended the Invesco Fair Fund distribution"
"5268","plan to segregate approximately $3.5 million of the Fair Fund's residual amount"
"5269","and to require that a certain financial intermediary take additional steps to"
"5270","identify beneficial accountholders of its historic omnibus positions in the"
"5271","funds so that they may receive their appropriate portion of the segregated $3.5"
"5272","million residual amount."
"5273","     The IDC Plan provides for distribution to all eligible investors for the"
"5274","periods spanning January 1, 2000 through July 31, 2003 (for the IFG Fair Fund)"
"5275","and January 1, 2001 through September 30, 2003 (for the AIM Fair Fund), their"
"5276","proportionate share of the applicable Fair Fund to compensate such investors for"
"5277","injury they may have suffered as a result of market timing in the affected"
"5278","funds. Further details regarding the IDC Plan and distributions thereunder are"
"5279","available on Invesco's Web site, available at http://www.invesco.com/us."
"5280","On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Office of the State Auditor - Securities"
"5281","Commission (WVASC) issued a Summary Order to Cease and Desist and Notice of"
"5282","Right to Hearing to Invesco and Invesco Distributors (collectively, Invesco)"
"5283","(Order No. 05-1318). The WVASC made findings of fact that Invesco allegedly"
"5284","entered into certain arrangements permitting market timing of the Invesco Funds"
"5285","and failed to disclose these arrangements in the prospectuses for such Funds,"
"5286","and conclusions of law to the effect that Invesco violated the West Virginia"
"5287","securities laws. The WVASC ordered Invesco to cease any further violations and"
"5288","sought to impose monetary sanctions, including restitution to affected"
"5289","investors, disgorgement of fees, reimbursement of investigatory, administrative"

                             MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
                 (SECURITIES LENDING ADMINISTRATIVE FEE WAIVER)

     This Sixth Amended and Restated Memorandum of Agreement is entered into as
of the dates indicated on Exhibit A between AIM Counselor Series Trust
(Invesco Counselor Series Trust), AIM Equity Funds (Invesco Equity Funds), AIM
Funds Group (Invesco Funds Group), AIM Growth Series (Invesco Growth Series),
AIM International Mutual Funds (Invesco International Mutual Funds), AIM
Investment Funds (Invesco Investment Funds), AIM Investment Securities Funds
(Invesco Investment Securities Funds), AIM Sector Funds (Invesco Sector Funds),
AIM Tax-Exempt Funds (Invesco Tax-Exempt Funds), AIM Treasurer's Series Trust
(Invesco Treasurer's Series Trust), AIM Variable Insurance Funds (Invesco
Variable Insurance Funds) and Short-Term Investments Trust (each a Fund and
collectively, the Funds), on behalf of the portfolios listed on Exhibit A to
this Memorandum of Agreement (the Portfolios), and Invesco Advisers, Inc.
(Invesco).

     For and in consideration of the mutual terms and agreements set forth
herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the Funds and Invesco agree as follows:

     1.   Each Fund, for itself and its Portfolios, and Invesco agree that until
          the expiration date, if any, of the commitment set forth on the
          attached Exhibit A occurs, as such Exhibit A is amended from time
          to time, Invesco has agreed that it will not charge any administrative
          fee under each Portfolio's advisory agreement in connection with
          securities lending activities without prior approval from the
          Portfolio's Board (such agreement is referred to as the Waiver).

     2.   Neither a Fund nor Invesco may remove or amend the Waiver to a Fund's
          detriment prior to requesting and receiving the approval of the
          Portfolio's Board to remove or amend the Waiver. Invesco will not have
          any right to reimbursement of any amount so waived.

     Unless a Fund, by vote of its Board of Trustees terminates the Waiver, or a
Fund and Invesco are unable to reach an agreement on the amount of the Waiver to
which the Fund and Invesco desire to be bound, the Waiver will continue
indefinitely with respect to such Fund. Exhibit A will be amended to reflect
the new date through which a Fund and Invesco agree to be bound.

     It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the Trusts hereunder shall
not be binding upon any of the Trustees, shareholders, nominees, officers,
agents or employees of the Trusts personally, but shall only bind the assets and
property of the Funds, as provided in each Trust's Agreement and Declaration of
Trust. The execution and delivery of this Memorandum of Agreement have been
authorized by the Trustees of each Trust, and this Memorandum of Agreement has
been executed and delivered by an authorized officer of each Trust acting as
such; neither such authorization by such Trustees nor such execution and
delivery by such officer shall be deemed to have been made by any of them
individually or to impose any liability on any of them personally, but shall
bind only the assets and property of the Funds, as provided in each Trust's
Agreement and Declaration of Trust.

     Nothing in this Memorandum of Agreement is intended to affect any other
memorandum of agreement executed by any Fund or Invesco with respect to any
other fee waivers, expense reimbursements and/or expense limitations.

<PAGE>

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each Fund, on behalf of itself and its Portfolios
listed in Exhibit A to this Memorandum of Agreement, and Invesco have entered
into this Memorandum of Agreement as of the dates indicated on Exhibit A.

                      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (Agreement) is adopted as of this
1st day of April, 2011 by and among (i) each of the Invesco open-end registered
investment companies identified as a Target Entity on Exhibit A hereto (each a
Target Entity) separately, on behalf of its respective series identified on
Exhibit A hereto (each a Target Fund); (ii) each of the Invesco open-end
registered investment companies identified as an Acquiring Entity on Exhibit A
hereto (each an Acquiring Entity), separately on behalf of its respective
series identified on Exhibit A hereto (each an Acquiring Fund); and (iii)
Invesco Advisers, Inc. (IAI).

            WHEREAS, the parties hereto intend for each Acquiring Fund and its
corresponding Target Fund (as set forth in Exhibit A hereto) to enter into a
transaction pursuant to which: (i) the Acquiring Fund will acquire the assets
and assume the liabilities of the Target Fund in exchange for the corresponding
class or classes of shares (as applicable) of the Acquiring Fund identified on
Exhibit A of equal value to the net assets of the Target Fund being acquired,
and (ii) the Target Fund will distribute such shares of the Acquiring Fund to
shareholders of the corresponding class of the Target Fund, in connection with
the liquidation of the Target Fund, all upon the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth in this Agreement (each such transaction, a
Reorganization and collectively, the Reorganizations);

            WHEREAS, each Target Entity and each Acquiring Entity is an
open-end, registered investment company of the management type; and

            WHEREAS, this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan
of reorganization and liquidation with respect to each Reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986,

described herein shall be conducted separately from the others, and a party that
is not a party to a Reorganization shall incur no obligations, duties or
liabilities with respect to such Reorganization by reason of being a party to
this Agreement. If any one or more Reorganizations should fail to be
consummated, such failure shall not affect the other Reorganizations in any way.

      1.2. Provided that all conditions precedent to a Reorganization set forth
herein have been satisfied as of the Closing Date (as defined in Section 3.1),
and based on the representations and warranties each party provides to the
others, each Target Entity and its corresponding Acquiring Entity agree to take
the following steps with respect to their Reorganization(s), the parties to

in Exhibit A:

<PAGE>

            (a) The Target Fund shall transfer all of its Assets, as defined and
      set forth in Section 1.2(b), to the Acquiring Fund, and the Acquiring Fund
      in exchange therefor shall assume the Liabilities, as defined and set
      forth in Section 1.2(c), and deliver to the Target Fund the number of full
      and fractional Acquiring Fund shares determined in the manner set forth in
      Section 2.

            (b) The assets of the Target Fund to be transferred to the Acquiring
      Fund shall consist of all assets and property, including, without
      limitation, all cash, securities, commodities and futures interests,
      claims (whether absolute or contingent, known or unknown, accrued or
      unaccrued and including, without limitation, any interest in pending or
      future legal claims in connection with past or present portfolio holdings,
      whether in the form of class action claims, opt-out or other direct
      litigation claims, or regulator or government-established investor
      recovery fund claims, and any and all resulting recoveries) and dividends
      or interest receivable that are owned by the Target Fund and any deferred
      or prepaid expenses shown as an asset on the books of the Target Fund on
      the Closing Date, except for cash, bank deposits or cash equivalent
      securities in an amount necessary to pay the estimated costs of
      extinguishing any Excluded Liabilities (as defined in Section 1.2(c)) and
      cash in an amount necessary to pay any distributions pursuant to Section
      7.1(f) (collectively, Assets).

            (c) The Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the liabilities of the
      Target Fund, whether accrued or contingent, known or unknown, existing at
      the Closing Date, except for the Target Fund's Excluded Liabilities (as
      defined below), if any, pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, with
      respect to each Target Fund separately, Liabilities). If prior to the
      Closing Date the Acquiring Entity identifies a liability that the
      Acquiring Entity and the Target Entity mutually agree should not be
      assumed by the Acquiring Fund, such liability shall be excluded from the
      definition of Liabilities hereunder and shall be listed on a Schedule of
      Excluded Liabilities to be signed by the Acquiring Entity and the Target
      Entity at Closing and attached to this Agreement as Schedule 1.2(c) (the
      Excluded Liabilities). The Assets minus the Liabilities of a Target Fund
      shall be referred to herein as the Target Fund's Net Assets.

            (d) As soon as is reasonably practicable after the Closing, the
      Target Fund will distribute to its shareholders of record (Target Fund"
"5394","      Shareholders) the shares of the Acquiring Fund of the corresponding class
      received by the Target Fund pursuant to Section 1.2(a), as set forth in
      Exhibit A, on a pro rata basis within that class, and the Target Fund will
      as promptly as practicable completely liquidate and dissolve. Such
      distribution and liquidation will be accomplished, with respect to each
      class of the Target Fund's shares, by the transfer of the Acquiring Fund
      shares of the corresponding class then credited to the account of the
      Target Fund on the books of the Acquiring Fund to open accounts on the
      share records of the Acquiring Fund in the names of the Target Fund
      Shareholders of the class. The aggregate net asset value of the Acquiring
      Fund shares to be so credited to the corresponding Target Fund
      Shareholders shall be equal to the aggregate net asset value of the
      corresponding Target Fund's shares owned by the Target Fund Shareholders
      on the Valuation Date. At the Closing, any outstanding certificates
      representing shares of a Target Fund will be cancelled. The Acquiring Fund

                                      -2-

<PAGE>

      shall not issue certificates representing shares in connection with such
      exchange, irrespective of whether Target Fund shareholders hold their
      shares in certificated form.

            (e) Ownership of Acquiring Fund shares will be shown on its books,
      as such are maintained by the Acquiring Fund's transfer agent.

2. VALUATION

      2.1. With respect to each Reorganization:

            (a) The value of the Target Fund's Assets shall be the value of such
      Assets computed as of immediately after the close of regular trading on
      the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which shall reflect the declaration
      of any dividends, on the business day next preceding the Closing Date (the
      Valuation Date), using the Target Fund's valuation procedures
      established by the Target Entity's Board of Trustees.

            (b) The net asset value per share of each class of the Acquiring
      Fund shares issued in connection with the Reorganization shall be the net
      asset value per share of the corresponding class of each class computed on
      the Valuation Date using the Acquiring Fund's valuation procedures
      established by the Acquiring Entity's Board of Trustees, which are the
      same as the Target Fund's valuation procedures.

            (c) The number of shares issued of each class of the Acquiring Fund
      (including fractional shares, if any, rounded to the nearest thousandth)
      in exchange for the Target Fund's Net Assets shall be determined by
      dividing the value of the Net Assets of the Target Fund attributable to
      each class of Target Fund shares by the net asset value per share of the
      corresponding share class of the Acquiring Fund.

            (d) All computations of value shall be made by the Target Fund's and
      the Acquiring Fund's designated recordkeeping agent using the valuation
      procedures described in this Section 2.

3. CLOSING AND CLOSING DATE

      3.1. Each Reorganization shall close on the date identified on Exhibit A
or such other date as the parties may agree with respect to any or all
Reorganizations (the Closing Date). All acts taking place at the closing of a
Reorganization (the Closing) shall be deemed to take place simultaneously as
of immediately prior to the opening of regular trading on the NYSE on the
Closing Date of that Reorganization unless otherwise agreed to by the parties
(the Closing Time).

      3.2. With respect to each Reorganization:

            (a) The Target Fund's portfolio securities, investments or other
      assets that are represented by a certificate or other written instrument
      shall be transferred and delivered by the Target Fund as of the Closing
      Date to the Acquiring Fund's Custodian for the account of the Acquiring
      Fund, duly endorsed in proper form for transfer and in such condition as
      to constitute good delivery thereof. The Target Fund shall direct the
      Target

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

      Fund's custodian (the Target Custodian) to deliver to the Acquiring
      Fund's Custodian as of the Closing Date by book entry, in accordance with
      the customary practices of Target Custodian and any securities depository
      (as defined in Rule 17f-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
      amended (the 1940 Act)), in which the Assets are deposited, the Target
      Fund's portfolio securities and instruments so held. The cash to be
      transferred by a Target Fund shall be delivered to the Acquiring Fund's
      Custodian by wire transfer of federal funds or other appropriate means on
      the Closing Date.

            (b) The Target Entity shall direct the Target Custodian for each
      Target Fund to deliver, at the Closing, a certificate of an authorized
      officer stating that (i) except as permitted by Section 3.2(a), the Assets
      have been delivered in proper form to the Acquiring Fund no later than the
      Closing Time on the Closing Date, and (ii) all necessary taxes in
      connection with the delivery of the Assets, including all applicable
      Federal, state and foreign stock transfer stamps, if any, have been paid
      or provision for payment has been made.

            (c) At such time prior to the Closing Date as the parties mutually
      agree, the Target Fund shall provide (i) instructions and related
      information to the Acquiring Fund or its transfer agent with respect to
      the Target Fund Shareholders, including names, addresses, dividend
      reinvestment elections and tax withholding status of the Target Fund
      Shareholders as of the date agreed upon (such information to be updated as
      of the Closing Date, as necessary) and (ii) the information and
      documentation maintained by the Target Fund or its agents relating to the
      identification and verification of the Target Fund Shareholders under the
      USA PATRIOT ACT and other applicable anti-money laundering laws, rules and
      regulations and such other information as the Acquiring Fund may
      reasonably request. The Acquiring Fund and its transfer agent shall have
      no obligation to inquire as to the validity, propriety or correctness of
      any such instruction, information or documentation, but shall, in each
      case, assume that such instruction, information or documentation is valid,
      proper, correct and complete.

            (d) The Target Entity shall direct each applicable transfer agent
      for a Target Fund (the Target Transfer Agent) to deliver to the
      Acquiring Fund at the Closing a certificate of an authorized officer
      stating that its records, as provided to the Acquiring Entity, contain the
      names and addresses of the Target Fund Shareholders and the number of
      outstanding shares of each class owned by each such shareholder
      immediately prior to the Closing. The Acquiring Fund shall issue and
      deliver to the Secretary of the Target Fund a confirmation evidencing the
      Acquiring Fund shares to be credited on the Closing Date, or provide other
      evidence satisfactory to the Target Entity that such Acquiring Fund shares
      have been credited to the Target Fund Shareholders' accounts on the books
      of the Acquiring Fund. At the Closing, each party shall deliver to the
      other such bills of sale, checks, assignments, certificates, if any,
      receipts or other documents as such other party or its counsel may
      reasonably request.

            (e) In the event that on the Valuation Date or the Closing Date (a)
      the NYSE or another primary trading market for portfolio securities of the
      Target Fund (each, an Exchange) shall be closed to trading or trading
      thereupon shall be restricted, or (b) trading or the reporting of trading
      on such Exchange or elsewhere shall be disrupted so

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

      that, in the judgment of the Board of Trustees of the Acquiring Entity or
      the Target Entity or the authorized officers of either of such entities,
      accurate appraisal of the value of the net assets of the Acquiring Fund or
      the Target Fund, respectively, is impracticable, the Closing Date shall be
      postponed until the first business day after the day when trading shall
      have been fully resumed and reporting shall have been restored.

      of the Target Fund under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933"
"5395","      Act), are in full force and effect;

            (c) No consent, approval, authorization, or order of any court or
      governmental authority or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
      (FINRA) is required for the consummation by the Target Fund and the
      Target Entity of the transactions contemplated herein, except such as have
      been obtained or will be obtained at or prior to the Closing Date under
      the 1933 Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (1934"
"5396","      Act), the 1940 Act and state securities laws;

            (d) The current prospectus and statement of additional information
      of the Target Fund and each prospectus and statement of additional
      information of the Target Fund used at all times between the commencement

      applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act and the rules and
      regulations of the Commission thereunder and does not or did not at the
      time of its use include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
      state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
      the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
      were made, not materially misleading;

      Target Fund's prospectus and statement of additional information;

      the Acquiring Fund, the Target Fund will on the Closing Date have good
      title to the Assets

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

      and full right, power, and authority to sell, assign, transfer and deliver
      such Assets free of adverse claims, including any liens or other
      encumbrances, and upon delivery and payment for such Assets, the Acquiring
      Fund will acquire good title thereto, free of adverse claims and subject
      to no restrictions on the full transfer thereof, including, without
      limitation, such restrictions as might arise under the 1933 Act, provided
      that the Acquiring Fund will acquire Assets that are segregated as
      collateral for the Target Fund's derivative positions, including without
      limitation, as collateral for swap positions and as margin for futures
      positions, subject to such segregation and liens that apply to such
      Assets;

            (g) The financial statements of the Target Fund for the Target
      Fund's most recently completed fiscal year have been audited by the
      independent registered public accounting firm identified in the Target
      Fund's prospectus or statement of additional information included in the
      Target Fund's registration statement on Form N-1A (the Prospectus and
      Statement of Additional Information). Such statements, as well as the
      unaudited, semi-annual financial statements for the semi-annual period
      next succeeding the Target Fund's most recently completed fiscal year, if
      any, were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
      accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) consistently applied,
      and such statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
      financial condition of the Target Fund as of such date in accordance with
      GAAP, and there are no known contingent liabilities of the Target Fund
      required to be reflected on a balance sheet (including the notes thereto)
      in accordance with GAAP as of such date not disclosed therein;

            (h) Since the last day of the Target Fund's most recently completed
      fiscal year, there has not been any material adverse change in the Target
      Fund's financial condition, assets, liabilities or business, other than
      changes occurring in the ordinary course of business;

            (i) On the Closing Date, all material Returns (as defined below) of
      the Target Fund required by law to have been filed by such date (including
      any extensions) shall have been filed and are or will be true, correct and
      complete in all material respects, and all Taxes (as defined below) shown
      as due or claimed to be due by any government entity shall have been paid
      or provision has been made for the payment thereof. To the Target Fund's
      knowledge, no such Return is currently under audit by any Federal, state,
      local or foreign Tax authority; no assessment has been asserted with
      respect to such Returns; there are no levies, liens or other encumbrances
      on the Target Fund or its assets resulting from the non-payment of any
      Taxes; no waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are outstanding nor
      are any written requests for such waivers pending; and adequate provision
      has been made in the Target Fund financial statements for all Taxes in
      respect of all periods ended on or before the date of such financial
      statements. As used in this Agreement, Tax or Taxes means (i) any tax,
      governmental fee or other like assessment or charge of any kind whatsoever
      (including, but not limited to, withholding on amounts paid to or by any
      person), together with any interest, penalty, addition to tax or
      additional amount imposed by any governmental authority (domestic or
      foreign) responsible for the imposition of any such tax. Return means
      reports, returns, information returns, elections, agreements,
      declarations, or other documents of any nature

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

      or kind (including any attached schedules, supplements and additional or
      supporting material) filed or required to be filed with respect to Taxes,
      including any claim for refund, amended return or declaration of estimated
      Taxes (and including any amendments with respect thereto);

            (j) The Target Fund has elected to be a regulated investment company
      under Subchapter M of the Code and is a fund that is treated as a separate
      corporation under Section 851(g) of the Code. The Target Fund has
      qualified for treatment as a regulated investment company for each taxable
      year since inception that has ended prior to the Closing Date and will
      have satisfied the requirements of Part I of Subchapter M of the Code to
      maintain such qualification for the period beginning on the first day of
      its current taxable year and ending on the Closing Date. The Target Fund
      has no earnings or profits accumulated in any taxable year in which the
      provisions of Subchapter M of the Code did not apply to it. If Target Fund
      serves as a funding vehicle for variable contracts (life insurance or
      annuity), Target Fund, with respect to each of its taxable years that has
      ended prior to the Closing Date during which it has served as such a
      funding vehicle, has satisfied the diversification requirements of Section
      817(h) of the Code and will continue to satisfy the requirements of
      Section 817(h) of the Code for the period beginning on the first day of
      its current taxable year and ending on the Closing Date. In order to (i)
      ensure continued qualification of the Target Fund for treatment as a
      regulated investment company for tax purposes and (ii) eliminate any tax
      liability of the Target Fund arising by reason of undistributed investment
      company taxable income or net capital gain, the Target Fund, before the
      Closing Date will declare on or prior to the Valuation Date to the
      shareholders of Target Fund a dividend or dividends that, together with
      all previous such dividends, shall have the effect of distributing (i) all
      of its investment company taxable income (determined without regard to any
      deductions for dividends paid) and all of its net capital gains (after
      reduction for any capital loss carryover), if any, for the period from the
      close of its last fiscal year to the Closing Time on the Closing Date;
      (ii) any such investment company taxable income and net capital gains for
      its taxable year ended prior to the Closing Date to the extent not
      otherwise already distributed; and (iii) at least 90 percent of the
      excess, if any, of the Target Fund's interest income excludible from gross
      income under Section 103(a) of the Code over its deductions disallowed
      under Sections 265 and 171(a)(2) of the Code for its taxable year ended
      prior to the Closing Date and at least 90 percent of such net tax-exempt
      income for the period from the close of its last fiscal year to the
      Closing Time on the Closing Date.;

            (k) All issued and outstanding shares of the Target Fund are, and on
      the Closing Date will be, duly and validly issued and outstanding, fully
      paid and non-assessable by the Target Entity and, in every state where
      offered or sold, such offers and sales have been in compliance in all
      material respects with applicable registration and/or notice requirements
      of the 1933 Act and state and District of Columbia securities laws;

            (l) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will
      have been duly authorized prior to the Closing Date by all necessary
      action, if any, on the part of the Board of Trustees of the Target Entity,
      on behalf of the Target Fund, and subject to the approval of the
      shareholders of the Target Fund and the due authorization, execution and
      delivery of this Agreement by the other parties hereto, this Agreement
      will constitute

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

      a valid and binding obligation of the Target Fund, enforceable in
      accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy,
      insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws relating to or
      affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles;

            (m) The books and records of the Target Fund are true and correct in
      all material respects and contain no material omissions with respect to
      information required to be maintained under the laws, rules and
      regulations applicable to the Target Fund;

            (n) The Target Fund is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a
      Title 11 or similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the
      Code; and

            (o) The Target Fund has no unamortized or unpaid organizational fees
      or expenses.

      4.2. Each Acquiring Entity, on behalf of the Acquiring Fund, represents
and warrants to the Target Entity and its corresponding Target Fund as follows:

            (a) The Acquiring Fund is duly organized as a series of the
      Acquiring Entity, which is a statutory trust duly formed, validly
      existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware,
      with power under its Agreement and Declaration of Trust, as amended (the
      Agreement and Declaration of Trust), to own all of its properties and
      assets and to carry on its business as it is now being, and as it is
      contemplated to be, conducted, and to enter into this Agreement and
      perform its obligations hereunder;

            (b) The Acquiring Entity is a registered investment company
      classified as a management company of the open-end type, and its
      registration with the Commission as an investment company under the 1940
      Act and the registration of the shares of the Acquiring Fund under the
      1933 Act are in full force and effect;

            (c) No consent, approval, authorization, or order of any court,
      governmental authority or FINRA is required for the consummation by the
      Acquiring Fund and the Acquiring Entity of the transactions contemplated
      herein, except such as have been or will be obtained (at or prior to the
      Closing Date) under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, the 1940 Act and state
      securities laws;

            (d) The prospectuses and statements of additional information of the
      Acquiring Fund to be used in connection with the Reorganization will
      conform at the time of their use in all material respects to the
      applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act and the rules and
      regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not include any untrue
      statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
      to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light
      of the circumstances under which they were made, not materially
      misleading;

            (e) The Acquiring Fund is in compliance in all material respects
      with the applicable investment policies and restrictions set forth in the
      Acquiring Fund's prospectus and statement of additional information;

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

            (f) The financial statements of the Acquiring Fund for the Acquiring
      Fund's most recently completed fiscal year have been audited by the
      independent registered public accounting firm identified in the Acquiring
      Fund's prospectus or statement of additional information included in the
      Acquiring Fund's registration statement on Form N-1A. Such statements, as
      well as the unaudited, semi-annual financial statements for the
      semi-annual period next succeeding the Acquiring Fund's most recently
      completed fiscal year, if any, were prepared in accordance with accounting
      principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP)
      consistently applied, and such statements present fairly, in all material
      respects, the financial condition of the Acquiring Fund as of such date in
      accordance with GAAP, and there are no known contingent liabilities of the
      Acquiring Fund required to be reflected on a balance sheet (including the
      notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP as of such date not disclosed
      therein;

            (g) Since the last day of the Acquiring Fund's most recently
      completed fiscal year, there has not been any material adverse change in
      the Acquiring Fund's financial condition, assets, liabilities or business,
      other than changes occurring in the ordinary course of business;

            (h) On the Closing Date, all material Returns of the Acquiring Fund
      required by law to have been filed by such date (including any extensions)
      shall have been filed and are or will be true, correct and complete in all
      material respects, and all Taxes shown as due or claimed to be due by any
      government entity shall have been paid or provision has been made for the
      payment thereof. To the Acquiring Fund's knowledge, no such Return is
      currently under audit by any Federal, state, local or foreign Tax
      authority; no assessment has been asserted with respect to such Returns;
      there are no levies, liens or other encumbrances on the Acquiring Fund or
      its assets resulting from the non-payment of any Taxes; and no waivers of
      the time to assess any such Taxes are outstanding nor are any written
      requests for such waivers pending; and adequate provision has been made in
      the Acquiring Fund financial statements for all Taxes in respect of all
      periods ended on or before the date of such financial statements;

            (i) The Acquiring Fund has elected to be a regulated investment
      company under Subchapter M of the Code and is a fund that is treated as a
      separate corporation under Section 851(g) of the Code. The Acquiring Fund
      has qualified for treatment as a regulated investment company for each
      taxable year since inception that has ended prior to the Closing Date and
      has satisfied the requirements of Part I of Subchapter M of the Code to
      maintain such qualification for the period beginning on the first day of
      its current taxable year and ending on the Closing Date. The Acquiring
      Fund has no earnings or profits accumulated in any taxable year in which
      the provisions of Subchapter M of the Code did not apply to it. If the
      Acquiring Fund serves as a funding vehicle for variable contracts (life
      insurance or annuity), the Acquiring Fund, with respect to each of its
      taxable years that has ended prior to the Closing Date during which it has
      served as such a funding vehicle, has satisfied the diversification
      requirements of Section 817(h) of the Code and will continue to satisfy
      the requirements of Section 817(h) of the Code for the period beginning on
      the first day of its current taxable year and ending on the Closing Date;

      Closing Date will be, duly authorized and validly issued and outstanding,
      fully paid and non-assessable by the Acquiring Entity and, in every state
      where offered or sold, such offers and sales have been in compliance in
      all material respects with applicable registration and/or notice
      requirements of the 1933 Act and state and District of Columbia securities
      laws;

            (k) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will
      have been duly authorized prior to the Closing Date by all necessary
      action, if any, on the part of the trustees of the Acquiring Entity, on
      behalf of the Acquiring Fund, and subject to the approval of shareholders
      of the Target Fund and the due authorization, execution and delivery of
      this Agreement by the other parties hereto, this Agreement will constitute
      a valid and binding obligation of the Acquiring Fund, enforceable in
      accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy,
      insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws relating to or
      affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles;

            (l) The shares of the Acquiring Fund to be issued and delivered to
      the Target Fund, for the account of the Target Fund Shareholders, pursuant
      to the terms of this Agreement, will on the Closing Date have been duly
      authorized and, when so issued and delivered, will be duly and validly
      issued Acquiring Fund shares, and, upon receipt of the Target Fund's
      Assets in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be fully paid
      and non-assessable by the Acquiring Entity;

            (m) The books and records of the Acquiring Fund are true and correct
      in all material respects and contain no material omissions with respect to
      information required to be maintained under laws, rules, and regulations
      applicable to the Acquiring Fund;

            (n) The Acquiring Fund is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a
      Title 11 or similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the
      Code;

            (o) The Acquiring Fund has no unamortized or unpaid organizational
      fees or expenses for which it does not expect to be reimbursed by Invesco
      or its affiliates.

      periods ending after the Closing Date.

      and the Target Fund will each take, or cause to be taken, all action, and

      treatment or results in the failure of such Reorganization to qualify as a
      reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code.

            (j) Any reporting responsibility of the Target Fund, including, but
      not limited to, the responsibility for filing regulatory reports, tax
      returns relating to tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
      (whether due before or after the Closing Date), or other documents with

8.    FURTHER CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATIONS OF THE ACQUIRING FUND AND THE
      TARGET FUND

      With respect to each Reorganization, if any of the conditions set forth
below have not been satisfied on or before the Closing Date with respect to the
Target Fund or the Acquiring Fund, the Acquiring Entity or Target Entity,
respectively, shall, at its option, not be required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement:

      8.1. The Agreement shall have been approved by the requisite vote of the
holders of the outstanding shares of the Target Fund in accordance with the
provisions of the Target Entity's Governing Documents, Delaware law, and the
1940 Act. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Target
Fund nor the Acquiring Fund may waive the conditions set forth in this Section
8.1;

      8.2. On the Closing Date, no action, suit or other proceeding shall be
pending or, to the Target Entity's or the Acquiring Entity's knowledge,
threatened before any court or governmental agency in which it is sought to
restrain or prohibit, or obtain damages or other relief in connection with, this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein;

      8.3. All consents of other parties and all other consents, orders and
permits of Federal, state and local regulatory authorities deemed necessary by
the Acquiring Fund or the Target Fund to permit consummation, in all material
respects, of the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been obtained,
except where failure to obtain any such consent, order or permit would not
involve a risk of a material adverse effect on the assets or properties of the
Acquiring Fund or the Target Fund, provided that either party hereto may for
itself waive any of such conditions;

      8.4. A registration statement on Form N-14 under the 1933 Act properly
registering the Acquiring Fund shares to be issued in connection with the
Reorganization shall have become effective under the 1933 Act and no stop orders
suspending the effectiveness thereof shall have been issued and, to the best

shall have been instituted or be pending, threatened or known to be contemplated
under the 1933 Act; and

      8.5. The Target Entity and the Acquiring Entity shall have received on or
before the Closing Date an opinion of Stradley Ronon in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Target Entity and the Acquiring Entity, as to the
matters set forth on Schedule 8.6. In rendering such opinion, Stradley Ronon may
request and rely upon representations contained in certificates of officers of
the Target Entity, the Acquiring Entity and others, and the officers of the
Target

                                      -14-
<PAGE>

Entity and the Acquiring Entity shall use their best efforts to make available
such truthful certificates.

9.    FEES AND EXPENSES

      9.1. Each Acquiring Fund will bear its expenses relating to the
Reorganizations, which IAI has estimated to be $30,000 per Reorganization. A
Target Fund will bear its costs associated with the Reorganization to the extent
that the Target Fund is expected to recoup those costs within 24 months
following the Reorganization as a result of reduced total annual fund operating
expenses based on estimates prepared by the Adviser and discussed with the
Board. IAI has agreed to bear the Reorganization costs of any Target Fund that
does not meet the foregoing threshold.

10.   FINAL TAX RETURNS AND FORMS 1099 OF TARGET FUND

parties, Target Entity shall or shall cause its agents to prepare any federal,
state or local tax returns, including any Forms 1099, required to be filed by
Target Entity with respect to each Target Fund's final taxable year ending with
its complete liquidation and for any prior periods or taxable years and shall
further cause such tax returns and Forms 1099 to be duly filed with the
appropriate taxing authorities.

11.   ENTIRE AGREEMENT; SURVIVAL OF WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS

      11.1. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith
shall not survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder.
The covenants to be performed after the Closing shall survive the Closing.

12.   TERMINATION

      This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby
may be abandoned with respect to one or more (or all) Reorganizations by mutual
agreement of the parties.

13.   AMENDMENTS

      This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented in a writing
signed by the parties hereto to be bound by such Amendment.

14.   HEADINGS; GOVERNING LAW; COUNTERPARTS; ASSIGNMENT; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

      14.1. The Article and Section headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

                                      -15-
<PAGE>

      14.2. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable Federal law, without regard to
its principles of conflicts of laws.

      14.3. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns, but no assignment or
transfer hereof or of any rights or obligations hereunder shall be made by any
party without the written consent of the other parties. Nothing herein expressed
or implied is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any person,
firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement.

      14.4. This agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each
of which shall be considered an original.

      14.5. It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the parties hereunder
shall not be binding upon any of their respective directors or trustees,
shareholders, nominees, officers, agents, or employees personally, but shall
bind only the property of the applicable Target Fund or the applicable Acquiring
Fund as provided in the Governing Documents of the Target Entity or the
Agreement and Declaration of Trust of the Acquiring Entity, respectively. The
execution and delivery by such officers shall not be deemed to have been made by
any of them individually or to impose any liability on any of them personally,
but shall bind only the property of such party.

                                      -16-
