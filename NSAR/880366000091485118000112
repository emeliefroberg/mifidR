"850","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"851","To the Board of Trustees of Legg Mason Partners Equity Trust and"
"852","Shareholders of ClearBridge Dividend Strategy Fund:"
"853","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"854","of ClearBridge Dividend Strategy Fund, a series of Legg Mason"
"855","Partners Equity Trust (the Company) as of and for the year"
"856","ended December 31, 2017, in accordance with the standards of the"
"857","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"858","considered the Company's internal control over financial"
"859","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"860","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"861","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"862","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"863","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's"
"864","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"865","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's"
"866","internal control over financial reporting."
"867","The management of the Company is responsible for establishing"
"868","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"869","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"870","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"871","benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"872","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"873","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"874","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"875","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"876","accounting principles.  A company's internal control over"
"877","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"878","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"879","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"880","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"881","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"882","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"883","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"884","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"885","with authorizations of management and trustees of the company;"
"886","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"887","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"888","of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"889","financial statements."
"890","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"891","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"892","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"893","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"894","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"895","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"896","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"897","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"898","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"899","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"900","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"901","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"902","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"903","material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim"
"904","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"905","timely basis."
"906","Our consideration of the Company's internal control over"
"907","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the"
"908","first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"909","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that"
"910","might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"911","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"912","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Company's internal"
"913","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"914","controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be"
"915","material weaknesses as defined above as of December 31, 2017."

"1030","EACH DATED MAY 1, 2017"
"1031","The following information supplements the fund's Summary Prospectus,"
"1032","Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information:"
"1033","At a meeting of the Board of Trustees (the Board) of the Legg Mason"
"1034","Partners Equity Trust (the Trust) held on July 25-26, 2017, the Board"
"1035","approved a proposal from Legg Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC (LMPFA), the"
"1036","fund's manager, and EnTrustPermal Management LLC (EnTrustPermal), the"
"1037","fund's subadviser, to change how the fund's investment strategy is"
"1038","implemented - specifically, from a fund-of-funds to a fund that will obtain"
"1039","greater exposure to asset classes and strategies through investment in"
"1040","exchange-traded funds (ETFs), securities and other instruments rather than"
"1041","through investing more than 25% of its assets in mutual funds. In addition,"
"1042","the Board approved, subject to shareholder approval, a proposal to revise the"
"1043","fund's investment restriction (the Revised Restriction) relating to"
"1044","concentration of investments, under which the fund would no longer be"
"1045","required to concentrate more than 25% of its assets in the mutual fund"
"1046","industry. Under the Revised Restriction, the fund would not be permitted to"
"1047","concentrate (i.e., invest more than 25% of its assets) in any industry."
"1048","In connection with the changes described above, the Board approved, subject"
"1049","to shareholder approval, an amended and restated management agreement between"
"1050","the Trust and LMPFA with respect to the fund (the Proposed Management
Agreement) under which the management fee payable by the fund would be"
"1051","increased from an annual rate of 0.65% of the fund's average daily net assets"
"1052","to an annual rate of 0.90% of the fund's average daily net assets up to and"
"1053","including $1 billion, declining to 0.85% of average daily net assets in"
"1054","excess of $1 billion and up to and including $2 billion and 0.80% of average"
"1055","daily net assets in excess of $2 billion."
"1056","The Board also approved, subject to shareholder approval, an amended and"
"1057","restated subadvisory agreement between LMPFA and EnTrustPermal Partners"
"1058","Offshore LP (EPOLP) with respect to the fund (the Proposed Subadvisory
Agreement). It is currently anticipated that the fund will change its"
"1059","current subadviser from EnTrustPermal Management LLC (EnTrustPermal) to"
"1060","EPOLP (an affiliate of EnTrustPermal) no later than October 1, 2017. EPOLP, a"
"1061","Delaware limited partnership, is a registered investment adviser and the"
"1062","surviving entity in a consolidation of multiple investment management"
"1063","entities (including EnTrustPermal) that are subsidiaries of EnTrustPermal"
"1064","LLC. Under the Proposed Subadvisory Agreement, the subadvisory fees payable"
"1065","by LMPFA to EPOLP would be higher than the fees payable by LMPFA to"
"1066","EnTrustPermal under the current subadvisory agreement. LMPFA currently pays"
"1067","an aggregate subadvisory fee to EnTrustPermal and Western Asset Management"
"1068","Company (Western Asset) at the annual rate of 0.450% of the fund's average"
"1069","daily net assets up to and including $250 million, declining to 0.400% of the"
"1070","fund's average daily net assets over $250 million and up to and including"
"1071","$750 million and to 0.350% of average daily net assets over $750 million."
"1072","LMPFA also currently pays EnTrustPermal a separate fee of 0.05% of the fund's"
"1073","average daily net assets related to implementation of portfolio investment"
"1074","decisions and provision of compliance and portfolio execution services to the"
"1075","fund. Under the Proposed Subadvisory Agreement, LMPFA (not the fund) would"
"1076","pay EPOLP and Western Asset an aggregate fee equal to 70% of the management"
"1077","fee paid to LMPFA, net of fee waivers and expense reimbursements."
"1078","The Board also approved new contractual caps on fund operating expenses,"
"1079","under which total annual fund operating expenses (other than interest,"
"1080","brokerage (including brokerage commissions on purchases and sales of closed-"
"1081","end funds, ETFs, exchange-traded notes and other assets), taxes, incentive or"
"1082","performance-based fees of underlying funds, acquired fund fees and expenses,"
"1083","dividend and interest expenses on securities sold short and extraordinary"
"1084","expenses) would be capped at 1.45% for Class A shares, 2.20% for Class C"
"1085","shares, 1.45% for Class FI shares, 1.70% for Class R shares, 1.10% for Class"
"1086","I shares and 1.00% for Class IS shares. In addition, total annual fund"
"1087","operating expenses for Class IS shares would not exceed total annual fund"
"1088","operating expenses for Class I shares. The revised contractual caps would go"
"1089","into effect if the Proposed Management Agreement and Proposed Subadvisory"
"1090","Agreement are approved by shareholders and would continue in effect until"
"1091","December 31, 2019. The current voluntary caps (which are in addition to the"
"1092","current contractual caps) of 1.95% for Class A shares, 2.70% for Class C"
"1093","shares, 1.95% for Class FI shares, 2.20% for Class R shares, 1.70% for Class"
"1094","I shares and 1.70% for Class IS shares would be eliminated at the same time"
"1095","that the revised contractual caps would go into effect."
"1096","In addition to the increased investments in ETFs, securities and other"
"1097","instruments, EnTrustPermal advised the Board that it expected to increase its"
"1098","use of derivative instruments to take short positions as opposed to selling"
"1099","securities short, as it does currently and may continue to do. A short"
"1100","position involves the risk of a theoretically unlimited increase in the value"
"1101","of the underlying instrument or security and, thus, the risk of a"

"1114","It is anticipated that a proxy statement further describing the proposals and"
