"950","     Report of Independent Registered"
"951","         Public Accounting Firm"
"952","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"953","Credit Suisse Commodity Strategy Funds:"
"954","In planning and performing our audits"
"955","of the financial statements of Credit"
"956","Suisse Commodity ACCESS Strategy Fund"
"957","and Credit Suisse Commodity Return"
"958","Strategy Fund (the Funds), each a"
"959","series of Credit Suisse Commodity"
"960","Strategy Funds, as of and for the"
"961","year ended October 31,2015, in"
"962","accordance with the standards of the"
"963","Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"964","Board (United States), we considered"
"965","the Funds' internal control over"
"966","financial reporting, including controls"
"967","over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"968","for designing our auditing procedures for"
"969","the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"970","the financial statements and to comply"
"971","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"972","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"973","on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"974","control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"975","we express no such opinion."
"976","Management of the Funds is responsible for"
"977","establishing and maintaining effective"
"978","internal control over financial reporting."
"979","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"980","and judgments by management are required to"
"981","assess the expected benefits and related costs"
"982","of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"983","financial reporting is a process designed to"
"984","provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"985","reliability of financial reporting and the"
"986","preparation of financial statements for"
"987","external purposes in accordance with generally"
"988","accepted accounting principles.  A fund's"
"989","internal control over financial reporting"
"990","includes those policies and procedures that"
"991","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"992","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"993","fairly reflect the transactions and"
"994","dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"995","(2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"996","transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"997","permit preparation of financial statements"
"998","in accordance with generally accepted"
"999","accounting principles, and that receipts"
"1000","and expenditures of the fund are being"
"1001","made only in accordance with authorizations"
"1002","of management and trustees of the fund; and"
"1003","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1004","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1005","acquisition, use, or disposition of the fund's"
"1006","assets that could have a material effect on"
"1007","the financial statements."
"1008","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1009","control over financial reporting may not"
"1010","prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"1011","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"
"1012","to future periods are subject to the risk"
"1013","that controls may become inadequate because"
"1014","of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"1015","of compliance with the policies or procedures"
"1016","may deteriorate."
"1017","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1018","reporting exists when the design or operation"
"1019","of a control does not allow management or"
"1020","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1021","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1022","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"1023","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"1024","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1025","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1026","possibility that a material misstatement of"
"1027","the Funds' annual or interim financial statements"
"1028","will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"1029","basis."
"1030","Our consideration of the Funds' internal"
"1031","control over financial reporting was for"
"1032","the limited purpose described in the first"
"1033","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1034","all deficiencies in internal control that"
"1035","might be material weaknesses under standards"
"1036","established by the Public Company Accounting"
"1037","Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"1038","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"1039","internal control over financial reporting"
"1040","and their operation, including controls"
"1041","over safeguarding securities that we"
"1042","consider to be a material weakness as"
"1043","defined above as of October 31, 2015."
"1044","This report is intended solely for the"
"1045","information and use of management and"
"1046","the Board of Trustees of Credit Suisse"
"1047","Commodity Strategy Funds and the Securities"
"1048","and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
