"1648","EXHIBIT 77B"
"1649","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1650","To the Trustees and Shareholders of Columbia Funds Series Trust I"
"1651","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"1652","Dividend Income Fund, High Yield Municipal Fund, High Yield"
"1653","Opportunity Fund, International Bond Fund, and Strategic Income Fund"
"1654","(each a series of Columbia Funds Series Trust I and hereafter"
"1655","referred to as the Funds) as of and for the period ended May 31,"
"1656","2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1657","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"1658","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1659","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1660","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1661","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"1662","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1663","Funds' internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"1664","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"1665","control over financial reporting."
"1666","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"1667","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"1668","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"1669","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1670","controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1671","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1672","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1673","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1674","accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over"
"1675","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1676","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1677","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"1678","the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1679","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1680","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1681","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"1682","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1683","trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1684","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"1685","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on"
"1686","the financial statements."
"1687","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1688","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"1689","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"1690","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1691","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1692","procedures may deteriorate."
"1693","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1694","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1695","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1696","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A"
"1697","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"1698","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1699","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's"
"1700","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1701","detected on a timely basis."
"1702","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1703","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1704","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1705","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"1706","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1707","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"1708","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"1709","and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities"
"1710","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of May"
"1711","31, 2012."
"1712","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1713","management and the Board of Trustees of the Funds and the Securities"
"1714","and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be"
"1715","used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1732","Columbia Strategic Income Fund"
"1733","(the Funds)"
"1734","Item 77D/77Q1(b) - Policies with Respect to Securities Investments:"
"1735","On March 13, 2012, Form Type 497(e), Accession No. 0001193125-12-"
"1736","111212, a supplement to the registration statement of Columbia Funds"
"1737","Series Trust I on behalf of the Columbia International Bond Fund was"
"1738","filed with the SEC. It is hereby incorporated by reference as part of"
"1739","the response to these Items 77D and 77Q1(b) of Form N-SAR. The"
"1740","supplement made material changes to the disclosure in the Principal"
"1741","Investment Strategies section of the Columbia International Bond"
"1742","Fund's prospectuses, as follows:"
"1743","Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its"
"1744","net assets in fixed-income securities of foreign issuers. Generally,"
"1745","the Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in"
"1746","debt securities of issuers in at least three foreign countries,"
"1747","including foreign governments, quasi-governments, provincials,"
"1748","agencies, instrumentalities, supranationals and corporate entities."
"1749","The Fund is not limited as to any particular countries in which it"
"1750","may invest. The Fund will invest in the securities of issuers in"
"1751","developed countries and the securities of issuers in emerging or"
"1752","developing countries."
"1753","Securities may be denominated in foreign currencies, baskets of"
"1754","foreign currencies or the U.S. dollar. The average portfolio duration"
"1755","will vary, based on the forecast for interest rates by Columbia"
"1756","Management Investment Advisers, LLC, the Fund's investment adviser"
"1757","(the Investment Manager)."
"1758","Under normal market conditions, at least 80% of the Fund's net assets"
"1759","(including the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) will"
"1760","be invested in investment-grade government or corporate debt"
"1761","obligations, including money market instruments, of issuers located"
"1762","in at least three foreign countries. Although the Fund emphasizes"
"1763","high- and medium-quality debt securities, it may assume some credit"
"1764","risk in seeking to achieve higher dividends and/or capital"
"1765","appreciation by investing in below investment-grade fixed-income"
"1766","securities (junk bonds)."
"1767","The Fund may invest in derivatives, including futures, forwards,"
"1768","options, swap contracts and other derivative instruments. The Fund"
"1769","may invest in derivatives for both hedging and non-hedging purposes,"
"1770","including, for example, to seek to enhance returns or as a substitute"
"1771","for a position in an underlying asset. The Fund may attempt to hedge"
"1772","the effects of currency value fluctuations on the Fund's investments."
"1773","The Fund also may invest in private placements."
"1774","The Fund is non-diversified, which means that it can invest a greater"
"1775","percentage of its assets in a single issuer than can a diversified"
"1776","fund."
"1777","The Investment Manager evaluates a number of factors in identifying"
"1778","investment opportunities and constructing the Fund's portfolio. The"
"1779","Investment Manager considers local, national and global economic"
"1780","conditions, market conditions, interest rate movements and other"
"1781","relevant factors to determine the allocation of the Fund's assets"
"1782","among different issuers, industry sectors and maturities."
"1783","The Investment Manager, in connection with selecting individual"
"1784","investments for the Fund, evaluates a security based on its potential"
"1785","to generate income and/or capital appreciation. The Investment"
"1786","Manager considers, among other factors, the creditworthiness of the"
"1787","issuer of the security and the various features of the security, such"
"1788","as its interest rate, yield, maturity, any call features and value"
"1789","relative to other securities."
"1790","The Investment Manager may sell a security if the Investment Manager"
"1791","believes that there is deterioration in the issuer's financial"
"1792","circumstances, or that other investments are more attractive; if"
"1793","there is deterioration in a security's credit rating; or for other"
"1794","reasons."
"1795","On July 20, 2012, Columbia Funds Series Trust I filed, on behalf of"
"1796","Columbia International Bond Fund, a post-effective amendment to its"
"1797","registration statement under Rule 485(a) of the Securities Act of"
"1798","1933, as amended, with these changes."

"1814","Item 77E - Legal Proceedings:"
"1815","In December 2005, without admitting or denying the allegations,"
"1816","American Express Financial Corporation (AEFC, which is now known as"
"1817","Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (Ameriprise Financial)) entered into"
"1818","settlement agreements with the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"1819","(SEC) and Minnesota Department of Commerce (MDOC) related to market"
"1820","timing activities. As a result, AEFC was censured and ordered to"
"1821","cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of certain"
"1822","provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment"
"1823","Company Act of 1940, and various Minnesota laws. AEFC agreed to pay"
"1824","disgorgement of $10 million and civil money penalties of $7 million."
"1825","AEFC also agreed to retain an independent distribution consultant to"
"1826","assist in developing a plan for distribution of all disgorgement and"
"1827","civil penalties ordered by the SEC in accordance with various"
"1828","undertakings detailed at www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/ia-2451.pdf."
"1829","Ameriprise Financial and its affiliates have cooperated with the"
"1830","SEC and the MDOC in these legal proceedings, and have made regular"
"1831","reports to the funds' Boards of Trustees."
"1832","Ameriprise Financial and certain of its affiliates have historically"
"1833","been involved in a number of legal, arbitration and regulatory"
"1834","proceedings, including routine litigation, class actions, and"
"1835","governmental actions, concerning matters arising in connection with"
"1836","the conduct of their business activities. Ameriprise Financial"
"1837","believes that the Funds are not currently the subject of, and that"
"1838","neither Ameriprise Financial nor any of its affiliates are the"
