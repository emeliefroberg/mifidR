"493","      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual"
"494","covenants herein contained, and intending to be legally bound"
"495","hereby, it is agreed among the parties hereto as follows:"
"496","SECTION 1.  Investment Advisory Services."
"497","      The Fund hereby engages the Adviser to act as its"

"501","portfolio of securities and investments, and shall from time to"
"502","time recommend to the Fund what securities, in the Adviser's"
"503","opinion, should be purchased or sold by the Fund, what portion"
"504","of the assets of the Fund should remain uninvested, and the"
"505","extent to which the Fund should otherwise use its investment"
"506","powers. In conducting such review and making such"
"507","recommendations, the Adviser shall be guided by the Fund's"
"508","investment policies as delineated and limited by the statements"
"509","contained in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange"
"510","Commission as amended from time to time, by policies adopted by"

"527","convenient for the discharge of the Adviser's obligations"
"528","hereunder or otherwise helpful to the Fund."

"535","another member of such an exchange or broker or dealer would"
"536","have charged for effecting such transaction, if the Adviser or"
"537","such officer or employee determines in good faith that such"
"538","amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of"
"539","the brokerage and research services (as such term is defined in"
"540","Section 28(e) (3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the"

"651","would cause the Fund's ratio of net operating expenses to"
"652","average net assets during any fiscal year to exceed two percent"
"653","(2%). The operating expenses of the Fund shall be accrued daily"
"654","and an interim computation shall be made at the end of each"
"655","month with respect to such limitation of expenses for the"
"656","current fiscal year. If the expenses do not exceed the"
"657","limitation and the Adviser has previously made payments to the"
"658","Fund with respect to the current fiscal year, the Adviser shall"
"659","be entitled to the return of such payments up to the amount of"
"660","the difference between the limitation and the expenses. Any"
"661","final adjustment for the fiscal year shall be made promptly"
"662","following the completion of the Fund's annual audit for such"
"663","year. The Fund agrees to assume and pay, or reimburse the"
"664","Adviser or such other entity for, the Fund's operating expenses,"
"665","including, without limitation, taxes, interest charges, fees of"
"666","its attorneys, independent accountants, accounting services"
"667","agents, custodians, transfer agents and registrars, certain"
"668","directors' fees and costs incurred in producing shareholder"
"669","reports and proxy materials. The Fund will also pay brokerage"
"670","commissions on its portfolio transactions."
"671","SECTION 6.  Compensation for Services."

"673","pay to the Adviser, except as otherwise provided in Section 5"
"674","hereof, on the last day of each month, a fee at the annual rate"
"675","of 3/4 of 1% of the Fund's average daily net asset value. The"
"676","fee shall be prorated for any portion of a month during which"
"677","the fee is payable."
"678","      The net asset value of the Fund shall be defined as the"
"679","total assets of the Fund, less its liabilities, and shall be"
"680","determined in accordance with instructions of the Board."
"681","SECTION 7.  Liability of the Investment Adviser."
"682","      The Adviser shall be liable only for willful misfeasance,"
"683","bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties"
"684","or reckless disregard of its obligations under this Agreement,"
"685","and nothing herein shall protect the Adviser against any such"
"686","liability to the Fund or its shareholders. The Adviser shall not"
"687","be liable for the acts and omissions of any agent (other than a"
"688","director, officer or employee of the Adviser) employed by the"
"689","Adviser, nor for those of any bank, trust company, broker or"
"690","other person with whom or into whose hands any moneys, shares of"
"691","the Fund or securities and investments may be deposited or come,"
"692","pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. The Adviser shall"
"693","not be liable for any defects in title of any property acquired,"
"694","nor for any loss unless it shall occur through the Adviser's own"

"702","of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), and (y) the holders of a"
"703","majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund and"
"704","(ii) upon completion of the Closing (the Effective Date), and"
"705","shall continue in effect for no more than two years after the"

"709","majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund; and"
"710","in either event by a vote of a majority of those directors of"

"729","in its corporate name shall not prevent the Adviser or any other"
"730","corporation affiliated with it, or its successors or assigns,"
"731","from using or permitting the use of the name Stratton, alone"
"732","or with any other word or words, for, by or in connection with"

"742","may continue to use the name Stratton so long as all"
"743","prospectuses and other material intended for investors is"
"744","appropriately marked to indicate that the Adviser is no longer"
"745","the Fund's investment adviser."
"746","SECTION 10.  Definitions."

"748","interested person and vote of a majority of the outstanding

"758","provisions of law, including, without limitation, the applicable"
"759","provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. To"
"760","the extent that any provisions herein contained conflict with"
"761","any such applicable provisions of law, the latter shall control."
"762","      The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall be"
"763","controlling and shall govern the construction, validity and"
"764","effect of this Agreement."
