"545","the Public"
"546","Company"
"547","Accounting"
"548","Oversight"
"549","Board (United"
"550","States), we"
"551","considered the"
"552","Funds internal"
"553","control over"
"554","financial"
"555","reporting,"
"556","including"
"557","controls over"
"558","safeguarding"

"568","to comply with"

"578","internal control"

"581","Accordingly, we"

"584","Management of"
"585","the Fund is"
"586","responsible for"
"587","establishing and"
"588","maintaining"
"589","effective"
"590","internal control"

"593","fulfilling this"

"612","assurance"
"613","regarding the"
"614","reliability of"
"615","financial"
"616","reporting and"
"617","the preparation"
"618","of financial"
"619","statements for"
"620","external"
"621","purposes in"
"622","accordance with"
"623","generally"

"625","accounting"
"626","principles. A"
"627","funds internal"
"628","control over"
"629","financial"
"630","reporting"
"631","includes those"
"632","policies and"
"633","procedures that"
"634","(1) pertain to"
"635","the maintenance"
"636","of records that,"
"637","in reasonable"
"638","detail, accurately"
"639","and fairly reflect"
"640","the transactions"
"641","and dispositions"
"642","of the assets of"
"643","the fund; (2)"
"644","provide"
"645","reasonable"
"646","assurance that"

"655","generally"
"656","accepted"

"663","in accordance"
"664","with"
"665","authorizations"
"666","of management"
"667","and directors of"
"668","the fund; and"
"669","(3) provide"
"670","reasonable"
"671","assurance"
"672","regarding"
"673","prevention or"
"674","timely detection"
"675","of unauthorized"
"676","acquisition, use,"
"677","or disposition"
"678","of the funds"
"679","assets that could"
"680","have a material"
"681","effect on the"
"682","financial"
"683","statements."
"684","Because of its"
"685","inherent"
"686","limitations,"
"687","internal control"
"688","over financial"
"689","reporting may"
"690","not prevent or"
"691","detect"
"692","misstatements."
"693","Also,"
"694","projections of"
"695","any evaluation"
"696","of effectiveness"
"697","to future"
"698","periods are"
"699","subject to the"
"700","risk that"
"701","controls may"
"702","become"
"703","inadequate"
"704","because of"
"705","changes in"
"706","conditions, or"
"707","the degree of"
"708","compliance with"
"709","policies and"
"710","procedures may"
"711","deteriorate."
"712","A deficiency in"
"713","internal control"
"714","over financial"
"715","reporting exists"
"716","when the design"
"717","or operation of"
"718","a control does"
"719","not allow"
"720","management or"
"721","employees, in"
"722","the normal"
"723","course of"
"724","performing their"
"725","assigned"
"726","functions, to"
"727","prevent or"
"728","detect"
"729","misstatements"
"730","on a timely"
"731","basis. A material"
"732","weakness is a"
"733","deficiency, or a"
"734","combination of"
"735","deficiencies, in"
"736","internal control"
"737","over financial"
"738","reporting, such"
"739","that there is a"
"740","reasonable"
"741","possibility that a"
"742","material"
"743","misstatement of"
"744","the Funds"
"745","annual or"
"746","interim financial"
"747","statements will"
"748","not be"
"749","prevented or"
"750","detected on a"
"751","timely basis."
"752","Our"
"753","consideration of"
"754","the Funds"
"755","internal control"
"756","over financial"
"757","reporting was"
"758","for the limited"
"759","purpose"
"760","described in the"
"761","first paragraph"
"762","and would not"
"763","necessarily"
"764","disclose all"
"765","deficiencies in"
"766","internal control"
"767","over financial"
"768","reporting that"
"769","might be"
"770","material"
"771","weaknesses"
"772","under standards"
"773","established by"
"774","the Public"
"775","Company"
"776","Accounting"
"777","Oversight"
"778","Board (United"
"779","States)."
"780","However, we"
"781","noted no"
"782","deficiencies in"
"783","the Funds"
"784","internal control"
"785","over financial"
"786","reporting and its"
"787","operation,"
"788","including"
"789","controls over"
"790","safeguarding"
"791","securities, that"
"792","we consider to"
"793","be material"
"794","weaknesses as"
"795","defined above"
"796","as of October"
"797","31, 2017."
