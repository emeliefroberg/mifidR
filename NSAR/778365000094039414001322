"1788","Municipal Opportunities Fund:"
"1789","In planning and performing our audit of the"

"1791","Municipal Opportunities Fund  (the Fund)"
"1792","(one of the funds constituting Eaton Vance"

"1794","ended July 31, 2014, in accordance with the"
"1795","standards of the Public Company"
"1796","Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1797","States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"1798","control over financial reporting, including"

"1800","basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"1801","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"

"1803","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"1804","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1805","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"1806","control over financial reporting."
"1807","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1808","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"1809","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"1810","internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"1811","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1812","judgments by management are required to"
"1813","assess the expected benefits and related"
"1814","costs of controls.  A fund's internal control"

"1818","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1819","statements for external purposes in"

"1836","reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1837","or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1838","acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's"
"1839","assets that could have a material effect on"
"1840","the financial statements."
"1841","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"

"1846","the risk that controls may become"
"1847","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"1848","or that the degree of compliance with the"

"1850","A deficiency in internal control over"

"1853","management or employees, in the normal"
"1854","course of performing their assigned"
"1855","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"1856","on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1857","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"1858","in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1859","such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"1860","that a material misstatement of a fund's"
"1861","annual or interim financial statements will"
"1862","not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"1863","basis."
"1864","Our consideration of the Fund's internal"

"1869","that might be material weaknesses under"
