"600","<DESCRIPTION>INTERNAL CONTROL"
"601","<TEXT>"
"602","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"603","To the Shareholders and"
"604","Board of Trustees of"
"605","Investment Managers Series Trust"
"606","Glendora, California 91740"
"607","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"608","Jubak  Global  Equity  Fund (the Fund), a  series  of  Investment"
"609","Managers  Series Trust, as of and for the year ended May 31,  2011,"
"610","in  accordance with the standards of the Public Company  Accounting"
"611","Oversight  Board  (United  States), we  considered  their  internal"
"612","control over financial reporting, including control activities  for"
"613","safeguarding  securities,  as a basis for  designing  our  auditing"
"614","procedures  for  the  purpose  of expressing  our  opinion  on  the"
"615","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"616","SAR,  but  not  for  the purpose of expressing an  opinion  on  the"
"617","effectiveness  of  the  Funds  internal  control  over   financial"
"618","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"619","The  management  of  the Fund is responsible for  establishing  and"
"620","maintaining  effective internal control over  financial  reporting."
"621","In  fulfilling  this  responsibility, estimates  and  judgments  by"
"622","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"623","costs  of  controls.   A companys internal control over  financial"
"624","reporting  is  a  process designed to provide reasonable  assurance"
"625","regarding   the   reliability  of  financial  reporting   and   the"
"626","preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in"
"627","accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.    A"
"628","companys internal control over financial reporting includes  those"
"629","policies  and  procedures that (1) pertain to  the  maintenance  of"
"630","records  that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly  reflect"
"631","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"632","provide  reasonable  assurance that transactions  are  recorded  as"
"633","necessary   to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements   in"
"634","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and  that"
"635","receipts  and  expenditures of the company are being made  only  in"
"636","accordance with authorizations of management and directors  of  the"
"637","company;  and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"638","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"639","of  a  companys assets that could have a material  effect  on  the"
"640","financial statements."
"641","Because  of  inherent limitations, internal control over  financial"
"642","reporting   may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.     Also,"
"643","projections  of  any evaluation of effectiveness to future  periods"
"644","are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"645","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"646","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"647","A  deficiency  in internal control over financial reporting  exists"
"648","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"649","or  employees,  in the normal course of performing  their  assigned"
"650","functions,  to  prevent or detect misstatements on a timely  basis."
"651","A   material   weakness  is  a  deficiency,   or   combination   of"
"652","deficiencies,  in internal control over financial  reporting,  such"
"653","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"654","of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"655","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"656","Our  consideration  of the Funds internal control  over  financial"
"657","reporting  was  for  the  limited purpose described  in  the  first"
"658","paragraph  and  would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies  in"
"659","internal  control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"660","established  by  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board"
"661","(United States).   However, we noted no deficiencies in the  Funds"
"662","internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  its  operation,"
"663","including  controls for safeguarding securities, which we  consider"
"664","to be material weaknesses, as defined above, as of May 31, 2011."
"665","This  report  is  intended solely for the information  and  use  of"
"666","management,  Shareholders  and  Board  of  Trustees  of  Investment"
"667","Managers  Series Trust and the Securities and Exchange  Commission,"
"668","and  is  not intended to be and should not be used by anyone  other"
"669","than these specified parties."
