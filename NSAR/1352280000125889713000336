"1033","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1034","To the Trustees and Shareholders of Columbia Funds Series Trust II"
"1035","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of the"
"1036","Columbia Recovery and Infrastructure Fund (hereafter referred to as the Fund)"
"1037","as of and for the year ended April 30, 2013, in accordance with the standards"
"1038","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"1039","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1040","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"1041","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"1042","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"1043","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1044","reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"1045","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"1046","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1047","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1048","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1049","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"1050","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1051","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1052","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1053","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"1054","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1055","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1056","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"1057","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1058","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1059","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"1060","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1061","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1062","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"1063","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1064","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1065","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1066","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1067","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1068","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1069","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1070","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"1071","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1072","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1073","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1074","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1075","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"1076","on a timely basis."
"1077","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"1078","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1079","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"1080","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1081","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"1082","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1083","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to"
"1084","be material weaknesses as defined above as of April 30, 2013."

"1102","EXHIBIT 77E"
"1103","In December 2005, without admitting or denying the allegations, American"
"1104","Express Financial Corporation (AEFC, which is now known as Ameriprise"
"1105","Financial, Inc. (Ameriprise Financial)) entered into settlement agreements with"
"1106","the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Minnesota Department of"
"1107","Commerce (MDOC) related to market timing activities. As a result, AEFC was"
"1108","censured and ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any"
"1109","violations of certain provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the"
"1110","Investment Company Act of 1940, and various Minnesota laws. AEFC agreed to pay"
"1111","disgorgement of $10 million and civil money penalties of $7 million. AEFC also"
"1112","agreed to retain an independent distribution consultant to assist in developing"
"1113","a plan for distribution of all disgorgement and civil penalties ordered by the"
"1114","SEC in accordance with various undertakings detailed at"
"1115","www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/ia-2451.pdf. Ameriprise Financial and its"
"1116","affiliates have cooperated with the SEC and the MDOC in these legal"
"1117","proceedings, and have made regular reports to the funds' Boards of Trustees."
"1118","Ameriprise Financial and certain of its affiliates have historically been"
"1119","involved in a number of legal, arbitration and regulatory proceedings,"
"1120","including routine litigation, class actions, and governmental actions,"
"1121","concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of their business"
"1122","activities. Ameriprise Financial believes that the Funds are not currently the"
"1123","subject of, and that neither Ameriprise Financial nor any of its affiliates are"
"1124","the subject of, any pending legal, arbitration or regulatory proceedings that"
"1125","are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Funds or the ability of"
"1126","Ameriprise Financial or its affiliates to perform under their contracts with"
"1127","the Funds. Ameriprise Financial is required to make 10-Q, 10-K and, as"
"1128","necessary, 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on legal and"
"1129","regulatory matters that relate to Ameriprise Financial and its affiliates."
"1130","Copies of these filings may be obtained by accessing the SEC website at"
"1131","www.sec.gov."
"1132","There can be no assurance that these matters, or the adverse publicity"
"1133","associated with them, will not result in increased fund redemptions, reduced"
"1134","sale of fund shares or other adverse consequences to the Funds. Further,"
"1135","although we believe proceedings are not likely to have a material adverse"
"1136","effect on the Funds or the ability of Ameriprise Financial or its affiliates to"
