"1022","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"1023","Accounting Firm"
"1024","To the Board of Trustees of Vanguard Fenway"
"1025","Funds and the Shareholders of"
"1026","Vanguard Growth Equity Fund"
"1027","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"1028","financial statements of Vanguard Equity Income"
"1029","Fund, Vanguard Growth Equity Fund and Vanguard"
"1030","PRIMECAP Core Fund (one of the funds"
"1031","constituting Vanguard Fenway Funds, hereafter"
"1032","referred to as the ?Fund?) as of and for the year"
"1033","ended September 30, 2010, in accordance with the"
"1034","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1035","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1036","Trust?s internal control over financial reporting,"
"1037","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"1038","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1039","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1040","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"1041","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"1042","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund?s"
"1043","internal control over financial reporting."
"1044","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"1045","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"1046","financial reporting."
"1047","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"1048","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1049","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1050","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1051","management are required to assess the expected"
"1052","benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"1053","company?s internal control over financial reporting is"
"1054","a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1055","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"1056","reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"1057","for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1058","accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"1059","internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1060","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1061","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1062","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"

"1126","To the Board of Trustees of Vanguard Fenway"
"1127","Funds and the Shareholders of"
"1128","Vanguard Equity Income Fund and"
"1129","Vanguard PRIMECAP Core Fund"
"1130","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"1131","financial statements of Vanguard Equity Income"
"1132","Fund, Vanguard Growth Equity Fund and Vanguard"
"1133","PRIMECAP Core Fund (two of the funds"
"1134","constituting Vanguard Fenway Funds, hereafter"
"1135","referred to as the ?Funds?) as of and for the year"
"1136","ended September 30, 2010, in accordance with the"
"1137","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1138","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1139","Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"1140","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"1141","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1142","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1143","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"1144","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"1145","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"1146","internal control over financial reporting."
"1147","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"1148","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"1149","financial reporting."
"1150","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"1151","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1152","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1153","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1154","management are required to assess the expected"
"1155","benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"1156","company?s internal control over financial reporting is"
"1157","a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1158","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"1159","reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"1160","for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1161","accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"1162","internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1163","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1164","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1165","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1166","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"1167","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
