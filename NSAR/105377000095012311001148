"2611","the year ended October 31, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"2612","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"2613","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"2614","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2615","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"

"2617","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"2618","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"2619","internal control over financial reporting."
"2620","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"2621","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"2622","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"2623","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"2624","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2625","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"2626","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2627","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"2628","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"2629","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"2630","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"2631","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2632","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"2633","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"2634","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of"

"2636","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"2637","company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2638","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2639","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2640","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2641","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"2642","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2643","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"2644","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"2645","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2646","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2647","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"2648","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2649","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"

"2771","Pending Regulatory Action Alleging Market Timing"
"2772","     On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Office of the State Auditor -"
"2773","Securities Commission (WVASC) issued a Summary Order to Cease and Desist and"
"2774","Notice of Right to Hearing to Invesco and Invesco Distributors (Order No."
"2775","05-1318). The WVASC makes findings of fact that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"2776","entered into certain arrangements permitting market timing of the Invesco Funds"
"2777","and failed to disclose these arrangements in the prospectuses for such Funds,"
"2778","and conclusions of law to the effect that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"2779","violated the West Virginia securities laws. The WVASC orders Invesco and Invesco"
"2780","Distributors to cease any further violations and seeks to impose monetary"
"2781","sanctions, including restitution to affected investors, disgorgement of fees,"
"2782","reimbursement of investigatory, administrative and legal costs and an"
"2783","administrative assessment, to be determined by the Commissioner. Initial"
"2784","research indicates that these damages could be limited or capped by statute. By"
"2785","agreement with the Commissioner of Securities, Invesco's time to respond to that"
"2786","Order has been indefinitely suspended."
"2787","Private Civil Actions Alleging Market Timing"
"2788","     Multiple civil lawsuits, including purported class action and shareholder"
"2789","derivative suits, have been filed against various parties (including, depending"
"2790","on the lawsuit, certain Invesco Funds, IFG, Invesco, Invesco Aim Management"
"2791","Group, Inc., n/k/a Invesco Management Group, Inc. and certain related entities,"

"2796","allegations of improper market timing and related activity in the Invesco Funds."
"2797","These lawsuits allege a variety of theories of recovery, including but not"
"2798","limited to: (i) violation of various provisions of the Federal and state"
"2799","securities laws; (ii) violation of various provisions of Employee Retirement"
"2800","Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA); (iii) breach of fiduciary duty;"
"2801","and/or (iv) breach of contract. These lawsuits were initiated in both Federal"
"2802","and state courts and seek such remedies as compensatory damages; restitution;"
"2803","injunctive relief; disgorgement of management fees; imposition of a constructive"
"2804","trust; removal of certain directors and/or employees; various corrective"
"2805","measures under ERISA; rescission of certain Funds' advisory agreements;"
"2806","interest; and attorneys' and experts' fees. All lawsuits based on allegations of"
"2807","market timing, late trading, and related issues have been transferred to the"
"2808","United States District Court for the District of Maryland (the MDL Court) for"
"2809","consolidated or coordinated pre-trial proceedings."
"2810","     Pursuant to an Order of the MDL Court, plaintiffs in these lawsuits"
"2811","consolidated their claims for pre-trial purposes into three amended complaints"
"2812","against various Invesco - and IFG-related parties. The parties in the amended"
"2813","complaints have agreed in principle to settle the actions. A list identifying"
"2814","the amended complaints in the MDL Court and details of the settlements are"

"2828","          1:04-MD-15864-FPS), filed on September 29, 2004."
"2829","     On March 1, 2006, the MDL Court dismissed all derivative causes of action"
"2830","in the Essenmacher lawsuit but two: (i) the excessive fee claim under Section"
"2831","36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act); and (ii) the"
"2832","control person liability claim under Section 48 of the 1940 Act, and all"
"2833","claims asserted in the Lepera class action lawsuit but three: (i) the securities"
"2834","fraud claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (ii)"
"2835","the excessive fee claim under Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act (which survived only"
"2836","insofar as plaintiffs seek recovery of fees associated with the assets involved"
"2837","in market timing); and (iii) the control person liability claim under Section"
"2838","48 of the 1940 Act. On June 14, 2006, the MDL Court entered an order dismissing"
"2839","the Section 48 claim in the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuit. Based on the MDL"
"2840","Court's March 1, 2006 and June 14, 2006 orders, all claims asserted against the"
"2841","Funds that were transferred to the MDL Court were dismissed, although certain"
"2842","Funds remain nominal defendants in the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuit. On"
"2843","January 5, 2008, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle both"
"2844","the class action (Lepera) and the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuits, subject to"
"2845","the MDL Court approval. Individual class members have the right to object."
"2846","     On September 15, 2006, Judge Motz for the MDL Court granted the Defendants'"
"2847","motion to dismiss the ERISA (Calderon) lawsuit and dismissed such lawsuit. The"
"2848","Plaintiff appealed this decision. On June 16, 2008, the Fourth Circuit Court of"
"2849","Appeals reversed the dismissal and remanded this lawsuit back to the MDL Court"
"2850","for further proceedings. On December 15, 2008, the parties reached an agreement"
"2851","in principle to settle this lawsuit, subject to the MDL Court approval."
"2852","Individual class members have the right to object. No payments are required"

"2885","     1. Section 2.6 of the Agreement is amended to add new section 2.6(d) to"
"2886","read as follows:"
"2887","          (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.6, Class B"
"2888","               Shares shall not convert to Class A Shares, if at the time of"
