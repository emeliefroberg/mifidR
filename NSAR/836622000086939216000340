"547","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"548","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"549","Putnam Diversified Income Trust:"
"550","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"551","statements of Putnam Diversified Income Trust (the Fund) as"
"552","of and for the year ended September 30, 2016, in accordance"
"553","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"554","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds"
"555","internal control over financial reporting, including"
"556","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"557","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"558","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"559","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"560","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"561","the Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"562","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"563","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"564","maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"565","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"566","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"567","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"568","companys internal control over financial reporting is a"
"569","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"570","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"571","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"572","with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  A"
"573","companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"574","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"575","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"576","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"577","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"578","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"579","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"580","accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"581","the company are being made only in accordance with"
"582","authorizations of management and trustees of the company;"
"583","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"584","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"585","disposition of the companys assets that could have a"
"586","material effect on the financial statements."
"587","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"588","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"589","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"590","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"591","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"592","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"593","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"594","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"595","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"596","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"597","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"598","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"599","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"600","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"601","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a"
"602","funds annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"603","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"604","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"605","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"606","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"607","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"608","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"609","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"610","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal"
"611","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"612","including controls over safeguarding securities, which we"
"613","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"614","September 30, 2016."

"669","Amendment to Amended and Restated Bylaws"
"670","WHEREAS, ARTICLE 13, Section 13.1 of the Amended and Restated"
"671","Bylaws (the Bylaws) of the Trusts permits the Board of Trustees"
"672","of the Trusts (the Trustees) to amend or repeal, in whole or in"

"674","WHEREAS, the Trustees desire to amend the Bylaws to add Article"
"675","14, Section 14.1, entitled Claims, which clarifies and defines"
"676","the distinction between direct shareholder claims and derivative"
"677","claims brought by or on behalf of the Trusts;"
"678","NOW, THEREFORE, the Bylaws are hereby amended as follows:"
"679","	1. 	The following shall be added as ARTICLE 14, Section"
"680","14.1:"
"681","14.1	Claims.  As used herein, a direct Shareholder claim shall"
"682","refer to (i) a claim based upon alleged violations of a"
"683","Shareholders individual rights independent of any harm to the"
"684","Trust, including a Shareholders voting rights under Article 10,"
"685","rights to receive a dividend payment as may be declared from time"
"686","to time, rights to inspect books and records, or other similar"
"687","rights personal to the Shareholder and independent of any harm to"
"688","the Trust; and (ii) a claim for which a direct shareholder action"
"689","is expressly provided under the U.S. federal securities laws. Any"
"690","claim asserted by a Shareholder that is not a direct Shareholder"
"691","claim, including without limitation any claims purporting to be"
"692","brought on behalf of the Trust or involving any alleged harm to"
"693","the Trust, shall be considered a derivative claim as used herein."
"694","This Amendment is effective as of April 22, 2016."
