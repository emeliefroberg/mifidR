"2340","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"

"2344","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"

"2347","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"

"2350","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"2351","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"

"2361","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"

"2367","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
