"709","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"710","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"711","Templeton China World Fund"
"712","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"713","Templeton China World Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year ended"
"714","August 31, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"715","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's"
"716","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"717","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"718","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"719","to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"720","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"721","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"722","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"723","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"724","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"725","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"726","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's"
"727","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"728","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"729","and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"730","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"731","A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"732","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"733","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"734","and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"735","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"736","of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"737","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made"
"738","only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"739","fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"740","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"741","fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"742","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"743","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"744","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"745","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"746","that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
