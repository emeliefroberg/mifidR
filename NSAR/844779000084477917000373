"6947","BLACKROCK FUNDS/SM/: BLACKROCK ADVANTAGE EMERGING MARKETS FUND"
"6948","77D(a)(g)"
"6949","Policies with respect to security investments"
"6950","On March 23, 2017, the Board of Trustees (the Board) of BlackRock Funds/SM/"
"6951","(the Trust) approved certain changes to the investment objective and"
"6952","investment strategies of BlackRock Emerging Markets Long/Short Equity Fund, a"
"6953","series of the Trust. The Board also approved a change in the name of BlackRock"
"6954","Emerging Markets Long/Short Equity Fund to BlackRock Advantage Emerging
Markets Fund (the Fund). In addition, Fund management determined to make"
"6955","certain changes to the benchmark index against which the Fund measures its"
"6956","performance."
"6957","The new investment objective of the Fund is to seek long-term capital"
"6958","appreciation, and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index/SM/ (the MSCI EM Index) is"
"6959","the new benchmark against which the Fund measures its performance."
"6960","Under the new investment strategies, under normal circumstances, the Fund seeks"
"6961","to invest at least 80% of its net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for"
"6962","investment purposes in equity securities issued by, or tied economically to,"
"6963","companies in emerging markets and derivatives that have similar economic"
"6964","characteristics to such securities. BlackRock considers an emerging market"
"6965","country to include any country that is: (1) generally recognized to be an"
"6966","emerging market country by the international financial community, including the"
"6967","World Bank; (2) classified by the United Nations as a developing country; or"
"6968","(3) included in the MSCI EM Index. BlackRock determines that an investment is"
"6969","tied economically to an emerging market if such investment satisfies one or"
"6970","more of the following conditions: (1) the issuer's primary trading market is in"
"6971","an emerging market; (2) the issuer is organized under the laws of, derives at"
"6972","least 50% of its revenue from, or has at least 50% of its assets in emerging"
"6973","markets; (3) the investment is included in an index representative of emerging"
"6974","markets; and (4) the investment is exposed to the economic risks and returns of"
"6975","emerging markets. The Fund primarily intends to invest in equity securities,"
"6976","which include common stock, preferred stock and convertible securities, or"
"6977","other financial instruments that are components of, or have characteristics"
"6978","similar to, the securities included in the MSCI EM Index. The MSCI EM Index is"
"6979","a capitalization-weighted index from a broad range of industries chosen for"
"6980","market size, liquidity and industry group representation. The Fund primarily"
"6981","seeks to buy common stock and may also invest in preferred stock and"
"6982","convertible securities. From time to time, the Fund may invest in shares of"
"6983","companies through new issues or initial public offerings (IPOs). The Fund"
"6984","may use derivatives, including options, futures, swaps, forward contracts and"
"6985","contracts for difference, both to seek to increase the return of the Fund and"
"6986","to hedge (or protect) the value of its assets against adverse movements in"
"6987","currency exchange rates, interest rates and movements in the securities"
"6988","markets. In order to manage cash flows into or out of the Fund effectively, the"
"6989","Fund may buy and sell financial futures contracts or options on such contracts."
"6990","Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from another"
"6991","security, a currency or an index, including but not limited to the MSCI EM"
"6992","Index. The use of options, futures, swaps, forward contracts and contracts for"
"6993","difference can be effective in protecting or enhancing the value of the Fund's"
"6994","assets."
"6995","These changes to the investment objective and the investment strategies of the"
"6996","Fund and the name change and benchmark change became effective June 12, 2017."

"7193","       WHEREAS, Adviser has agreed to furnish investment advisory services to"

"7199","sub-advisory services as described below in connection with Adviser's advisory"
"7200","activities on behalf of the Portfolios;"
"7201","       WHEREAS, the investment advisory agreement between Adviser and the Fund"
"7202","dated May 13, 2015 (such Agreement or the most recent successor agreement"
"7203","between such parties relating to advisory services to the Portfolios is"
"7204","referred to herein as the Advisory Agreement) contemplates that Adviser may"

"7206","each Portfolio;"
"7207","       WHEREAS, this Agreement has been approved in accordance with the"
"7208","provisions of the 1940 Act, and Sub-Adviser is willing to furnish such services"
"7209","upon the terms and conditions herein set forth;"
"7210","       NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants"
"7211","herein contained, it is agreed between the parties hereto as follows:"
"7212","       1. Appointment. Adviser hereby appoints Sub-Adviser to act as"
"7213","sub-adviser with respect to each Portfolio as provided in Section 2 of the"
"7214","Advisory Agreement. Sub-Adviser accepts such appointment and agrees to render"
"7215","the services herein set forth for the compensation herein provided."
"7216","       2. Services of Sub-Adviser. Subject to the oversight and supervision of"
"7217","Adviser and the Fund's Board of Trustees, Sub-Adviser will supervise certain"
"7218","day-to-day operations of each Portfolio and perform the following services:"
"7219","(i) act as investment adviser for and manage the investment and reinvestment of"
"7220","those assets of the Portfolio as Adviser may from time to time request and in"
"7221","connection therewith have complete discretion in purchasing and selling such"
"7222","securities and other assets for the Portfolio and in voting, exercising"
"7223","consents and exercising all other rights appertaining to such securities and"
"7224","other assets on behalf of the Portfolio; (ii) provide investment research and"
"7225","credit analysis concerning the Portfolio's investments; (iii) assist Adviser in"
"7226","determining what portion of the Portfolio's assets will be invested in cash and"
"7227","cash equivalents and money market instruments; (iv) place orders for all"
"7228","purchases and sales of such investments made for the Portfolio; and"
"7229","(v) maintain the books and records as are required to support Fund operations"
"7230","(in conjunction with record-keeping and accounting functions performed by"
"7231","Adviser). At the request of Adviser, Sub-Adviser will also, subject to the"
"7232","oversight and supervision of Adviser and the direction and control of the"
"7233","Fund's Board of Trustees, provide to Adviser or the Fund any of the facilities"
"7234","and equipment and"
"7235","<PAGE>"
"7236","perform any of the services described in Section 4 of the Advisory Agreement."
"7237","In addition, Sub-Adviser will keep the Fund and Adviser informed of"
"7238","developments materially affecting each Portfolio and shall, on its own"
"7239","initiative, furnish to the Fund from time to time whatever information"
"7240","Sub-Adviser believes appropriate for this purpose. Sub-Adviser will"
"7241","periodically communicate to Adviser, at such times as Adviser may direct,"
"7242","information concerning the purchase and sale of securities for each Portfolio,"
"7243","including (i) the name of the issuer, (ii) the amount of the purchase or sale,"
"7244","(iii) the name of the broker or dealer, if any, through which the purchase or"
"7245","sale will be effected, (iv) the CUSIP number of the instrument, if any, and"
"7246","(v) such other information as Adviser may reasonably require for purposes of"
"7247","fulfilling its obligations to the Fund under the Advisory Agreement."
"7248","Sub-Adviser will provide the services rendered by it under this Agreement in"
"7249","accordance with each Portfolio's investment objective, policies and"
"7250","restrictions as stated in the Portfolio's prospectus and statement of"
"7251","additional information (as currently in effect and as they may be amended or"
"7252","supplemented from time to time), and the resolutions of the Fund's Board of"
"7253","Trustees."
"7254","       3. Other Sub-Adviser Covenants. Sub-Adviser further agrees that it:"
"7255","          (a) will comply with (i) the provisions of the 1940 Act and the"
"7256","Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended and all applicable rules and"
"7257","regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), (ii) any"
"7258","other applicable provision of law and (iii) the provisions of this Agreement,"
"7259","the Declaration of Trust and the Amended and Restated Code of Regulations of"
"7260","the Fund as such are amended from time to time;"
"7261","          (b) will place orders either directly with the issuer or with any"
"7262","broker or dealer. Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph, in placing"
"7263","orders with brokers and dealers, Sub-Adviser will attempt to obtain the best"
"7264","price and the most favorable execution of its orders. In placing orders,"
"7265","Sub-Adviser will consider the experience and skill of the firm's securities"
"7266","traders as well as the firm's financial responsibility and administrative"
"7267","efficiency. Consistent with this obligation, Sub-Adviser may, subject to the"
"7268","approval of the Fund's Board of Trustees, select brokers on the basis of the"
"7269","research, statistical and pricing services they provide to each Portfolio and"
"7270","other clients of Adviser or Sub-Adviser. Information and research received from"
"7271","such brokers will be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the services required"
"7272","to be performed by Sub-Adviser hereunder. A commission paid to such brokers may"
"7273","be higher than that which another qualified broker would have charged for"
"7274","effecting the same transaction, PROVIDED that Sub-Adviser determines in good"
"7275","faith that such commission is reasonable in terms of either the transaction or"
"7276","the overall responsibility of Adviser and Sub-Adviser to each Portfolio and its"
"7277","other clients and that the total commissions paid by the Portfolio will be"
"7278","reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio over the long-term. In"
"7279","no instance, however, will a Portfolio's securities be purchased from or sold"
"7280","to Adviser, Sub-Adviser, the Fund's distributor or any affiliated person"
"7281","thereof, except to the extent permitted by the SEC or by applicable law. It is"
"7282","understood that Sub-Adviser may utilize affiliates in connection with the"
"7283","placement of orders with issuers and brokers or dealers, but such use of"
"7284","affiliates shall not affect the responsibility of Sub-Adviser to Adviser for"
"7285","such activities. Subject to the foregoing and the provisions of the 1940 Act,"
"7286","the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and other applicable"
"7287","provisions of law, Sub-Adviser may select brokers and dealers with which it or"
"7288","the Fund is affiliated;"
"7289","                                       2"
"7290","<PAGE>"
"7291","          (c) will maintain or cause Adviser to maintain books and records with"
"7292","respect to each Portfolio's securities transactions and will furnish Adviser"
"7293","and the Fund's Board of Trustees such periodic and special reports as they may"
"7294","request;"
"7295","          (d) will maintain a policy and practice of conducting its investment"
"7296","advisory services hereunder independently of the commercial banking operations"
"7297","of its affiliates. When Sub-Adviser makes investment recommendations for a"
"7298","Portfolio, its investment advisory personnel will not inquire or take into"
"7299","consideration whether the issuer of securities proposed for purchase or sale"
"7300","for the Portfolio's account are customers of the commercial departments of its"
"7301","affiliates. In dealing with commercial customers of its affiliates, Sub-Adviser"
"7302","will not inquire or take into consideration whether securities of those"
"7303","customers are held by the Fund; and"
"7304","          (e) will treat confidentially and as proprietary information of the"
"7305","Fund all records and other information relative to the Fund, any of a"
"7306","Portfolio's and the Fund's prior, current or potential shareholders, and will"
"7307","not use such records and information for any purpose other than performance of"
"7308","its responsibilities and duties hereunder, except after prior notification to"
"7309","and approval in writing by the Fund, which approval shall not be unreasonably"
"7310","withheld and may not be withheld where Sub-Adviser may be exposed to civil or"
"7311","criminal contempt proceedings for failure to comply, when requested to divulge"
"7312","such information by duly constituted authorities, or when so requested by the"
"7313","Fund."
"7314","       4. Services Not Exclusive. Sub-Adviser's services hereunder are not"
"7315","deemed to be exclusive, and Sub-Adviser shall be free to render similar"
"7316","services to others so long as its services under this Agreement are not"
"7317","impaired thereby."
"7318","       5. Books and Records. In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3"
"7319","under the 1940 Act, Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that all records which it"
"7320","maintains for the Portfolios are the property of the Fund and further agrees to"
"7321","surrender promptly to the Fund any such records upon the Fund's request."
"7322","Sub-Adviser further agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2"
"7323","under the 1940 Act the records required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under"
"7324","the 1940 Act."
"7325","       6. Expenses. During the term of this Agreement, Sub-Adviser will bear"
"7326","all costs and expenses of its employees and any overhead incurred by"
"7327","Sub-Adviser in connection with its duties hereunder; PROVIDED that the Board of"
"7328","Trustees of the Fund may approve reimbursement to Sub-Adviser of the pro rata"
"7329","portion of the salaries, bonuses, health insurance, retirement benefits and all"
"7330","similar employment costs for the time spent on Fund operations (including,"
"7331","without limitation, compliance matters) (other than the provision of investment"
"7332","advice required to be provided hereunder) of all personnel employed by"
"7333","Sub-Adviser who devote substantial time to Fund operations or the operations of"
"7334","other investment companies advised or sub-advised by Sub-Adviser."
"7335","       7. Compensation. For the services provided and the expenses assumed"
"7336","pursuant to this Agreement, Adviser will pay to Sub-Adviser a fee, computed"
"7337","daily and payable monthly, at the annual rate with respect to each Portfolio"
"7338","set forth on Appendix A attached hereto. For any period less than a month"
"7339","during which this Agreement is in effect, the fee shall"
"7340","                                       3"
"7341","<PAGE>"
"7342","be prorated according to the proportion which such period bears to a full month"
"7343","of 28, 29, 30 or 31 days, as the case may be."
"7344","       For purposes of the fee rates set forth on Appendix A, the net assets of"
"7345","a Portfolio shall be calculated pursuant to the procedures adopted by"
"7346","resolutions of the Fund's Board of Trustees for calculating the value of the"
"7347","Fund's assets or delegating such calculations to third parties."
"7348","       If Adviser waives any or all of its advisory fee payable under the"
"7349","Advisory Agreement, or reimburses the Fund pursuant to Section 8(b) of that"
"7350","Agreement, with respect to a Portfolio, Sub-Adviser will bear its share of the"
"7351","amount of such waiver or reimbursement by waiving fees otherwise payable to it"
"7352","hereunder on a proportionate basis to be determined by comparing the aggregate"
"7353","fees that would otherwise be paid to it hereunder with respect to the Portfolio"
"7354","to the aggregate fees that would otherwise be paid by the Fund to Adviser under"
"7355","the Advisory Agreement with respect to the Portfolio. Adviser shall inform"
"7356","Sub-Adviser prior to waiving or reimbursing any advisory fees."
"7357","       8. Limitation of Liability. Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any"
"7358","error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by Adviser or by a"
"7359","Portfolio in connection with the performance of this Agreement, except a loss"
"7360","resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of"
"7361","compensation for services or a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad"
"7362","faith or gross negligence on its part in the performance of its duties or from"
"7363","reckless disregard by it of its obligations or duties under this Agreement."
"7364","       9. Duration and Termination. This Agreement will become effective as of"
"7365","the date hereof and, unless sooner terminated with respect to a Portfolio as"
"7366","provided herein, shall continue in effect with respect to the Portfolio until"
"7367","for a period of two years. Thereafter, if not terminated, this Agreement shall"
"7368","continue in effect with respect to each Portfolio for successive periods of 12"
"7369","months, PROVIDED such continuance is specifically approved at least annually"
"7370","(a) by the vote of a majority of those members of the Fund's Board of Trustees"
"7371","who are not interested persons of any party to this Agreement, cast in person"
"7372","at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval, and (b) by the"
"7373","Fund's Board of Trustees or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting"
"7374","securities of the Portfolio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may"
"7375","be terminated with respect to a Portfolio at any time, without the payment of"
"7376","any penalty, by the Fund (by vote of the Fund's Board of Trustees or by vote of"
"7377","a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Portfolio), or by"
"7378","Adviser or Sub-Adviser on sixty days' written notice, and will terminate"
"7379","automatically upon any termination of the Advisory Agreement between the Fund"
"7380","and Adviser. This Agreement will also immediately terminate in the event of its"
"7381","assignment. (As used in this Agreement, the terms majority of the outstanding
voting securities, interested person and assignment shall have the same"
"7382","meanings as such terms in the 1940 Act.)"
"7383","       10. Notices. Any notice under this Agreement shall be in writing to the"
"7384","other party at such address as the other party may designate from time to time"
"7385","for the receipt of such notice and shall be deemed to be received on the"
"7386","earlier of the date actually received or on the fourth day after the postmark"
"7387","if such notice is mailed first class postage prepaid."

"10261","Fund, a series of the Trust.  The Board also approved a change"

"10284","by Fund management, which may include high yield securities"
"10285","(commonly called junk bonds)."
"10286","The Fund may invest in derivatives, including but not limited"

"10288","contracts for difference, options, futures, options on futures"

"10290","transactions, for hedging purposes, as well as to enhance the"
"10291","return on its portfolio investments. There is no limit to the"
"10292","Fund's ability to invest in derivatives. The Fund may engage in"
"10293","short sales of securities either to hedge against potential"
"10294","declines in the value of a security held in the portfolio or to"
"10295","realize appreciation when a security the Fund does not own"
"10296","declines in value."

Market Index Fund (each a series of BlackRock Funds, hereafter referred to as
the Funds) as of and for the period ended July 31, 2017, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
we considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including
controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing
procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial
statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting.

The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this
responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess
the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with

generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the
design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the
normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the
Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis.

Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was
for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not
necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial
reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no
deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and their
operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to
be material weaknesses as defined above as of July 31, 2017.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and
the Board of Trustees of BlackRock Funds and the Securities and Exchange
Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other
than these specified parties.
