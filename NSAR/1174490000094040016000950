"498","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"499","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"500","of Touchstone Institutional Funds Trust"
"501","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"502","statements of Touchstone Institutional Funds Trust (the"
"503","Trust) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, in"
"504","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"505","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"506","the Trust's internal control over financial reporting,"
"507","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"508","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"509","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"510","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"511","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"512","the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"513","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"514","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing"
"515","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"516","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"517","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"518","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"519","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"520","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"521","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"522","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"523","with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's"
"524","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"525","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"526","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"527","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"528","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"529","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"530","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"531","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"532","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"533","accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"534","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"535","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"536","acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets"
"537","that could have a material effect on the financial"
"538","statements."
"539","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"540","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"541","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"542","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"543","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"544","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"545","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"546","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"547","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"548","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"549","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"550","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"551","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"552","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"553","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"554","company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"555","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"556","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over"
"557","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"558","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"559","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"560","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"561","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"562","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trust's internal"
"563","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"564","including controls over safeguarding securities that we"
"565","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"566","December 31, 2015."
"567","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"568","of management and the Board of Trustees of the Trust and"
"569","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"570","to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"571","specified parties."

"582","AMENDMENT TO THE"
"583","AGREEMENT AND DECLARATION OF TRUST OF"
"584","TOUCHSTONE INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS TRUST"
"585","      Pursuant to Article VIII, Section 4 of the Agreement and"
"586","Declaration of Trust and the affirmative vote of the Trustees at"
"587","a meeting duly called and held on November 19, 2015,"
"588","Article VIII of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust is"
"589","amended by re-numbering Section 10 as Section 11 and by adding"
"590","Section 10 as follows:"
"591","      SECTION 10.  FORUM FOR ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES.
Unless the Trust consents in writing to the selection
of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum
for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on
behalf of the Trust, (ii) any action asserting a claim
of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any Trustee,
officer or other employee of the Trust to the Trust or
the Trust's Shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a
claim arising pursuant to any provision of the
Delaware Act or this Declaration of Trust or the By-
Laws, (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or
determine the validity of this Declaration of Trust or
the By-Laws or (v) any action asserting a claim
governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the
U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware or
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does
not have jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State
of Delaware (each, a Covered Action).  Any person
purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any
interest in shares of beneficial interest of the Trust
shall be (a) deemed to have notice of and consented to
the provisions of this Section 10, and (b) deemed to
have waived any argument relating to the inconvenience
of the forums referenced above in connection with any
action or proceeding described in this Section 10.

      If any Covered Action is filed in a court other
than the U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware or the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or the Superior Court of the State of
Delaware (a Foreign Action) in the name of any
Shareholder, such Shareholder shall be deemed to have
consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the U.S.
District Court for the District of Delaware or the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the
Superior Court of the State of Delaware in connection
with any action brought in any such courts to enforce
the first paragraph of this Section 10 (an
Enforcement Action) and (ii) having service of
process made upon such Shareholder in any such
Enforcement Action by service upon such Shareholder's
counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such
Shareholder.

      If any provision or provisions of this Section 10
shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
as applied to any person or circumstance for any
reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the validity, legality and
enforceability of such provision(s) in any other
circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this
Section 10 (including, without limitation, each
portion of any sentence of this Section 10 containing
any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such
provision to other persons and circumstances shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby."
