"1052","engaged RSM US, LLP (RSM) as the Funds'"
"1053","independent registered public accounting firm for"
"1054","the fiscal year ending October 31, 2017.  The selection"
"1055","was based on"
"1056","Deloitte & Touche LLP's (Deloitte) reports on the Funds'"
"1057","financial statements for the periods ended prior to November"
"1058","1, 2016 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer"
"1059","of opinion, nor were such reports qualified or modified"
"1060","as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles."
"1061","During the periods ended prior to November 1, 2016, there were"
"1062","no disagreements between the Funds and Deloitte on any matter"
"1063","of accounting principles or practices, financial statement"
"1064","disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements,"
"1065","if not resolved to the satisfaction of TWB, would have caused"
"1066","it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement"
"1067","in its report on the financial statements for such period."
"1068","During the periods ended prior to November 1, 2016, there were no"
"1069","reportable events (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of"
"1070","Regulation S-K)."

"1093","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"1094","Firm"
"1095","Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"1096","Miller Investment Trust"
"1097","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1098","statements of Miller Convertible Bond Fund, Miller"
"1099","Convertible Plus Fund, and Miller Intermediate Bond"
"1100","Fund (collectively, the Funds), as of and for the year"
"1101","ended October 31, 2017, in accordance with the"
"1102","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1103","Board (United States), we considered the Funds internal"
"1104","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1105","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1106","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1107","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"
"1108","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1109","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"1110","the Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"1111","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1112","The management of the Funds are responsible for"
"1113","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1114","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1115","estimates and judgments by management are required"
"1116","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1117","controls. A funds internal control over financial reporting"
"1118","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1119","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1120","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1121","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1122","principles (GAAP). A funds internal control over financial"
"1123","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (a)"
"1124","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1125","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1126","dispositions of the assets of the company; (b) provide"
"1127","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1128","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"1129","in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"1130","expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"1131","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1132","directors of the company; and (c) provide reasonable"
"1133","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1134","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a funds"
"1135","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1136","statements."
"1137","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1138","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1139","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1140","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1141","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1142","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1143","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1144","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1145","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1146","allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"1147","of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1148","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"1149","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,"
"1150","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there"
"1151","is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"1152","of the Funds annual or interim financial statements will"
"1153","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1154","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"1155","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"1156","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1157","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1158","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"1159","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1160","However, we identified the following deficiencies in"
"1161","internal control over financial reporting that we consider"
"1162","to be material weaknesses, as defined above. These"
"1163","conditions were considered in determining the nature,"
"1164","timing, and extent of the procedures performed in our"
"1165","audit of the financial statements of the Funds as of and"
"1166","for the year ended October 31, 2017, and this report"
"1167","does not affect our report thereon dated January 12,"
"1168","2018. As of and for the year ended October 31, 2017,"
"1169","we noted that review controls over the Funds calculation"
"1170","of convertible bond premium/discount"
"1171","amortization/accretion were not operating effectively and"
"1172","failed to detect errors within the calculation.  As a result,"
"1173","accounting entries were recorded to reclassify"
"1174","investment gains to interest income in the Funds"
"1175","financial statements for the year ended October 31,"
"1176","2017. The accounting entries did not impact net assets"
"1177","or net increase in net assets resulting from operations of"
"1178","the Funds. Management of the Funds has reviewed the"
"1179","processes and controls that gave rise to these"
"1180","adjustments, and as a result, management implemented"
"1181","changes that management believes will allow for the"
"1182","prevention and/or timely detection of similar errors on a"
"1183","prospective basis."
"1184","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"1185","of management and the Board of Trustees of the Funds"
"1186","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"1187","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"1188","than these specified parties."
