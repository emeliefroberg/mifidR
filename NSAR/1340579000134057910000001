"664","SUB-ITEM 77E: LEGAL"
"665","PROCEEDINGS"
"666","Since October 2003,"
"667","Federated and related"
"668"," entities (collectively,"
"669","Federated), and various"
"670","Federated funds"
"671","(Funds), have been"
"672","named as defendants in"
"673","several class action"
"674","lawsuits now pending in"
"675","the United States District"
"676","Court for the District"
"677","of Maryland. The lawsuits"
"678","were purportedly filed on"
"679"," behalf of people who purchased,"
"680","owned"
"681","and/or redeemed shares of"
"682","Federated-sponsored mutual"
"683","funds during specified"
"684","periods beginning November 1, 1998."
"685","The suits are generally"
"686","similar in alleging that"
"687","Federated engaged in illegal"
"688","and improper trading practices"
"689","including"
"690","market timing and late trading"
"691"," in concert with certain"
"692","institutional traders,"
"693","which allegedly caused financial"
"694","injury to"
"695","the mutual fund shareholders."
"696","These lawsuits began to be"
"697","filed shortly after Federated's"
"698"," first public announcement"
"699","that it had received requests"
"700"," for information on shareholder"
"701","trading activities in the Funds"
"702","from the SEC, the Office"
"703","of the New York State Attorney"
"704"," General (NYAG), and other"
"705","authorities. In that regard,"
"706","on November 28, 2005,"
"707","Federated announced that it"
"708","had reached final settlements"
"709"," with the SEC and the NYAG with"
"710","respect to those matters."
"711","Specifically, the SEC and"
"712","NYAG settled proceedings"
"713","against three Federated"
"714","subsidiaries involving"
"715","undisclosed"
"716","market timing arrangements"
"717","and late trading. The SEC made"
"718","findings: that Federated"
"719","Investment Management"
"720","Company (FIMC), an"
"721","SEC-registered investment"
"722","adviser to various Funds,"
"723","and Federated Securities"
"724","Corp., an"
"725","SEC-registered broker-dealer"
"726","and distributor for the Funds,"
"727","violated provisions of the"
"728","Investment Advisers Act and"
"729","Investment Company Act by"
"730","approving, but not disclosing,"
"731","three market timing arrangements,"
"732","or the associated"
"733","conflict of interest between"
"734"," FIMC and the funds involved"
"735","in the arrangements, either"
"736","to other fund shareholders"
"737"," or to"
"738","the funds' board; and that"
"739","Federated Shareholder Services"
"740","Company, formerly an"
"741","SEC-registered transfer agent,"
"742","failed to prevent a customer"
"743","and a Federated employee from"
"744","late trading in violation of"
"745","provisions of the Investment"
"746","Company Act. The NYAG found"
"747","that such conduct violated provisions"
"748","of New York State law. Federated entered"
"749","into the settlements without admitting"
"750","or denying the regulators' findings."
"751"," As Federated previously reported in 2004,"
"752","it has already paid approximately"
"753"," $8.0 million to certain funds as"
"754"," determined by an independent consultant."
"755","As part"
"756","of these settlements, Federated"
"757","agreed to pay disgorgement and"
"758","a civil money penalty in the"
"759","aggregate amount of an"
"760","additional $72 million and,"
"761","among other things, agreed"
"762","that it would not serve as investment"
"763","adviser"
"764"," to any"
"765","registered investment company"
"766","unless (i) at least 75% of the"
"767","fund's directors are independent"
"768","of Federated, (ii) the"
"769","chairman of each such fund is"
"770","independent of Federated, (iii)"
"771","no"
"772","action may be taken by the fund's"
"773","board or any"
"774","committee thereof unless approved"
"775"," by a majority of the independent"
"776","trustees of the fund or committee,"
"777"," respectively,"
"778","and (iv) the fund appoints a"
"779","senior officer who reports"
"780","to the independent trustees and"
"781","is responsible for"
"782","monitoring compliance by the"
"783"," fund with applicable laws"
"784","and fiduciary duties and for"
"785","managing the process by which"
"786","management fees charged to a"
"787","fund are approved. The settlements"
"788","are described in Federated's announcement"
"789","which, along with previous press"
"790","releases and related communications"
"791","on those matters, is available in the About

"793","Federated entities have also been"
"794","named as defendants in several"
"795","additional lawsuits that are now"
"796","pending in the"
"797","United States District Court for"
"798","the Western District of Pennsylvania,"
"799"," alleging, among other things, excessive"
"800","advisory and Rule 12b-1 fees."
"801","The Board of the Funds retained the"
"802","law"
"803"," firm of Dickstein Shapiro LLP to"
"804","represent the Funds in each of the"
"805","lawsuits described in the preceding"
"806","two paragraphs. Federated and the"
"807","Funds, and their respective counsel,"
"808","have"
"809","been defending this litigation, and"
"810","none of the Funds remains a defendant"
"811","in any of the lawsuits (though some could"
"812","potentially receive any recoveries as"
"813","nominal defendants). Additional lawsuits"
"814"," based upon similar allegations may"
"815","be filed in the future. The potential"
"816","impact of these lawsuits, all of which"
"817","seek unquantified damages, attorneys'"
"818","fees, and expenses, and future potential"
"819","similar suits is uncertain. Although"
"820","we do not believe that these lawsuits will"
"821","have a material adverse effect on the"
"822","Funds, there can be no assurance that"
"823","these suits, ongoing adverse publicity"
"824","and/or other developments resulting"
"825","from the regulatory investigations"
"826","will not result in increased Fund"
"827","redemptions, reduced sales of Fund"
"828","shares, or other adverse consequences"
"829","for the Funds."

"844","In planning and performing"
"845","our audit of the financial"
"846"," statements of Federated"
"847"," International Bond Strategy"
"848","Portfolio (one of the"
"849"," portfolios constituting"
"850","Federated Managed Pool"
"851","Series) (the Fund) as"
"852"," of and for"
"853","the year ended November"
"854","30, 2009, in accordance"
"855","with the standards of"
"856","the Public Company Accounting"
"857","Oversight Board (United"
"858","States), we considered"
"859"," the Fund's internal"
"860","control over financial"
"861","reporting,"
"862","including controls over"
"863","safeguarding securities,"
"864"," as a basis for designing"
"865","our auditing procedures for the"
"866","purpose of expressing our"
"867","opinion on the financial"
"868","statements and to comply"
"869","with the requirements of"
"870","Form N-SAR, but not for"
"871","the purpose of expressing"
"872","an opinion on the effectiveness"
"873","of the Fund's internal"
"874","control over financial"
"875","reporting.  Accordingly,"
"876","we express no such opinion."
"877","The management of the Fund"
"878","is responsible for establishing"
"879","and maintaining effective internal"
"880"," control"
"881","over financial reporting."
"882","In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"883","estimates and judgments by management"
"884","are"
"885","required to assess the expected"
"886"," benefits and related costs of controls."
"887","A company's internal control over"
"888","financial reporting is a"
"889","process designed to provide"
"890","reasonable assurance regarding"
"891","the reliability of"
"892","financial reporting and the"
"893","preparation of financial"
"894","statements for external purposes"
"895","in accordance with"
"896","generally accepted accounting"
"897"," principles.  A company's"
"898","internal control over financial"
"899","reporting includes"
"900","those policies and procedures"
"901","that (1) pertain to the"
"902","maintenance of records that,"
"903","in reasonable detail,"
"904","accurately and fairly reflect"
"905","the transactions and dispositions"
"906"," of the assets of the company;"
"907","(2) provide"
"908","reasonable assurance that"
"909","transactions are recorded as"
"910"," necessary to permit preparation"
"911","of financial"
"912","statements in accordance with"
"913","generally accepted accounting"
"914","principles, and that receipts and"
"915","expenditures of the company are"
"916","being made only in accordance"
"917","with authorizations of management"
"918"," and"
"919","directors of the company; and"
"920"," (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"921","regarding prevention or timely"
"922","detection"
"923","of unauthorized acquisition,"
"924","use or disposition of a company's"
"925","assets that could have a material"
"926","effect on"
"927","the financial statements."
"928","Because of its inherent"
"929","limitations, internal control over"
"930","financial reporting may not"
"931","prevent or detect"
"932","misstatements. Also, projections"
"933","of any evaluation of effectiveness"
"934","to future periods are subject to the"
"935"," risk"
"936","that controls may become inadequate"
"937","because of changes in conditions, or"
"938","that the degree of compliance"
"939","with the policies or procedures may"
"940","deteriorate."
"941","A deficiency in internal control over"
"942"," financial reporting exists when"
"943","the design or operation of a control"
"944","does not allow management or"
"945"," employees, in the normal course of"
"946","performing their assigned functions,"
"947","to"
"948","prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"949","timely basis.  A material weakness"
"950","is a deficiency, or a combination"
"951","of deficiencies, in internal control"
"952","over financial reporting, such that"
"953","there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"954","material misstatement of the company's"
"955","annual or interim financial statements"
"956","will not be prevented or"
"957","detected on a timely basis."
"958","Our consideration of the Fund's"
"959","internal control over financial"
"960","reporting was for the limited purpose"
"961","described in the first paragraph"
"962","and would not necessarily disclose"
"963","all deficiencies in internal control"
"964","that"
"965","might be material weaknesses under"
"966","standards established by the Public"
"967","Company Accounting Oversight"
"968","Board (United States).  However, we"
"969","noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"970"," internal control over financial"
"971","reporting and its operation,"
"972","including controls over"
"973","safeguarding securities, that"
"974"," we consider to be a"
"975","material weakness as defined"
"976","above as of November 30, 2009."
"977","This report is intended solely"
"978","for the information and use of"
"979","management and the Board of"
"980","Directors of"
"981","the Fund and the Securities and"
"982","Exchange Commission and is not"
"983","intended to be and should not be used"
