"526","and Board of"
"527","Trustees of"
"528","Federated U.S."
"529","Government Securities"
"530","Fund: 2-5 Years:"
"531","In planning and performing"
"532","our audit of the financial"
"533","statements of Federated U.S."
"534","Government Securities"
"535","Fund: 2-5 Years (the Fund)"
"536","as of and for the year"
"537","ended January"
"538","31, 2012, in accordance"
"539","with the standards of"
"540","the Public Company"
"541","Accounting Oversight"
"542","Board (United States),"
"543","we considered the Fund's"
"544","internal control over"
"545","financial reporting,"
"546","including controls"
"547","over safeguarding"
"548","securities, as a basis"
"549","for designing our auditing"
"550","procedures for the"
"551","purpose of expressing"
"552","our opinion on the"
"553","financial statements"
"554","and to"
"555","comply with"
"556","the requirements of"
"557","Form N-SAR, but not for"
"558","the purpose of expressing an"
"559","opinion on the"
"560","effectiveness of the"
"561","Fund's internal control"
"562","over financial reporting."
"563","Accordingly, we express"
"564","no such opinion."
"565","The management of the"
"566","Fund is responsible"
"567","for establishing and"
"568","maintaining effective"
"569","internal control over"
"570","financial reporting."
"571","In fulfilling this"
"572","responsibility, estimates"
"573","and judgments by"
"574","management are required"
"575","to assess the"
"576","expected benefits"
"577","and related costs"
"578","of controls. A company's"
"579","internal control over"
"580","financial reporting is"
"581","a process designed to"
"582","provide reasonable assurance"
"583","regarding the reliability"
"584","of financial reporting and the"
"585","preparation of financial"
"586","statements for external"
"587","purposes in"
"588","accordance with"
"589","generally accepted"
"590","accounting principles."
"591","A company's internal"
"592","control over financial"
"593","reporting includes"
"594","those policies and"
"595","procedures that (1)"
"596","pertain to the maintenance"
"597","of records that,"
"598","in reasonable detail,"
"599","accurately and fairly"
"600","reflect the transactions"
"601","and dispositions of the"
"602","assets of the company;"
"603","(2) provide reasonable"
"604","assurance that transactions"
"605","are recorded as"
"606","necessary to permit"
"607","preparation of"
"608","financial statements"
"609","in accordance with generally"
"610","accepted accounting"
"611","principles, and that"
"612","receipts and expenditures"
"613","of the company are"
"614","being made only in"
"615","accordance with"
"616","authorizations of"
"617","management and directors"
"618","of the company;"
"619","and (3) provide reasonable"
"620","assurance regarding"
"621","prevention or timely"
"622","detection of unauthorized"
"623","acquisition, use or"
"624","disposition of a"
"625","company's assets"
"626","that could have a"
"627","material effect"
"628","on the financial"
"629","statements. Because"
"630","of its inherent limitations,"
"631","internal control over"
"632","financial reporting may not"
"633","prevent or detect misstatements."
"634","Also, projections of any"
"635","evaluation of effectiveness to"
"636","future periods are subject"
"637","to the risk that controls"
"638","may become inadequate because of"
"639","changes in conditions,"
"640","or that the degree of"
"641","compliance with the"
"642","policies or procedures"
"643","may deteriorate."
"644","A deficiency in internal"
"645","control over financial"
"646","reporting exists when"
"647","the design or"
"648","operation of a control"
"649","does not allow management"
"650","or employees,"
"651","in the normal course of"
"652","performing their"
"653","assigned functions,"
"654","to prevent or detect"
"655","misstatements on a timely basis."
"656","A material weakness"
"657","is a deficiency,"
"658","or a combination of"
"659","deficiencies,"
"660","in internal control"
"661","over financial reporting,"
"662","such that there"
"663","is a reasonable"
"664","possibility that a material"
"665","misstatement of the company's"
"666","annual or interim"
"667","financial statements"
"668","will not be"
"669","prevented or"
"670","detected on a"
"671","timely basis."
"672","Our consideration"
"673","of the Fund's internal"
"674","control over financial"
"675","reporting was for the"
"676","limited purpose described"
"677","in the first paragraph"
"678","and would not necessarily"
"679","disclose all"
"680","deficiencies in"
"681","internal control that"
"682","might be material"
"683","weaknesses under standards"
"684","established by the"
"685","Public Company"
"686","Accounting Oversight"
"687","Board (United States)."
"688","However, we noted"
"689","no deficiencies"
"690","in the Fund's internal"
"691","control over"
"692","financial reporting"
"693","and its operation,"
"694","including controls"
"695","over safeguarding"
"696","securities, that"
"697","we consider to be a"
"698","material weakness"
"699","as defined above"
"700","as of January 31, 2012."
"701","This report is"
