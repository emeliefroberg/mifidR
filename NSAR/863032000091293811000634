"1258","             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1259","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1260","MFS Series Trust VI"
"1261","In  planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of MFS Global"
"1262","Equity  Fund,  MFS Global Total Return Fund, and MFS Utilities Fund (the Funds),"
"1263","three of the funds  comprising MFS Series Trust VI, as of and for the year ended"
"1264","October 31, 2011, in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company"
"1265","Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"1266","control  over  financial  reporting,   including   controls   over  safeguarding"
"1267","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for  the purpose of"
"1268","expressing  our  opinions  on  the  financial statements and to comply with  the"
"1269","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for  the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1270","the  effectiveness  of  the Funds' internal control  over  financial  reporting."
"1271","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1272","The management of the Funds  is  responsible  for  establishing  and maintaining"
"1273","effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  In  fulfilling   this"
"1274","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1275","expected  benefits  and  related costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"1276","over financial reporting is  a  process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1277","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"1278","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1279","accounting principles. A company's  internal  control  over  financial reporting"
"1280","includes  those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the  maintenance  of"
"1281","records  that,   in   reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the"
"1282","transactions  and dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide"
"1283","reasonable assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary to permit"
"1284","preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with generally  accepted"
"1285","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures  of  the  company  are"
"1286","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"1287","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1288","detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"1289","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1290","Because of its  inherent  limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1291","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1292","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1293","inadequate because of changes in conditions,  or  that  the degree of compliance"
"1294","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1295","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"1296","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,  in the normal"
"1297","course   of   performing   their   assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"1298","misstatements on a timely basis. A material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or  a"
"1299","combination  of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1300","that there is  a  reasonable  possibility  that  a  material misstatement of the"
"1301","company's  annual  or  interim financial statements will  not  be  prevented  or"
"1302","detected on a timely basis."
"1303","Our consideration of the  Funds'  internal  control over financial reporting was"
"1304","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in  the first  paragraph  and  would  not"
"1305","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1306","weaknesses  under  standards  established  by  the   Public  Company  Accounting"
"1307","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"1308","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,  including controls"
"1309","over  safeguarding  securities, which we consider to be a material  weakness  as"
"1310","defined above as of October 31, 2011."
"1311","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"1312","Board of Trustees of  MFS  Series  Trust  VI  and  the  Securities  and Exchange"
"1313","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"1314","these specified parties."
