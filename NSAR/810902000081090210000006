"1533","DISCLOSURE REGARDING THE APPROVAL OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENTS FOR"
"1534","BARON ASSET FUND, BARON GROWTH FUND, BARON SMALL CAP FUND, BARON OPPORTUNITY"
"1535","FUND AND BARON FIFTH AVENUE GROWTH FUND, BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES (UNAUDITED)"
"1536","- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
"1537","The Board of Trustees (the Board) of Baron Investment Funds Trust (Trust)"
"1538","met on May 18, 2010 to discuss the selection of BAMCO, Inc. (the Adviser) as"
"1539","the investment adviser and the approval of the investment advisory agreements"
"1540","for Baron Asset Fund, Baron Growth Fund, Baron Small Cap Fund, Baron"
"1541","Opportunity Fund and Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund (each a Fund and"
"1542","collectively, the Funds). The members of the Board who are not affiliated"
"1543","with the Trust (the Independent Trustees) met in a separate session to"
"1544","discuss and consider the renewal of the advisory contract for the Funds. An"
"1545","independent consultant provided reports to the Board and attended the Board"
"1546","meeting. The Trustees received a substantial amount of information from the"
"1547","Adviser and from the consultant, and were advised by independent counsel. Based"
"1548","on its evaluation of this and other information, the Board, including a"
"1549","majority of the Independent Trustees, approved the continuation of the advisory"
"1550","agreements for the Funds for an additional one year period."
"1551","In reaching its determination, the Board considered various factors that it"
"1552","deemed relevant, including the factors listed below."
"1553","1. NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES"
"1554","As part of their consideration of the nature, extent and quality of services"
"1555","provided by the Adviser, the Independent Trustees relied on the information"
"1556","they received at the Board meeting, as well as on the information they had"
"1557","considered in past years. In particular, the Board considered the following:"
"1558","   . Their confidence in the Adviser's senior personnel, portfolio management,"
"1559","     the financial condition of the Adviser and its affiliates and the"
"1560","     Adviser's available resources;"
"1561","   . The nature, quality and the level of long-term performance of the services"
"1562","     provided by the Adviser, including: intensive devotion to research,"
"1563","     selection of broker/dealers for Fund portfolio transactions, relationships"
"1564","     with and supervision of third party service providers, such as the Funds'"
"1565","     custodian and transfer agent, the quality of shareholder reports, the"
"1566","     ability to monitor adherence to investment guidelines and restrictions,"
"1567","     the legal, accounting and compliance services provided to the Funds and"
"1568","     the support services provided to the Board;"
"1569","   . The Adviser's investment principles and processes and the historical"
"1570","     performance of the Funds as compared to similar funds managed by other"
"1571","     advisers and other funds managed by the Adviser over comparable periods;"
"1572","   . The total expense ratio of the Funds and comparisons to similar funds"
"1573","     managed by other advisers over comparable periods;"
"1574","   . The costs of portfolio management, including the types of investments made"
"1575","     for the Funds, the personnel and systems necessary for the implementation"
"1576","     of investment strategies and the pre-tax profits realized by the Adviser"
"1577","     and its affiliates from their relationship with the Funds; and"
"1578","   . Any additional services provided by the Adviser."
"1579","The Board concluded that the nature, extent and quality of the services"
"1580","provided by the Adviser to each Fund were appropriate and that each Fund was"
"1581","likely to continue to benefit from those services provided under the relevant"
"1582","advisory agreement with the Adviser."
"1583","2. INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF THE FUNDS AND THE ADVISER"
"1584","As part of its consideration of the investment performance of the Funds and the"
"1585","Adviser, the Board took into account the analyses performed by and discussed"
"1586","with the independent consultant. The Board considered for each Fund, among"
"1587","other information, the independent consultant's comparisons of the expense"
"1588","ratio and contractual advisory fee with those of expense group funds. The Board"
"1589","also considered the independent consultant's risk-adjusted performance"
"1590","comparisons with comparable funds and comparisons of each Fund's annualized"
"1591","total return over one-, three-, five- and ten-year periods, where applicable,"
"1592","against expense group and performance universe averages. After considering all"
"1593","the information, the Board concluded that the Adviser continued to invest in"
"1594","accordance with its long-standing principles and that each Fund's more relative"
"1595","performance was consistent with expectations for the Adviser's investment style"
"1596","under recent market conditions. The Board noted the Funds' favorable absolute"
"1597","performance in the most recent one-year period and the risk-adjusted"
"1598","performance comparisons. The Board also concluded that the Funds and their"
"1599","shareholders had benefited over the long-term from the Adviser's investment"
"1600","management of the Funds."
"1601","3. COSTS OF SERVICES PROVIDED AND PROFITS TO BE REALIZED BY THE ADVISER"
"1602","The Board was provided with information from the Adviser and the independent"
"1603","consultant regarding the fees charged by the Adviser as compared to the fees"
"1604","charged by comparable funds. This information compared various fees and"
"1605","expenses, as well as the total expense ratios, of the Funds against the same"
"1606","fees, expenses and total expense ratios of other funds of similar size,"
"1607","character and investment strategies. The total expense ratios of the Funds were"
"1608","generally competitive with the total expense ratios of the funds against which"
"1609","it was compared."
"1610","The Board considered comparisons of the advisory fees charged and services"
"1611","provided by the Adviser and its investment adviser affiliate to the Funds,"
"1612","sub-advised accounts and separately managed accounts. The Board considered"
"1613","that, while the advisory fees for the other clients are the same as, or lower"
"1614","than, the fees for the Funds, the Adviser or its affiliate performs"
"1615","significantly fewer services for those clients compared with those provided by"
"1616","the Adviser to the Funds."
"1617","The Board also considered the costs of portfolio management, including the"
"1618","types of investments made for the Funds, the personnel and systems necessary to"
"1619","implement investment strategies and the pre-tax profits realized by the Adviser"
"1620","and its affiliates from their relationship with each Fund. The Board also"
"1621","considered benefits that accrue to the Adviser and its affiliates from their"
"1622","relationship with the Funds."
"1623","4. ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND BENEFITS TO INVESTORS"
"1624","The Board considered the extent to which the Funds' management fee reflected"
"1625","economies of scale for the benefit of Fund shareholders. The Board considered"
"1626","that, except for Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund, the Funds do not have"
"1627","breakpoint fees. The Board considered that the small- and mid-cap investment"
"1628","strategy required more attention by the Adviser than a strategy that involved"
"1629","other types of investing, particularly as the asset size increases. The Board"
"1630","considered that the Adviser was continuing to grow and upgrade its staff and"
"1631","invest in its business even during this recent period of declining assets and"
"1632","reduced revenues. The Board concluded that the management fee for each Fund"
"1633","was reasonable in light of the services provided as discussed at the meeting,"
"1634","including the Adviser's investments in resources to support the Funds. The"
"1635","Board will continue to scrutinize the extent of economies of scale, asset"
"1636","growth and the Adviser's plans to reinvest further to support the Funds."
"1637","After due consideration of the above enumerated factors and other factors, the"
"1638","Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, concluded that"
"1639","approval of each Fund's investment advisory agreement was in the best interests"
"1640","of the respective Fund and its shareholders."

"1648","EX-99 77B Accountants Letter"
"1649","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1650","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1651","Baron Investment Funds Trust"
"1652","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1653","statements of Baron Asset Fund, Baron Growth Fund, Baron"
"1654","Small Cap Fund, Baron Opportunity Fund (formerly Baron"
"1655","iOpportunity Fund) and Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund"
"1656","(5 of the portfolios constituting the Baron Investment"
"1657","Funds Trust, hereafter referred to as the Funds) as of"
"1658","and for the year ended September 30, 2010, in accordance with"
"1659","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1660","Board (United States), we considered the Funds internal"
"1661","Control over financial reporting, including control"
"1662","activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1663","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1664","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"1665","to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"1666","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1667","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"1668","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express"
"1669","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"1670","control over financial reporting."
"1671","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"1672","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1673","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1674","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"1675","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal"
"1676","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1677","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1678","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1679","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1680","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal"
"1681","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1682","procedures that"
"1683","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1684","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1685","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"1686","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1687","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1688","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures"
"1689","of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"1690","of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1691","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1692","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"1693","a material effect on the financial statements."
"1694","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1695","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"1696","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"1697","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1698","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1699","procedures may deteriorate."
"1700","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1701","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"1702","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1703","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"1704","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1705","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1706","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1707","misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial statements"
"1708","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1709","Our consideration of the Funds's internal control over financial"
"1710","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1711","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"1712","in internal control over financial reporting that might be"
"1713","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"1714","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"1715","we noted no deficiencies in the Company's internal control"
"1716","over financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"1717","over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material"
"1718","weaknesses as defined above as of September 30, 2010."
"1719","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1720","management and the Board of Trustees of Baron Investment Funds"
"1721","Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"1722","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"1723","these specified parties."
