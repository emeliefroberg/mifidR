"1287","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1288","To the Shareholders and"
"1289","Board of Trustees of"
"1290","Federated Equity Funds"
"1291","In planning and performing our"
"1292"," audits of the financial statements"
"1293","of Federated Clover Small"
"1294","Value Fund, Federated Clover Value Fund,"
"1295"," and Federated Prudent Bear Fund, each"
"1296","a portfolio of"
"1297","Federated Equity Funds (collectively,"
"1298","the Funds) as of and for the year ended"
"1299","September 30,"
"1300","2010, in accordance with the standards"
"1301","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1302","(United States), we considered the Funds'"
"1303"," internal control over financial reporting,"
"1304"," including"
"1305","controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"1306","a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"1307"," for the"
"1308","purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1309","financial statements and to comply with the"
"1310","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"1311","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1312","effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"1313","control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"1314"," we express no"
"1315","such opinion."
"1316","Management of the Funds is responsible for"
"1317"," establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1318","control over financial reporting. In"
"1319","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"1320"," and judgments by"
"1321","management are required to assess the"
"1322","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"1323","company's internal control over financial"
"1324"," reporting is a process designed to provide"
"1325","reasonable"
"1326","assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1327","financial reporting and the preparation"
"1328"," of financial"
"1329","statements for external purposes in"
"1330","accordance with generally accepted"
"1331","accounting principles. A"
"1332","company's internal control over financial"
"1333"," reporting includes those policies and"
"1334","procedures that (1)"
"1335","pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"1336"," in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1337","reflect the"
"1338","transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"1339","of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1340","assurance that"
"1341","transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1342","permit preparation of financial statements"
"1343"," in accordance"
"1344","with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"1345"," and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"1346","are being made in accordance with authorizations"
"1347","of management and directors of the company;"
"1348","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1349"," prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized"
"1350","acquisition, use, or disposition of the"
"1351","company's assets that could have a material"
"1352","affect on the"
"1353","financial statements."
"1354","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1355","control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"1356","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"1357"," evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1358","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1359"," inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"1360"," or that"
"1361","the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1362","procedures may deteriorate."
"1363","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1364"," reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1365","control does not allow management or employees,"
"1366","in the normal course of performing their"
"1367","assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1368","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"1369","weakness is a"
"1370","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"1371","in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1372","such that"
"1373","there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1374","misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim"
"1375","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1376"," detected on a timely basis."
"1377","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control"
"1378"," over financial reporting was for the limited"
"1379","purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"1380"," not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1381","internal control that might be material weaknesses"
"1382"," under standards established by the Public"
"1383","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1384"," However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"1385","Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"1386","and its operation, including controls over"
"1387","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"1388"," material weakness as defined above as of"
"1389","September 30, 2010."

"1406","LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"1407","Since October 2003, Federated and"
"1408","related entities (collectively, Federated)"
"1409"," and various Federated-sponsored"
"1410","mutual funds (Funds) have been named as"
"1411"," defendants in several class action"
"1412"," lawsuits now pending in the United"
"1413","States District Court for the District"
"1414","of Maryland. The lawsuits were"
"1415","purportedly filed on behalf of people who"
"1416","purchased, owned and/or redeemed shares"
"1417","of certain Funds during specified periods"
"1418"," beginning November 1, 1998."
"1419","The suits are generally similar in"
"1420","alleging that Federated engaged in"
"1421","illegal and improper trading practices including"
"1422","market timing and late trading in"
"1423"," concert with certain institutional"
"1424"," traders, which allegedly caused"
"1425"," financial injury to"
"1426","the mutual fund shareholders. Federated"
"1427","without admitting the validity of any"
"1428","claim has reached a preliminary"
"1429","settlement with the Plaintiffs in"
"1430","these cases. Any settlement would have"
"1431","to be approved by the Court."
"1432","     Federated entities have also been"
"1433","named as defendants in several additional"
"1434"," lawsuits that are now pending in"
"1435","the United States District Court for the"
"1436"," Western District of Pennsylvania. These"
"1437"," lawsuits have been consolidated into"
"1438","a single action alleging excessive"
"1439","advisory fees involving one of the Funds."
"1440","     The Board of the Funds retained the"
"1441","law firm of Dickstein Shapiro LLP to"
"1442","represent the Funds in each of the"
"1443","lawsuits described in the preceding two"
"1444","paragraphs. Federated and the Funds, and"
"1445"," their respective counsel, have"
"1446","been defending this litigation, and none"
"1447"," of the Funds remains a defendant in any"
"1448","of the lawsuits. Additional lawsuits"
"1449","based upon similar allegations may be filed"
"1450","in the future. The potential impact of these"
"1451"," lawsuits, all of which seek"
"1452","monetary damages, attorneys' fees and expenses,"
"1453"," and future potential similar suits is uncertain."
"1454"," Although we do not"
"1455","believe that these lawsuits will have a material"
"1456"," adverse effect on the Funds, there can be"
"1457"," no assurance that these"
"1458","suits, ongoing adverse publicity and/or other"
"1459"," developments resulting from the allegations"
"1460","in these matters will not"
"1461","result in increased redemptions, or reduced"
"1462"," sales of shares of the Funds or other adverse"
"1463","consequences for the Funds."
