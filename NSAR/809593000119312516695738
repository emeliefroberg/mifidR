"518","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"519","The Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"520","American Beacon Bridgeway Large Cap Growth Fund:"
"521","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Bridgeway"
"522","Large Cap Growth Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2016,"
"523","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"524","Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"525","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"526","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"527","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"528","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"529","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"530","opinion."
"531","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"532","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"533","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"534","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"535","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"536","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"537","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"538","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"539","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"540","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"541","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"542","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"543","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"544","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"545","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"546","directors of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"547","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"548","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"549","statements."
"550","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"551","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"552","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"553","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"554","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"555","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"556","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"557","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"558","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"559","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"560","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"561","fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"562","on a timely basis."
"563","<PAGE>"
"564","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"565","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"566","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"567","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"568","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"569","in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"570","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"571","material weakness as defined above as of June 30, 2016."
"572","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"573","the Board of Trustees of the Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"574","and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"575","specified parties."

"590","The Fund engaged Ernst & Young, LLP (E&Y) as the independent registered"
"591","public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016. E&Y replaces"
"592","BBD, LLP (BBD), the Fund's previous independent registered public accounting"
"593","firm, who was dismissed upon completion of the tax-free reorganization. The"
"594","change in accountants was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of"
"595","Trustees on August 6, 2015. During the periods that BBD served as the Fund's"
"596","independent registered public accounting firm and through February 5, 2016,"
"597","BBD's audit reports contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion; nor"
"598","were its reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or"
"599","accounting principle. There were no disagreements between the Fund and BBD on"
"600","any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement"

"633","DATE AND TERMS THEREOF, ANY ACTION TAKEN BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR"
"634","SHAREHOLDERS APPROVING OR RATIFYING THE MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION. At the August"
"635","5-6, 2015 Board meeting for the American Beacon Funds (Trust), the Board of"
"636","Trustees (Board or Trustees), including a majority of the Independent"
"637","Trustees, determined that the adoption by the Trust, on behalf of the American"
"638","Beacon Bridgeway Large Cap Growth Fund (the New Fund), of the Agreement and"
"639","Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) with the Bridgeway Large-Cap Growth Fund"
"640","(the Old Fund), was in the best interests of the New Fund and the"
"641","shareholders of the New Fund. The Plans were approved by a majority of the"
"642","shareholders of the Old Fund on December 2, 2015. Pursuant to the Plan, the Old"
"643","Fund reorganized into the New Fund and management oversight responsibility for"
"644","the New Fund shifted from Bridgeway Capital Management, Inc. (Bridgeway) to"
"645","American Beacon Advisors, Inc. Following shareholder approval of the Plan, the"
