"574","<TEXT>"
"575","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"576","To the Board of Trustees of the Mutual Fund Series Trust and"
"577","the Shareholders of the SMH Representation Trust"
"578","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of the SMH"
"579","Representation Trust (the Fund), a series of shares of beneficial interest"
"580","of the Mutual Fund Series Trust , as of and for the year ended June 30, 2012,"
"581","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"582","Board (United States), we considered its internal control over financial"
"583","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"584","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"585","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"586","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"587","Funds internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express"
"588","no such opinion."
"589","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"590","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"591","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"592","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A companys internal"
"593","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"594","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"595","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting"
"596","principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('GAAP').  A"
"597","companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"598","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"599","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"600","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"601","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the"
"602","financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"603","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"604","authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide"
"605","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"606","acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a"
"607","material effect on the financial statements."
"608","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"609","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"610","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"611","become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of"
"612","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  A deficiency in"
"613","internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation"
"614","of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"615","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"616","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"617","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there"
"618","is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds annual"
"619","or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"620","basis."
"621","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial reporting was"
"622","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"623","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"624","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"625","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies"
"626","in the internal control over financial reporting and its operations, including"
"627","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be material"
"628","weaknesses, as defined above, as of June 30, 2012."
"629","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management, the"
"630","shareholders of the SMH Representation Trust and the Board of Trustees of the"
"631","Mutual Fund Series Trust, and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"632","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"633","parties."
