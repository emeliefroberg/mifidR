"25064","irrevocably belong to that class for all purposes, subject only to the rights of"
"25065","creditors, and shall be so recorded upon the books and accounts of the"
"25066","Corporation.  Such consideration, assets, income, earnings, profits and proceeds"

"25068","of such assets, and any funds or payments derived from any reinvestment of such"
"25069","proceeds, in whatever form the same may be, together with any General Items"

"25072","any assets, income, earnings, profits, proceeds thereof, funds or payments which"
"25073","are not readily identifiable as belonging to any particular class (collectively"
"25074","General Items), such General Items shall be allocated by or under the"
"25075","supervision of the Board of Directors to and among any one or more of the"
"25076","classes established and designated from time to time in such manner and on such"
"25077","basis as the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, deems fair and"

"25101","standing resolution or resolutions adopted only once or with such frequency as"

"25105","available assets determined by the Board of Directors as belonging to such"

"25109","appropriate.  The Board of Directors shall have the power, in its sole"
"25110","discretion, to distribute in any fiscal year as dividends, including dividends"
"25111","designated in whole or in part as capital gains distributions, amounts"
"25112","sufficient, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, to enable the Corporation,"
"25113","or where applicable each series of shares or class of a series, to qualify as a"
"25114","regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"
"25115","amended, or any successor or comparable statute thereto, and regulations"
"25116","promulgated thereunder, and to avoid liability for the Corporation, or each"

"25122","liquidated shall be entitled to receive, as a series or class, when and as"
"25123","declared by the Board of Directors, the excess of the assets belonging to that"
"25124","series or class over the liabilities belonging to that series or class.  The"
"25125","holders of shares of any series or class shall not be entitled thereby to any"
"25126","distribution upon liquidation of any other series or class.  The assets so"
"25127","distributable to the shareholder of any particular series or class shall be"
"25128","distributed among such shareholders according to their respective rights taking"
"25129","into account the proper allocation of expenses being borne by that series or"
"25130","class.  The liquidation of assets attributable to any particular series or class"

"25132","the class may be authorized by vote of a majority of the Board of Directors then"

"25137","of various series or classes in such proportion as the Board of Directors"
"25138","determines to be fair and equitable, and such determination by the Board of"
"25139","Directors shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes."

"25141","redemption rights provided for in Article V, Section 5."
"25142","	(d)	The Corporation's shares of stock are issued and sold, and all"

"25146","	Section 2.  Quorum Requirements and Voting Rights:  Except as otherwise"
"25147","expressly provided by the Maryland General Corporation Law, the presence in"

"25150","quorum at any meeting of the stockholders, except that where the holders of any"
"25151","series or class are required or permitted to vote as a series or class, one-"
"25152","third of the aggregate number of shares of that series or class outstanding and"

"25154","	Notwithstanding any provision of Maryland General Corporation Law"
"25155","requiring a greater proportion than a majority of the votes of all series or"

"25159","entitled to be cast thereon subject to the applicable laws and regulations as"
"25160","from time to time in effect or rules or orders of the Securities and Exchange"
"25161","Commission or any successor thereto.  All shares of stock of this Corporation"
"25162","shall have the voting rights provided for in Article V, Section 1, paragraph"
"25163","(b)."
"25164","	Section 3.  No Preemptive Rights:  No holder of shares of capital stock of"

"25167","issue or sell (whether consisting of shares of capital stock authorized by these"

"25170","which the Board of Directors of the Corporation, in its discretion, may"
"25171","determine."
"25172","	Section 4.  Determination of Net Asset Value: The net asset value of each"
"25173","share of each series or class of each series of the Corporation shall be the"
"25174","quotient obtained by dividing the value of the net assets of the Corporation, or"
"25175","if applicable of the series or class (being the value of the assets of the"
"25176","Corporation or of the particular series or class or attributable to the"
"25177","particular series or class less its actual and accrued liabilities exclusive of"

"25183","net asset value consistent with the requirements of applicable statutes and"
"25184","regulations and, so far as accounting matters are concerned, with generally"
"25185","accepted accounting principles.  The procedures may include, without limitation,"
"25186","procedures for valuation of the Corporation's portfolio securities and other"
"25187","assets, for accrual of expenses or creation of reserves and for the"
"25188","determination of the number of shares issued and outstanding at any given time."
"25189","	Section 5.  Redemption and Repurchase of Shares of Capital Stock:  Any"
"25190","shareholder may redeem shares of the Corporation for the net asset value of each"
"25191","series or class thereof by presentation of an appropriate request, together with"
"25192","the certificates, if any, for such shares, duly endorsed, at the office or"

"25195","conditions contained in the bylaws or approved by the Board of Directors."
"25196","	Section 6.  Purchase of Shares:  The Corporation shall be entitled to"

"25199","Corporation Law, upon such terms and conditions and for such consideration as"

"26113","earnings, profits and proceeds thereof, including any proceeds derived from the"

"26116","irrevocably belong to that class for all purposes, subject only to the rights of"
"26117","creditors, and shall be so recorded upon the books and accounts of the"
"26118","Corporation.  Such consideration, assets, income, earnings, profits and proceeds"
"26119","thereof, including any proceeds derived from the sale, exchange or liquidation"
"26120","of such assets, and any funds or payments derived from any reinvestment of such"
"26121","proceeds, in whatever form the same may be, together with any General Items"
"26122","allocated to that class as provided in the following sentence, are herein"
"26123","referred to as assets belonging to that class.  In the event that there are"
"26124","any assets, income, earnings, profits, proceeds thereof, funds or payments which"
"26125","are not readily identifiable as belonging to any particular class (collectively"
"26126","General Items), such General Items shall be allocated by or under the"
"26127","supervision of the Board of Directors to and among any one or more of the"
"26128","classes established and designated from time to time in such manner and on such"
"26129","basis as the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, deems fair and"
"26130","equitable, and any General Items so allocated to a particular class shall belong"
"26131","to that class.  Each such allocation by the Board of Directors shall be"
"26132","conclusive and binding for all purposes."
"26133","	(2)	Liabilities Belonging to a Class.  The assets belonging to each"

"26135","respect of that class and all expenses, costs, charges and reserves attributable"
"26136","to that class, and any general liabilities, expenses, costs, charges or reserves"
"26137","of the Corporation which are not readily identifiable as belonging to any"
"26138","particular class shall be allocated and charged by or under the supervision of"

"26144","related to the shares of a series may be borne solely by that series (as"
"26145","determined by the Board of Directors).  Each allocation of liabilities,"
"26146","expenses, costs, charges and reserves by the Board of Directors shall be"
"26147","conclusive and binding for all purposes."
"26148","	(3)	Dividends.  The Board of Directors may from time to time declare and"
"26149","pay dividends or distributions, in stock, property or cash, on any or all series"
"26150","of stock or classes of series, the amount of such dividends and property"
"26151","distributions and the payment of them being wholly in the discretion of the"
"26152","Board of Directors.  Dividends may be declared daily or otherwise pursuant to a"
"26153","standing resolution or resolutions adopted only once or with such frequency as"
"26154","the Board of Directors may determine, after providing for actual and accrued"
"26155","liabilities belonging to that class.  All dividends or distributions on shares"
"26156","of a particular class shall be paid only out of surplus or other lawfully"
"26157","available assets determined by the Board of Directors as belonging to such"
"26158","class.  Dividends and distributions may vary between the classes of a series to"
"26159","reflect differing allocations of the expense of each class of that series to"
"26160","such extent and for such purposes as the Boards of Directors may deem"
"26161","appropriate.  The Board of Directors shall have the power, in its sole"
"26162","discretion, to distribute in any fiscal year as dividends, including dividends"
"26163","designated in whole or in part as capital gains distributions, amounts"
"26164","sufficient, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, to enable the Corporation,"
"26165","or where applicable each series of shares or class of a series, to qualify as a"
"26166","regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"
"26167","amended, or any successor or comparable statute thereto, and regulations"
"26168","promulgated thereunder, and to avoid liability for the Corporation, or each"
"26169","series of shares or class of a series, for Federal income and excise taxes in"
"26170","respect of that or any other year."
"26171","	(4)	Liquidation.  In the event of the liquidation of the Corporation or"
"26172","of the assets attributable to a particular series or class, the shareholders of"
"26173","each series or class that has been established and designated and is being"
"26174","liquidated shall be entitled to receive, as a series or class, when and as"
"26175","declared by the Board of Directors, the excess of the assets belonging to that"
"26176","series or class over the liabilities belonging to that series or class.  The"
"26177","holders of shares of any series or class shall not be entitled thereby to any"
"26178","distribution upon liquidation of any other series or class.  The assets so"
"26179","distributable to the shareholder of any particular series or class shall be"
"26180","distributed among such shareholders according to their respective rights taking"
"26181","into account the proper allocation of expenses being borne by that series or"
"26182","class.  The liquidation of assets attributable to any particular series or class"
"26183","in which there are shares then outstanding and the termination of the series or"
"26184","the class may be authorized by vote of a majority of the Board of Directors then"
"26185","in office, without action or approval of the shareholders, to the extent"
"26186","consistent with applicable laws and regulation.  In the event that there are any"
"26187","general assets not belonging to any particular series or class of stock and"
"26188","available for distribution, such distribution shall be made to holders of stock"
"26189","of various series or classes in such proportion as the Board of Directors"
"26190","determines to be fair and equitable, and such determination by the Board of"
"26191","Directors shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes."
"26192","	(5)	Redemption.  All shares of stock of the Corporation shall have the"
"26193","redemption rights provided for in Article V, Section 5."
"26194","	(d)	The Corporation's shares of stock are issued and sold, and all"
"26195","persons who shall acquire stock of the Corporation shall do so, subject to the"
"26196","condition and understanding that the provisions of the Corporation's Articles of"
"26197","Incorporation, as from time to time amended, shall be binding upon them."
"26198","	Section 2.  Quorum Requirements and Voting Rights:  Except as otherwise"
"26199","expressly provided by the Maryland General Corporation Law, the presence in"
"26200","person or by proxy of the holders of one-third of the shares of capital stock of"
"26201","the Corporation outstanding and entitled to vote thereat shall constitute a"
"26202","quorum at any meeting of the stockholders, except that where the holders of any"
"26203","series or class are required or permitted to vote as a series or class, one-"
"26204","third of the aggregate number of shares of that series or class outstanding and"
"26205","entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum."
"26206","	Notwithstanding any provision of Maryland General Corporation Law"
"26207","requiring a greater proportion than a majority of the votes of all series or"
"26208","classes or of any series or class of the Corporation's stock entitled to be cast"
"26209","in order to take or authorize any action, any such action may be taken or"
"26210","authorized upon the concurrence of a majority of the aggregate number of votes"
"26211","entitled to be cast thereon subject to the applicable laws and regulations as"
"26212","from time to time in effect or rules or orders of the Securities and Exchange"
"26213","Commission or any successor thereto.  All shares of stock of this Corporation"
"26214","shall have the voting rights provided for in Article V, Section 1, paragraph"
"26215","(b)."
"26216","	Section 3.  No Preemptive Rights:  No holder of shares of capital stock of"
"26217","the Corporation shall, as such holder, have any right to purchase or subscribe"
"26218","for any shares of the capital stock of the Corporation which the Corporation may"
"26219","issue or sell (whether consisting of shares of capital stock authorized by these"
"26220","Articles of Incorporation, or shares of capital stock of the Corporation"
"26221","acquired by it after the issue thereof, or other shares) other than any right"
"26222","which the Board of Directors of the Corporation, in its discretion, may"
"26223","determine."
"26224","	Section 4.  Determination of Net Asset Value: The net asset value of each"
"26225","share of each series or class of each series of the Corporation shall be the"
"26226","quotient obtained by dividing the value of the net assets of the Corporation, or"
"26227","if applicable of the series or class (being the value of the assets of the"
"26228","Corporation or of the particular series or class or attributable to the"
"26229","particular series or class less its actual and accrued liabilities exclusive of"

"27213","liabilities, expenses, costs, charges and reserves allocated and so charged to a"
"27214","class are herein referred to as liabilities belonging to that class. Expenses"
"27215","related to the shares of a series may be borne solely by that series (as"
"27216","determined by the Board of Directors).  Each allocation of liabilities,"
"27217","expenses, costs, charges and reserves by the Board of Directors shall be"
"27218","conclusive and binding for all purposes."
"27219","	(3)	Dividends.  The Board of Directors may from time to time declare and"
"27220","pay dividends or distributions, in stock, property or cash, on any or all series"
"27221","of stock or classes of series, the amount of such dividends and property"

"27224","standing resolution or resolutions adopted only once or with such frequency as"
"27225","the Board of Directors may determine, after providing for actual and accrued"
"27226","liabilities belonging to that class.  All dividends or distributions on shares"

"27228","available assets determined by the Board of Directors as belonging to such"
"27229","class.  Dividends and distributions may vary between the classes of a series to"
"27230","reflect differing allocations of the expense of each class of that series to"
"27231","such extent and for such purposes as the Boards of Directors may deem"
"27232","appropriate.  The Board of Directors shall have the power, in its sole"
"27233","discretion, to distribute in any fiscal year as dividends, including dividends"
"27234","designated in whole or in part as capital gains distributions, amounts"
"27235","sufficient, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, to enable the Corporation,"

"27248","holders of shares of any series or class shall not be entitled thereby to any"
"27249","distribution upon liquidation of any other series or class.  The assets so"
"27250","distributable to the shareholder of any particular series or class shall be"
"27251","distributed among such shareholders according to their respective rights taking"
"27252","into account the proper allocation of expenses being borne by that series or"

"27255","the class may be authorized by vote of a majority of the Board of Directors then"

"28601","Report of independent registered public accounting firm"
"28602","The Shareholders and Board of Directors"
"28603","Principal Funds, Inc."
"28604","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Principal"
"28605","Funds, Inc. (the Company) as of and for the year ended October 31, 2008, in"
"28606","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"28607","(United States), we considered the Company's internal controls over financial"
"28608","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"28609","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"28610","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"28611","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"28612","Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"28613","such opinion."
"28614","The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"28615","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"28616","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"28617","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"28618","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"28619","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"28620","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"28621","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"28622","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"28623","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"28624","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"28625","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"28626","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"28627","accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"28628","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"28629","the company and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"28630","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"28631","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"28632","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"28633","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"28634","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"28635","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"28636","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"28637","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"28638","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"28639","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"28640","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"28641","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"28642","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"28643","company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"28644","detected on a timely basis."
"28645","Our consideration of the Company's internal control over financial reporting was"
"28646","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"28647","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"28648","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"28649","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"28650","Company's internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"28651","controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness"
"28652","as defined above as of October 31, 2008."
"28653","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"28654","Board of Directors of Principal Funds, Inc. and the Securities and Exchange"

"29449","	conduct of the investment business of the Series."

"29451","detail as the"
"29452","	Board of Directors may reasonably deem appropriate in order to enable it"
"29453","to determine"
"29454","	that the investment policies, procedures and approved investment program"
"29455","of the"
"29456","	Series are being observed."
"29457","(f)	Upon request, provide assistance and recommendations for the determination"
"29458","of the"
"29459","	fair value of certain securities when reliable market quotations are not"
"29460","readily available"
"29461","	for purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance with procedures"
"29462","and methods established by the Fund's Board of Directors."
"29463","(g) Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and management"
"29464","facilities,"
"29465","	including salaries of clerical and other personnel required for it to"
"29466","execute its duties"
"29467","faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical"
"29468","personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of the investment"
"29469","advisory affairs of the"
"29470","Series."
"29471","(h) Open accounts with broker-dealers and future commission merchants (broker-
	dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all transactions for the"
"29472","Series, place all"
"29473","	necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated"
"29474","broker-dealers),"
"29475","	and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the extent consistent with"
"29476","applicable law,"
"29477","	purchase or sell orders for the Series may be aggregated with"
"29478","contemporaneous"
"29479","	purchase or sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event"
"29480","allocation of"
"29481","	securities so sold or purchased, as well as the expenses incurred in the"
"29482","transaction, will"
"29483","be made by the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the"
"29484","most"
"29485","equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other"
"29486","clients."
"29487","	The Sub-Advisor will report on such allocations at the request of the"
"29488","Manager, the Fund"
"29489","	or the Fund's Board of Directors providing such information as the number"
"29490","of"
"29491","	aggregated trades to which the Series was a party, the broker-dealers to"
"29492","whom such"
"29493","	trades were directed and the basis for the allocation for the aggregated"
"29494","trades.  The"
"29495","	Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain execution of transactions"
"29496","for the Series"
"29497","at prices which are advantageous to the Series and at commission rates that are"
"29498","     reasonable in relation to the benefits received. However, the Sub-Advisor"
"29499","may select"
"29500","     brokers or dealers on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or"
"29501","other services"
"29502","     or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable"
"29503","law, the Sub-"
"29504","Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a"
"29505","securities transaction in excess of the amount of commission or dealer spread"
"29506","another broker or"
"29507","dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor"
"29508","determines"
"29509","in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the"
"29510","value of"
"29511","the brokerage and research products and/or services provided by such broker or"
"29512","dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and research products"
"29513","and/or"
"29514","services, may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the"
"29515","overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with"
"29516","respect to the Series"
"29517","as well as to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Not all"
"29518","such"
"29519","services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the Series.  In"
"29520","addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized by the Series"
"29521","except to"
"29522","the extent permitted under any exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor"
"29523","provided"
"29524","that all conditions of such order are complied with."
"29525","(i)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the Series as are"
"29526","required of"
"29527","	an investment advisor of a registered investment company pursuant to the"
"29528","1940 Act"
"29529","	and Investment Advisor's Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisor's Act), and"
"29530","the rules"
"29531","	thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with such periodic and"
"29532","special"
"29533","	reports as the Fund or Manager may reasonably request.  In compliance with"
"29534","the"
"29535","	requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby"
"29536","agrees that all"
"29537","	records that it maintains for the Series are the property of the Fund,"
"29538","agrees to preserve"
"29539","	for the periods described by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records"
"29540","that it"
"29541","	maintains for the Account and that are required to be maintained by Rule"
"29542","31a-1 under"
"29543","	the 1940 Act, and further agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any"
"29544","records that it"
"29545","	maintains for the Series upon request by the Fund or the Manager.  The"
"29546","Sub-Advisor"
"29547","	has no responsibility for the maintenance of Fund records except insofar"
"29548","as is directly"
"29549","	related to the services provided to the Series."

"29859","AGREEMENT executed as of the September 30, 2008, by and between PRINCIPAL"
"29860","MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, an Iowa corporation (hereinafter called the Manager),"
"29861","and AXA ROSENBERG INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability"
"29862","Company (hereinafter called the Sub-Advisor).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to each Fund of the
Principal  Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end management investment company
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940"
"29863","Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it with
portfolio selection and related research and statistical services in connection
with the investment advisory services for each series identified in Appendix A (
hereinafter called the Series), which the Manager has agreed to provide to the
Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to furnish such services; and

WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies properly
certified or authenticated of each of the following and will promptly provide
the Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or authenticated of any amendment
or supplement thereto:

 	(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement) with the Fund;

 	(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

 	(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the Board of
Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and services provided by the Sub-
Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the Manager hereby
appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the services described in Section 2 below
for investment and reinvestment of the securities and other assets of the
Series, subject to the control and direction of the Manager and the Fund's Board
of Directors, for the period and on the terms hereinafter set forth. The Sub-
Advisor accepts such appointment and agrees to furnish the services hereinafter
set forth for the compensation herein provided. The Sub-Advisor shall for all
purposes herein be deemed to be an independent contractor and shall, except as
expressly provided or authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the
Fund or the Manager in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or
the Manager.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Manager authorizes the Sub-Advisor
to enter into trades as agent on behalf of the Fund.

The services of the Sub-Advisor to the Fund and the Manager are not to be deemed
exclusive, and the Sub-Advisor will be free to render similar services to others
so long as its services to the Fund and the Manager are not impaired thereby.

The Manager may, from time to time, make additions to, and withdrawals from the
Series assigned to the Sub-Advisor upon providing reasonable prior notice.  The
Manager agrees that any additions to the Series would not result in the Sub-
Advisor being the manager of 100% of the Series' assets; in the event the Sub-
Advisor is required to serve as the sole manager for the Series, the Manager
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

		The Sub-Advisor will:

(a) Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited to research,
advice and supervision for the Series.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval (or any
appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from time to time as economic
conditions require, a recommended investment program for the Fund consistent
with the Series' investment objective and policies.

(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing orders for the
purchase and sale of securities without prior consultation with the Manager and
without regard to the length of time the securities have been held, the
resulting rate of portfolio turnover or any tax considerations, subject always
to the provisions of the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, the
requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same shall be from time to time in
effect.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the officers,
in taking such steps as are reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the
decisions of its Board of Directors, and any appropriate committees of such
Board, regarding the general conduct of the investment business of the Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment advisory
services provided to the Series, its compliance with the 1940 Act and the
regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder and the
Series' investment strategies and restrictions as stated in the Fund's
prospectus and statement of additional information, subject to receipt of such
additional information as may be required from the Manager and provided in
accordance with Section 11(d) of this Agreement. The Sub-Advisor has no
responsibility for the maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is directly
related to the services it provides to the Series.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and in such
detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem appropriate in order to
enable it to determine that the investment policies, procedures and approved
investment program of the Series are being observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide reasonable assistance in the determination of the
fair value of certain securities when reliable market quotations are not readily
available for purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance with
procedures and methods established by the Fund's Board of Directors.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and management
facilities, including salaries of clerical and other personnel required for it
to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including
bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient
conduct of its duties under this Agreement.

(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission merchants on
behalf of the Fund (broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all
transactions for the Series, place all necessary orders with broker-dealers or
issuers (including affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if
applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell
orders for the Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell
orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation of
securities so sold or purchased, as well as the expenses incurred in the
transaction, will be made by the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor
considers to be the most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations
to the Fund and to other clients.  The Manager recognizes that, in some cases,
this procedure may limit the size of the position that may be acquired or sold
for the Series.  The Sub-Advisor will report on such allocations at the request
of the Manager, the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors providing such
information as the number of aggregated trades to which the Series was a party,
the broker-dealers to whom such trades were directed and the basis for the
allocation for the aggregated trades.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best
efforts to obtain execution of transactions for the Series at prices which are
advantageous to the Series and at commission rates that are reasonable in
relation to the benefits received. However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers
or dealers on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or other services
or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable law,
the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission for effecting
a securities transaction in excess of the amount of commission or dealer spread
another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if
the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that such amount of commission is
reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research products
and/or services provided by such broker or dealer. This determination, with
respect to brokerage and research products and/or services, may be viewed in
terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities
which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to the Series as well
as to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Not all such
services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the Series. In
addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized by the Series
except to the extent permitted under any exemptive order obtained by the Sub-
Advisor provided that all conditions of such order are complied with.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the Series as are
required of an investment advisor of a registered investment company pursuant to
the 1940 Act and Investment Advisor's Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisor's"
"29864","Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with such
periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager may reasonably request.  In
compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-
Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it maintains for the Series are the
property of the Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2
under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains for the Fund and that are
required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees
to surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it maintains for the Series
upon request by the Fund or the Manager, provided however, the Sub-Advisor may
keep copies of such records in order to meet its own books and records
obligations.

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the Sub-
Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as the same may be
amended from time to time.  The Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-
Advisor's current Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to the
Manager a copy of any material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request, furnish the
requesting party reports on portfolio transactions and reports on investments
held by the Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the Fund may reasonably
request.  The Sub-Advisor will make available its officers and employees to meet
with the Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's principal place of business on
due notice to review the investments of the Series.

(m)	Provide such reasonable information as is customarily provided by a sub-
advisor and may be required for the Fund or the Manager to comply with their
respective obligations under applicable laws, including, without limitation, the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the
Investment Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities"
"29865","Act), and any state securities laws, and any rule or regulation thereunder.
Sub-Advisor will advise Manager of any changes in Sub-Advisor's managing members
within a reasonable time after any such change.  Manager acknowledges receipt of
Sub-Advisor's Form ADV Part II more than 48 hours prior to the execution of this
Agreement.

(n) [Intentionally omitted.]

(o) Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies solicited by, or with
respect to, the issuers of securities held in the Series in accordance with the
Sub-Advisor's proxy policies and procedures.  The Manager shall cause to be
promptly forwarded to Sub-Advisor all proxy solicitation materials that it
receives and shall assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to conduct the proxy voting
process.  It is understood and agreed that the Sub-Advisor may utilize the
services of a third party proxy voting specialist in order to carry out its
obligations hereunder.

    3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-Advisor will not
consult with any other investment advisory firm that provides investment
advisory services to any investment company sponsored by Principal Life
Insurance Company regarding transactions for the Fund in securities or other
assets.

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations assumed by the
Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the Fund, the Manager shall pay the
compensation specified in Appendix A to this Agreement.



    5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers, employees, agents or

made in the good faith exercise of the Sub-Advisor's duties under this Agreement

misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of, or from reckless disregard of,
the duties of the Sub-Advisor or any of its directors, officers, employees,
agents (excluding any broker-dealer selected by the Sub-Advisor), or affiliates.

    6.	Indemnification

The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Sub-Advisor from and
against any and all claims, losses, liabilities or damages (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and other related expenses), (Losses) howsoever arising, from
or in connection with this Agreement or the performance by the Sub-Advisor of
its duties hereunder, so long as the Sub-Advisor shall, after receipt of notice
of any claim or commencement of any action, promptly notify the Manager in
writing of the claim or commencement of such action.  The Manager shall not be
liable for any settlement of any claim or action effected without its written
consent.  Nothing contained herein shall require the Manager to indemnify the
Sub-Advisor for Losses resulting from the Sub-Advisor's willful misfeasance, bad
faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or from its reckless
disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.

    7.	Supplemental Arrangements

APPENDIX A


The Sub-Advisor shall serve as an investment sub-advisor for the Series
identified below. The Manager will pay the Sub-Advisor, as full compensation for
all services provided under this Agreement, a fee, computed and paid quarterly
at an annual rate as shown below of the Series' average daily net assets (but
gross of the sub-advisor fee) in the relevant month allocated to the Sub-
Advisor's management.

In calculating the fee for a series included in the table, assets of any
unregistered separate account of Principal Life Insurance Company and any
investment company sponsored by Principal Life Insurance Company to which the
Sub-Advisor provides investment advisory services and which have the same
investment mandate as the series for which the fee is calculated, will be
combined with the assets of the series to arrive at net assets.

If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates before the end of any month,
the fee (if any) for the period from the effective date to the end of such month
or from the beginning of such month to the date of termination, as the case may
be, shall be prorated according to the proportion which such period bears to the
full month in which such effectiveness or termination occurs.

"29923","services provided to the Series, its compliance with the 1940 Act and the"
"29924","regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder and the"

"29927","additional information as may be required from the Manager and provided in"
"29928","accordance with Section 11(d) of this Agreement. The Sub-Advisor has no"
"29929","responsibility for the maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is directly"
"29930","related to the services it provides to the Series."
"29931","(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and in such"
"29932","detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem appropriate in order to"
"29933","enable it to determine that the investment policies, procedures and approved"

"29935","(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the Board of Directors' determination"
"29936","of the fair value of certain securities when reliable market quotations are not"
"29937","readily available for purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance with"
"29938","procedures and methods established by the Fund's Board of Directors."
"29939","(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and management"
"29940","facilities, including salaries of clerical and other personnel required for it"
"29941","to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including"
"29942","bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient"
"29943","conduct of its duties under this Agreement."
"29944","(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission merchants"
"29945","(broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all transactions for the"
"29946","Series, place all necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers (including"
"29947","affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the"
"29948","extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders for the Series"
"29949","may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of other clients"
"29950","of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation of securities so sold or purchased,"
"29951","as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Sub-"
"29952","Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the most equitable and"
"29953","consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients.  The"
"29954","Manager recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure may limit the size of the"
"29955","position that may be acquired or sold for the Series.  The Sub-Advisor will"
"29956","report on such allocations at the request of the Manager, the Fund or the Fund's"
"29957","Board of Directors providing such information as the number of aggregated trades"
"29958","to which the Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades were"
"29959","directed and the basis for the allocation for the aggregated trades.  The Sub-"
"29960","Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain execution of transactions for the"
"29961","Series at prices which are advantageous to the Series and at commission rates"
"29962","that are reasonable in relation to the benefits received. However, the Sub-"
"29963","Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the basis that they provide brokerage,"
"29964","research or other services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent"
"29965","consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an"
"29966","amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the"
"29967","amount of commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would have"
"29968","charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good"
"29969","faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of"
"29970","the brokerage and research products and/or services provided by such broker or"
"29971","dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and research products"
"29972","and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or"
"29973","the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with"
"29974","respect to the Series as well as to accounts over which they exercise investment"
"29975","discretion. Not all such services or products need be used"
"29976","by the Sub-Advisor in managing the Series. In addition, joint repurchase or"
"29977","other accounts may not be utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted"
"29978","under any exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all"
"29979","conditions of such order are complied with."
"29980","(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the Series as are"
"29981","required of an investment adviser of a registered investment company pursuant to"
"29982","the 1940 Act and Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisers
Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with such"
"29983","periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager may reasonably request.  In"
"29984","compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-"
"29985","Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it maintains for the Series are the"
"29986","property of the Fund (as well as the Sub-Advisor), agrees to preserve for the"
"29987","periods described by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the records that are required"
"29988","to be maintained by the Sub-Advisor under Rule 31a-1 (f) under the 1940 Act, and"
"29989","further agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it maintains"
"29990","for the Series upon request by the Fund or the Manager (but may keep copies"
"29991","thereof)."
"29992","(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the Sub-"
"29993","Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as the same may be"
"29994","amended from time to time.  The Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-"
"29995","Advisor's current Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to the"
"29996","Manager a copy of any material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics."
"29997","(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request, furnish the"
"29998","requesting party reports on portfolio transactions and reports on investments"
"29999","held by the Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the Fund may reasonably"
"30000","request.  The Sub-Advisor will make available its officers and employees to meet"
"30001","with the Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's principal place of business on"
"30002","due notice to review the investments of the Series."
"30003","(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-advisor and"
"30004","may be required for the Fund or the Manager to comply with their respective"
"30005","obligations under applicable laws, including, without limitation, the Internal"
"30006","Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment"
"30007","Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and"
"30008","any state securities laws, and any rule or regulation thereunder.  Sub-Advisor"
"30009","will advise Manager of any material changes in the managing members of the Sub-"
"30010","Advisor's limited liability company within a reasonable time after any such"
"30011","change.  Manager acknowledges receipt of Sub-Advisor's Form ADV more than 48"
"30012","hours prior to the execution of this Agreement."
"30013","(n) Perform quarterly and annual tax compliance tests to monitor the Series'"
"30014","compliance with Subchapter M of the Code and Section 817(h) of the Code, subject"
"30015","to receipt of such additional information as may be required from the Manager"
"30016","and provided in accordance with Section 11(d) of this Agreement.  The Sub-"
"30017","Advisor shall notify the Manager immediately upon having a reasonable basis for"
"30018","believing that the Series has ceased to be in compliance or that it might not be"
"30019","in compliance in the future.  If it is determined that the Series is not in"

"30234","AMENDED AND RESTATED SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT"
"30235","J.P. MORGAN SUB-ADVISED FUNDS"
"30236","AGREEMENT executed as of the 1st day of October, 2008, by and between PRINCIPAL"
"30237","MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, an Iowa corporation (hereinafter called the Manager),"
"30238","and J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc., a Delaware Corporation (hereinafter"
"30239","called the Sub-Advisor).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to each Fund of the
Principal  Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end management investment company
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940"
"30240","Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it with
portfolio selection and related research and statistical services in connection
with the investment advisory services for each series identified in Appendix A (
hereinafter called the Series), which the Manager has agreed to provide to the
Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to furnish such services; and

WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies properly
certified or authenticated of each of the following and will promptly provide
the Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or authenticated of any amendment
or supplement thereto:

 	(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement) with the Fund;

 	(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

 	(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the Board of
Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and services provided by the Sub-
Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the Manager hereby
appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the services described in Section 2 below
for investment and reinvestment of the securities and other assets of the
Series, subject to the control and direction of the Manager and the Fund's Board
of Directors, for the period and on the terms hereinafter set forth. The Sub-
Advisor accepts such appointment and agrees to furnish the services hereinafter
set forth for the compensation herein provided. The Sub-Advisor shall for all
purposes herein be deemed to be an independent contractor and shall, except as
expressly provided or authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the
Fund or the Manager in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or
the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

		The Sub-Advisor will:

(a) Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited to research,
advice and supervision for the Series.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval (or any
appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from time to time as economic
conditions require, a recommended investment program for the Fund consistent
with the Series' investment objective and policies.

(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing orders for the
purchase and sale of securities without prior consultation with the Manager and
without regard to the length of time the securities have been held, the
resulting rate of portfolio turnover or any tax considerations, subject always
to the provisions of the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, the
requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same shall be from time to time in
effect.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the officers,
in taking such steps as are reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the
decisions of its Board of Directors, and any appropriate committees of such
Board, regarding the general conduct of the investment business of the Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment advisory
services provided to the Series, its compliance with the 1940 Act and the
regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder and the
Series' investment strategies and restrictions as stated in the Fund's
prospectus and statement of additional information, subject to receipt of such
additional information as may be required from the Manager and provided in
accordance with Section 11(d) of this Agreement. The Sub-Advisor has no
responsibility for the maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is directly
related to the services it provides to the Series.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and in such
detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem appropriate in order to
enable it to determine that the investment policies, procedures and approved
investment program of the Series are being observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination of the fair value of
certain securities when reliable market quotations are not readily available for
purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance with procedures and
methods established by the Fund's Board of Directors.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and management
facilities, including salaries of clerical and other personnel required for it
to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including
bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient
conduct of its duties under this Agreement.

(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission merchants
(broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all transactions for the
Series, place all necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers (including
affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the
extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders for the Series
may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of other clients
of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation of securities so sold or purchased,
as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Sub-
Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the most equitable and
consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients.  The
Manager recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure may limit the size of the
position that may be acquired or sold for the Series.  The Sub-Advisor will
report on such allocations at the request of the Manager, the Fund or the Fund's
Board of Directors providing such information as the number of aggregated trades
to which the Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades were
directed and the basis for the allocation for the aggregated trades.  The Sub-
Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain execution of transactions for the
Series at prices which are advantageous to the Series and at commission rates
that are reasonable in relation to the benefits received. However, the Sub-
Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the basis that they provide brokerage,
research or other services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent
consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an
amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the
amount of commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would have
charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good
faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of
the brokerage and research products and/or services provided by such broker or
dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and research products
and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or
the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with
respect to the Series as well as to accounts over which they exercise investment
discretion. Not all such services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in
managing the Series. In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be
utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under any exemptive order
obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions of such order are
complied with.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the Series as are
required of an investment advisor of a registered investment company pursuant to
the 1940 Act and Investment Advisor's Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisor's"
"30241","Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with such
periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager may reasonably request.  In
compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-
Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it maintains for the Series are the
property of the Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2
under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains for the Fund and that are
required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees
to surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it maintains for the Series
upon request by the Fund or the Manager.

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the Sub-
Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as the same may be
amended from time to time.  The Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-
Advisor's current Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to the
Manager a copy of any material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request, furnish the
requesting party reports on portfolio transactions and reports on investments
held by the Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the Fund may reasonably
request.  The Sub-Advisor will make available its officers and employees to meet
with the Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's principal place of business on
due notice to review the investments of the Series.

(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-advisor and
may be required for the Fund or the Manager to comply with their respective
obligations under applicable laws, including, without limitation, the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment
Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and
any state securities laws, and any rule or regulation thereunder.  Sub-Advisor
will advise Manager of any changes in Sub-Advisor's general partners within a
reasonable time after any such change.  Manager acknowledges receipt of Sub-
Advisor's Form ADV more than 48 hours prior to the execution of this Agreement.

(n) Perform quarterly and annual tax compliance tests to monitor the Series'
compliance with Subchapter M of the Code and Section 817(h) of the Code, subject
to receipt of such additional information as may be required from the Manager
and provided in accordance with Section 11(d) of this Agreement.  The Sub-
Advisor shall notify the Manager immediately upon having a reasonable basis for
believing that the Series has ceased to be in compliance or that it might not be
in compliance in the future.  If it is determined that the Series is not in
compliance with the requirements noted above, the Sub-Advisor, in consultation
with the Manager, will take prompt action to bring the Series back into
compliance (to the extent possible) within the time permitted under the Code.

(o) Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies solicited by, or with
respect to, the issuers of securities held in the Series.  The Manager shall
cause to be forwarded to Sub-Advisor all proxy solicitation materials that it
receives and shall assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to conduct the proxy voting
process.

    3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-Advisor will not
consult with any other investment advisory firm that provides investment
advisory services to any investment company sponsored by Principal Life
Insurance Company regarding transactions for the Fund in securities or other
assets.

    4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations assumed by the
Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the Fund, the Manager shall pay the
compensation specified in Appendix A to this Agreement.

    5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers, employees, agents or
affiliates shall be liable to the Manager, the Fund or its shareholders for any
loss suffered by the Manager or the Fund resulting from any error of judgment
made in the good faith exercise of the Sub-Advisor's duties under this Agreement
or as a result of the failure by the Manager or any of its affiliates to comply
with the terms of this Agreement except for losses resulting from willful

"30299","(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment advisory"
"30300","services provided to the Series, its compliance with the 1940 Act and the"
"30301","regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder and the"

"30309","detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem appropriate in order to"
"30310","enable it to determine that the investment policies, procedures and approved"
"30311","investment program of the Series are being observed."
"30312","(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination of the fair value of"
"30313","certain securities when reliable market quotations are not readily available for"

"30320","conduct of its duties under this Agreement."
"30321","(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission merchants"
"30322","(broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all transactions for the"
"30323","Series, place all necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers (including"
"30324","affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the"
"30325","extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders for the Series"
"30326","may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of other clients"
"30327","of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation of securities so sold or purchased,"
"30328","as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Sub-"
"30329","Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the most equitable and"
"30330","consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients.  The"
"30331","Manager recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure may limit the size of the"
"30332","position that may be acquired or sold for the Series.  The Sub-Advisor will"
"30333","report on such allocations at the request of the Manager, the Fund or the Fund's"
"30334","Board of Directors providing such information as the number of aggregated trades"
"30335","to which the Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades were"
"30336","directed and the basis for the allocation for the aggregated trades.  The Sub-"
"30337","Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain execution of transactions for the"
"30338","Series at prices which are advantageous to the Series and at commission rates"

"30340","Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the basis that they provide brokerage,"
"30341","research or other services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent"
"30342","consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an"
"30343","amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the"
"30344","amount of commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would have"
"30345","charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good"
"30346","faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of"
"30347","the brokerage and research products and/or services provided by such broker or"
"30348","dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and research products"
"30349","and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or"
"30350","the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with"
"30351","respect to the Series as well as to accounts over which they exercise investment"
"30352","discretion. Not all such services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in"
"30353","managing the Series. In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be"
"30354","utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under any exemptive order"

"30356","complied with."
"30357","(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the Series as are"
"30358","required of an investment advisor of a registered investment company pursuant to"

"30367","upon request by the Fund or the Manager."

"30376","request.  The Sub-Advisor will make available its officers and employees to meet"

"30618","AGREEMENT executed as of the September 30, 2008, by and between PRINCIPAL"
"30619","MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, an Iowa corporation (hereinafter called the Manager),"
"30620","and PACIFIC INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability"
"30621","Company (hereinafter called the Sub-Advisor).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to each Fund of the
Principal Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end management investment company
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940"
"30622","Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it with
portfolio selection and related research and statistical services in connection
with the investment advisory services for each series identified in Appendix A
(hereinafter called the Series), which the Manager has agreed to provide to
the Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to furnish such services; and

WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies properly
certified or authenticated of each of the following and will promptly provide
the Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or authenticated of any amendment
or supplement thereto:

 	(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement) with the Fund;

 	(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

 	(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the Board of
Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and services provided by the Sub-
Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the Manager hereby
appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the services described in Section 2 below
for investment and reinvestment of the securities and other assets of the
Series, subject to the control and direction of the Manager and the Fund's Board
of Directors, for the period and on the terms hereinafter set forth. The Sub-
Advisor accepts such appointment and agrees to furnish the services hereinafter
set forth for the compensation herein provided. The Sub-Advisor shall for all
purposes herein be deemed to be an independent contractor and shall, except as
expressly provided or authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the
Fund or the Manager in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or
the Manager.


2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

		The Sub-Advisor will:

(a) Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited to research,
advice and supervision for the Series.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval (or any
appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from time to time as economic
conditions require, a recommended investment program for the Fund consistent
with the Series' investment objective and policies.

(b) Implement the approved investment program by placing orders for the purchase
and sale of securities without prior consultation with the Manager and without
regard to the length of time the securities have been held, the resulting rate
of portfolio turnover or any tax considerations, subject always to the
provisions of the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, the requirements
of the 1940 Act, as each of the same shall be from time to time in effect.
The Sub-Advisor further shall have authority to instruct the custodian to: (i)
pay cash for securities and other property delivered to the custodian for the
Series, (ii) deliver or accept delivery of, upon receipt of payment or payment
upon receipt of, securities, commodities or other property underlying any
futures or options contracts, and other property purchased or sold for the
Series, and (iii) deposit margin or collateral obligations of the Series with
respect to any investments made pursuant to the Series' investment objectives
and guidelines.  The Sub-Advisor shall not have the authority to case the
Manager to deliver securities and other property, or pay cash to the Sub-Advisor
other than payment of the subadvisory fee provided for in this Agreement.
The Sub-Advisor is authorized on behalf of the Series to (i) enter into
agreements and execute any documents (e.g., any derivatives documentation such
as exchange traded and over-the-counter, as applicable) required to make
investments pursuant to the Series' investment objectives and guidelines, which
shall include market and/or industry standard documentation and the standard
representations contained therein; and (ii) acknowledge the receipt of brokers'
risk disclosure statements, electronic trading disclosure statements and similar
disclosures.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the officers,
in taking such steps as are reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the
decisions of its Board of Directors, and any appropriate committees of such
Board, regarding the general conduct of the investment business of the Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment advisory
services provided to the Series, its compliance with the 1940 Act and the
regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder and the
Series' investment strategies and restrictions as stated in the Fund's
prospectus and statement of additional information, subject to receipt of such
additional information as may be required from the Manager and provided in
accordance with Section 12(d) of this Agreement. The Sub-Advisor has no
responsibility for the maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is directly
related to the services it provides to the Series.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and in such
detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem appropriate in order to
enable it to determine that the investment policies, procedures and approved
investment program of the Series are being observed.

(g)	Upon reasonable request, provide reasonable assistance to the Manager in
the Manager's determination of the fair value of certain securities when
reliable market quotations are not readily available for purposes of calculating
net asset value in accordance with procedures and methods established by the
Fund's Board of Directors.  The Manager acknowledges and agrees that the Sub-
Advisor is not a pricing vendor for the Fund or any Series and does not have
responsibility for determining the market value of any asset in any Series or
for calculating the net asset value of any Series.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and management
facilities, including salaries of clerical and other personnel required for it
to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including
bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient
conduct of its duties under this Agreement.

(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission merchants
(broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all transactions for the
Series, place all necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers (including
affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the
extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders for the Series
may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of other clients
of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation of securities so sold or

purchased, as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by
the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be consistent with
its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients and consistent with
the Sub-Advisor's Trade Allocation Policy.  The Manager recognizes that, in some
cases, this procedure may limit the size of the position that may be acquired or
sold for the Series.  The Sub-Advisor will report reasonable non-confidential
information on such allocations at the reasonable request of the Manager, the
Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors, providing such information as the the
broker-dealers to whom such trades were directed.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its
best efforts to obtain best execution of transactions for the Series at prices
which are advantageous to the Series and at commission rates that are reasonable
in relation to the benefits received. However, the Sub-Advisor may select
brokers or dealers on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or other
services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with
applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of
commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount of
commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would have charged for
effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that such
amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and
research products and/or services provided by such broker or dealer. This
determination, with respect to brokerage and research products and/or services,
may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall
responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to
the Series as well as to accounts over which they exercise investment
discretion. Not all such services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in
managing the Series.
The Sub-Advisor may select any unaffiliated brokerage firm unaffiliated with the
Sub-Advisor consistent with Sub-Advisor's obligation to seek best execution.
The Sub-Advisor shall not be liable for any act or omission of any brokerage
firm or firms or counterparties designated by the Manager or chosen with
reasonable care.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the Series as are
required of a sub-advisor of a registered investment company pursuant to the
1940 Act and Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisers Act),
and the rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with such
periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager may reasonably request.  In
compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-
Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it maintains for the Series are the
property of the Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2
under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains for the Fund and that are
required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees
to surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it maintains for the Series
upon request by the Fund or the Manager.  The Sub-Advisor shall be entitled to
retain originals or copies of records pursuant to the requirements of applicable
laws or regulations.

(k)	Observe and comply in all material respects with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940
Act and the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as the
same may be amended from time to time.  The Manager acknowledges receipt of a
copy of Sub-Advisor's current Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly
forward to the Manager a copy of any material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's
Code of Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request, furnish the
requesting party reports on portfolio transactions and reports on investments
held by the Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the Fund may reasonably
request.  The Sub-Advisor will make available its account management employees
to meet with the Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's principal place of
business on due notice to review the investments of the Series.

(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-advisor and
may be required for the Fund or the Manager to comply with their respective
obligations under applicable laws, including, without limitation, the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment
Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and
any state securities laws, and any rule or regulation thereunder.  Sub-Advisor
will advise Manager of any changes in Sub-Advisor's Managing Directors within a
reasonable time after any such change.  Manager acknowledges receipt of Sub-
Advisor's Form ADV, Part II more than 48 hours prior to the execution of this
Agreement.

(n) Perform quarterly and annual tax compliance tests to monitor the Series'
compliance with Subchapter M of the Code and Section 817(h) of the Code, subject
to receipt of such additional information as may be required from the Manager
and provided in accordance with Section 12(d) of this Agreement.  The Sub-
Advisor shall notify the Manager immediately upon having a reasonable basis for
believing that the Series has ceased to be in compliance or that it might not be
in compliance in the future.  If it is determined that the Series is not in
compliance with the requirements noted above, the Sub-Advisor, in consultation
with the Manager, will take prompt action to bring the Series back into
compliance (to the extent possible) within the time permitted under the Code.

(o) Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies solicited by, or with
respect to, the issuers of securities held in the Series including the power to
exercise rights, options, warrants, conversion privileges, and redemption
privileges, and to tender securities pursuant to a tender offer.  The Manager
shall cause to be forwarded to Sub-Advisor all proxy solicitation materials that
it receives and shall assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to conduct the proxy
voting process.

(p)  Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the Sub-Advisor shall
have no obligation to perform the following services or to have employees of the
Sub-Advisor perform the following roles, as applicable:  (a) preparing and
filing material for distribution to shareholders of the Series, including
statistical information about the Series and material regarding the Series'
performance or investments;  (b)  providing employees of the Sub-Advisor to
serve as officers of the Fund; or (c)  providing employees of the Sub-Advisor to
serve as the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer and associated staff.

3. Representations and Agreements of the Manager
(i) each Series is a qualified institutional buyer (QIB) as defined in Rule
144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Manager will promptly
notify the Sub-Advisor if a Series ceases to be a QIB;
(ii) each Series is a qualified eligible person (QEP) as defined in
Commodity Futures Trading Commission Rule 4.7 (CFTC Rule 4.7), the Manager

(iv)	the assets in the Series are free from all liens and charges, and the
Manager undertakes that no liens or charges will arise from the act or omissions
of the Manger or the Fund which may prevent the Sub-Advisor from giving a first
priority lien or charge on the Series assets solely in connection with the Sub-
Advisor's authority to direct the deposit of margin or collateral to the extent
necessary to meet the obligations of the Series with respect to any investments
made pursuant to the Series' investment objectives and guidelines.

    4.	Prohibited Conduct

Advisor's duties under this Agreement or as a result of the failure by the

approvals and notices given on behalf of the Manager the Fund or the Series.
The Manager shall provide a Secretary Certificate, Incumbency Certificate, or
similar document indicating that the persons designated as representatives have
the authority to bind the Manager and the Series and is included herein as
Appendix B.  The Manager may amend such Exhibit B from time to time by written
notice to the Sub-Advisor.  The Manager shall continue to rely upon these
instructions until notified by the Manager to the contrary.


    7.	Indemnification

The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Sub-Advisor from and
against any and all claims, losses, liabilities or damages (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and other related expenses), (Losses) howsoever arising, from

services were provided directly.  No additional fees shall be imposed for such
services except as otherwise agreed.

allocated to PIMCO's management.

The fee for the Series shall be accrued for each calendar day and the sum of the
daily fee accruals shall be paid monthly to the Subadviser. The daily fee
accruals will be computed by multiplying the fraction of one over the number of
calendar days in the year by the applicable annual rate described in the
following paragraph, and multiplying this product by the daily net assets of the
Series as determined in accordance with the Fund's prospectus and statement of
additional information as of the close of each business day.

If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates before the end of any month,
the fee (if any) for the period from the effective date to the end of such month

"30671","effect."
"30672","(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the officers,"
"30673","in taking such steps as are reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the"
"30674","decisions of its Board of Directors, and any appropriate committees of such"

"30676","(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment advisory"
"30677","services provided to the Series, its compliance with the 1940 Act and the"
"30678","regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder and the"
"30679","Series' investment strategies and restrictions as stated in the Fund's"
"30680","prospectus and statement of additional information, subject to receipt of such"
"30681","additional information as may be required from the Manager and provided in"
"30682","accordance with Section 11(d) of this Agreement. The Sub-Advisor has no"
"30683","responsibility for the maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is directly"
"30684","related to the services it provides to the Series."
"30685","(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and in such"
"30686","detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem appropriate in order to"
"30687","enable it to determine that the investment policies, procedures and approved"
"30688","investment program of the Series are being observed."
"30689","(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination of the fair value of"
"30690","certain securities when reliable market quotations are not readily available for"
"30691","purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance with procedures and"
"30692","methods established by the Fund's Board of Directors."
"30693","(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and management"
"30694","facilities, including salaries of clerical and other personnel required for it"
"30695","to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including"
"30696","bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient"
"30697","conduct of its duties under this Agreement."
"30698","(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission merchants"
"30699","(broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all transactions for the"
"30700","Series, place all necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers (including"
"30701","affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the"
"30702","extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders for the Series"
"30703","may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of other clients"
"30704","of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation of securities so sold or purchased,"
"30705","as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Sub-"
"30706","Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the most equitable and"
"30707","consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients.  The"
"30708","Manager recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure may limit the size of the"
"30709","position that may be acquired or sold for the Series.  The Sub-Advisor will"
"30710","report on such allocations at the request of the Manager, the Fund or the Fund's"
"30711","Board of Directors providing such information as the number of aggregated trades"
"30712","to which the Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades were"
"30713","directed and the basis for the allocation for the aggregated trades.  The Sub-"
"30714","Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain execution of transactions for the"
"30715","Series at prices which are advantageous to the Series and at commission rates"
"30716","that are reasonable in relation to the benefits received. However, the Sub-"
"30717","Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the basis that they provide brokerage,"
"30718","research or other services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent"
"30719","consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an"
"30720","amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the"
"30721","amount of commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would have"
"30722","charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good"
"30723","faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of"
"30724","the brokerage and research products and/or services provided by such broker or"
"30725","dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and research products"
"30726","and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or"
"30727","the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with"
"30728","respect to the Series as well as to accounts over which they exercise investment"
"30729","discretion. Not all such services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in"
"30730","managing the Series. In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be"
"30731","utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under any exemptive order"
"30732","obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions of such order are"
"30733","complied with."
"30734","(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the Series as are"
"30735","required of an investment advisor of a registered investment company pursuant to"
"30736","the 1940 Act and Investment Advisor's Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisor's
Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with such"
"30737","periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager may reasonably request.  In"
"30738","compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-"
"30739","Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it maintains for the Series are the"
"30740","property of the Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2"
"30741","under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains for the Fund and that are"
"30742","required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees"
"30743","to surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it maintains for the Series"
"30744","upon request by the Fund or the Manager."
"30745","(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the Sub-"
"30746","Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as the same may be"
"30747","amended from time to time.  The Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-"
"30748","Advisor's current Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to the"

"30751","requesting party reports on portfolio transactions and reports on investments"
"30752","held by the Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the Fund may reasonably"
"30753","request.  The Sub-Advisor will make available its officers and employees to meet"
"30754","with the Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's principal place of business on"
"30755","due notice to review the investments of the Series."
"30756","(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-advisor and"
"30757","may be required for the Fund or the Manager to comply with their respective"
"30758","obligations under applicable laws, including, without limitation, the Internal"
"30759","Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment"

"30769","receives and shall assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to conduct the proxy voting"
"30770","process."
"30771","    3.	Prohibited Conduct"
"30772","In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-Advisor will not"
