"485","<DESCRIPTION>ACCOUNTANTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL"
"486","<TEXT>"
"487","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"488","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Franklin California"
"489","Tax-Free Income Fund:"
"490","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"491","Franklin California Tax-Free Income Fund (the Fund)) as of and for"
"492","the year ended March 31, 2017, in accordance with the standards of"
"493","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"494","considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"495","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"496","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"497","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"498","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"499","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"500","financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion"
"501","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"502","financial reporting."
"503","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"504","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"505","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"506","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"507","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"508","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"509","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"510","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"511","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"512","A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"513","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"514","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"515","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"516","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"517","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"518","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"519","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance"
"520","with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3)"
"521","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"522","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets"
"523","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"524","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"525","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"526","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"527","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes"
"528","in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"529","or procedures may deteriorate."
"530","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"531","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"532"," or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"533"," to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"534"," weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"535","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"536","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's"
"537","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"538","detected on a timely basis."
"539","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"540","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"541","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"542","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"543","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"544","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"545"," the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and"
"546","its operations, including controls over safeguarding securities"
"547","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above"
"548","as of March 31, 2017."
"549","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"550","management and the Board of Trustees of Franklin California Tax-Free"
"551","Income Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"552","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"553","these specified parties."

"618","AGREEMENT"
"619","In order to consummate the Reorganization and in consideration of the premises"
"620","and of the covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto,"
"621","intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:"
"622","1.	Sale and Transfer of Assets, Liquidation and Dissolution of the"
"623","Target Fund."
"624","(a)	Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, and in"
"625","reliance on the representations and warranties herein contained, and"
"626","in consideration of the delivery by the Acquiring Fund of the number"
"627","of Acquiring Fund Shares hereinafter provided, CAFTFT, on behalf of the"

"629","and deliver to the Acquiring Fund all of the Target Fund's then existing"

"643","(ii) discharge its unpaid liabilities on its books at the Closing"
"644","Date (as such term is defined in Section 3), including, but not"

"646","if any, payable for the period prior to the Closing Date and through"
"647","the final taxable year ending with the Target Fund's complete liquidation;"
"648","and (iii) pay such contingent liabilities, if any, as the officers of"
"649","CAFTFT shall reasonably deem to exist against the Target Fund at the"
"650","Closing Date, for which contingent and other appropriate liability reserves"
"651","shall be established on the Target Fund's books (such assets hereinafter"
"652","Net Assets).  The Acquiring Fund shall not assume any liability of the"
"653","Target Fund, whether accrued or contingent, known or unknown, and the Target"
"654","Fund shall use its reasonable best efforts to discharge all of its known"
"655","liabilities so far as may be possible, from the cash, bank deposits and"
"656","cash equivalent securities described above."
"657","(b)	Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, and in reliance"
"658","on the representations and warranties herein contained, and in consideration"
"659","of such sale, conveyance, transfer, and delivery, the Acquiring Fund agrees at"
"660","the Closing to deliver to CAFTFT, on behalf of the Target Fund, the number of"
"661","Acquiring Fund Shares, determined by dividing the net asset value per share of"
"662","each Class A, Class C and Advisor Class shares of the Target Fund by the net"
"663","asset value per share each of Class A, Class C and Advisor Class shares of"
"664","the Acquiring Fund, respectively, and separately multiplying the result"
"665","thereof by the number of outstanding Class A, Class C and Advisor Class"
"666","shares, respectively, of the Target Fund as of 1:00 p.m., Pacific time on"
"667","the Closing Date.  The Acquiring Fund Shares delivered to CAFTFT, on"
"668","behalf of the Target Fund, at the Closing shall have an aggregate net"
"669"," asset value equal to the value of the Target Fund's Net Assets, all"
"670","determined as provided in Section 2 of the Plan and as of the date and"
"671","time specified herein."
"672","(c)	Immediately following the Closing, CAFTFT, on behalf"
"673","of the Target Fund, shall distribute the Acquiring Fund Shares received"
"674","by CAFTFT, on behalf of the Target Fund, pursuant to this Section 1 to the"
"675","Target Fund's shareholders of record so that each shareholder receives full"
"676","and fractional Acquiring Fund Shares of the corresponding class of the"
"677","Acquiring Fund equal in value to the full and fractional shares of the Target"
"678","Fund held by the shareholder as of 1:00 p.m., Pacific time, on the Closing"
"679","Date. Such distribution shall be accomplished by the establishment of accounts"
"680","on the share records of the Acquiring Fund of the type and in the amounts"
"681","due such shareholders based on their respective holdings in the Target"
"682","Fund as of 1:00 p.m., Pacific time, on the Closing Date.  Fractional"
"683","Acquiring Fund Shares shall be carried to the third decimal place."
"684","As promptly as practicable after the Closing, each holder of any outstanding"
"685","certificate or certificates representing Target Fund Shares shall be entitled"
"686","to surrender the same to the transfer agent for the Acquiring Fund in exchange"
"687","for the number of Acquiring Fund Shares of the same class into which the"
"688","Target Fund Shares theretofore represented by the certificate or"
"689","certificates so surrendered shall have been converted.  Until so"
"690","surrendered, each outstanding certificate, if any, which, prior"
"691","to the Closing, represented Target Fund Shares shall be deemed"
"692","for all Acquiring Fund purposes to evidence ownership of the number"
"693","of Acquiring Fund Shares into which the Target Fund Shares (which prior"
"694","to the Closing were represented thereby) have been converted."
"695","Certificates for the Acquiring Fund Shares shall not be issued."
"696","After the distribution, the Target Fund shall be dissolved."
"697","(d)	At the Closing, each shareholder of record of the Target"
"698","Fund as of the record date (the Distribution Record Date) with"
"699","respect to any unpaid dividends and other distributions that were"
"700","declared prior to the Closing, including any dividend or distribution"
"701","declared pursuant to Section 6(d) hereof, shall have the right to receive"
"702","such unpaid dividends and distributions with respect to the shares of the"
"703","Target Fund that such person had on such Distribution Record Date."
"704","(e)	All books and records relating to the Target Fund, including"
"705","all books and records required to be maintained under the Investment"
"706","Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act), and the rules and regulations"
"707","thereunder, shall be available to the Acquiring Fund from and after"
"708","the date of the Plan, and shall be turned over to the Acquiring Fund"
"709","on or prior to the Closing."
"710","2.	Valuation."
"711","(a)	The net asset value per share of the Acquiring Fund Shares and the"
"712","Target Fund Shares and the value of the Target Fund's Net Assets to be"
"713","acquired by the Acquiring Fund hereunder shall in each case be computed"
"714"," as of 1:00 p.m., Pacific time, on the Closing Date, unless on such"
"715","date: (i) the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is not open for unrestricted"
"716","trading; or (ii) the reporting of trading on the NYSE or other relevant"
"717","market is disrupted; or (iii) any other extraordinary financial event"
"718","or market condition occurs (each of the events described in (i), (ii) or"
"719","(iii) are referred to as a Market Disruption).  The net asset value"
"720","per share of the Acquiring Fund Shares and the Target Fund Shares and"
"721","the value of the Target Fund's Net Assets shall be computed in"
"722","accordance with the valuation procedures set forth in the most"
"723","recent respective prospectus of the Acquiring Fund and the Target"
"724","Fund, as amended or supplemented."
"725","(b)	In the event of a Market Disruption on the proposed Closing"
"726","Date so that an accurate appraisal of the net asset value per share of"
"727","the Acquiring Fund Shares or Target Fund Shares or the value of the Target"
"728","Fund's Net Assets is impracticable, the Closing Date shall be postponed"
"729","until the first business day when regular trading on the NYSE shall have"
"730","been fully resumed and reporting shall have been restored and other"
"731","trading markets are otherwise stabilized."
"732","(c)	All computations of value regarding the net asset value"
"733","per share of the Acquiring Fund Shares and Target Fund Shares"
"734","and the value of the Target Fund's Net Assets shall be made by the"
"735","administrator to the Acquiring Fund and Target Fund."
"736","3.	Closing and Closing Date."
"737","The Closing shall take place at the principal office of the Acquiring"
"738","Fund at 1:00 p.m., Pacific time, on October 28, 2016 or such later date as"
"739","the officers of the Acquiring Fund and CAFTFT may mutually agree (the"
"740","Closing Date).  CAFTFT, on behalf of the Target Fund, shall have provided"
"741","for delivery as of the Closing the Net Assets to be transferred to the account"
