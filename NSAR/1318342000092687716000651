"653","REPORT OF"
"654","INDEPENDENT"
"655","REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"656","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"657","To the Shareholders and"
"658","Board of Trustees of"
"659","Investment Managers Series"
"660","Trust"
"661","Glendora, California 91740"
"662","In planning and performing our"
"663","audit of the financial statements"
"664","of Gavekal KL Allocation Fund"
"665","(the Fund), a series of"
"666","Investment Managers Series"
"667","Trust, as of and for the year"
"668","ended August 31, 2016, in"
"669","accordance with the standards"
"670","of the Public Company"
"671","Accounting Oversight Board"
"672","(United States), we considered"
"673","their internal control over"
"674","financial reporting, including"
"675","control activities for"
"676","safeguarding securities, as a"
"677","basis for designing our auditing"
"678","procedures for the purpose of"
"679","expressing our opinion on the"
"680","financial statements and to"
"681","comply with the requirements of"
"682","Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"683","purpose of expressing an"
"684","opinion on the effectiveness of"
"685","the Funds internal control over"
"686","financial reporting."
"687","Accordingly, we express no"
"688","such opinion."
"689","The management of the Fund is"
"690","responsible for establishing and"
"691","maintaining effective internal"
"692","control over financial reporting."
"693","In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"694","estimates and judgments by"
"695","management are required to"
"696","assess the expected benefits and"
"697","related costs of controls.   A"
"698","companys internal control over"
"699","financial reporting is a process"
"700","designed to provide reasonable"
"701","assurance regarding the"
"702","reliability of financial reporting"
"703","and the preparation of financial"
"704","statements for external purposes"
"705","in accordance with generally"
"706","accepted accounting principles."
"707","A companys internal control"
"708","over financial reporting includes"
"709","those policies and procedures"
"710","that (1) pertain to the"
"711","maintenance of records that, in"
"712","reasonable detail, accurately and"
"713","fairly reflect the transactions"
"714","and dispositions of the assets of"
"715","the company (2) provide"
"716","reasonable assurance that"
"717","transactions are recorded as"
"718","necessary to permit preparation"
"719","of financial statements in"
"720","accordance with generally"
"721","accepted accounting principles,"
"722","and that receipts and"
"723","expenditures of the company are"
"724","being made only in accordance"
"725","with authorizations of"
"726","management and directors of"
"727","the company and (3) provide"
"728","reasonable assurance regarding"
"729","prevention or timely detection"
"730","of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"731","or disposition of a companys"
"732","assets that could have a material"
"733","effect on the financial"
"734","statements."
"735","Because of inherent limitations,"
"736","internal control over financial"
"737","reporting may not prevent or"
"738","detect misstatements.   Also,"
"739","projections of any evaluation of"
"740","effectiveness to future periods"
"741","are subject to the risk that"
"742","controls may become"
"743","inadequate because of changes"
"744","in conditions, or that the degree"
"745","of compliance with the policies"
"746","or procedures may deteriorate."
"747","A deficiency in internal control"
"748","over financial reporting exists"
"749","when the design or operation of"
"750","a control does not allow"
"751","management or employees, in"
"752","the normal course of performing"
"753","their assigned functions, to"
"754","prevent or detect misstatements"
"755","on a timely basis.   A material"
"756","weakness is a deficiency, or"
"757","combination of deficiencies, in"
"758","internal control over financial"
"759","reporting, such that there is a"
"760","reasonable possibility that a"
"761","material misstatement of the"
"762","companys annual or interim"
"763","financial statements will not be"
"764","prevented or detected on a"
"765","timely basis."
"766","To the Shareholders and"
"767","Board of Trustees of"
"768","Investment Managers Series"
"769","Trust"
"770","Page Two"
"771","Our consideration of the Funds"
"772","internal control over financial"
"773","reporting was for the limited"
"774","purpose described in the first"
"775","paragraph and would not"
"776","necessarily disclose all"
"777","deficiencies in internal control"
"778","that might be material"
"779","weaknesses under standards"
"780","established by the Public"
"781","Company Accounting Oversight"
"782","Board (United States)."
"783","However, we noted no"
"784","deficiencies in the Funds"
"785","internal control over financial"
"786","reporting and its operation,"
"787","including controls for"
"788","safeguarding securities, which"
"789","we consider to be material"
"790","weaknesses, as defined above,"
"791","as of August 31, 2016."
