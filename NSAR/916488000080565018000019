"2373","Templeton Global Investment Trust (the Trust)"
"2374","WHEREAS, Article VIII, Section 2 of the By-Laws provides that the"

"2377","of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the Board of Trustees"
"2378","unanimously authorized the By-Laws to be amended as set forth below."
"2379","NOW THEREFORE, the By-Laws are hereby amended as follows:"
"2380","1.    ARTICLE VII, Sections 3, 4 and 6 are replaced in their"
"2381","entirety with the following:"
"2382","* * * * *"
"2383","Section 3. 	CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES. No certificate or certificates"
"2384","for Shares shall be issued to Shareholders and no Shareholder shall"
"2385","have the right to demand or require that a certificate for Shares"
"2386","be issued to it. The Trust shall adopt and use a system of"
"2387","issuance, recordation and transfer of its shares by electronic"
"2388","or other means."
"2389","Section 4. 	LOST CERTIFICATES. No new certificate for Shares"

"2444","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2445","To the Board of Trustees of Templeton Global Investment"
"2446","Trust and Shareholders of the Templeton Dynamic Equity Fund,"
"2447","Templeton Emerging Markets Small Cap Fund, and Templeton"
"2448","Frontier Markets Fund:"
"2449","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"2450","statements of Templeton Dynamic Equity Fund, Templeton"
"2451","Emerging Markets Small Cap Fund, and Templeton Frontier"
"2452","Markets Fund (the Funds) as of and for the year ended"
"2453","March 31, 2018, in accordance with the standards of the"
"2454","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"2455","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2456","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"2457","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"2458","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"2459","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"2460","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"2461","of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"2462","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness"
"2463","of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"2464","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"2465","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"2466","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"2467","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"2468","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal"
"2469","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"2470","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"2471","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"2472","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"2473","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal"
"2474","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"2475","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"2476","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"2477","and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"2478","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2479","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"2480","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures"
"2481","of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"2482","of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"2483","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"2484","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"2485","a material effect on the financial statements."
"2486","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2487","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"2488","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"2489","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2490","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"2491","procedures may deteriorate."
"2492","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2493","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"2494","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"2495","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"2496","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"2497","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"

"2532","From the Statement of Additional Information Supplement"

"2534","SUPPLEMENT DATED MARCH 2, 2018"
"2535","TO THE CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION"
"2536","OF EACH OF THE FUNDS LISTED BELOW"
"2537","Templeton Emerging Markets Small Cap Fund"
"2538","Templeton Frontier Markets Fund"
"2539","Templeton Dynamic Equity Fund"
"2540","For the Fund, the following is added to the Goals, Strategies
and Risks - Glossary of Investments, Techniques, Strategies and
Their Risks - Developing markets or emerging markets"
"2541","section of the SAI:"
"2542","Investing through the Bond Connect Program. Foreign investors"
"2543","may invest in China Interbank bonds traded on the China Interbank"
"2544","Bond Market (CIBM) through the China - Hong Kong Bond Connect"
"2545","program (Bond Connect). In China, the Hong Kong Monetary"
"2546","Authority Central Money Markets Unit holds Bond Connect securities"
"2547","on behalf of ultimate investors (such as the Fund) in accounts"
"2548","maintained with a China-based custodian (either the China Central"
"2549","Depository & Clearing Co. or the Shanghai Clearing House). This"
"2550","recordkeeping system subjects the Fund to various risks,"
"2551","including the risk that"
"2552","the Fund may have a limited ability to enforce rights as a"
"2553","bondholder and the risks of settlement delays and counterparty"
"2554","default of the Hong Kong sub-custodian. In addition, enforcing"
"2555","the ownership rights of a beneficial holder of Bond Connect"
"2556","securities is untested and courts in China have limited"
"2557","experience in applying the concept of beneficial ownership."
"2558","Bond Connect uses the trading infrastructure of both Hong"
"2559","Kong and China and is not available on trading holidays in"
"2560","Hong Kong. As a result, prices of securities purchased through"
"2561","Bond Connect may fluctuate at times when a Fund is unable to"
"2562","add to or exit its position. Securities offered through Bond"
"2563","Connect may lose their eligibility for trading through the program"
"2564","at any time. If Bond Connect securities lose their eligibility for"
"2565","trading through the program, they may be sold but can no longer be"
"2566","purchased through Bond Connect."
"2567","Bond Connect is subject to regulation by both Hong Kong and China and"
"2568","there can be no assurance that further regulations will not affect the"
"2569","availability of securities in the program, the frequency of redemptions"
"2570","or other limitations. Bond Connect trades are settled in Chinese"
"2571","currency, the renminbi (RMB). It cannot be guaranteed that"
"2572","investors will have timely access to a reliable supply of RMB"
"2573","in Hong Kong."
"2574","Bond Connect is relatively new and its effects on the Chinese"
"2575","interbank bond market are uncertain. In addition, the trading,"
"2576","settlement and IT systems required for non-Chinese investors in"
"2577","Bond Connect are relatively new. In the event of systems malfunctions,"
"2578","trading via Bond Connect could be disrupted. In addition, the Bond"
"2579","Connect program may be subject to further interpretation and guidance."
"2580","There can be no assurance as to the program's continued existence"
"2581","or whether future developments regarding the program may restrict"
"2582","or adversely affect the Fund's investments or returns. Finally,"
"2583","uncertainties in China tax rules governing taxation of income"
"2584","and gains from investments via Bond Connect could"
"2585","result in unexpected tax liabilities for a Fund."
