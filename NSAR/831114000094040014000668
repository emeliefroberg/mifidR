"7737","prompt and accurate data with respect to the Fund's transactions"

"7742","provision of the investment advisory services set forth in"
"7743","Section 3(a) above to one or more other parties (each such"
"7744","party, a Sub-Adviser), pursuant in each case to a written"

"7746","Section 15 of the 1940 Act and rules thereunder applicable to"
"7747","contracts for service as investment adviser of a registered"
"7748","investment company (including without limitation the"

"7750","Company and the shareholders of the Fund), subject, however, to"

"7753","Adviser may (but need not) be affiliated with the Investment"
"7754","Adviser."
"7755","      Any delegation of services pursuant to this Section 3(b)"
"7756","shall be subject to the following conditions:"
"7757","1.	Any fees or compensation payable to any Sub-Adviser"
"7758","shall be paid by the Investment Adviser and no additional"
"7759","obligation may be incurred on the Company's behalf to any"
"7760","Sub-Adviser; except that any Company expenses that may be"
"7761","incurred by the Investment Adviser and paid by the"
"7762","Company to the Investment Adviser directly may be"
"7763","incurred by the Sub-Adviser and paid by the Company to"
"7764","the Sub-Adviser directly, so long as such payment"
"7765","arrangements are approved by the Company and the"
"7766","Investment Adviser prior to the Sub-Adviser's incurring"
"7767","such expenses."
"7768","2.	If the Investment Adviser delegates its"
"7769","responsibilities to more than one Sub-Adviser, the"
"7770","Investment Adviser shall be responsible for assigning to"
"7771","each Sub-Adviser that portion of the assets of the Fund"
"7772","for which the Sub-Adviser is to act as Sub-Adviser,"
"7773","subject to the approval of the Company's Board of"
"7774","Directors."
"7775","3.	To the extent that any obligations of the Investment"
"7776","Adviser or any Sub-Adviser require any service provider"
"7777","of the Company or Fund to furnish information or"
"7778","services, such information or services shall be furnished"
"7779","by the Company's or the Fund's service providers directly"
"7780","to both the Investment Adviser and any Sub-Adviser."
"7781","      SECTION 4. BROKERAGE.  Subject to the Investment Adviser's"
"7782","obligation to obtain best price and execution, the Investment"
"7783","Adviser shall have full discretion to select brokers or dealers"
"7784","to effect the purchase and sale of securities.  When the"
"7785","Investment Adviser places orders for the purchase or sale of"
"7786","securities for the Fund, in selecting brokers or dealers to"
"7787","execute such orders, the Investment Adviser is expressly"
"7788","authorized to consider the fact that a broker or dealer has"
"7789","furnished statistical, research or other information or services"
"7790","for the benefit of the Fund directly or indirectly.  Without"
"7791","limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Investment Adviser"
"7792","is authorized to cause the Fund to pay brokerage commissions"
"7793","which may be in excess of the lowest rates available to brokers"
"7794","who execute transactions for the Fund or who otherwise provide"
"7795","brokerage and research services utilized by the Investment"
"7796","Adviser, provided that the Investment Adviser determines in good"
"7797","faith that the amount of each such commission paid to a broker"
"7798","is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"7799","research services provided by such broker viewed in terms of"
"7800","either the particular transaction to which the commission"
"7801","relates or the Investment Adviser's overall responsibilities"
"7802","with respect to accounts as to which the Investment Adviser"
"7803","exercises investment discretion.  The Investment Adviser may"
"7804","aggregate securities orders so long as the Investment Adviser"
"7805","adheres to a policy of allocating investment opportunities to"
"7806","the Fund over a period of time on a fair and equitable basis"
"7807","relative to other clients.  In no instance will the Fund's"
"7808","securities be purchased from or sold to the Company's principal"
"7809","underwriter, the Investment Adviser, or any affiliated person"
"7810","thereof, except to the extent permitted by SEC exemptive order"
"7811","or by applicable law."
"7812","      The Investment Adviser shall report to the Board of"
"7813","Directors of the Company at least quarterly with respect to"
"7814","brokerage transactions that were entered into by the Investment"
"7815","Adviser, pursuant to the foregoing paragraph, and shall certify"
"7816","to the Board that the commissions paid were reasonable in terms"
"7817","either of that transaction or the overall responsibilities of"
"7818","the Investment Adviser to the Company and the Investment"
"7819","Adviser's other clients, that the total commissions paid by the"
"7820","Company were reasonable in relation to the benefits to the"
"7821","Company over the long term, and that such commissions were paid"
"7822","in compliance with Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act"
"7823","of 1934."
"7824","      SECTION 5. CONFORMITY WITH LAW; CONFIDENTIALITY.  The"
"7825","Investment Adviser further agrees that it will comply with all"
"7826","applicable rules and regulations of all federal regulatory"
"7827","agencies having jurisdiction over the Investment Adviser in the"
"7828","performance of its duties hereunder.  The Investment Adviser"
"7829","will treat confidentially and as proprietary information of the"
"7830","Company all records and other information relating to the"
"7831","Company and prior, present, or potential shareholders (except"
"7832","with respect to clients of the Investment Adviser) and will not"
"7833","use such records and information for any purpose other than"
"7834","performance of its responsibilities and duties hereunder, except"
"7835","after prior notification to and approval in writing by the"
"7836","Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld and"
"7837","may not be withheld where the Investment Adviser may be exposed"
"7838","to civil or criminal contempt proceedings for failure to comply,"
"7839","when requested to divulge such information by duly constituted"
"7840","authorities, or when so requested by the Company. Where the"
"7841","Investment Adviser may be exposed to civil or criminal contempt"
"7842","proceedings for failure to comply with a request for records or"
"7843","other information relating to the Company, the Investment"
"7844","Adviser may comply with such request prior to obtaining the"
"7845","Company's written approval, provided that the Investment Adviser"
"7846","has taken reasonable steps to promptly notify the Company, in"
"7847","writing, upon receipt of the request."
"7848","      SECTION 6. SERVICES NOT EXCLUSIVE.  The Investment Adviser"
"7849","and its officers may act and continue to act as investment"
"7850","managers for others, and nothing in this Agreement shall in any"
"7851","way be deemed to restrict the right of the Investment Adviser to"
"7852","perform investment management or other services for any other"
"7853","person or entity, and the performance of such services for"
"7854","others shall not be deemed to violate or give rise to any duty"
"7855","or obligation to the Fund or the Company."
"7856","      Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the"
"7857","Investment Adviser or any of its directors, officers, affiliates"
"7858","or employees from buying, selling or trading in any securities"
"7859","for other clients and/or its or their own account.  The Company"
"7860","acknowledges that the Investment Adviser and its directors,"
"7861","officers, affiliates, employees and other clients may, at any"
"7862","time, have, acquire, increase, decrease, or dispose of positions"
"7863","in investments which are at the same time being acquired or"
"7864","disposed of for the Fund.  The Investment Adviser shall have no"
"7865","obligation to acquire for the Fund a position in any investment"
"7866","which the Investment Adviser, its directors, officers,"
"7867","affiliates or employees may acquire for its or their own"
"7868","accounts or for the account of another client, so long as it"
"7869","continues to be the policy and practice of the Investment"
"7870","Adviser not to favor or disfavor consistently or consciously any"
"7871","client or class of clients in the allocation of investment"
"7872","opportunities so that, to the extent practical, such"

"8018","performance of its duties or from reckless disregard by it of"
"8019","its obligations and duties under this Agreement (disabling
conduct).  The Fund will indemnify the Investment Adviser and"
"8020","each of the Investment Adviser's affiliates, directors,"
"8021","officers, employees, agents, associates and controlling persons"

"8025","or expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses)"
"8026","resulting from any claim, demand, action or suit not resulting"
"8027","from disabling conduct by the Investment Adviser.  All"
"8028","determinations with respect to Indemnification shall be made:"
"8029","(i) by a final decision on the merits by a court or other body"
"8030","before whom the proceeding was brought that the Indemnitee was"
"8031","not liable by reason of disabling conduct or (ii) in the absence"
"8032","of such a decision, a reasonable determination, based upon a"
"8033","review of the facts, that the Indemnitee was not liable by"
"8034","reason of disabling conduct by (a) the vote of a majority of a"
"8035","quorum of directors of the Fund who are neither interested
persons of the Company nor parties to the proceeding"
"8036","(disinterested non-party directors) or (b) if such a quorum is"
"8037","not obtainable or, even if obtainable, if a majority vote of"
"8038","such quorum so directs, an independent legal counsel in a"
"8039","written opinion.  The Indemnitee shall be entitled to advances"
"8040","from the Fund for payment of the reasonable expenses incurred by"
"8041","it in connection with the matter as to which it is seeking"
"8042","indemnification in the manner and to the fullest extent"
"8043","permissible under the Maryland General Corporation Law.  The"
"8044","Investment Adviser shall provide to the Fund a written"
"8045","affirmation of its good faith belief that the standard of"
"8046","conduct necessary for indemnification by the Fund has been met"
"8047","and a written undertaking to repay any such advance if it should"
"8048","ultimately be determined that the standard of conduct has not"
"8049","been met.  In addition, at least one of the following additional"
"8050","conditions shall be met:  (a) the Investment Adviser shall"
"8051","provide a security in form and amount reasonably acceptable to"
"8052","the Fund for its undertaking; (b) the Fund is insured against"
"8053","losses arising by reason of the advance; or (c) a majority of a"
"8054","quorum of disinterested non-party directors, or independent"
"8055","legal counsel, in a written opinion, shall have determined,"
"8056","based upon a review of facts readily available to the Fund at"
"8057","the time the advance is proposed to be made, that there is"
"8058","reason to believe that the Indemnitee will ultimately be found"
"8059","to be entitled to indemnification.  Any amounts payable by the"
"8060","Fund under this Section 12 shall be satisfied only against the"
"8061","assets of the Fund and not against the assets of any other"
"8062","investment portfolio of the Company.  The rights accruing to any"
"8063","Indemnitee under these provisions shall not exclude any other"
"8064","right to which such Indemnitee may be legally entitled."
"8065","      The limitations on liability and indemnification provisions"
"8066","of this Section 12 shall not be applicable to any losses,"
"8067","claims, damages, liabilities or expenses arising from the"
"8068","Investment Adviser's rights to the Fund's name.  The Investment"
"8069","Adviser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the"
"8070","Fund for any claims arising from the use of the Marks."
