"1021","Item 77C - Matters submitted to a vote of security holders:"
"1022","Columbia Core Bond Fund"
"1023","At a Joint Special Meeting of Shareholders held on February 15, 2011,"
"1024","shareholders of the Fund considered a proposal to approve an Agreement"
"1025","and Plan of Reorganization pursuant to which the Fund will transfer its"
"1026","assets to Columbia Bond Fund (the Buying Fund) in exchange for shares of"
"1027","the Buying Fund and the assumption by the Buying Fund of all of the"
"1028","liabilities of the Fund (the Reorganization).  The proposal was"
"1029","approved as follows:"

"1033","Item 77E - Legal Proceedings:"
"1034","Information Regarding Pending and"
"1035","Settled Legal Proceedings"
"1036","In June 2004, an action captioned John E. Gallus et al. v. American"
"1037","Express Financial Corp. and American Express Financial Advisors"
"1038","Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of"
"1039","Arizona. The plaintiffs allege that they are investors in several"
"1040","American Express Company mutual funds (branded as Columbia or"
"1041","RiverSource) and they purport to bring the action derivatively on"
"1042","behalf of those funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The"
"1043","plaintiffs allege that fees allegedly paid to the defendants by the funds"
"1044","for investment advisory and administrative services are excessive. The"
"1045","plaintiffs seek remedies including restitution and rescission of"
"1046","investment advisory and distribution agreements. The plaintiffs"
"1047","voluntarily agreed to transfer this case to the United States District"
"1048","Court for the District of Minnesota (the District Court). In response to"
"1049","defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint, the District Court"
"1050","dismissed one of plaintiffs' four claims and granted plaintiffs limited"
"1051","discovery. Defendants moved for summary judgment in April 2007."
"1052","Summary judgment was granted in the defendants' favor on July 9, 2007."
"1053","The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Eighth Circuit Court of"
"1054","Appeals (the Eighth Circuit) on August 8, 2007. On April 8, 2009, the"
"1055","Eighth Circuit reversed summary judgment and remanded to the District"
"1056","Court for further proceedings. On August 6, 2009, defendants filed a"
"1057","writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court (the Supreme Court),"
"1058","asking the Supreme Court to stay the District Court proceedings"
"1059","while the Supreme Court considers and rules in a case captioned"
"1060","Jones v. Harris Associates, which involves issues of law similar to those"
"1061","presented in the Gallus case. On March 30, 2010, the Supreme Court"
"1062","issued its ruling in Jones v. Harris Associates, and on April 5, 2010, the"
"1063","Supreme Court vacated the Eighth Circuit's decision in the Gallus case"
"1064","and remanded the case to the Eighth Circuit for further consideration in"
"1065","light of the Supreme Court's decision in Jones v. Harris Associates. On"
"1066","June 4, 2010, the Eighth Circuit remanded the Gallus case to the"
"1067","District Court for further consideration in light of the Supreme Court's"
"1068","decision in Jones v. Harris Associates. On December 9, 2010, the"
"1069","District Court reinstated its July 9, 2007 summary judgment order in"
"1070","favor of the defendants. On January 10, 2011 plaintiffs filed a notice"
"1071","of appeal with the Eighth Circuit. In response to the plaintiffs'"
"1072","opening appellate brief filed on March 18, 2011, the defendants filed"
"1073","a response brief on May 4, 2011 with the Eighth Circuit."
"1074","In December 2005, without admitting or denying the allegations,"
"1075","American Express Financial Corporation (AEFC, which is now"
"1076","known as Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (Ameriprise Financial)), entered"
"1077","into settlement agreements with the Securities and Exchange"
"1078","Commission (SEC) and Minnesota Department of Commerce"
"1079","(MDOC) related to market timing activities. As a result, AEFC was"
"1080","censured and ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing"
"1081","any violations of certain provisions of the Investment Advisers Act"
"1082","of 1940, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and various"
"1083","Minnesota laws. AEFC agreed to pay disgorgement of $10 million"
"1084","and civil money penalties of $7 million. AEFC also agreed to retain"
"1085","an independent distribution consultant to assist in developing a plan"
"1086","for distribution of all disgorgement and civil penalties ordered by the"
"1087","SEC in accordance with various undertakings detailed at"
"1088","http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/ia-2451.pdf. Ameriprise"
"1089","Financial and its affiliates have cooperated with the SEC and the"
"1090","MDOC in these legal proceedings, and have made regular reports to"
"1091","the RiverSource, Seligman and Threadneedle funds' Boards of"
"1092","Directors/Trustees."
"1093","Ameriprise Financial and certain of its affiliates have historically"
"1094","been involved in a number of legal, arbitration and regulatory"
"1095","proceedings, including routine litigation, class actions, and"
"1096","governmental actions, concerning matters arising in connection with"
"1097","the conduct of their business activities. Ameriprise Financial believes"
"1098","that the Funds are not currently the subject of, and that neither"
"1099","Ameriprise Financial nor any of its affiliates are the subject of, any"
"1100","pending legal, arbitration or regulatory proceedings that are likely to"
"1101","have a material adverse effect on the Funds or the ability of"
"1102","Ameriprise Financial or its affiliates to perform under their contracts"
"1103","with the Funds. Ameriprise Financial is required to make 10-Q, 10-K"
"1104","and, as necessary, 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange"
"1105","Commission on legal and regulatory matters that relate to Ameriprise"
"1106","Financial and its affiliates. Copies of these filings may be obtained"
"1107","by accessing the SEC website at www.sec.gov."
"1108","There can be no assurance that these matters, or the adverse publicity"
"1109","associated with them, will not result in increased fund redemptions,"
"1110","reduced sale of fund shares or other adverse consequences to the"
"1111","Funds. Further, although we believe proceedings are not likely to"
"1112","have a material adverse effect on the Funds or the ability of"
"1113","Ameriprise Financial or its affiliates to perform under their contracts"
"1114","with the Funds, these proceedings are subject to uncertainties and, as"
"1115","such, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that"
"1116","may result. An adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings"
"1117","could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or"
"1118","other relief that could have a material adverse effect on the"
"1119","consolidated financial condition or results of operations of"
"1120","Ameriprise Financial."
