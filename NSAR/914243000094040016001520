"3442","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"3443","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"3444","of Touchstone Funds Group Trust"
"3445","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"3446","statements of Touchstone Funds Group Trust (the Trust) as"
"3447","of and for the year ended September 30, 2016, in accordance"
"3448","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"3449","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust's"
"3450","internal control over financial reporting, including"
"3451","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"3452","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"3453","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"3454","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"3455","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"3456","the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"3457","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3458","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing"
"3459","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"3460","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"3461","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"3462","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"3463","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"3464","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"3465","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"3466","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"3467","with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's"
"3468","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"3469","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"3470","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"3471","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"3472","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"3473","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"3474","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"3475","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"3476","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"3477","accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"3478","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"3479","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"3480","acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets"
"3481","that could have a material effect on the financial"
"3482","statements."
"3483","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"3484","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"3485","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"3486","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"3487","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"3488","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"3489","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3490","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"3491","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"3492","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"3493","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3494","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"3495","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"3496","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"3497","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"3498","company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"3499","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3500","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over"
"3501","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"3502","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"3503","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"3504","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"3505","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"3506","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trust's internal"
"3507","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"3508","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"3509","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"3510","September 30, 2016."
"3511","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"3512","of management and the Board of Trustees of the Trust and"
"3513","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"3514","to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"3515","specified parties."

"3530","Change to Investment Policy"
"3531","Current Strategy"
"3532","The Fund will generally consider qualifying"
"3533","investments to be in companies that are organized"
"3534","under the laws of, or maintain their principal place"
"3535","of business in, an emerging market country; have"
"3536","securities that are principally traded in such"
"3537","countries; or derive at least 50% of revenues or"
"3538","profits from, or have at least 50% of their assets"
"3539","in, such countries."
"3540","The Fund's sub-advisor, Copper Rock Capital Partners"
"3541","LLC (Copper Rock), seeks to construct a portfolio"
"3542","that is diversified across sectors and industries."
"3543","Copper applies a blend of fundamental and"
"3544","quantitative analyses to generate initial investment"
"3545","ideas. Copper Rock's investment process seeks to add"
"3546","value through bottom-up stock selection and in-depth"
"3547","fundamental research. Copper Rock typically sells or"
"3548","reduces a position when the target price for a stock"
"3549","is attained, there is a change in the company's"
"3550","management team or business objectives, there is"
"3551","deterioration in a company's fundamentals."
"3552","Equity securities include common stocks and American"
"3553","Depositary Receipts (ADRs). The Fund generally"
"3554","expects to invest in a portfolio of approximately 80"
"3555","to 100 issuers."
"3556","Previous Strategy"
"3557","The Fund invests in securities of companies operating"
"3558","in a broad range of industries.  AGF invests in"
"3559","businesses that it believes are mispriced by the"
"3560","market and that are expected to generate positive and"
"3561","sustainable earnings growth. AGF believes that these"
"3562","companies should be able to achieve positive economic"
"3563","profits over time.  In assessing company valuations,"
"3564","AGF uses the Economic Value-Added (EVA) approach"
"3565","and considers factors such as cash flow return on"
"3566","investment, franchise value, competitive advantage,"
"3567","and investment profile."
"3568","In-depth, proprietary fundamental research conducted"
"3569","globally by AGF's team of portfolio managers and"
"3570","analysts is used to seek emerging market securities"
"3571","with sustainable earnings growth prospects that are"
"3572","not recognized by the market, and are priced at"
"3573","attractive valuations.  The Fund generally holds"
"3574","approximately 60 to 90 securities and attempts to"
"3575","broadly diversify its investments among securities"
"3576","and countries by limiting its exposure to a"
"3577","particular company or country.  The Fund's weight in"
"3578","any individual country is limited to 20% at the time"
"3579","of purchase.  The Fund may attempt to hedge against"
"3580","currency risks associated with its portfolio"
"3581","securities by using forward foreign currency exchange"
"3582","contracts."
"3583","AGF generally considers selling a security when it"
"3584","exceeds AGF's fair value estimate, when earnings"
"3585","forecasts do not appear to justify the current price,"
"3586","when there has been or there is an expectation of an"
"3587","adverse change in the company's fundamentals, or when"
"3588","other opportunities appear more attractive."
"3589","The Board of Trustees of the Touchtone Funds Group Trust (the"
"3590","Trust) approved changes in the investment policy of the"
"3591","Touchstone Emerging Markets Small Cap Fund (the Fund), a"
"3592","series of the Trust, as summarized below and as set forth in"
"3593","Post-Effective Amendment No. 80 to the Registration Statement as"
"3594","filed with the SEC via EDGAR on April 19, 2016 (Accession No."

"3603","Item 77e. - Legal Proceedings"
"3604","Touchstone Funds Group Trust - Mid Cap Value Fund"
"3605","In January 2012, the Old Mutual Mid-Cap Fund (which reorganized"
"3606","into the TS&W Mid-Cap Value Fund in March 2009, and was"
"3607","subsequently renamed the Touchstone Mid Cap Value Opportunities"
"3608","Fund in April 2012 and the Touchstone Mid Cap Value Fund in"
"3609","March 2014) was served with a summons and complaint in an action"
"3610","brought by Edward S. Weisfelner, as Trustee of the LB Creditor"
"3611","Trust, in the case captioned Weisfelner v. Fund 1(U.S. Bankr."
"3612","S.D.N.Y. Adv. Pro. No. 10-4609) (the Action). The Action"
"3613","alleges that, under state law, all payments made to shareholders"
"3614","in the December 2007 leveraged buyout of Lyondell Chemical"
"3615","Company were made, by means of intentional and constructive"
"3616","fraudulent transfer and seeks to recover all those payments. The"
"3617","amount sought to be disgorged is $3,784,800, which is what the"
"3618","Fund received in payments in connection with the leveraged"
"3619","buyout. The Fund (along with thousands of other defendants)"
"3620","filed a joinder to the motion to dismiss and the court heard"
"3621","oral argument on the motion to dismiss in January 2015.  In"
"3622","November 2015, the court dismissed the intentional fraudulent"
"3623","transfer claims and in July 2016, the court dismissed the"
"3624","remaining constructive fraudulent transfer claims. The plaintiff"
"3625","appealed the part of the motion to dismiss that was granted in"
"3626","November 2015, and on July 27, 2016, the District Court reversed"
"3627","the Bankruptcy Court's dismissal order.  As a result, part of"
"3628","the claims against the defendants (including the Fund) have been"
"3629","reinstated.  The path the litigation will follow is uncertain at"
"3630","this time, including whether the parties will appeal the"
"3631","District Court's and Bankruptcy Court's rulings on the motion to"
"3632","dismiss. At this nascent stage of the litigation, it is not"
"3633","possible to assess the likely outcome. The Fund is currently"
"3634","assessing the case and has not yet determined the potential"
"3635","effect, if any, on its net asset value."

"3805","(iii)The Sub-Advisor shall notify the Trust's Chief Compliance"

"3810","guideline or procedure that the Advisor has provided to the"

"3817","under this Agreement. The Sub-Advisor acknowledges and"
"3818","agrees that the Advisor may, in its discretion, provide"
"3819","such quarterly compliance certifications to the Board.  The"
"3820","Sub-Advisor agrees to correct any such failure promptly and"

"3829","action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, at law"
"3830","or in equity, before or by any court, public board, or"
"3831","body, involving the affairs of the Trust (excluding class"
"3832","action suits in which a Fund is a member of the plaintiff"
"3833","class by reason of the Fund's ownership of shares in the"

"3835","federal or state securities laws or (ii) the controlling"
"3836","stockholder of the Sub-Advisor changes or an actual change"
"3837","in control resulting in an assignment (as defined in the"
"3838","1940 Act) has occurred or is otherwise proposed to occur."
"3839","(iv)The Sub-Advisor shall maintain separate books and detailed"
"3840","records of all matters pertaining to the Fund's assets"
"3841","advised by the Sub-Advisor required by Rule 31a-1 under the"
"3842","1940 Act (other than those records being maintained by the"
"3843","Advisor, custodian or transfer agent appointed by the Fund)"
"3844","relating to its responsibilities provided hereunder with"

"3846","the periods and in a manner prescribed therefore by Rule"
"3847","31a-2 under the 1940 Act (the Fund Books and Records )."
"3848","The Fund Books and Records shall be available to the"
"3849","Advisor and the Board at any time upon request shall be"
"3850","delivered to the Trust upon the termination of this"
"3851","Agreement and shall be available for telecopying without"
"3852","delay during any day the Fund is open for business."
"3853","d.The Sub-Advisor shall provide support to the Advisor with"
"3854","respect to the marketing of the Fund, including but not"
"3855","limited to:  (i) permission to use the Sub-Advisor's name"
"3856","as provided in Section 5, (ii) permission to use the past"
"3857","performance and investment history of the Sub-Advisor with"
"3858","respect to a composite of other funds managed by the Sub-"
"3859","Advisor that are comparable, in investment objective and"
"3860","composition, to the Fund, (iii) access to the individual(s)"
"3861","responsible for day-to-day management of the Fund for"
"3862","marketing conferences, teleconferences and other activities"
"3863","involving the promotion of the Fund, subject to the"
"3864","reasonable request of the Advisor, (iv) permission to use"
"3865","biographical and historical data of the Sub-Advisor and"
"3866","individual manager(s), and (v) permission to use the names"
"3867","of those clients pre-approved by the Sub-Advisor to which"
"3868","the Sub-Advisor provides investment management services,"
"3869","subject to receipt of the consent of such clients to the"
"3870","use of their names."
"3871","e.The Sub-Advisor will, in the name of the Fund, place orders"
"3872","for the execution of all portfolio transactions in"
"3873","accordance with the policies with respect thereto set forth"
"3874","in the Trust's registration statements under the 1940 Act"
"3875","and the Securities Act of 1933, as such registration"
"3876","statements may be in effect from time to time.  When"
"3877","placing orders with brokers and dealers, the Sub-Advisor's"
"3878","primary objective shall be to obtain the most favorable"
"3879","price and execution available for the Fund, and in placing"
"3880","such orders the Sub-Advisor may consider a number of"
"3881","factors, including, without limitation, the overall direct"
"3882","net economic result to the Fund (including commissions,"
"3883","which may not be the lowest available but ordinarily should"
"3884","not be higher than the generally prevailing competitive"
"3885","range), the financial strength and stability of the broker,"
"3886","the efficiency with which the transaction will be effected,"
"3887","the ability to effect the transaction at all where a large"
"3888","block is involved and the availability of the broker or"
"3889","dealer to stand ready to execute possibly difficult"
"3890","transactions in the future.  Consistent with the Conduct"
"3891","Rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority"
"3892","(FINRA), and subject to seeking most favorable price and"
"3893","execution and compliance with Rule 12b-1(h) under the 1940"
"3894","Act, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers and dealers to"
"3895","execute portfolio transactions of the Fund that promote or"
"3896","sell shares of the Fund.  The Sub-Advisor is specifically"
"3897","authorized, to the extent authorized by law (including,"
"3898","without limitation, Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act,  to pay"
"3899","a broker or dealer who provides research services to the"
"3900","Sub-Advisor an amount of commission for effecting a"
"3901","portfolio transaction in excess of the amount of commission"
"3902","another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting"
"3903","such transaction, in recognition of such additional"
"3904","research services rendered by the broker or dealer, but"
"3905","only if the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that the"
"3906","excess commission is reasonable in relation to the value of"
"3907","the brokerage and research services provided by such broker"
"3908","or dealer viewed in terms of the particular transaction or"
"3909","the Sub-Advisor's overall responsibilities with respect to"
"3910","discretionary accounts that it manages, and that the Fund"
"3911","derives or will derive a reasonable benefit from such"
"3912","research services.  The Sub-Advisor will present a written"
"3913","report to the Board of Trustees of the Trust, at least"
"3914","quarterly, indicating total brokerage expenses, actual or"
"3915","imputed, as well as the services obtained in consideration"
"3916","for such expenses, broken down by broker-dealer and"
"3917","containing such information as the Board of Trustees"
"3918","reasonably shall request."
"3919","f.The Sub-Adviser shall maintain errors and omissions insurance"
"3920","coverage in an appropriate amount and shall provide prior"
"3921","written notice to the Trust (i) of any material changes in"
"3922","its insurance policies or insurance coverage; or (ii) if"
"3923","any material claims will be made on its insurance policies."
"3924","Furthermore, the Sub-Advisor shall, upon reasonable"
"3925","request, provide the Trust with any information it may"
"3926","reasonably require concerning the amount of or scope of"
"3927","such insurance."
"3928","g.In the event of any reorganization or other change in the Sub-"
"3929","Advisor, its investment principals, supervisors or members"
"3930","of its investment (or comparable) committee, the Sub-"
"3931","Advisor shall give the Advisor and the Trust's Board of"
"3932","Trustees written notice of such reorganization or change"
"3933","within a reasonable time (but not later than 30 days) after"
"3934","such reorganization or change."
"3935","h.The Sub-Advisor will bear its expenses of providing services"
"3936","to the Fund pursuant to this Agreement except such expenses"
"3937","as are expressly undertaken by the Advisor or the Trust."
"3938","3.Compensation of the Sub-Advisor."
"3939","a.As compensation for the services to be rendered and duties"
"3940","undertaken hereunder by the Sub-Advisor, the Advisor will"
"3941","pay to the Sub-Advisor a monthly fee equal on an annual"
"3942","basis to XXX% of the average daily net assets of the Fund,"
"3943","without regard to any total expense limitation of the Trust"
"3944","or the Advisor.  Such fee shall be computed and accrued"
"3945","daily.  If the Sub-Advisor serves in such capacity for less"
"3946","than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3a,"
"3947","the compensation to the Sub-Advisor shall be prorated.  For"
"3948","purposes of calculating the Sub-Advisor's fee, the daily"
"3949","value of the Fund Assets shall be computed by the same"
"3950","method as the Trust uses to compute the net asset value of"
"3951","the Fund for purposes of purchases and redemptions of"
"3952","shares thereof."
"3953","b.The Sub-Advisor reserves the right to waive all or a part of"
"3954","its fees hereunder."
"3955","4.Activities of the Sub-Advisor.  The Sub-Advisor will report to"
"3956","the Board of Trustees of the Trust (at regular quarterly"
"3957","meetings and at such other times as such Board of Trustees"
"3958","reasonably shall request, subject to the limitation on personal"
"3959","attendance at such meetings set forth in Section 2a) (i) the"
"3960","financial condition and prospects of the Sub-Advisor, (ii) the"
"3961","nature and amount of transactions affecting the Fund that"
"3962","involve the Sub-Advisor and affiliates of the Sub-Advisor, (iii)"
"3963","information regarding any potential conflicts of interest"
"3964","arising by reason of its continuing provision of advisory"
"3965","services to the Fund and to its other accounts, and (iv) such"
"3966","other information as the Board of Trustees shall reasonably"
"3967","request regarding the Fund, the Fund's performance, the services"
"3968","provided by the Sub-Advisor and affiliates of the Sub-Advisor to"
"3969","the Fund as compared to its other accounts and the plans of, and"
"3970","the capability of, the Sub-Advisor with respect to providing"
"3971","future services to the Fund and its other accounts. The Sub-"
"3972","Advisor agrees to submit to the Trust a statement defining its"
"3973","policies with respect to the allocation of business among the"
"3974","Fund and its other clients."
"3975","The Sub-Advisor has supplied to the Advisor and the Trust copies"
"3976","of its Form ADV with all exhibits and attachments thereto"
"3977","(including the Sub-Advisor's statement of financial condition)"
"3978","and will hereafter supply to the Advisor, promptly upon the"
"3979","preparation thereof, copies of all amendments or restatements of"
"3980","such document."
"3981","5.Use of Names.  Neither the Advisor nor the Trust shall use the"
"3982","name of the Sub-Advisor in any prospectus, sales literature or"
"3983","other material relating to the Advisor or the Trust in any"
"3984","manner not approved in advance by the Sub-Advisor; provided,"
"3985","however, that the Sub-Advisor will approve all uses of its name"
"3986","which merely refer in accurate terms to its appointment"
"3987","hereunder or which are required by the SEC or a state securities"
"3988","commission; and provided further, that in no event shall such"
"3989","approval be unreasonably withheld.  The Sub-Advisor shall not"
"3990","use the name of the Advisor or the Trust in any material"
"3991","relating to the Sub-Advisor in any manner not approved in"
"3992","advance by the Advisor or the Trust, as the case may be;"
"3993","provided, however, that the Advisor and the Trust shall each"
"3994","approve all uses of their respective names which merely refer in"
"3995","accurate terms to the appointment of the Sub-Advisor hereunder"
"3996","or which are required by the SEC or a state securities"
"3997","commission; and, provided further, that in no event shall such"
"3998","approval be unreasonably withheld."

"4005","(including reasonable legal and other expenses) by reason of or"
"4006","arising out of: (a) the Sub-Advisor being in material violation"
"4007","of any applicable federal or state law, rule or regulation or"
"4008","any investment policy or restriction set forth in the Fund's"
"4009","prospectus and Statement of Additional Information or any"
"4010","written direction or instruction provided in writing by the"
