"567"," Public Accounting Firm"
"568","To the Shareholders and"
"569"," Board of Directors of"
"570","Federated Investment Series"
"571","Funds, Inc.:"
"572","In planning and performing"
"573"," our audit of the financial"
"574","statements of Federated Bond"
"575"," Fund (the"
"576","sole portfolio comprising"
"577"," Federated Investment Series"
"578"," Funds, Inc.) (the Fund)"
"579","as of and for the"
"580","year ended November 30, 2009,"
"581"," in accordance with the"
"582","standards of the Public Company"
"583","Accounting Oversight Board"
"584"," (United States), we"
"585","considered the Fund's"
"586"," internal control over"
"587","financial reporting,"
"588","including controls over"
"589"," safeguarding securities,"
"590"," as a basis for designing our"
"591","auditing procedures for"
"592"," the purpose of expressing"
"593"," our opinion on the"
"594","financial statements and to"
"595","comply with the requirements"
"596"," of Form N-SAR, but not"
"597","for the purpose of"
"598"," expressing an opinion"
"599","on the effectiveness of"
"600","the Fund's internal control"
"601"," over financial reporting."
"602"," Accordingly, we"
"603","express no such opinion."
"604","The management of the Fund"
"605"," is responsible for"
"606","establishing and maintaining"
"607"," effective internal"
"608","control over financial"
"609"," reporting.  In fulfilling"
"610"," this responsibility,"
"611"," estimates and judgments by"
"612","management are required"
"613","to assess the expected"
"614"," benefits and related costs"
"615"," of controls. A"
"616","company's internal control"
"617"," over financial reporting"
"618"," is a process designed to"
"619"," provide reasonable"
"620","assurance regarding the"
"621","reliability of financial"
"622","reporting and the"
"623"," preparation of financial"
"624","statements for external"
"625"," purposes in accordance"
"626","with generally accepted"
"627","accounting principles.  A"
"628","company's internal"
"629","control over financial"
"630","reporting includes those"
"631"," policies and procedures"
"632","that (1)"
"633","pertain to the maintenance"
"634"," of records that, in"
"635","reasonable detail,"
"636","accurately and fairly"
"637","reflect the"
"638","transactions and"
"639","dispositions of the assets"
"640"," of the company; (2)"
"641","provide reasonable assurance that"
"642","transactions are recorded"
"643","as necessary to permit"
"644"," preparation of financial"
"645"," statements in accordance"
"646","with generally accepted"
"647"," accounting principles,"
"648","and that receipts and"
"649","expenditures of the company"
"650","are being made only in"
"651","accordance with"
"652","authorizations of management"
"653"," and directors of the"
"654","company; and (3) provide"
"655","reasonable assurance"
"656","regarding prevention or"
"657"," timely detection of"
"658","unauthorized acquisition,"
"659"," use or disposition of a"
"660"," company's assets that"
"661","could have a material"
"662","effect on the financial"
"663"," statements."
"664","Because of its inherent"
"665","limitations, internal"
"666"," control over financial"
"667","reporting may not prevent or"
"668","detect misstatements. Also,"
"669","projections of any evaluation"
"670"," of effectiveness to"
"671","future periods are"
"672","subject to the risk that"
"673","controls may become"
"674","inadequate because of"
"675","changes in conditions,"
"676"," or that"
"677","the degree of compliance"
"678"," with the policies or"
"679","procedures may deteriorate."
"680","A deficiency in internal"
"681"," control over financial"
"682","reporting exists when"
"683","the design or operation"
"684"," of a"
"685","control does not allow"
"686"," management or employees,"
"687"," in the normal course of"
"688","performing their"
"689","assigned functions, to"
"690"," prevent or detect"
"691","misstatements on a timely"
"692","basis.  A material weakness"
"693","is a"
"694","deficiency, or a"
"695","combination of deficiencies,"
"696"," in internal control over"
"697"," financial reporting, such"
"698"," that"
"699","there is a reasonable"
"700","possibility that a material"
"701"," misstatement of the"
"702","company's annual or interim"
"703","financial statements will"
"704"," not be prevented or"
"705"," detected on a timely basis."
"706","Our consideration of the"
"707"," Fund's internal control"
"708","over financial reporting"
"709","was for the limited"
"710","purpose described in the"
"711","first paragraph and would"
"712"," not necessarily disclose"
"713","all deficiencies in"
"714","internal control that might"
"715"," be material weaknesses"
"716"," under standards established"
"717"," by the Public"
"718","Company Accounting Oversight"
"719"," Board (United States)."
"720","However, we noted no"
"721","deficiencies in"
"722","the Fund's internal control"
"723"," over financial reporting"
"724"," and its operation, including"
"725"," controls over"
"726","safeguarding securities,"
"727","that we consider to be a"
"728","material weakness as"
"729","defined above as of"
"730","November 30, 2009."
"731","This report is intended"
"732","solely for the information"
"733"," and use of management"
"734","and the Board of"
"735","Directors of the Fund and"

"752","Exhibit 77E"
"753","LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"754","Since October 2003,"
"755"," Federated and related"
"756","entities (collectively,"
"757","Federated), and various"
"758"," Federated funds (Funds),"
"759"," have been named as"
"760","defendants in several class"
"761"," action lawsuits now pending"
"762","in the United States District"
"763","Court for the District of"
"764"," Maryland. The lawsuits were"
"765","purportedly filed on behalf"
"766","of people who purchased,"
"767","owned and/or redeemed shares"
"768"," of Federated-sponsored"
"769","mutual funds during"
"770"," specified periods"
"771","beginning November 1, 1998."
"772","The suits are generally"
"773","similar in alleging that"
"774","Federated engaged in illegal"
"775"," and improper trading"
"776","practices including"
"777","market timing and late trading"
"778","in concert with certain"
"779"," institutional traders,"
"780"," which allegedly caused"
"781"," financial injury to the"
"782"," mutual fund shareholders."
"783","These lawsuits began to be"
"784","filed shortly after"
"785"," Federated's first public"
"786","announcement that it had"
"787"," received requests for"
"788"," information on shareholder"
"789","trading activities in"
"790"," the Funds from the SEC,"
"791"," the Office of the New"
"792","York State Attorney"
"793","General (NYAG), and"
"794","other authorities. In"
"795","that regard,"
"796","on November 28, 2005,"
"797","Federated announced that"
"798","it had reached final"
"799","settlements with the SEC"
"800","and the NYAG with respect"
"801"," to those matters."
"802","Specifically, the SEC"
"803","and NYAG settled proceedings"
"804"," against three Federated"
"805","subsidiaries involving"
"806"," undisclosed market timing"
"807"," arrangements and late"
"808","trading. The SEC made"
"809"," findings: that Federated"
"810","Investment Management"
"811","Company (FIMC), an"
"812","SEC-registered investment"
"813"," adviser to various Funds,"
"814","and Federated Securities"
"815","Corp., an SEC-registered"
"816"," broker-dealer and distributor"
"817"," for the Funds, violated"
"818","provisions of the Investment"
"819"," Advisers Act"
"820","and Investment Company Act"
"821"," by approving, but not"
"822"," disclosing, three market"
"823"," timing arrangements, or"
"824"," the associated conflict"
"825"," of interest between"
"826","FIMC and the funds involved"
"827","in the arrangements, either"
"828","to other fund shareholders or"
"829"," to the funds' board; and that"
"830"," Federated Shareholder"
"831","Services Company, formerly"
"832","an SEC-registered transfer"
"833","agent, failed to prevent a"
"834","customer and a Federated"
"835","employee from late trading"
"836","in violation"
"837","of provisions of the Investment"
"838"," Company Act. The NYAG found"
"839"," that such conduct violated"
"840","provisions of New York State"
"841"," law. Federated entered"
"842","into the settlements without"
"843"," admitting or denying the"
"844","regulators' findings. As"
"845"," Federated previously"
"846","reported in 2004, it has"
"847","already paid"
"848","approximately $8.0 million"
"849","to certain funds as"
"850"," determined by an independent"
"851"," consultant. As part of"
"852","these settlements, Federated"
"853","agreed to pay"
"854","disgorgement and a civil"
"855","money penalty in the aggregate"
"856"," amount of an additional"
"857","$72 million and, among other"
"858"," things, agreed that it would"
"859"," not"
"860","serve as investment adviser"
"861"," to any registered investment"
"862","company unless (i) at least"
"863"," 75% of the fund's directors"
"864","are independent of Federated,"
"865","(ii) the chairman of each such"

"867","Federated, (iii) no action"

"870","unless approved by a majority"
"871"," of the independent trustees"

"879","the fund with applicable laws"
"880"," and fiduciary duties and for"
"881","managing the process by which"
"882"," management fees charged to"
"883","a fund are approved. The"
"884","settlements are described"
"885","in Federated's announcement"
"886","which, along with previous"
"887","press releases and related"
"888","communications on those matters,"
"889","is available in the About Us"
"890","section of Federated's"
"891","website at FederatedInvestors.com."
"892","Federated entities have also"
"893"," been named as defendants in"
"894"," several additional lawsuits"
"895"," that are now pending in the"
"896"," United States District Court for"
"897","the Western District of Pennsylvania,"
"898"," alleging, among other things,"
"899","excessive advisory and Rule 12b-1 fees."
"900","The Board of the Funds retained"
"901","the law firm of Dickstein Shapiro"
"902","LLP to represent the Funds in each"
"903"," of the lawsuits described in the"
"904","preceding two paragraphs. Federated"
"905","and the Funds, and their respective"
"906"," counsel, have been defending this"
"907"," litigation, and none of the Funds"
"908","remains a defendant in any of the"
"909","lawsuits (though some could"
"910","potentially receive any recoveries"
"911","as nominal defendants). Additional"
"912"," lawsuits based"
"913","upon similar allegations may be"
"914"," filed in the future. The potential"
"915"," impact of these lawsuits, all of"
"916"," which seek unquantified damages,"
"917","attorneys' fees,"
"918","and expenses, and future potential"
"919","similar suits is uncertain."
"920","Although we do not believe that"
"921"," these lawsuits will have a"
"922"," material adverse effect on"
"923","the Funds, there can be no"
"924","assurance that these suits,"
"925","ongoing adverse publicity and/or"
"926","other developments resulting"
"927","from the regulatory"
"928","investigations will not result"
"929"," in increased Fund redemptions,"
"930"," reduced sales of Fund shares,"
"931","or other adverse consequences"
"932","for the Funds."
