"1983","Capital Growth Fund, Touchstone International Small Cap"
"1984","Fund, Touchstone Mid Cap Value Opportunities Fund,"
"1985","Touchstone Small Cap Value Opportunities Fund, Touchstone"
"1986","U.S. Long/Short Fund, and Touchstone Value Fund:"
"1987","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1988","statements of Touchstone Capital Growth Fund, Touchstone"
"1989","International Small Cap Fund, Touchstone Mid Cap Value"
"1990","Opportunities Fund, Touchstone Small Cap Value Opportunities"
"1991","Fund, Touchstone U.S. Long/Short Fund, and Touchstone Value"
"1992","Fund (six portfolios comprising Touchstone Strategic Trust,"
"1993","hereafter referred to as the Funds) as of and for the"
"1994","three-month period ended June 30, 2012, in accordance with"
"1995","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1996","Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"1997","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1998","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1999","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"2000","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"2001","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2002","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"2003","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"2004","do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"2005","internal control over financial reporting."
"2006","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"2007","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"2008","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"2009","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"2010","benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal"
"2011","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"2012","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"2013","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"2014","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"2015","generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal"
"2016","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"2017","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"2018","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"2019","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"2020","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"2021","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"2022","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2023","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"2024","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"2025","management and trustees of the funds; and (3)  provide"
"2026","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"2027","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of"
"2028","a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"2029","financial statements."
"2030","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2031","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2032","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"2033","future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"2034","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"2035","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"2036","deteriorate."
"2037","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"2038","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"2039","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"2040","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2041","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"2042","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2043","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"2044","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2045","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"2046","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2047","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"2048","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"2049","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"2050","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting"
"2051","that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"2052","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"2053","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"2054","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"2055","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities"
"2056","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above"
"2057","as of June 30, 2012."

the Fund Assets (as defined below) of an Acquired Fund will be
transferred to the corresponding Acquiring Fund in exchange
for the corresponding class of the Acquiring Fund as set forth

and the assumption by the corresponding Acquiring Fund of all
of the Acquired Fund's Liabilities (as defined below), and (2)
Corresponding Class shares of the corresponding Acquiring Fund
of equal value to the net assets of the Acquired Fund being
acquired will be distributed to holders of shares of the

AGREEMENT:
      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises,
representations, and warranties made herein, covenants and
agreements hereinafter contained, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are acknowledged, the Parties, and Old Mutual Capital and
Touchstone to the extent indicated above, intending to be
legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

ARTICLE I
THE REORGANIZATION
      1.1	The Reorganization.  In accordance with the
Agreement and Declaration of Trust and the Amended and
Restated By-laws, as they may be amended from time to time, of
the Acquired Trust (the Old Mutual Governing Documents), at
the Effective Time (as defined below), upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and on the basis
of the representations and warranties contained herein, the
Acquired Fund shall assign, deliver and otherwise transfer all
Fund Assets, subject to all of the liabilities of the Acquired
Fund (the Liabilities), to the Acquiring Fund, and the
Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the Liabilities of the
Acquired Fund.  In consideration of the foregoing, the
Acquiring Fund, at the Effective Time shall deliver to the
Acquired Fund full and fractional (to the third decimal place)
shares of the Acquiring Fund.  The aggregate number of shares
of the Acquiring Fund shall be determined as set forth in
paragraph 2.3 by dividing (a) the value of the Fund Assets
attributable to the Acquired Fund, net of the Acquired Fund's
Liabilities (computed as of the Valuation Time (as defined
below) in the manner set forth in paragraph 2.1), by (b) the
net asset value of one share of the corresponding class of the
Acquiring Fund shares (computed as of the Valuation Time in
the manner set forth in paragraph 2.2).  Holders of each class
of shares of the Acquired Fund will receive shares of the
Corresponding Class, as set forth in Section E of the Recitals
and Exhibit A to this Agreement, of the Acquiring Fund, as set
forth in Section A of the Recitals. At and after the Effective
Time, all of the Fund Assets of the Acquired Fund shall become
and be included in the Fund Assets of the Acquiring Fund and
the Liabilities of the Acquired Fund shall become and be the
Liabilities of and shall attach to the Acquiring Fund.  At and
after the Effective Time, the Liabilities of the Acquired Fund
may be enforced only against the Acquiring Fund to the same
extent as if such Liabilities had been incurred by the
Acquiring Fund subject to any defense and/or set off that the
Acquired Fund was entitled to assert immediately prior to the
Effective Time and further subject to any defense and/or
setoff that the Acquiring Trust or the Acquiring Fund may from
time to time be entitled to assert.
      1.2	The Acquired Fund Assets.
            (a)	At least ten Business Days prior to the
Valuation Time, the Acquired Fund will provide the
Acquiring Fund with a schedule of the securities and
other assets and Liabilities of the Acquired Fund.
Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Acquiring
Fund has provided the Acquired Fund with a copy of its
current investment objective, investment policies,
principal investment strategies, and restrictions and
will provide the Acquired Fund with a written notice of
any changes thereto through the Valuation Time.  The
Acquired Fund reserves the right to sell any of the
securities or other assets shown on the schedule it
provides to the Acquiring Fund pursuant to this
paragraph 1.2(a) in the ordinary course as necessary to
meet distribution and redemption requirements prior to
the Valuation Time but will not, without the prior
approval of the Acquiring Fund, acquire any additional
securities other than securities which the Acquiring
Fund may purchase in accordance with its stated
investment objective and policies.
            (b)	At least five Business Days prior to the
Valuation Time, the Acquiring Fund will advise the
Acquired Fund of any investments of the Acquired Fund
shown on the Acquired Fund's schedule provided pursuant
to paragraph 1.2(a) which the Acquiring Fund would not
be permitted to hold (i) under its investment objective,
principal investment strategies or investment
restrictions; (ii) under applicable Law; or (iii)
because the transfer of such investments would result in
material operational or administrative difficulties to
the Acquiring Fund in connection with facilitating the
orderly transition of the Acquired Fund's Fund Assets.
Under such circumstances, to the extent practicable, the
Acquired Fund will, if requested by the Acquiring Fund
and, to the extent permissible and consistent with its
own investment objectives and policies and the fiduciary
duties of the investment adviser or sub-adviser
responsible for the portfolio management of the Acquired
Fund, dispose of such investments prior to the Valuation
Time.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein
will require the Acquired Fund to dispose of any
portfolio securities or other investments of the
Acquired Fund, if, in the reasonable judgment of the Old
Mutual Board or the Acquired Fund's investment adviser
or sub-adviser, such disposition would adversely affect
the tax-free nature of the Reorganization for federal
income tax purposes or would otherwise not be in the
best interests of the Acquired Fund and its
shareholders.
      1.3	Assumption of Liabilities.  The Acquired Fund will,
to the extent permissible and consistent with its own
investment objectives and policies, use its best efforts to
discharge all of the Liabilities of the Acquired Fund prior to
or at the Effective Time.  The Acquiring Fund will assume all
of the Liabilities of the Acquired Fund.
      1.4	Distribution of Acquiring Fund Shares.  Immediately
upon receipt, the Acquired Fund will distribute the
Corresponding Class shares of the Acquiring Fund received by
the Acquired Fund from the Acquiring Fund pursuant to
paragraph 1.1  pro rata to the record holders of shares of the
Acquired Fund.  Such distribution will be accomplished by
transferring the Acquiring Fund Shares then credited to the
Acquired Fund's account on the Books and Records of the
Acquiring Fund to open accounts on the Books and Records of
the Acquiring Fund established and maintained by the Acquiring
Fund's transfer agent in the names of record holders of the
Acquired Fund and representing the respective pro rata number
of the Acquiring Fund Shares due to such record holder.  All
issued and outstanding shares of the Acquired Fund will,
without further notice, be cancelled promptly by the Acquired
Fund on the Acquired Fund's Books and Records.  Any such
shares issued and outstanding prior to such cancellation shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Acquiring
Fund Shares issued to the Acquired Fund in accordance with
paragraph 1.1 above.  In addition, each record holder of the
Acquired Fund shall have the right to receive any unpaid
dividends or other distributions which were declared with
respect to his/her or its shares of the Acquired Fund at or
before the Valuation Time.
      1.5	Liquidation of the Acquired Fund.  As soon as
conveniently practicable after the distribution of the
Acquiring Fund Shares pursuant to paragraph 1.4 has been made,
the Acquired Fund shall take, in accordance with Delaware law,
the 1940 Act and the Old Mutual Governing Documents, all such
other steps as may be necessary or appropriate to effect a
complete liquidation and termination of the Acquired Fund.
      1.6	Transfer Taxes.  Any transfer taxes payable on
issuance of the Acquiring Fund Shares in a name other than
that of the record holder of the Acquired Fund shares on the
Acquired Fund's Books and Records shall be paid by the Person
to whom such Acquiring Fund Shares are issued and transferred,
as a condition of that transfer.
ARTICLE II

VALUATION
      2.1	Net Asset Value of the Acquired Fund.  The net asset
value of a share of each class of the Acquired Fund shall be
the net asset value computed as of the Valuation Time, after
the declaration and payment of any dividends and/or other
distributions on the date thereof, using the valuation
procedures described in the then-current prospectus and
statement of additional information of the Acquired Fund as
supplemented from time to time, or such other valuation
procedures as shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties.
      2.2	Net Asset Value of the Acquiring Fund.  The net
asset value per share of each Corresponding Class of the
Acquiring Fund shall be the net asset value per share of the
Corresponding Class of the Acquired Fund as of the Valuation
Time.  The net asset value of the Acquiring Fund and the
Acquired Fund will be determined by using the valuation
procedures described in the then-current prospectus and
statement of additional information of the Acquired Fund as
supplemented from time to time, or such other valuation
procedures as shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties.
      2.3	Calculation of Number of Acquiring Fund Shares.  The
number of Acquiring Fund Shares to be issued (including
fractional shares (to the third decimal place), if any) in
connection with the Reorganization shall be the number of
outstanding Acquired Fund Shares as of the Valuation Time.
      2.4	Determination of Net Asset Value.  All computations
of net asset value and the value of securities transferred
under this Article II shall be made by BNY Mellon Investment
Servicing (U.S.) Inc. (BNY Mellon), sub-administrator for
the Acquired Fund, in accordance with its regular practice and
the requirements of the 1940 Act.
      2.5	Valuation Time.  Valuation Time shall mean 4:00 PM
Eastern Time of the Business Day preceding the Effective Time.

ARTICLE III
EFFECTIVE TIME AND CLOSING
      3.1	Effective Time and Closing.  Subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, the Reorganization shall
occur immediately prior to the opening of business on April
16, 2012, or on such other date as may be mutually agreed in
writing by an authorized officer of each Party (the Effective"
"2130","Time).  To the extent any Fund Assets are, for any reason,
not transferred at the Effective Time, the Acquired Fund shall
cause such Fund Assets to be transferred in accordance with
this Agreement at the earliest practical date thereafter.  The
closing of the Reorganization shall be held in person, by
facsimile, by e-mail or by such other communication means as
may be mutually agreed by the Parties, at the Effective Time
(the Closing).
      3.2	Transfer and Delivery of Fund Assets.  The Acquired
Fund shall direct The Bank of New York Mellon (Acquired Fund"
"2131","Custodian), as custodian for the Acquired Fund, to deliver to
the Acquiring Fund at  the Closing, or promptly thereafter,
consistent with commercially reasonable standards, a
certificate of an authorized officer certifying that: (a)
Acquired Fund Custodian delivered the Fund Assets of the
Acquired Fund to the Acquiring Fund at the Effective Time; and
(b) all necessary taxes in connection with the delivery of
such Fund Assets, including all applicable foreign, federal
and state stock transfer stamps and any other stamp duty
taxes, if any, have been paid or provision (as reasonably
estimated) for payment has been made.
      3.3	Acquiring Fund Share Records. The Acquiring Fund
shall deliver to an officer of the Acquired Trust at the
Closing a confirmation evidencing that:  (a) the appropriate
number of Acquiring Fund Shares have been credited to the
account of the Acquired Fund on the Books and Records of the
Acquired Fund pursuant to paragraph 1.1 prior to the actions
contemplated by paragraph 1.4, and (b) the appropriate number
of Acquiring Fund Shares have been credited to the accounts of
record holders of the Acquired Fund shares on the Books and
Records of the Acquiring Fund pursuant to paragraph 1.4.
      3.4	Postponement of Valuation Time and Effective Time.
If immediately prior to the Valuation Time:  (a) the NYSE or
another primary trading market for portfolio securities of the
Acquiring Fund or the Acquired Fund is closed to trading, or
trading thereupon is restricted, or (b) trading or the
reporting of trading on such market is disrupted so that, in
the judgment of an appropriate officer of the Acquired Fund or
the Acquiring Fund, accurate appraisal of the value of the net
assets of the Acquiring Fund or the Acquired Fund is
impracticable, the Valuation Time and Effective Time shall be
postponed until the first Business Day that is a Friday after
the day when trading shall have been fully resumed and
reporting shall have been restored or such later date as may
be mutually agreed in writing by an authorized officer of each
Party.

ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
      4.1	Representations and Warranties of the Acquired
Trust.  The Acquired Trust, on behalf of the Acquired Fund,
hereby represents and warrants to the Acquiring Trust, on
behalf of the Acquiring Fund, as follows, which
representations and warranties shall be true and correct on
the date hereof and agrees to confirm the continuing accuracy
and completeness of the following at the Effective Time:
            (a)	The Acquired Trust is a statutory trust
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the State of Delaware and is duly
qualified, licensed or admitted to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign association under the Laws of
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification, licensing or
admission necessary, except in such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified, licensed or admitted and
in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on its
properties or assets or the properties or assets of the
Acquired Fund.  The Acquired Fund has full power under
the Old Mutual Governing Documents to conduct its
business as it is now being conducted and to own the
properties and assets it now owns.  The Acquired Fund
has all necessary authorizations, licenses and approvals
from any applicable Governmental or Regulatory Body
necessary to carry on its business as such business is
now being carried on except authorizations, licenses and
approvals that the failure to so obtain would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Fund.
            (b)	The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Acquired Fund and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated herein will have been
duly and validly authorized by the Old Mutual Board, and
the Old Mutual Board has approved the Reorganization and
has resolved to recommend the Reorganization to the
shareholders of the Acquired Fund and to call a meeting
of shareholders of the Acquired Fund for the purpose of
approving this Agreement and the Reorganization
contemplated hereby.  Other than the approval by the
requisite vote of the shareholders of the outstanding
shares of the Acquired Fund in accordance with the
provisions of the Old Mutual Governing Documents,
applicable Delaware Law and the 1940 Act, no other
action on the part of the Acquired Fund or its
shareholders is necessary to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Acquired Fund or the consummation of the Reorganization
contemplated herein.  This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Acquired Trust on
behalf of the Acquired Fund and assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the
Acquiring Trust on behalf of the Acquiring Fund, is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Acquired
Trust, as it relates to the Acquired Fund, enforceable
in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights,
to general equity principles and to any limitations on
indemnity as may be required under federal and state
securities Laws).
            (c)	The authorized capital of the Acquired
Fund consists of an unlimited number of shares of
beneficial interest with a par value of $0.001 per
share.  Each share represents a fractional undivided

Trust.  The Acquiring Trust, on behalf of the Acquiring Fund,
hereby represents and warrants to the Acquired Fund as
follows, which representations and warranties shall be true
and correct on the date hereof and agrees to confirm the
continuing accuracy and completeness of the following at the
Effective Time:
            (a)	The Acquiring Trust is a business trust
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and
is duly qualified, licensed or admitted to do business
and is in good standing as a foreign association under
the Laws of each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it makes such qualification,
licensing or admission necessary, except in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified,
licensed or admitted and in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on its properties or assets or the
properties or assets of the Acquiring Fund.  The
Acquiring Fund has full power under the Acquiring
Trust's Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust, as
amended from time to time, and By-laws (Touchstone"
"2132","Governing Documents) to conduct its business as it is
now being conducted and to own properties and assets for
itself.  The Acquiring Fund will prior to the Effective
Time have all necessary authorizations, licenses and
approvals from any applicable Governmental or Regulatory
Body necessary to carry on its business.
            (b)	The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Acquiring Trust on behalf of the
Acquiring Fund and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein have been duly and validly
authorized by the Touchstone Board and the Touchstone

performance of this Agreement by the Acquiring Trust on
behalf of the Acquiring Fund or the consummation of the
Reorganization.  This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Acquiring Trust on
behalf of the Acquiring Fund, and assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the
Acquired Trust on behalf of the Acquired Fund, is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Acquiring
Trust, as it relates to the Acquiring Fund, enforceable
in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights,
to general equity principles and to any limitations on
indemnity as may be required under federal and state
securities Laws).
            (c)	The authorized capital of the Acquiring
Fund consists of an unlimited number of shares of
beneficial interest without par value.  As of the date

shares of any class.  As of the Valuation Time, the
outstanding shares of beneficial interest of the
Acquiring Fund will consist solely of  shares having the
characteristics described in the Acquiring Fund's
prospectus effective at such time.  There are no
outstanding options, warrants or other rights of any
kind to acquire from the Acquiring Fund any shares of
any series or equity interests of the Acquiring Fund or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or
which otherwise confer on the holder thereof any right
to acquire, any such additional shares, nor is the
Acquiring Fund committed to issue any share appreciation
or similar rights or options, warrants, rights or
securities in connection with any series of shares.
            (d)	Except for consents, approvals, or waivers
to be received prior to the Effective Time, including
shareholder approval by the Acquired Fund, and upon the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the Acquiring Trust on behalf of the Acquiring Fund does
not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein will not:  (i) violate or conflict
with the terms, conditions or provisions of the
Touchstone Governing Documents, or of any material
contract, agreement, indenture, instrument, or other
undertaking to which the Acquiring Trust is a party or
by which the Acquiring Trust or the Acquiring Fund is
bound, (ii) result in the acceleration of any
obligation, or the imposition of any penalty, under any
material agreement, indenture, instrument, contract,
lease or other undertaking to which the Acquiring Trust
is a party or by which the Acquiring Trust or the
Acquiring Fund is bound, (iii) result in a breach or
violation by the Acquiring Trust or the Acquiring Fund
of any terms, conditions, or provisions of any Law or
Order, or (iv) require any consent or approval of,
filing with or notice to, any Governmental or Regulatory
Body.
            (e)	Except as set forth in writing to the
Acquired Fund, there is no Action or Proceeding pending
against the Acquiring Trust or the Acquiring Fund or, to
the best of the Acquiring Trust's Knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or affecting, the Acquiring Trust
or the Acquiring Fund.
            (f)	No agent, broker, finder or investment or
commercial banker, or other Person or firm engaged by or
acting on behalf of the Acquiring Trust or the Acquiring
Fund in connection with the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement or any other agreement
contemplated hereby, or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, is or will be entitled
to any broker's or finder's or similar fees or other
commissions as a result of the consummation of such
transactions.
            (g)	The Acquiring Trust is registered with the
SEC as an open-end management investment company under
the 1940 Act, and its registration with the SEC as such
an investment company is in full force and effect, and
the Acquiring Fund is a separate series of the Acquiring
Trust duly designated in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Touchstone Governing Documents and in
and compliance in all material respects with the 1940
Act and its rules and regulations.
            (h)	The Acquiring Fund is, and will at the
Effective Time be, a new series portfolio of the
Acquiring Trust created within the last 12 months, and
such Acquiring Fund will not have had any assets (other
than assets required to meet the requirements of Section
14(a) of the 1940 Act or other seed capital) or
operations at any time prior to the Effective Time.
            (i)	The Acquiring Fund was established in
order to effect the transactions described in this

have carried on any business activity (other than such
activities as are customary to the organization of a new
series prior to its commencement of investment
operations).  It has not yet filed its first federal
income tax return and, thus, has not yet elected to be
treated as a regulated investment company for federal
income tax purposes.  However, upon filing its first
federal income tax return at the completion of its first
taxable year, the Acquiring Fund shall elect to be a
regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the
Code and until such time shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to ensure that it qualifies for taxation as a
regulated investment company under Sections 851 and
852 of the Code.  The Acquiring Fund is and will at the
Effective Time be treated as a separate corporation
under Section 851(g) of the Code.

immediately thereafter to its shareholders) pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement will have been duly
authorized at the Effective Time and, when so issued and
delivered, will be registered under the 1933 Act, duly
and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and no
shareholder of the Acquiring Fund shall have any
statutory or contractual preemptive right of
subscription or purchase in respect thereof.  In regard
to the statement above that the Acquiring Fund shares
will be non-assessable, it is noted that the Acquiring
Trust is a Massachusetts business trust and under
Massachusetts' Law, shareholders could, under certain
circumstances, be held personally liable for the
obligations of the Acquiring Fund; however, the
Acquiring Fund has included appropriate provisions
disclaiming such liability in all material contracts
entered into between the Acquiring Fund and any third-
party.
            (k)	As of the Valuation Time, the Acquiring
Fund's prospectus and statement of additional
information will conform in all material respects to the
applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act
and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder and will not include any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not materially misleading.
            (l)	The Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be
included in the Registration Statement and filed in
connection with this Agreement, and the documents
incorporated therein by reference and any amendment or
supplement thereto insofar as they relate to the
Acquiring Trust and the Acquiring Fund, each comply or
will comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the 1933 Act, 1934 Act and the 1940 Act
and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder on the effective date of such Registration
Statement.  Each of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
Registration Statement and the documents incorporated
therein by reference and any amendment or supplement
thereto, insofar as it relates to the Acquiring Trust
and the Acquiring Fund, does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not materially misleading on the effective date of
such Registration Statement; provided, however, that the
Acquiring Trust makes no representations or warranties
as to the information contained in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, Registration Statement and the
documents incorporated therein by reference and any
amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in
conformity with information relating to the Acquired
Trust or the Acquired Fund and furnished by the Acquired
Fund to the Acquiring Trust specifically for use in
connection with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
Registration Statement and the documents incorporated
therein by reference and any amendment or supplement
thereto.
            (m)	The Acquiring Trust has adopted and
implemented written policies and procedures in
accordance with Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act.
            (n)	The Acquiring Fund has maintained, or
caused to be maintained on its behalf, in all material
respects, all Books and Records required of a registered
investment company in compliance with the requirements
of Section 31 of the 1940 Act and rules thereunder.
            (o)	Except as disclosed in writing to the
Acquired Fund, to the best of the Acquiring Fund's
Knowledge, no events have occurred and no issues,
conditions or facts have arisen which either
individually or in the aggregate have had a Material
Adverse Effect on the Acquiring Fund other than changes
occurring in the ordinary course of business.
            (p)	The Acquiring Trust is not under the
jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or similar case
(within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the
Code).
            (q)	The Acquiring Fund has no unamortized or
unpaid organizational fees or expenses for which it does
not expect to be reimbursed by Touchstone or its
Affiliates.

taken that is inconsistent with such treatment or that results
in the failure of the transaction to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

call, convene and hold a meeting of shareholders of the

not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, the Party discovering the item shall notify the

representatives, as appropriate, throughout the period prior
to the Effective Time, all such documents and other
information concerning the Acquired Fund and the Acquiring
Fund, respectively, and their business and properties as may
reasonably be requested by the other Party.  Such cooperation
shall include providing copies of reasonably requested
documents and other information.  Each Party shall make its
employees and officers available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide an explanation of any documents or
information provided hereunder to the extent that such Party's
employees are familiar with such documents or information.
      5.5	Notice of Material Changes.  Each Party will notify

Fund will deliver to the Acquiring Fund an unaudited statement
of assets and liabilities of the Acquired Fund, together with
a schedule of portfolio investments as of and for the interim
period ending at the Valuation Time.  These financial
statements will present fairly in all material respects the
financial position and portfolio investments of the Acquired
Fund as of the Valuation Time in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis, and there will be no material contingent
liabilities of the Acquired Fund not disclosed in said
financial statements.  These financial statements shall be
certified by the Treasurer of the Acquired Trust as, to the
best of his or her Knowledge, complying with the requirements
of the preceding sentence.  The Acquired Fund also will
deliver to the Acquiring Fund at the Effective Time (i) the
detailed tax-basis accounting records for each security or
other investment to be transferred to the Acquiring Fund

and clearly reflect the basis used for determination of gain
and loss realized on the partial sale of any security to be
transferred to the Acquiring Fund and (ii) a statement of
earnings and profits of the Acquired Fund for federal income
tax purposes that shall be carried over by the Acquired Fund
as a result of Code Section 381 and which shall be certified
by an officer of the Acquired Fund.

all necessary action and use their reasonable best efforts to
complete all filings, obtain all governmental and other
consents and approvals and satisfy any other provision
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by

      5.8	Books and Records.  Upon reasonable notice, each
Party will make available to each other Party for review any
Books and Records which are reasonably requested by such other

      5.9	Issued Shares.  The Acquiring Fund Shares to be
issued and delivered to the Acquired Fund for the account of
the Acquired Fund (and to be distributed immediately
thereafter to its shareholders) pursuant to this Agreement,
will have been duly authorized at the Effective Time.  Said
shares when issued and delivered will be registered under the
1933 Act, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable.  No shareholder of the Acquiring Fund shall have
any statutory or contractual preemptive right of subscription
or purchase in respect thereof.  The shareholders of the
Acquired Fund shall not pay any front-end or deferred sales
charge in connection with the Reorganization.  The contingent
deferred sales charge (CDSC) applicable to Class A and Class
C shares of the Acquiring Fund issued in connection with the
Reorganization will be calculated based on the CDSC schedule
of Class A and Class C shares, respectively, of the Acquired
Fund and, for purposes of calculating the CDSC, recipients of
such Class A and Class C shares of the Acquiring Fund shall be
deemed to have acquired such shares on the date(s) that the
corresponding shares of the Acquired Fund were acquired by the
shareholder.
      5.10	Liquidation of Acquired Fund.  The Acquired Trust
and the Acquired Fund agree that the liquidation and
termination of the Acquired Fund shall be effected in the
manner provided in the Old Mutual Governing Documents in

business except in connection with its liquidation and
termination, or the satisfaction of any provisions of this
Agreement as set forth in Section 10.5.

respect to the taxable year ending on or prior to the
Effective Time and for any prior periods or taxable years and
shall further cause such tax returns and Forms 1099 to be duly
filed with the appropriate taxing authorities.
      5.12	Regulatory Filings.  The Acquired Trust and the
Acquired Fund agree to file all necessary or appropriate
reports with the SEC, Internal Revenue Service or other
regulatory or tax authority covering any reporting period
ending prior to or at the Effective Time with respect to the
Acquired Trust and the Acquired Fund.
      5.13	Compliance Section 15(f).  The Acquiring Trust
agrees that, for the minimum time periods specified in Section
15(f) of the 1940 Act it shall take (or refrain from taking,
as the case may be) such actions as are necessary to ensure
that: (i) at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the trustees
of the Acquiring Fund shall not be interested persons (as
that term is defined in the 1940 Act) of the Acquiring Fund's
investment adviser or the Acquired Fund's investment adviser;
(ii) no unfair burden (as that term is defined in Section
15(f)(2)(B) of the 1940 Act) shall be imposed on the Acquiring
Fund; and (iii) each vacancy among the trustees of the

interested person neither of the Acquiring Fund's investment
adviser nor of the Acquired Fund's investment adviser so as to
comply with Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act, as if such Section
were applicable, shall be filled in the manner specified by

in lieu of the covenants set forth in the preceding sentence,
to apply for and obtain an exemptive order under Section 6(c)
of the 1940 Act from the provisions of Section 15(f)(1)(A) of
the 1940 Act, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Acquired Fund's investment adviser.

accounting and (B) any Acquired Fund shareholder or Acquiring

or the Acquiring Fund with respect to any stock held in a
passive foreign investment company as defined in Section
