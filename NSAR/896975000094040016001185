"1017","Global Value Fund II - Currency Unhedged, Tweedy, Browne Value"

"1022","Global Value Fund II - Currency Unhedged, Tweedy, Browne Value"
"1023","Fund and Tweedy, Browne Worldwide High Dividend Yield Value Fund"
"1024","(constituting Tweedy, Browne Fund Inc., hereafter referred to as"
"1025","the Funds) as of and for the year ended March 31, 2016, in"
"1026","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1027","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"1028","internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"1029","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1030","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1031","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"1032","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1033","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1034","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"1035","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1036","reporting."
"1037","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"1038","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1039","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1040","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1041","related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"1042","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1043","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1044","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1045","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1046","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1047","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1048","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1049","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"1050","funds; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1051","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1052","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1053","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the funds are"
"1054","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1055","and directors of the funds; and (3)  provide reasonable"
"1056","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1057","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets"
"1058","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1059","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1060","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1061","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1062","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1063","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"1064","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1065","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1066","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1067","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1068","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"1069","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1070","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1071","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1072","material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial"
"1073","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1074","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1075","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1076","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1077","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"1078","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1079","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"1080","no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1081","reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"1082","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material"
"1083","weaknesses as defined above as of March 31, 2016."

"1145","1. The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Tribune"
"1146","Company (the Committee) initiated litigation against Tweedy,"
"1147","Browne Value Fund (the Value Fund) and thousands of other"
"1148","former public shareholders of Tribune Company, seeking to avoid"
"1149","and recover payments made to Tribune Company shareholders in"
"1150","connection with the 2007 leveraged buyout of Tribune Company."
"1151","Value Fund tendered its shares in a tender offer from Tribune"
"1152","Company and received proceeds of approximately $3.4 million."
"1153","The Committee, which was replaced during 2012 as plaintiff in"
"1154","this action by a litigation trustee (the Litigation Trustee),"
"1155","alleges that the shareholder payments were made in violation of"
"1156","various laws prohibiting actual fraudulent transfers. A fifth"
"1157","amended complaint filed on August 1, 2013 by the Litigation"
"1158","Trustee alleges no misconduct by Value Fund or any member of"
"1159","the putative defendant class of public shareholders. The"
"1160","outcome of the proceedings (the AFT Litigation) cannot be"
"1161","predicted at this time and, no contingency has been recorded on"
"1162","the books of Value Fund."
"1163","Name of court in which proceedings were instituted: United"
"1164","States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. This"
"1165","proceeding was transferred by order of the United States"
"1166","Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to the United States"
"1167","District Court for the Southern District of New York on April"
"1168","5, 2012 and remains pending. A scheduling order was entered by"
"1169","the Court on April 25, 2014 related to a motion to dismiss the"
"1170","entire case contemplated by certain primary defendants."
"1171","Briefing in connection with this potentially case dispositive"
"1172","motion was completed on July 3, 2014. The timetable for a"

"1177","S.D.N.Y. Civil Case Number - 1:12-cv-02652 (RJS)."
"1178","2. In addition to the AFT Litigation, a second proceeding,"
"1179","commenced by certain holders of notes issued by  Tribune"
"1180","Company, asserts litigation claims against Value Fund and"
"1181","other public shareholders of Tribune Company, seeking to"
"1182","recover payments made to Tribune Company shareholders in"
"1183","connection with the 2007 leveraged buyout of Tribune Company."
"1184","The plaintiffs in this second action allege that the"
"1185","shareholder payments were made in violation of various laws"
"1186","prohibiting constructive fraudulent transfers. The complaint"
"1187","alleges no misconduct by Value Fund or any member of the"
"1188","putative defendant class. The outcome of the proceedings (the"
"1189","Niese Litigation) cannot be predicted at this time and no"
"1190","contingency has been recorded on the books of Value Fund. On"
"1191","September 23, 2013, Judge Richard Sullivan issued a Memorandum"
"1192","and Order granting defendants' Omnibus Phase One Motion to"
"1193","Dismiss the state law fraudulent conveyance claims in the Niese"
"1194","Litigation on grounds that the automatic stay under Section"
"1195","362(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code precludes fraudulent"
"1196","conveyance actions by individual creditors (like the plaintiffs"
"1197","in the Niese Litigation) as long as the Litigation Trustee in"
"1198","the AFT Litigation continues to assert his avoidance powers."
"1199","During October 2013, Judge Sullivan's decision was appealed by"
"1200","both plaintiffs and defendants to the U.S. Court of Appeals"
"1201","for the Second Circuit. On November 5, 2014, after briefing"
"1202","was completed, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral"
"1203","arguments. On March 29, 2016 the Second Circuit issued its"
"1204","revised opinion affirming the District Court's dismissal of the"
"1205","complaint on preemption rather than  standing grounds.  The"
"1206","Second Circuit held that the noteholders have statutory"
"1207","standing because the bankruptcy court granted the noteholders"
"1208","relief from the automatic stay on three occasions. However, the"
"1209","Second Circuit found that the noteholders' state law"
"1210","constructive fraudulent conveyance claims are preempted by the"
"1211","safe harbor in Section 546(e) of the Bankruptcy Code. The time"
