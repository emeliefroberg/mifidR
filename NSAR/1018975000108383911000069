"2380","or disposition of a companys assets that could have a material"
"2381","effect on the financial statements."
"2382","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2383","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2384","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"2385","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2386","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"2387","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2388","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2389","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"2390","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"2391","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"2392","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2393","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"2394","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"2395","material misstatement of the Funds annual or interim financial"
"2396","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2397","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"2398","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2399","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"2400","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"2401","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"2402","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we"
"2403","noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal control over"
"2404","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"2405","safeguarding securities that we consider to be material"
"2406","weaknesses as defined above as of February 28, 2011."

"2534","      Sub-Adviser will properly communicate to the"

"2574","(e)	will monitor the pricing of portfolio"

"2576","those securities and the markets in which the"
"2577","securities trade in the ordinary course of managing"
"2578","the portfolio securities of the Funds, and will"
"2579","notify Manager promptly of any issuer-specific or"
"2580","market events or other situations that occur"
"2581","(particularly those that may occur after the close of"
"2582","a foreign market in which the securities may"
"2583","primarily trade but before the time at which the"
"2584","Funds securities are priced on a given day) that"
"2585","may materially impact the pricing of one or more"
"2586","securities in Sub-Advisers portion of the portfolio."
"2587","In addition, upon the request of Manager, Sub-"
"2588","Adviser will assist Manager in evaluating the"
"2589","impact that such an event may have on the net"
"2590","asset value of the Funds and in determining a"
"2591","recommended fair value of the affected security or"
"2592","securities.  Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any"
"2593","valuation determined or adopted by the Funds, the"
"2594","Funds custodian and/or portfolio accounting"
"2595","agent, as contemplated in this Agreement, unless"
"2596","such determination is made based upon"
"2597","information provided by Sub-Adviser that is"
"2598","materially incorrect or incomplete as a result of"
"2599","Sub-Advisers gross negligence."
"2600","3. Expenses.  During the term of this"
"2601","Agreement, Sub-Adviser will pay all expenses"
"2602","incurred by it in connection with its activities"
"2603","under this Agreement other than the cost of"
"2604","securities (including brokerage commission, if any)"
"2605","purchased for each Fund."
"2606","4. Compensation.  For the services provided and"
"2607","the expenses assumed pursuant to this Agreement,"
"2608","Manager will pay Sub-Adviser, and Sub-Adviser"
"2609","agrees to accept as full compensation therefor, a"
"2610","portfolio management fee for each Fund equal to a"
"2611","percentage (as set forth on Schedule A) of the"
"2612","remainder of (a) the investment management fee"
"2613","payable by each Fund to Manager based on"
"2614","average daily net assets pursuant to the"
"2615","Management Agreement between Manager and the"
"2616","Trust, less (b) any management fees, expenses,"
"2617","supermarket fees and alliance fees waived,"
"2618","reimbursed or paid by Manager in respect of each"
"2619","Fund."
"2620","	The management fee shall accrue on each calendar"
"2621","day, and shall be payable monthly on the second business"
"2622","day of the next succeeding calendar month.  The daily fee"
"2623","accrual shall be computed by multiplying the fraction of"
"2624","one divided by the number of days in the calendar year by"
"2625","the applicable annual rate of fee, and multiplying this"
"2626","product by the net assets of each Fund, determined in the"
"2627","manner established by the Board, as of the close of"
"2628","business on the last preceding business day on which each"
"2629","Funds net asset value was determined."
"2630","	For the month and year in which this Agreement"
"2631","becomes effective or terminates, there shall be an"
"2632","appropriate proration on the basis of the number of days"
"2633","that the Agreement is in effect during the month and year,"
"2634","respectively."
"2635","      5.   	Services to Others.  Manager understands,"
"2636","      and has advised the Board, that Sub-Adviser now"
"2637","      acts, or may in the future act, as an investment"
"2638","      adviser to fiduciary and other managed accounts,"
"2639","      and as investment adviser or sub-investment"
"2640","      adviser to other investment companies that are not"
"2641","      series of the Trust, provided that whenever each"
"2642","      Fund and one or more other investment advisory"
"2643","      clients of Sub-Adviser have available funds for"
"2644","      investment, investments suitable and appropriate"
"2645","      for each will be allocated in a manner believed by"
"2646","      Sub-Adviser to be equitable to each.  Manager"
"2647","      recognizes, and has advised the Board, that in"
"2648","      some cases this procedure may adversely affect the"
"2649","      size of the position that each Fund may obtain in a"
"2650","      particular security.  It is further agreed that, on"
"2651","      occasions when Sub-Adviser deems the purchase"
"2652","      or sale of a security to be in the best interests of"
"2653","      each Fund as well as other accounts, it may, to the"
"2654","      extent permitted by applicable law, but will not be"
"2655","      obligated to, aggregate the securities to be so sold"
"2656","      or purchased for each Fund with those to be sold or"
"2657","      purchased for other accounts in order to obtain"
"2658","      favorable execution and lower brokerage"
"2659","      commissions.  In addition, Manager understands,"
"2660","      and has advised the Board, that the persons"
"2661","      employed by Sub-Adviser to assist in Sub-"
"2662","      Advisers duties under this Agreement will not"
"2663","      devote their full such efforts and service to the"
"2664","      Funds.  It is also agreed that Sub-Adviser may use"
"2665","      any supplemental research obtained for the benefit"
"2666","      of the Funds in providing investment advice to its"
"2667","      other investment advisory accounts or for"
"2668","      managing its own accounts."
"2669","      6.	Limitation of Liability.  Manager will not"
"2670","      take any action against Sub-Adviser to hold Sub-"
"2671","      Adviser liable for any error of judgment or mistake"
"2672","      of law or for any loss suffered by a Fund in"
"2673","      connection with the performance of Sub-Advisers"
"2674","       duties under this Agreement, except for a loss"
"2675","      resulting from Sub-Advisers willful misfeasance,"
"2676","      bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance"
"2677","      of its duties or by reason of its reckless disregard"
"2678","      of its obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"2679","7. Term; Termination; Amendment."
"2680","As to each Fund, this Agreement shall become"
"2681","effective and shall run for an initial period as"
"2682","specified for each Fund in Schedule A hereto. This"
"2683","Agreement shall continue in force from year to"

"2686","approved for each Fund at least annually in the"
"2687","manner required by the 1940 Act and the rules and"
"2688","regulations thereunder; provided, however, that if"
"2689","the continuation of this Agreement is not approved"
"2690","for each Fund, Sub-Adviser may continue to serve"
"2691","in such capacity for each Fund in the manner and"
"2692","to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act and the"
"2693","rules and regulations thereunder."

"2706","      penalty by Manager or the Board or by vote of a"
"2707","      majority of the outstanding voting securities of"
"2708","      each Fund in the event that it shall have been"
"2709","      established by a court of competent jurisdiction"
"2710","      that Sub-Adviser or any officer or director of Sub-"
"2711","      Adviser has taken any action which results in a"
"2712","      breach of the covenants of Sub-Adviser set forth"
