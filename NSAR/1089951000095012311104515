"1060","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1061","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1062","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1063","accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"1064","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1065","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"1066","the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1067","<PAGE>"
"1068","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1069","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1070","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1071","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"1072","authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide"
"1073","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1074","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material"
"1075","effect on the financial statements."
"1076","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1077","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1078","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1079","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"1080","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A deficiency in internal"
"1081","control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1082","control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1083","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1084","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1085","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1086","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Trust's annual or"
"1087","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"1088","basis."
"1089","Our consideration of the Trust's and AMG's internal control over financial"
"1090","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"1091","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"1092","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1093","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"1094","deficiencies in the Trust's and AMG's internal control over financial reporting"
"1095","and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"1096","consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of October 31, 2011."

"1114","                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS"
"1115","To the Board of Trustees and Management of The Managers Funds, Managers AMG"
"1116","Funds, Managers Trust I and Managers Trust II:"
"1117","We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying Management"
"1118","Statement Regarding Compliance with Exemptive Order Pertaining to Interfund"
"1119","Lending (the Management Statement). The Management Statement asserts that as"
"1120","of June 30, 2011 and for the period from July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011, The"
"1121","Managers Funds, Managers AMG Funds, Managers Trust I and Managers Trust II as"
"1122","set forth in Exhibit I (hereinafter collectively referred to as the Funds)"
"1123","have established and maintained procedures reasonably designed to achieve"
"1124","compliance with the conditions set forth in the Order of Exemption (the Order)"
"1125","granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission dated June 23, 2009."
"1126","Management is responsible for the Funds' compliance with those requirements. Our"
"1127","responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the"
"1128","Funds' procedures to achieve compliance with the conditions of the Order based"
"1129","on our examination."
"1130","Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards"
"1131","established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and,"
"1132","accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Funds'"
"1133","procedures to achieve compliance with the Order and performing such other"
"1134","procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination"
"1135","procedures included an assessment of the establishment and maintenance of"
"1136","procedures reasonably designed to achieve the following objectives set forth in"
"1137","the Order (all capitalized terms as defined in the Order):"
"1138","      a)    the Interfund Rate on all Interfund Loans is higher than the Repo"
"1139","            Rate, and if applicable the yield of the money market funds, but"
"1140","            lower than the Bank Loan Rate;"
"1141","      b)    all Interfund Loans comply with the collateral requirements as set"
"1142","            forth in the Order;"
"1143","      c)    all Interfund Loans comply with the percentage limitations on"
"1144","            Interfund borrowing and lending;"
"1145","      d)    Interfund borrowing and lending demand is allocated in an equitable"
"1146","            manner and in accordance with procedures established by the Funds'"
"1147","            Board of Trustees; and"
"1148","      e)    The Interfund Loan Rate on all interfund loans does not exceed the"
"1149","            interest rate on any third party borrowings of a borrowing Fund at"
"1150","            the time of the Interfund Loan."
"1151","We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our"
"1152","examination does not provide a legal determination on the Funds' compliance with"
"1153","specified requirements of the Order."
"1154","Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud may occur"
"1155","and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of internal control"
"1156","over the Interfund Lending Program to future periods are subject to the risk"
"1157","that internal control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"1158","that the degree of compliance with the control activities may deteriorate."
"1159","In our opinion, management's assertion that the Funds have established and"
"1160","maintained procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the Order"
"1161","as of June 30, 2011 and for the period from July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011, is"
"1162","fairly stated, in all material respects, based upon the criteria set forth in"
"1163","the Order and the accompanying Management Statement."
"1164","This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Board of"
"1165","Trustees and Management of the Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission,"
"1166","and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"1167","specified parties."
