"514","accordance with"
"515","the standards of"
"516","the Public"
"517","Company"
"518","Accounting"
"519","Oversight"
"520","Board (United"
"521","States), we"
"522","considered the"
"523","Fund's internal"
"524","control over"
"525","financial"
"526","reporting,"
"527","including"
"528","controls over"
"529","safeguarding"
"530","securities, as a"
"531","basis for"
"532","designing audit"
"533","procedures for"
"534","the purpose of"
"535","expressing an"
"536","opinion on the"
"537","consolidated"
"538","financial"
"539","statements and"
"540","to comply with"
"541","the"
"542","requirements of"

"548","effectiveness of"
"549","the Fund's"
"550","internal control"
"551","over financial"
"552","reporting."
"553","Accordingly, we"
"554","express no such"
"555","opinion."
"556","Management of"
"557","the Fund is"
"558","responsible for"
"559","establishing and"
"560","maintaining"
"561","effective"
"562","internal control"
"563","over financial"
"564","reporting. In"
"565","fulfilling this"
"566","responsibility,"
"567","estimates and"
"568","judgments by"

"570","required to"
"571","assess the"

"574","related costs of"
"575","controls. A"
"576","fund's internal"
"577","control over"
"578","financial"
"579","reporting is a"
"580","process"
"581","designed to"
"582","provide"
"583","reasonable"
"584","assurance"
"585","regarding the"
"586","reliability of"
"587","financial"
"588","reporting and"
"589","the preparation"
"590","of consolidated"
"591","financial"
"592","statements for"
"593","external"
"594","purposes in"
"595","accordance with"
"596","generally"
"597","accepted"
"598","accounting"
"599","principles. A"
"600","fund's internal"
"601","control over"
"602","financial"
"603","reporting"
"604","includes those"
"605","policies and"
"606","procedures that"
"607","(1) pertain to"
"608","the maintenance"
"609","of records that,"
"610","in reasonable"
"611","detail, accurately"
"612","and fairly reflect"
"613","the transactions"
"614","and dispositions"
"615","of the assets of"
"616","the fund; (2)"
"617","provide"
"618","reasonable"
"619","assurance that"

"622","necessary to"
"623","permit"
"624","preparation of"

"627","statements in"
"628","accordance with"
"629","generally"
"630","accepted"
"631","accounting"
"632","principles, and"
"633","that receipts and"
"634","expenditures of"
"635","the fund are"
"636","being made only"
"637","in accordance"
"638","with"
"639","authorizations"
"640","of management"
"641","and directors of"
"642","the fund; and"
"643","(3) provide"
"644","reasonable"
"645","assurance"
"646","regarding"
"647","prevention or"
"648","timely detection"
"649","of unauthorized"
"650","acquisition, use,"
"651","or disposition"
"652","of the fund's"
"653","assets that could"
"654","have a material"
"655","effect on the"
"656","consolidated"
"657","financial"
"658","statements."
"659","Because of its"
"660","inherent"
"661","limitations,"
"662","internal control"
"663","over financial"
"664","reporting may"
"665","not prevent or"
"666","detect"
"667","misstatements."
"668","Also projections"
"669","of any"
"670","evaluation of"
"671","effectiveness to"
"672","future periods"
"673","are subject to"
"674","the risk that"
"675","controls may"
"676","become"
"677","inadequate"
"678","because of"
"679","changes in"
"680","conditions, or"
"681","the degree of"
"682","compliance with"
"683","policies and"
"684","procedures may"
"685","deteriorate."
"686","A deficiency in"
"687","internal control"
"688","over financial"
"689","reporting exists"
"690","when the design"
"691","or operation of"
"692","a control does"
"693","not allow"
"694","management or"
"695","employees, in"
"696","the normal"
"697","course of"
"698","performing their"
"699","assigned"
"700","functions, to"
"701","prevent or"
"702","detect"
"703","misstatements"
"704","on a timely"
"705","basis. A material"
"706","weakness is a"
"707","deficiency, or a"
"708","combination of"
"709","deficiencies, in"
"710","internal control"
"711","over financial"
"712","reporting, such"
"713","that there is a"
"714","reasonable"
"715","possibility that a"
"716","material"
"717","misstatement of"
"718","the Fund's"
"719","annual or"
"720","interim"
"721","consolidated"
"722","financial"
"723","statements will"
"724","not be"
"725","prevented or"
"726","detected on a"
"727","timely basis."
"728","Our"
"729","consideration of"
"730","the Fund's"
"731","internal control"
"732","over financial"
"733","reporting was"
"734","for the limited"
"735","purpose"
"736","described in the"
"737","first paragraph"
"738","and would not"
"739","necessarily"
"740","disclose all"
"741","deficiencies in"
"742","internal control"
"743","over financial"
"744","reporting that"
"745","might be"
"746","material"
"747","weaknesses"
"748","under standards"
"749","established by"
"750","the Public"
"751","Company"
"752","Accounting"
"753","Oversight"
"754","Board (United"
"755","States)."
"756","However, we"
"757","noted no"
"758","deficiencies in"
"759","the Fund's"
"760","internal control"
"761","over financial"
"762","reporting and its"
"763","operation,"
"764","including"
"765","controls over"
"766","safeguarding"
"767","securities, that"
"768","we consider to"
"769","be material"
"770","weaknesses as"
"771","defined above"
"772","as of April 30,"
"773","2017."
"774","This report is"
