"521","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"522","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"523","Federated Total Return Government Bond Fund:"
"524","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"525","financial statements of Federated Total"
"526","Return Government Bond Fund (the Fund) as of"
"527","and for the year ended February 28,"
"528","2010, in accordance with the standards of the"
"529","Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"530","Board (United States), we considered the Fund's"
"531","internal control over financial reporting,"
"532","including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"533","as a basis for designing our auditing"
"534","procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"535","opinion on the financial statements and to"
"536","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"537","not for the purpose of expressing an"
"538","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"539","control over financial reporting."
"540","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"541","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"542","establishing and maintaining effective"
"543","internal control over financial reporting. In"
"544","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"545","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"546","expected benefits and related costs"
"547","of controls. A company's internal control over"
"548","financial reporting is a process designed to"
"549","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability"
"550","of financial reporting and the"
"551","preparation of financial statements for external"
"552","purposes in accordance with generally"
"553","accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal"
"554","control over financial reporting"
"555","includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"556","pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"557","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"558","the transactions and dispositions of the"
"559","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"560","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"561","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"562","statements in accordance with generally"
"563","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"564","and expenditures of the company are"
"565","being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"566","of management and directors of the"
"567","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"568","regarding prevention or timely detection"
"569","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"570","of a company's assets that could have a"
"571","material effect on the financial statements."
"572","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"573","control over financial reporting may not"
"574","prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"575","of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"576","future periods are subject to the risk that controls"
"577","may become inadequate because of"
"578","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"579","compliance with the policies or procedures"
"580","may deteriorate."
"581","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"582","reporting exists when the design or"
"583","operation of a control does not allow management"
"584","or employees, in the normal course of"
"585","performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"586","or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"587","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"588","combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"589","over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"590","reasonable possibility that a material"
"591","misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"592","financial statements will not be"
"593","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"594","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control"
"595","over financial reporting was for the"
"596","limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"597","and would not necessarily disclose all"
"598","deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"599","material weaknesses under standards"
"600","established by the Public Company Accounting"
"601","Oversight Board (United States)."
"602","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"603","internal control over financial reporting"
"604","and its operation, including controls over"
"605","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"606","material weakness as defined above"
"607","as of February 28, 2010."
"608","This report is intended solely for the"
"609","information and use of management and the Board"
"610","of Trustees of the Fund and the Securities and"
"611","Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"612","to be, and should not be, used by anyone other"
"613","than these specified parties."

"624","ITEM 77E.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"625","Since October 2003, Federated and related entities"
"626","(collectively, Federated) and various Federated"
"627","funds (Funds) have been named as defendants"
"628","in several class action lawsuits now pending in the"
"629","United States District Court for the District of"
"630","Maryland. The lawsuits were purportedly filed on"
"631","behalf of people who purchased, owned and/or redeemed"
"632","shares of Federated-sponsored mutual funds during"
"633","specified periods beginning November"
"634","1, 1998. The suits are generally similar in alleging"
"635","that Federated engaged in illegal and improper trading"
"636","practices including market timing and"
"637","late trading in concert with certain institutional"
"638","traders, which allegedly caused financial injury to"
"639","the mutual fund shareholders. Federated without"
"640","admitting the validity of any claim has reached a"
"641","preliminary settlement with the Plaintiffs in"
"642","these cases. Any settlement would have to be"
"643","approved by the Court."
"644","     Federated entities have also been named as"
"645","defendants in several additional lawsuits that"
"646","are now pending in the United States District"
"647","Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania."
"648","These lawsuits have been consolidated into a single"
"649","action alleging excessive advisory fees"
"650","involving another Federated Fund."
"651","     The Board of the Funds retained the law firm"
"652","of Dickstein Shapiro LLP to represent the Funds in"
"653","each of the lawsuits described in the"
"654","preceding two paragraphs. Federated and the Funds,"
"655","and their respective counsel, have been defending"
"656","this litigation, and none of the Funds"
"657","remains a defendant in any of the lawsuits (though,"
"658","the other Fund noted above could potentially receive"
"659","a recovery in the action alleging"
"660","excessive advisory fees). Additional lawsuits based"
"661","upon similar allegations may be filed in the future."
"662","The potential impact of these lawsuits, all"
"663","of which seek monetary damages, attorneys' fees and"
"664","expenses, and future potential similar suits is"
"665","uncertain. Although we do not believe that"
"666","these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect"
"667","on the Funds, there can be no assurance that these"
"668","suits, ongoing adverse publicity and/or"
"669","other developments resulting from the allegations"
"670","in these matters will not result in increased Fund"
"671","redemptions, reduced sales of Fund shares or"
"672","other adverse consequences for the Funds."
