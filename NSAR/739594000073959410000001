"545"," LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"546","Since October 2003,"
"547"," Federated and"
"548","related entities"
"549","(collectively, Federated)"
"550"," and various Federated"
"551","funds (Funds) have"
"552","been named as defendants"
"553","in several class action"
"554","lawsuits now pending in the"
"555","United"
"556","States District"
"557","Court for the District of"
"558"," Maryland. The lawsuits"
"559","were purportedly filed"
"560","on behalf of people"
"561","who purchased, owned"
"562","and/or redeemed shares"
"563","of Federated-sponsored"
"564"," mutual funds during"
"565","specified"
"566","periods beginning November"
"567"," 1, 1998. The suits are"
"568","generally similar in"
"569","alleging that Federated"
"570","engaged"
"571","in illegal and improper"
"572","trading practices including"
"573","market timing and late trading"
"574","in concert with certain"
"575","institutional traders, which"
"576","allegedly caused financial"
"577","injury to the mutual fund"
"578","shareholders. Federated"
"579","without admitting the"
"580","validity of any claim"
"581","has reached a preliminary"
"582","settlement with the Plaintiffs"
"583","in these"
"584","cases. Any settlement"
"585","would have to be approved by"
"586","the Court."
"587","     Federated entities have"
"588","also been named as defendants"
"589","in several additional lawsuits"
"590","that are now"
"591","pending in the United States"
"592","District Court for the Western"
"593","District of Pennsylvania. These"
"594"," lawsuits have"
"595","been consolidated into a single"
"596","action alleging excessive advisory"
"597","fees involving another Federated Fund."
"598","     The Board of the Funds"
"599","retained the law firm of Dickstein"
"600","Shapiro LLP to represent the Funds in"
"601","each of the lawsuits described in"
"602","the preceding two paragraphs."
"603"," Federated and the Funds, and their"
"604","respective counsel, have been"
"605","defending this litigation, and"
"606","none of the Funds remains a defendant"
"607","in"
"608","any of the lawsuits (though,"
"609","the other Fund noted above could"
"610","potentially receive a recovery in"
"611","the action"
"612","alleging excessive advisory fees)."
"613","Additional lawsuits based upon similar"
"614","allegations may be filed in the"
"615","future. The potential impact of"
"616","these lawsuits, all of which seek"
"617","monetary damages, attorneys' fees and"
"618","expenses, and future potential"
"619","similar suits is uncertain. Although"
"620","we do not believe that these lawsuits"
"621","will have a material adverse effect"
"622"," on the Funds, there can be no"
"623","assurance that these suits, ongoing"
"624","adverse publicity and/or other"
"625","developments resulting from the"
"626","allegations in these matters will"
"627","not result"
"628","in increased Fund redemptions,"
"629"," reduced sales of Fund Shares or"
"630","other adverse consequences for the"
"631","Funds."

"639","Report of Independent"
"640","Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"641","To the Shareholders"
"642","and Board of Trustees of"
"643","Federated U.S."
"644","Government Securities"
"645","Fund: 1-3 Years:"
"646","In planning and"
"647","performing our audit"
"648"," of the financial"
"649","statements of Federated U.S."
"650","Government Securities"
"651","Fund: 1-3 Years (the Fund)"
"652","as of and for the year ended"
"653","February 28, 2010, in"
"654","accordance with the standards"
"655","of the Public Company Accounting"
"656","Oversight Board (United States),"
"657"," we considered the Fund's"
"658","internal control over financial"
"659","reporting, including controls"
"660","over safeguarding securities,"
"661","as a basis for designing our"
"662","auditing procedures for the"
"663","purpose of expressing our"
"664","opinion on the financial statements"
"665","and to comply with the requirements"
"666","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"667","of"
"668","expressing an opinion on the"
"669","effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"670","control over financial"
"671","reporting.  Accordingly, we express"
"672","no such opinion."
"673","The management of the Fund is"
"674","responsible for establishing and"
"675","maintaining effective"
"676","internal control over financial"
"677","reporting. In fulfilling this"
"678","responsibility, estimates and"
"679","judgments by management are required"
"680","to assess the expected benefits and"
"681","related costs"
"682","of controls. A company's internal"
"683","control over financial reporting"
"684","is a process designed to"
"685","provide reasonable assurance"
"686","regarding the reliability of"
"687","financial reporting and the"
"688","preparation of financial statements"
"689","for external purposes in accordance"
"690","with generally"
"691","accepted accounting principles."
"692","A company's internal control over"
"693","financial reporting"
"694","includes those policies and procedures"
"695","that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"696","of records that,"
"697","in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"698"," fairly reflect the transactions and"
"699","dispositions of the"
"700","assets of the company; (2) provide"
"701","reasonable assurance that transactions"
"702","are recorded as"
"703","necessary to permit preparation of"
"704","financial statements in accordance"
"705","with generally"
"706","accepted accounting principles, and"
"707","that receipts and expenditures of"
"708"," the company are"
"709","being made only in accordance with"
"710","authorizations of management and"
"711","directors of the"
"712","company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"713","assurance regarding prevention or"
"714","timely detection"
"715","of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"716","disposition of a company's assets"
"717","that could have a"
"718","material effect on the financial"
"719","statements."
"720","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"721","internal control over financial"
"722","reporting may not"
"723","prevent or detect misstatements."
"724"," Also,"
"725","projections of any evaluation of"
"726","effectiveness to"
"727","future periods are subject to the"
"728","risk that controls may become inadequate"
"729"," because of"
"730","changes in conditions, or that the"
"731","degree of compliance with the policies"
"732","or procedures"
"733","may deteriorate."
"734","A deficiency in internal control"
"735","over financial reporting exists"
"736","when the design or"
"737","operation of a control does not"
"738","allow management or employees, in"
"739","the normal course of"
"740","performing their assigned functions,"
"741","to prevent or detect misstatements"
"742","on a timely basis."
"743","A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"744","or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"745","internal control"
"746","over financial reporting, such that"
"747","there is a reasonable possibility"
"748","that a material"
"749","misstatement of the company's annual"
"750","or interim financial statements will"
"751","not be"
"752","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"753","Our consideration of the Fund's"
"754"," internal control over financial"
"755","reporting was for the"
"756","limited purpose described in the"
"757","first paragraph and would not"
"758","necessarily disclose all"
"759","deficiencies in internal control"
"760","that might be material weaknesses"
"761","under standards"
"762","established by the Public Company"
"763"," Accounting Oversight Board"
"764","(United States)."
"765","However, we noted no deficiencies"
"766","in the Fund's internal control over"
"767","financial reporting"
"768","and its operation, including controls"
"769"," over safeguarding securities that we"
"770","consider to be a"
"771","material weakness as defined above as"
"772","of February 28, 2010."
"773","This report is intended solely for the"
