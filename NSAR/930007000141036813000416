In no instance will portfolio securities be purchased from or sold to UBS Global AM or the Sub-Adviser, or any affiliated person thereof, except in accordance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Sub-Adviser may aggregate sales and purchase orders with respect to the assets of the Portfolio or Segment with similar orders being made simultaneously for other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates. Whenever the Sub-Adviser simultaneously places orders to purchase or sell the same security on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment and one or more other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser, the orders will be allocated as to price and amount among all such accounts in a manner believed to be equitable over time to each account. UBS Global AM recognizes that in some cases this procedure may adversely affect the results obtained for the Portfolio or Segment.</font></div>"

In all such dealings, the Affiliated Broker-Dealers shall be authorized and entitled to retain any commissions, remuneration or profits which may be made in such transactions and shall not be liable to account for the same to UBS Global AM, the Portfolio or the Trust.</font></div>"

Cross Transactions are transactions which may be effected by the Affiliated Broker-Dealers acting for both the Portfolio or the Trust and the counterparty to the transaction. Cross Transactions enable the Sub-Adviser to purchase or sell a block of securities for the Portfolio or the Trust at a set price and possibly avoid an unfavorable price movement that may be created through entrance into the market with such purchase or sale order. As such, the Sub-Adviser believes that Cross Transactions can provide meaningful benefits for the Portfolio and the Trust and its clients generally. UBS Global AM, the Portfolio and the Trust should be aware, however, that in a Cross Transaction an Affiliated Broker-Dealer will be receiving commissions from both sides of the trade and, therefore, there is a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities.</font></div>"

The Sub-Adviser may from time to time seek research assistance and may rely upon resources available to it through its affiliated companies to the extent such actions would not constitute an assignment for purposes of the 1940 Act but in no case shall such assistance and/or reliance relieve the Sub-Adviser of any of its obligations hereunder, nor shall the Portfolio or Segment or UBS Global AM be responsible for any additional fees or expenses hereunder as a result. The Sub-Adviser will determine from time to time what investments will be purchased, retained or sold by the Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-Adviser will be responsible for placing purchase and sell orders for investments and for other related transactions for the Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-Adviser will be responsible for voting proxies of issuers of securities held by the Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-Adviser understands that the Portfolio's assets need to be managed so as to permit the Portfolio to qualify or to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (Code). The Sub-Adviser will provide services under this Agreement in accordance with the Portfolio's investment objective, policies and restrictions as stated in the Trust's currently effective registration statement under the 1940 Act, and any amendments or supplements thereto (Registration Statement).</font></div>"

In no instance will portfolio securities be purchased from or sold to UBS Global AM or the Sub-Adviser, or any affiliated person thereof, except in accordance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Sub-Adviser may aggregate sales and purchase orders with respect to the assets of the Portfolio or Segment with similar orders being made simultaneously for other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates. Whenever the Sub-Adviser simultaneously places orders to purchase or sell the same security on behalf of the Portfolio and one or more other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser, the orders will be allocated as to price and amount among all such accounts in a manner believed to be equitable over time to each account. UBS Global AM recognizes that in some cases this procedure may adversely affect the results obtained for the Portfolio or Segment.</font></div>"

The Sub-Adviser will be responsible for placing purchase and sell orders for investments and for other related transactions for the Portfolio or Segment. The Sub-Adviser understands that the Portfolio's assets need to be managed so as to permit the Portfolio to qualify or to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (Code). The Sub-Adviser will provide services under this Agreement in accordance with the Portfolio's investment objective, policies and restrictions as stated in the Trust's currently effective registration statement under the 1940 Act, and any amendments or supplements thereto (Registration Statement).</font></div>"

Cross Transactions are transactions which may be effected by the Affiliated Broker-Dealers acting for both the Series or the Trust and the counterparty to the transaction. Cross Transactions enable the Sub-Adviser to purchase or sell a block of securities for the Series or the Trust at a set price and possibly avoid an unfavorable price movement that may be created through entrance into the market with such purchase or sale order. As such, the Sub-Adviser believes that Cross Transactions can provide meaningful benefits for the Series and the Trust and its clients generally. UBS Global Americas, the Series and the Trust should be aware, however, that in a Cross Transaction an Affiliated Broker-Dealer will be receiving commissions from both sides of the trade and, therefore, there is a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities.</font></div>"

UBS Global AM acknowledges and agrees that the Sub-Adviser shall not be responsible for taking any action or rendering advice with respect to any class action claim relating to any assets held in the Portfolio or Segment. UBS Global AM will instruct the applicable service providers not to forward to the Sub-Adviser any information concerning such actions. The Sub-Adviser will, however, forward to UBS Global AM any information it receives regarding any legal matters involving any asset held in the Portfolio or Segment.</font></div>"

In no instance will portfolio securities be purchased from or sold to UBS Global AM or the Sub-Adviser, or any affiliated person thereof, except in accordance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Sub-Adviser may aggregate sales and purchase orders with respect to the assets of the Portfolio or Segment with similar orders being made simultaneously for other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates. Whenever the Sub-Adviser simultaneously places orders to purchase or sell the same security on behalf of the Portfolio or Segment and one or more other accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser, the orders will be allocated as to price and amount among all such accounts in a manner believed to be equitable over time to each account. UBS Global AM recognizes that in some cases this procedure may adversely affect the results obtained for the Portfolio or Segment.</font></div>"

Cross Transactions are transactions which may be effected by the Affiliated Broker-Dealers acting for both the Portfolio or the Trust and the counterparty to the transaction. Cross Transactions enable the Sub-Adviser to purchase or sell a block of securities for the Portfolio or the Trust at a set price and possibly avoid an unfavorable price movement that may be created through entrance into the market with such purchase or sale order. As such, the Sub-Adviser believes that Cross Transactions can provide meaningful benefits for the Portfolio and the Trust and its clients generally. UBS Global AM, the Portfolio and the Trust should be aware, however, that in a Cross Transaction an Affiliated Broker-Dealer will be receiving commissions from both sides of the trade and, therefore, there is a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities.</font></div>"

A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the&#160;&#160;maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</font></div>"
