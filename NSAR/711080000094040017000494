      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the
covenants and agreements in this Agreement, the parties hereto
covenant and agree as follows:


ARTICLE I

      TRANSFER OF ASSETS OF THE PREDECESSOR FUND IN EXCHANGE FOR
THE SUCCESSOR FUND SHARES AND ASSUMPTION OF PREDECESSOR FUND
LIABILITIES AND LIQUIDATION OF THE PREDECESSOR FUND

      1.1	THE EXCHANGE.  Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and on the basis of the representations and
warranties contained herein, the Predecessor Fund agrees to
transfer all of the Predecessor Fund's assets as set forth in
paragraph 1.2 to the Successor Fund.  The Successor Fund agrees
in exchange for the Predecessor Fund's assets (i) to deliver to
the Predecessor Fund the number of Successor Fund Shares,
including fractional Successor Fund Shares, computed in the
manner and as of the time and date set forth in paragraph 2.3;
and (ii) to assume all of the liabilities of the Predecessor
Fund, as set forth in paragraph 1.3.  Such transactions shall
take place at the Closing (as defined in paragraph 3.1 below).

      1.2	ASSETS TO BE ACQUIRED.  The assets of the Predecessor
Fund to be acquired by the Successor Fund shall consist of all
property, including, without limitation, all cash, securities,
commodities, interests in futures and dividends or interest
receivables, that is owned by the Predecessor Fund and any
deferred or prepaid expenses shown as an asset on the books of
the Predecessor Fund as of the Closing.
      The Predecessor Fund has provided the Successor Fund with
its most recent audited financial statements, which contain a
list of all of the Predecessor Fund's assets as of the date
thereof.  The Predecessor Fund represents that, as of the date
of the execution of this Agreement, there have been no changes
in its financial position as reflected in said financial
statements other than those occurring in the ordinary course of
its business in connection with the purchase and sale of
portfolio securities, purchases and redemptions of Predecessor
Fund shares, the payment of its normal operating expenses and
the distribution of its net income and net capital gain.  The
Predecessor Fund reserves the right to buy and sell any
securities or other assets in accordance with its investment
objective and policies.

      1.3	LIABILITIES TO BE ASSUMED.  The Predecessor Fund will
endeavor to discharge all of its known liabilities and
obligations prior to the Valuation Time (as defined in
paragraph 2.1 below).  The Successor Fund shall assume all of the
Predecessor Fund's liabilities and obligations of any kind
whatsoever, whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise,
in existence as of the Closing.

      1.4	LIQUIDATION AND DISTRIBUTION.  Immediately after the
Closing, (a) the Predecessor Fund will completely liquidate and
distribute pro rata to the Predecessor Fund's shareholders of
record of each class, determined as of the time of such
distribution (the Predecessor Fund Shareholders), the Successor
Fund Shares of the corresponding class (as set forth in paragraph
2.3) received by the Predecessor Fund pursuant to paragraph 1.1;
and (b) the Predecessor Fund will proceed to terminate in
accordance with applicable laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts as set forth in paragraph 1.8 below.  Such
liquidation and distribution will be accomplished by the transfer
of the Successor Fund Shares then credited to the account of the
Predecessor Fund on the books of the Successor Fund to open
accounts on the share records of the Successor Fund in the names
of the Predecessor Fund Shareholders and representing the
respective pro rata number of Successor Fund Shares, by class,
due such shareholders.  All issued and outstanding shares of the
Predecessor Fund will simultaneously be canceled on the books of
the Predecessor Fund and will be null and void.  The Successor
Fund shall not issue certificates representing the Successor Fund
Shares in connection with such exchange, except for any global
certificate or certificates required by a securities depository
in connection with the establishment of book-entry ownership of
the shares.  Successor Fund Shares distributed to Predecessor
Fund Shareholders will be reflected on the books of the Successor
Fund as uncertificated shares.

      1.5	OWNERSHIP OF SHARES.  Ownership of Successor Fund
Shares will be shown on the books of the Successor Fund's
transfer agent.  Successor Fund Shares will be issued in the
manner described in the Prospectus/Information Statement on
Form N-14 (the Prospectus/Information Statement), which will be
distributed to shareholders of the Predecessor Fund as described
in paragraph 8.3.

      1.6	TRANSFER TAXES.  Any transfer taxes payable upon
issuance of Successor Fund Shares in a name other than the
registered holder of the Predecessor Fund shares on the books of
the Predecessor Fund as of that time shall, as a condition of
such issuance and transfer, be paid by the person to whom such
Successor Fund Shares are to be issued and transferred.

      1.7	REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY.  Any reporting responsibility
of the Predecessor Fund is and shall remain the responsibility of
the Predecessor Fund up to and including the Closing Date and
such later date on which the Predecessor Fund is terminated.

      1.8	TERMINATION.  The Predecessor Trust shall take all
necessary and appropriate steps under applicable law to terminate
the Predecessor Fund promptly following the Closing and the
making of all distributions pursuant to paragraph 1.4, but in no
event later than 12 months following the Closing Date.

      1.9	INITIAL SHARES.  Prior to the Closing, the Successor
Fund will issue one [Class A, Class C and Class Y] share of
beneficial interest of the Successor Fund (the Initial Shares)
to Touchstone or one of its affiliates (the Sole Shareholder)
in exchange for $1.00 per share for the sole purpose of allowing
the Sole Shareholder to approve certain matters to facilitate the
organization of the Successor Fund.  The Initial Shares shall be
redeemed and cancelled by the Successor Fund in exchange for
$1.00 per share prior to the Closing.


ARTICLE II

VALUATION

      2.1	VALUATION OF ASSETS.  The value of the Predecessor
Fund's net assets shall be the value of the assets of the
Predecessor Fund to be acquired by the Successor Fund less the
amount of the Predecessor Fund's liabilities to be assumed by the
Successor Fund as of the close of business on the New York Stock
Exchange on the Closing Date (the Valuation Time), using the
valuation procedures set forth in the Predecessor Trust's
[Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust, as amended from
time to time] (the Predecessor Trust's Declaration of Trust)
and the Predecessor Fund's then current prospectus and statement
of additional information or such other valuation procedures as
shall be mutually agreed upon by the Funds.

      2.2	VALUATION OF SHARES.  The net asset value per share of
each class of the Successor Fund shall be the net asset value per

indenture, instrument, contract, lease or other undertaking to
which the Predecessor Fund is a party or by which it is bound.

of its properties or assets, which, if adversely determined,
would materially and adversely affect its financial condition,
the conduct of its business or its ability to carry out the
Reorganization.  The Predecessor Fund knows of no facts that

otherwise disclosed to and accepted by the Successor Fund.  For
the purposes of this subparagraph (i), a decline in the net

Initial Shares prior to the Closing in exchange for an amount
equal to the consideration received by the Successor Fund for
such Initial Shares so that the Successor Fund will own no
assets at the time of the Closing.

            (d)	[The current prospectus and statement of
additional information of the Successor Fund, as of the date of

litigation, administrative proceeding or investigation of or
before any court or governmental body is currently pending or to
the Successor Fund's knowledge threatened against the Successor
Fund or any of its properties or assets, which, if adversely
determined, would materially and adversely affect its financial
condition, the conduct of its business or its ability to carry
out the Reorganization.  The Successor Fund knows of no facts
that might form the basis for the institution of any such
proceedings and is not a party to or subject to the provisions
of any order, decree or judgment of any court or governmental
body that is reasonably likely to materially and adversely
affect its business or its ability to consummate the
Reorganization or the transactions contemplated herein.

reorganization, moratorium and other laws relating to or
affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.

delivered to the Predecessor Fund, for the account of the
Predecessor Fund Shareholders, pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement will, at the Closing, have been duly authorized and
will, after taking into account the redemption and cancellation
of the Initial Shares, constitute all of the issued and

taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date;
and (iii) all of the Predecessor Fund's net capital gain (as
defined in Section 1222(11) of the Code) realized in all taxable
years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date (after
reduction for any available capital loss carryforward).

      8.5	Each of the Successor Fund and the Predecessor Fund
shall have received an opinion of Vedder Price P.C. substantially
to the effect that, for federal income tax purposes:

            (a)	The transfer by the Predecessor Fund of all its
assets to the Successor Fund solely in exchange for Successor
Fund Shares and the assumption by the Successor Fund of all the
liabilities of the Predecessor Fund, immediately followed by the
pro rata, by class, distribution of all the Successor Fund
Shares so received by the Predecessor Fund to the Predecessor
Fund's shareholders of record in complete liquidation of the
Predecessor Fund and the termination of the Predecessor Fund as
soon as practicable thereafter, will constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the
Code, and the Successor Fund and the Predecessor Fund will each
be a party to a reorganization, within the meaning of
Section 368(b) of the Code, with respect to the Reorganization.

            (b)	No gain or loss will be recognized by the
Successor Fund upon the receipt of all the assets of the
Predecessor Fund solely in exchange for Successor Fund Shares
and the assumption by the Successor Fund of all the liabilities
of the Predecessor Fund.

            (c)	No gain or loss will be recognized by the
Predecessor Fund upon the transfer of all its assets to the
Successor Fund solely in exchange for Successor Fund Shares and
the assumption by the Successor Fund of all the liabilities of
the Predecessor Fund or upon the distribution (whether actual or
constructive) of the Successor Fund Shares so received to the
Predecessor Fund's shareholders solely in exchange for such
shareholders' shares of the Predecessor Fund in complete
liquidation of the Predecessor Fund.

            (d)	No gain or loss will be recognized by the
Predecessor Fund's shareholders upon the exchange, pursuant to
this Agreement, of all their shares of the Predecessor Fund
solely for Successor Fund Shares.

            (e)	The aggregate basis of the Successor Fund Shares
received by each Predecessor Fund Shareholder pursuant to the
Reorganization will be the same as the aggregate basis of the
Predecessor Fund shares exchanged therefor by such shareholder.

            (f)	The holding period of the Successor Fund Shares
received by each Predecessor Fund Shareholder in the
Reorganization will include the period during which the shares
of the Predecessor Fund exchanged therefor were held by such
shareholder, provided such Predecessor Fund shares were held as
capital assets at the effective time of the Reorganization.

            (g)	The basis of the assets of the Predecessor Fund
received by the Successor Fund will be the same as the basis of
such assets in the hands of the Predecessor Fund immediately
before the effective time of the Reorganization.

            (h)	The holding period of the assets of the
Predecessor Fund received by the Successor Fund will include the
period during which such assets were held by the Predecessor
Fund.

      No opinion will be expressed as to (1) the effect of the
Reorganization on the Predecessor Fund, the Successor Fund or
any Predecessor Fund Shareholder with respect to any asset
(including without limitation any stock held in a passive
foreign investment company as defined in Section 1297(a) of the
Code) as to which any unrealized gain or loss is required to be
recognized for federal income tax purposes (i) at the end of a
taxable year or upon the termination thereof, or (ii) upon the
transfer of such asset regardless of whether such transfer would
otherwise be a non-taxable transaction under the Code, or
(2) any other federal tax issues (except those set forth above)
and all state, local or foreign tax issues of any kind.

      Such opinion shall be based on customary assumptions and
limitations and such representations as Vedder Price P.C. may
reasonably request.  The Predecessor Fund and Successor Fund
will cooperate to make and certify the accuracy of such
representations.  Such opinion may contain such assumptions and
limitations as shall be in the opinion of such counsel
appropriate to render the opinions expressed.  Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, neither the Successor Fund nor
the Predecessor Fund may waive the conditions set forth in this
paragraph 8.5.


ARTICLE IX

willful default, there shall be no liability for damages on the

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of Touchstone Credit
Opportunities Fund, Touchstone Global Growth Fund, Touchstone
International Small Cap Fund, Touchstone Large Cap Fund, Touchstone
Large Company Growth Fund, Touchstone Ohio Tax-Free Bond Fund,
Touchstone Small Cap Value Opportunities Fund, and Touchstone Value
Fund.

In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of
Touchstone Credit Opportunities Fund, Touchstone Global Growth Fund,
Touchstone International Small Cap Fund, Touchstone Large Cap Fund,
Touchstone Large Company Growth Fund, Touchstone Ohio Tax-Free Bond
Fund, Touchstone Small Cap Value Opportunities Fund and Touchstone
Value Fund (eight of the funds constituting the Touchstone Strategic
Trust) (the Trust) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2017, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust's internal
control over financial reporting, including controls over
safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing
procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial
statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Trust's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we
express no such opinion.

The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In
fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management
are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of
controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when
the design or operation of a control does not allow management or
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned
functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's
annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis.

Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first
paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in
internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards
established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trust's internal
control over financial reporting and its operation, including
controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a
material weakness as defined above as of June 30, 2017.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of
management and the Board of Trustees of the Trust and the Securities
and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be
used by anyone other than these specified parties.
