"3952","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"3953","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Franklin"
"3954","Strategic Series:"
"3955","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"3956","statements of Franklin Biotechnology Discovery Fund,"
"3957","Franklin Flexible Alpha Bond Fund, Franklin Focused"
"3958","Core Equity Fund, Franklin Growth Opportunities Fund,"
"3959","Franklin Natural Resources Fund, Franklin Small Cap"
"3960","Growth Fund, Franklin Small-Mid Cap Growth Fund, Franklin"
"3961","Strategic Income Fund (constituting portfolios of Franklin"
"3962","Strategic Series (the Funds)) as of and for the year"
"3963","ended April 30, 2018, in accordance with the standards of"
"3964","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"3965","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3966","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"3967","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"3968","of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"3969","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"3970","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"3971","Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"3972","we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"3973","internal control over financial reporting."
"3974","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"3975","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"3976","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"3977","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"3978","related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"3979","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"3980","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"3981","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"3982","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"3983","A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"3984","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"3985","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"3986","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"3987","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"3988","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"3989","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"3990","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"3991","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"3992","fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"3993","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"3994","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"3995","financial statements."
"3996","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"3997","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"3998","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"3999","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"4000","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"4001","procedures may deteriorate."
"4002","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"4003","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"4004","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"4005","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"4006","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"4007","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"4008","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds'"
"4009","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"4010","detected on a timely basis."
"4011","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"4012","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"4013","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"4014","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"4015","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"4016","(United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"4017","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"4018","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be material"
"4019","weaknesses as defined above as of April 30, 2018."
"4020","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"4021","and the Board of Trustees of Franklin Strategic Series and the Securities"
"4022","and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used"
"4023","by anyone other than these specified parties."

"4499","SUPPLEMENT DATED APRIL 24, 2018"
"4500","TO THE PROSPECTUS DATED SEPTEMBER 1, 2017"
"4501","OF"
"4502","FRANKLIN STRATEGIC SERIES"
"4503","(Franklin Focused Core Equity Fund)"
"4504","Effective June 1, 2018, the prospectus of the Fund is amended as"
"4505","follows:"
"4506","I. The name of the Fund will be changed from Franklin Focused Core"
"4507","Equity Fund to Franklin Select U.S. Equity Fund."
"4508","II. The following replaces the Fund Summary - Principal Investment
Strategies section on page 4 of the prospectus:"
"4509","Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80%"
"4510","of its net assets in U.S. equity securities. The Fund invests"
"4511","primarily to predominantly in equity securities of large"
"4512","capitalization companies, which are companies similar in"
"4513","size to those in the S&P 500 Index. The equity securities"
"4514","in which the Fund invests are predominantly common stock."
"4515","The Fund generally seeks to maintain a portfolio consisting"
"4516","of securities of approximately 20-50 companies. Although"
"4517","the Fund seeks investments across a number of sectors,"
"4518","from time to time, based on economic conditions, the Fund"
"4519","may have significant positions in particular sectors such"
"4520","as information technology, healthcare and industrials. The"
"4521","Fund also may invest a portion of its total assets in foreign"
"4522","securities."
"4523","The investment manager is a research-driven, bottom-up"
"4524","fundamental investor seeking companies that exhibit a combination"
"4525","of growth potential, quality, and reasonable valuation. The"
"4526","investment manager assesses growth potential by considering"
"4527","companies that it believes are positioned for growth in revenue,"
"4528","earnings or assets. In assessing valuation, the investment manager"
"4529","considers whether security prices fully reflect the balance of the"
"4530","long-term growth prospects relative to business and financial"
"4531","risks. The investment manager places a particular emphasis on"
"4532","quality and assessing downside risk, believing that"
"4533","important attributes of quality include experienced and talented"
"4534","management teams, favorable competitive positioning, and financial"
"4535","strength reflected in metrics including profitability, free cash"
"4536","generation, and returns on capital employed."
"4537","III. The following replaces the Franklin Focused Core Equity
Fund - Fund Details - Principal Investment Policies and Practices"
"4538","section on page 30 of the prospectus:"
"4539","Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of"
"4540","its net assets in U.S. equity securities. Shareholders will be"
"4541","given at least 60 days' advance notice of any change to the 80%"
"4542","policy. The Fund invests primarily to predominantly in equity"
"4543","securities of large capitalization companies, which are companies"
"4544","similar in size to those in the S&P 500 Index. That index consists"
"4545","of 500 leading companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy,"
"4546","with a median market capitalization in excess of"
"4547","$20.741 billion as of March 29, 2018. The equity securities in"
"4548","which the Fund invests are predominantly common stock."
"4549","The Fund generally seeks to maintain a portfolio consisting of"
"4550","securities of approximately 20-50 companies. Although the Fund"
"4551","seeks investments across a number of sectors, from time to time,"
"4552","based on economic conditions, the Fund may have significant"
"4553","positions in particular sectors such as information technology,"
"4554","healthcare and industrials. The Fund also may invest a portion"
"4555","of its total assets in foreign securities."
"4556","An equity security represents a proportionate share of the"
"4557","ownership of a company; its value is based on the success or"
"4558","failure of the company's business, any income paid to stockholders,"
"4559","the value of its assets and general market conditions. Common"
"4560","stocks and preferred stocks are examples of equity securities."
"4561","IV. The following replaces the Franklin Focused Core Equity Fund -
Fund Details - Principal Investment Policies and Practices -
Portfolio Selection section beginning on page 30 of the prospectus:"
"4562","Portfolio Selection"
"4563","The investment manager is a research-driven, bottom-up fundamental"
"4564","investor seeking companies that exhibit a combination of growth"
"4565","potential, quality, and reasonable valuation. The investment"
"4566","manager assesses growth potential by considering companies that"
"4567","it believes are positioned for growth in revenue, earnings or"
"4568","assets. In assessing valuation, the investment manager considers"
"4569","whether security prices fully reflect the balance of the long-term"
"4570","growth prospects relative to business and financial risks. The"
"4571","investment manager places a particular emphasis on quality and"
"4572","assessing downside risk, believing that"

"4574","management teams, favorable competitive positioning, and financial"
"4575","strength reflected in metrics including profitability, free cash"
"4576","generation, and returns on capital employed. This quality"
"4577","analysis generally includes an assessment by the investment"
"4578","manager of the potential impacts of any material environmental,"
"4579","social and governance (ESG) factors on the long-term risk"
"4580","and return profile of a company."
"4581","The investment manager generally uses a team of analysts to"
"4582","help provide in-depth industry expertise and uses both qualitative"
"4583","and quantitative analysis to evaluate companies."
"4584","V. The following replaces the Franklin Focused Core Equity Fund -
Fund Details - Principal Risks - Focus Risk section beginning on"
"4585","page 32 of the prospectus:"
"4586","Focus"
"4587","The greater the Fund's exposure to any single type of investment -"
"4588","including investment in a given industry, sector, region, country,"
"4589","issuer, or type of security - the greater the losses the Fund"
"4590","may experience upon any single economic, business, political,"
"4591","regulatory, or other occurrence. As a result, there may be more"
"4592","fluctuation in the price of the Fund's shares."
"4593","Technology companies. Technology company stocks have been subject to"
"4594","abrupt or erratic price movements, especially over the short term,"
"4595","due to the rapid pace of product change and development affecting"
"4596","such companies. Technology companies are subject to significant"
"4597","competitive pressures, such as new market entrants, aggressive"
"4598","pricing and tight profit margins. Prices of technology company"
"4599","stocks often change collectively without regard to the merits"
"4600","of individual companies."
"4601","Healthcare companies. The activities of healthcare companies"
"4602","may be funded or subsidized by federal and state governments."
"4603","If government funding and subsidies are reduced or discontinued,"
"4604","the profitability of these companies could be adversely affected."
"4605","Healthcare companies may also be affected by government policies"
"4606","on healthcare reimbursements, regulatory approval for new drugs"
"4607","and medical products, and similar matters. They are also subject"
"4608","to legislative risk, i.e., the risks associated with the reform"
"4609","of the healthcare system through legislation."
"4610","Industrials. The stock prices of companies in the industrials"
"4611","sector are affected by supply and demand both for their specific"
"4612","product or service and for industrials sector products in general."
"4613","Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by"
"4614","changes in government regulation, world events and economic"
"4615","conditions. In addition, these companies are at risk for"
"4616","environmental damage and product liability claims. Companies"
"4617","in this sector could be adversely affected by commodity price"
"4618","volatility, changes in exchange rates, imposition of export or"
"4619","import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources,"
"4620","technological developments and labor relations."
