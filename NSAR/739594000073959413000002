"523","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"524","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"525","Federated U.S. Government Securities Fund: 1-3 Years:"
"526","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"527","statements of Federated U.S. Government Securities"
"528","Fund: 1-3 Years (the Fund) as of and for the year ended"
"529","February 28, 2013, in accordance with the standards of"
"530","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"531","we considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"532","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"533","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"534","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"535","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"536","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"537","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"538","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express"
"539","no such opinion. The management of the Fund is responsible"
"540","for establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"541","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"542","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"543","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"544","A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"545","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"546","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"547","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"548","with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's"
"549","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"550","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"551","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"552","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"553","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"554","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"555","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"556","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"557","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"558","accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"559","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"560","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"561","use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"562","material effect on the financial statements. Because of"
"563","its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"564","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"565","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"566","future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"567","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"568","that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures"
"569","may deteriorate. A deficiency in internal control over"
"570","financial reporting exists when the design or"
"571","operation of a control does not allow management or"
"572","employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"573","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"574","on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"575","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"576","over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"577","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"578","company's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"579","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"580","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"581","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"582","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"583","all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"584","material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"585","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"586","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal"
"587","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"588","including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"589","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above"
"590","as of February 28, 2013. This report is intended solely"
"591","for the information and use of management and the Board"
"592","of Trustees of the Fund and the Securities and Exchange"
"593","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be"
"594","used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"606","Since February 2004, Federated and related entities"
"607","(collectively, Federated) have been named as"
"608","defendants in several lawsuits, that were consolidated"
"609","into a single action in the United States District"
"610","Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania,"
"611","alleging excessive advisory fees involving one of"
"612","the Federated-sponsored mutual funds.  Without admitting"
"613","the validity of any claim, Federated reached a"
"614","final settlement with the Plaintiffs in these cases in"
"615","April 2011."

"624","Pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,"
"625","and the General Rules and Regulations thereunder, a"
"626","Registration Statement on Form N-14, SEC File No. 333-"

"634","Service Shares of the Surviving Fund were distributed"
"635","on a pro rata basis to the shareholders of the Acquired Fund"
"636","in complete liquidation and termination of the Acquired Fund."
"637","As a result, effective September 21, 2012, each shareholder"
"638","of the Acquired Fund became the owner of Surviving Fund"
"639","Service Shares having a total net asset value equal to the"
"640","total net asset value of his or her holdings in the"
"641","Acquired Fund."
"642","The Agreement and Plan of Reorganization providing for the"
"643","transfer of the assets of the Acquired Fund to the Surviving"
"644","Fund was approved by the Board of Trustees at their Special"
"645","Meeting held on June 25, 2012 and was also approved by Acquired Fund"
"646","shareholders at a Special Meeting held on September 19, 2012."
"647","The Agreement and Plan of Reorganization for this merger is hereby"
"648","incorporated by reference from the definitive Prospectus/Proxy"
"649","Statement filed with the SEC on August 8, 2012."
