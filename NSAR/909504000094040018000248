"1274","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1275","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"1276","GAMCO Global Series Funds, Inc."
"1277","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1278","statements of GAMCO Global Series Funds, Inc. (the Funds)"
"1279","(including The Gabelli Global Rising Income and Dividend Fund,"
"1280","The GAMCO Global Growth Fund, The Gabelli International Small"
"1281","Cap Fund, and The Gabelli Global Content & Connectivity Fund),"
"1282","as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, in accordance"
"1283","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1284","Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal control"
"1285","over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1286","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"1287","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1288","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1289","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1290","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1291","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1292","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"1293","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1294","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1295","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1296","related costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"1297","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1298","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1299","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1300","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"1301","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1302","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1303","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"1304","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1305","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1306","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1307","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"1308","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1309","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1310","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"1311","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1312","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"1313","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1314","statements."
"1315","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1316","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1317","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1318","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1319","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"1320","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1321","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1322","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1323","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1324","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"1325","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1326","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1327","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1328","material misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"1329","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"1330","timely basis."
"1331","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1332","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1333","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1334","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1335","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1336","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"1337","Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1338","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that"
"1339","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"1340","December 31, 2017."
"1341","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1342","management and the Board of Directors of the Funds and the"
"1343","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"1344","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1356","PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION PURSUANT TO RULE 12b-1"
"1357","OF"
"1358","THE GAMCO GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS FUND"
"1359","      WHEREAS, THE GAMCO GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS FUND (the"
"1360","Fund) is a series of GAMCO Global Series Funds, Inc., a"
"1361","Maryland Corporation (the Corporation) that engages in"
"1362","business as an open-end management investment company and is"
"1363","registered as such under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as"
"1364","amended (the Act);"
"1365","      WHEREAS, the Fund has issued and is authorized to issue"
"1366","shares of Common Stock (Shares);"
"1367","      WHEREAS, G.distributors, LLC (the Distributor) presently"
"1368","serves as the principal distributor of the Shares pursuant to"
"1369","the distribution agreement between the Fund and the Distributor,"
"1370","which distribution agreement has been duly approved by the Board"
"1371","of Directors of the Corporation (the Board), in accordance"
"1372","with the requirements of the Act (the Distribution Agreement);"
"1373","      WHEREAS, the Fund has established and plans to offer shares"
"1374","of its common stock denominated as Class T Shares (the Class T
Shares), pursuant to Rule 18f-3 under the Act that permits the"
"1375","Fund to implement a multiple distribution system providing"
"1376","investors with the option of purchasing shares of various"
"1377","classes;"
"1378","      WHEREAS, the Board as a whole, and the directors who are"
"1379","not interested persons of the Fund (as defined in the Act) and"
"1380","who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the"
"1381","operation of the Plan or any agreements related to the Plan (the"
"1382","Disinterested Directors), have determined, after review of all"
"1383","information and consideration of all pertinent facts reasonably"
"1384","necessary to an informed determination, that it would be"
"1385","desirable to adopt a plan of distribution for the Class T Shares"
"1386","and that, in the exercise of reasonable business judgment and in"
"1387","light of their fiduciary duties, that there is a reasonable"
"1388","likelihood that a plan of distribution containing the terms set"
"1389","forth herein (the Plan) will benefit the Fund and the"
"1390","shareholders of the Class T Shares, and have accordingly"
"1391","approved the Plan by votes cast in person at a meeting called"
"1392","for the purpose of voting on the Plan; and"
"1393","      WHEREAS, this Plan governs the Class T Shares and does not"
"1394","relate to any class of shares which may be offered and sold by"
"1395","the Fund other than the Class T Shares."
"1396","      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the Fund"
"1397","hereby adopts the Plan in accordance with Rule 12b-1 under the"
"1398","Act on the following terms and conditions:"
"1399","1. In consideration of the services to be provided, and the"
"1400","expenses to be incurred, by the Distributor pursuant to the"
"1401","Distribution Agreement, the Fund will pay to the Distributor as"
"1402","distribution payments (the Payments) in connection with the"
"1403","distribution of Class T Shares an aggregate amount at a rate of"
"1404","0.25% per year of the average daily net assets of the Class T"
"1405","Shares. Such Payments shall be accrued daily and paid monthly in"
"1406","arrears or shall be accrued and paid at such other intervals as"
"1407","the Board shall determine. The Fund's obligation hereunder shall"
"1408","be limited to the assets of the Class T Shares and shall not"
"1409","constitute an obligation of the Fund except out of such assets"
"1410","and shall not constitute an obligation of any shareholder of the"
"1411","Fund."
"1412","2. It is understood that the Payments made by the Fund under this"
"1413","Plan will be used by the Distributor for the purpose of"
"1414","financing or assisting in the financing of any activity which is"
"1415","primarily intended to result in the sale of Class T Shares. The"
"1416","scope of the foregoing shall be interpreted by the Board, whose"
"1417","decision shall be conclusive except to the extent it contravenes"
"1418","established legal authority. Without in any way limiting the"
"1419","discretion of the Board, the following activities are hereby"
"1420","declared to be primarily intended to result in the sale of Class"
"1421","T Shares: advertising the Class T Shares or the Fund's"
"1422","investment adviser's mutual fund activities; compensating"
"1423","underwriters, dealers, brokers, banks and other selling entities"
"1424","(including the Distributor and its affiliates) and sales and"
"1425","marketing personnel of any of them for sales of Class T Shares,"
"1426","whether in a lump sum or on a continuous, periodic, contingent,"

"1428","brokers, banks and other servicing entities and servicing"
"1429","personnel (including the Fund's investment adviser and its"
"1430","personnel) of any of them for providing services to shareholders"
"1431","of the Fund relating to their investment in the Class T Shares,"
"1432","including assistance in connection with inquiries relating to"
"1433","shareholder accounts; the production and dissemination of"
"1434","prospectuses (including statements of additional information) of"

"1441","any activity for which Payment is authorized by the Board; and"
"1442","profit to the Distributor and its affiliates arising out of"
"1443","their provision of shareholder services. Notwithstanding the"
"1444","foregoing, this Plan does not require the Distributor or any of"
"1445","its affiliates to perform any specific type or level of"
"1446","distribution activities or shareholder services or to incur any"
"1447","specific level of expenses for activities covered by this"
"1448","Section 2. In addition, Payments made in a particular year shall"
"1449","not be refundable whether or not such Payments exceed the"
"1450","expenses incurred for that year pursuant to this Section 2."

"1452","appropriate written agreements with the Distributor and each"
"1453","other person to whom the Fund intends to make any Payment, and"
"1454","the Distributor is hereby authorized and directed to enter into"
"1455","appropriate written agreements with each person to whom the"
"1456","Distributor intends to make any payments in the nature of a"

"1458","any agreement or arrangement with respect to which the party to"
"1459","whom Payment is to be made does not have the purpose set forth"
"1460","in Section 2 above (such as the printer in the case of the"
"1461","printing of a prospectus or a newspaper in the case of an"
"1462","advertisement) unless the Board determines that such an"
"1463","agreement or arrangement should be treated as a related"
"1464","agreement for purposes of Rule 12b-1 under the Act."
"1465","4. Each agreement required to be in writing by Section 3 must"
"1466","contain the provisions required by Rule 12b-1 under the Act and"
"1467","must be approved by a majority of the Board (Board Approval)"
"1468","and by a majority of the Disinterested Directors (Disinterested
Director Approval), by vote cast in person at a meeting called"
"1469","for the purposes of voting on such agreement. All determinations"
"1470","or authorizations of the Board hereunder shall be made by Board"
"1471","Approval and Disinterested Director Approval."
"1472","5. The officers, investment adviser or Distributor of the Fund,"
"1473","as appropriate, shall provide to the Board and the Board shall"
"1474","review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts"
"1475","expended pursuant to this Plan and the purposes for which such"
"1476","Payments were made."
"1477","6. To the extent any activity is covered by Section 2 and is also"
"1478","an activity which the Fund may pay for on behalf of the Class T"
"1479","Shares without regard to the existence or terms and conditions"
"1480","of a plan of distribution under Rule 12b-1 of the Act, this Plan"
"1481","shall not be construed to prevent or restrict the Fund from"
"1482","paying such amounts outside of this Plan and without limitation"
"1483","hereby and without such payments being included in calculation"
"1484","of Payments subject to the limitation set forth in Section 1."
"1485","7. This Plan may not be amended in any material respect without"
"1486","Board Approval and Disinterested Director Approval and may not"
"1487","be amended to increase the maximum level of Payments permitted"
"1488","hereunder without such approvals and further approval by a vote"
"1489","of at least a majority of the Class T Shares. This Plan may"
"1490","continue in effect for longer than one year after its adoption"
"1491","only as long as such continuance is specifically approved at"
"1492","least annually by Board Approval and by Disinterested Director"
"1493","Approval."
"1494","8. This Plan may be terminated at any time by a vote of the"
"1495","Disinterested Director, cast in person at a meeting called for"
"1496","the purposes of voting on such termination, or by a vote of at"
"1497","least a majority of the Class T Shares."
"1498","9. For purposes of this Plan the terms interested person and"
"1499","related agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them in"
"1500","the Act and the rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange"
"1501","Commission thereunder and the term vote of a majority of the
Class T Shares shall mean the vote, at the annual or a special"
"1502","meeting of the holders of the Class T Shares duly called, (a) of"
"1503","67% or more of the Class T Shares present at such meeting, if"
