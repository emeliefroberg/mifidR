"1271","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1272","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1273","Franklin Alternative Strategies Funds:"
"1274","In planning and performing our audit of the consolidated financial"
"1275","statements of Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund and Franklin"
"1276","K2 Alternative Strategies Fund, two of the funds constituting Franklin"
"1277","Alternative Strategies Funds (the  Trust) as of and for the year"
"1278","ended May 31, 2015, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1279","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1280","Trust's internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"1281","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1282","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the consolidated"
"1283","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1284","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"1285","the Trust's  internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"1286","express no such opinion."
"1287","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"1288","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1289","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"1290","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"1291","company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed"
"1292","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"1293","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"1294","purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"1295","company's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1296","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"1297","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"1298","and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1299","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1300","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1301","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"1302","the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1303","management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1304","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1305","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"1306","material effect on the consolidated financial statements."
"1307","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1308","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"1309","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"1310","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"1311","that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1312","deteriorate."
"1313","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1314","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1315","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"1316","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness"
"1317","is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"1318","over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"1319","that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial"
"1320","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1321","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial"
"1322","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"1323","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"1324","that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1325","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we"
"1326","noted no deficiencies in the Trust's internal control over financial"
"1327","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1328","securities that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above"
"1329","as of May 31, 2015."
"1330","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"1331","and the Board of Trustees of Franklin Alternative Strategies Funds and"
"1332","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"1333","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."
