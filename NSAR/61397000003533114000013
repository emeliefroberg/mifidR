"2919","seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission rates which are reasonable in"

"2924","transaction if the Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage"
"2925","and research services provided by such broker or dealer. This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction"

"2939","Portfolio experienced better or worse performance than the Standard and Poor's 500 Index (the &quot;Index&quot;). The Performance Adjustment"
"2940","is not cumulative. An increased fee will result even though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the"
"2941","performance period has been behind that of the Index, and, conversely, a reduction in the fee will be made for a month even though the"
"2942","performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been ahead of that of the Index. The Basic"
"2943","Fee and the Performance Adjustment will be computed as follows:"

"2950","Management Contracts with the Adviser and currently have Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with Fidelity SelectCo,"
"2951","LLC, are included. The Group Fee Rate shall be determined on a cumulative basis pursuant to the following schedule:"

"3954","</P>"
"3955","<P ALIGN=CENTER>ON INTERNAL CONTROL REQUIRED BY FORM N-SAR"
"3956","</P>"
"3957","<P ALIGN=LEFT>To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Fidelity Magellan Fund:"
"3958","</P>"
"3959","<P ALIGN=LEFT>"
"3960","</P>"
"3961","<P ALIGN=LEFT>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Fidelity Magellan Fund as of and for the year"
"3962","ended March 31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"3963","(United States), we considered the Trust's internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"3964","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"3965","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,  but not for the purpose of expressing"
"3966","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not"
"3967","express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"3968","</P>"
"3969","<P ALIGN=LEFT>The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"3970","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"3971","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"3972","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"3973","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"3974","company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"3975","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"3976","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"3977","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"3978","and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"3979","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"3980","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3981","</P>"
"3982","<P ALIGN=LEFT>Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"3983","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3984","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"3985","deteriorate."
"3986","</P>"
"3987","<P ALIGN=LEFT>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"3988","allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3989","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"3990","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Trust's"
"3991","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3992","</P>"
"3993","<P ALIGN=LEFT>Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the"
"3994","first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that"
"3995","might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"3996","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trust's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"3997","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"3998","above as of March 31, 2014."
