"532","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"533","The Board of Directors and Shareholders:"
"534","Prudential Investment Portfolios 6:"
"535","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"536","of Prudential California Muni Income Fund (the Fund), a series"
"537","of Prudential Investment Portfolios 6, as of and for the year"
"538","ended August 31, 2017, in accordance with the standards of the"
"539","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"540","considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"541","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"542","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"543","our opinion on the Fund's financial statements and to comply"
"544","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"545","expressing opinions on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"546","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"547","such opinion."
"548","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"549","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"550","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"551","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"552","related costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"553","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"554","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"555","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"556","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"557","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"558","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"559","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"560","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"561","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"562","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"563","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"564","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"565","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"566","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"567","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"568","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's"
"569","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"570","statements."
"571","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"572","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"573","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"574","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"575","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"576","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"577","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"578","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"579","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"580","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"581","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"582","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"583","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"584","material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial"
"585","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"586","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"587","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"588","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"589","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"590","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"591","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"592","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"593","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that"
"594","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"595","August 31, 2017."
"596","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"597","management and the Board of Directors of the Fund and the"
"598","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"599","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"618","Assistant Secretary of Prudential Investment Portfolios 6, a"
"619","trust with transferable shares established under Massachusetts"
"620","law of the type commonly called a Massachusetts business trust"
"621","(the Trust), DOES HEREBY CERTIFY that, pursuant to the"
"622","authority conferred upon the Trustees of the Trust by Section"
"623","6.9 of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust dated"
"624","August 17, 1994, as amended (the Declaration of Trust), and"
"625","pursuant to the affirmative vote of a majority of the Trustees"
"626","at a meeting duly called and held on September 13, 2017:"
"627","      1.	The Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation"
"628","dated February 1, 2010, is hereby further amended and restated"
"629","effective September 13, 2017 to read in its entirety as follows:"
"630","      a. The shares of beneficial interest of the Trust (the"
"631","Shares) shall be divided into one series, Prudential"
"632","California Muni Income Fund (a Fund).  The shares of the Fund"
"633","shall be classified into five classes (each, a Class),"
"634","designated Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares,"
"635","Class Q Shares, and Class Z Shares, respectively, of which"
"636","an unlimited number may be issued.  Class A Shares, Class B"
"637","Shares, Class C Shares, and Class Z Shares outstanding on the"
"638","date on which the amendments provided for herein become"
"639","effective shall be and shall continue to be Class A Shares,"
"640","Class B Shares, Class C Shares, and Class Z Shares of the Fund."
"641","      b. The holders of Shares of each Class shall be considered"
"642","Shareholders of the Trust for all purposes (including, without"
"643","limitation, for purposes of receiving reports and notices and"
"644","the right to vote) and, for matters reserved to the Shareholders"
"645","of one or more other Classes by the Declaration of Trust or by"
"646","any instrument establishing and designating a particular Class,"
"647","or as required by the Investment Company Act of 1940 and/or the"
"648","rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"649","thereunder (collectively, as from time to time in effect, the"
"650","1940 Act) or other applicable laws.  The holders of Shares of"
"651","each Class shall be entitled to one vote per Share, and to a"
"652","fraction of a vote proportional to each fractional Share held,"
"653","on all matters on which Shares of that Class shall be entitled"
"654","to vote, all as provided in the Declaration of Trust."
"655","      c. The Shares of each Class shall represent an equal"
"656","proportionate interest in the share of such Class in the Trust"
"657","Property, adjusted for any liabilities specifically allocable to"
"658","the Shares of that Class, and each Share of a Class shall have"
"659","identical voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights, and"
"660","the same terms and conditions, as the Shares of each other"
"661","Class, except that the expenses related directly or indirectly"
"662","to the distribution of the Shares of a Class, and any service"
"663","fees to which such Class is subject (as determined by the"
"664","Trustees), shall be borne solely by such Class, and such"
"665","expenses shall be appropriately reflected in the determination"
"666","of the net asset value and the dividend, distribution and"
"667","liquidation rights of such Class."
"668","      d. Each Class shall be subject to such asset-based charges"
"669","as may be imposed pursuant to a plan under Rule 12b-1 of the"
"670","1940 Act (a Plan) in effect for such Class, and/or to such"
"671","service fees for the maintenance of shareholder accounts and"
"672","personal services for such Class in such amounts as shall be"
"673","determined by the Trustees from time to time, and the Shares of"
"674","each Class may be issued and sold subject to such sales charges"
"675","and/or contingent deferred sales charges, and upon such other"
"676","terms, as may from time to time be determined by the Trustees"
"677","and described in the Trust's then current registration statement"
"678","under the Securities Act."
"679","      e. Subject to compliance with the requirements of the 1940"
"680","Act, the Trustees shall have the authority to provide (a) that"
"681","holders of Shares of any Class shall have the right to convert"
"682","such Shares into shares of such one or more other registered"
"683","investment companies as shall have agreed with the Trust to"
"684","accord such shareholders such right, (b) that holders of any"
"685","Class of Shares shall have the right to convert such Shares into"
"686","Shares of one or more other Classes, and (c) that Shares of any"
"687","Class shall be automatically converted into Shares of another"
"688","Class, in each case in accordance with such requirements and"
"689","procedures as the Trustees may from time to time establish, all"
"690","as may be specified for the purpose in the Trust's then current"
"691","registration statement under the Securities Act applicable to"
"692","the Shares accorded such right or rights."
"693","      f. Shareholders of each Class shall vote as a separate"
"694","Class on any matter to the extent required by, and any matter"
"695","shall be deemed to have been effectively acted upon with respect"
"696","to any Class as provided in, Rule 18f-2 under the 1940 Act, as"
"697","from time to time in effect, or any successor rule, and by the"
"698","Declaration of Trust.  Except as otherwise required by the 1940"
"699","Act, the Shareholders of each Class, voting as a separate Class,"
"700","shall have sole and exclusive voting rights with respect to"
"701","matters relating to expenses being borne solely by such Class."
"702","      g. The Trustees from time to time in office shall have the"
"703","authority at any time and from time to time to reallocate assets"
"704","and expenses or to change the designation of any Series or Class"
"705","now or hereafter created, or otherwise to change the special and"
"706","relative rights of any such Series or Class, provided, that no"
"707","such change shall adversely affect the rights of holders of"
"708","outstanding Shares of any Series or Class."
"709","      2.	All capitalized terms which are not defined herein"
"710","shall have the same meanings as are assigned to those terms in"
"711","the Declaration."
"712","      The Trustees further direct that, upon the execution of"
"713","this Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation, the Trust"
"714","take all necessary action to file a copy of this Amended and"
"715","Restated Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State"
"716","of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and at any other place"
"717","required by law or by the Declaration."
