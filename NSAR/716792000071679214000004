"3490","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"3491","Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"3492","First Investors Tax Exempt Funds"
"3493","40 Wall Street"
"3494","New York, New York 10005"
"3495","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of First"
"3496","Investors Tax Exempt Funds (comprising, respectively, the Tax Exempt Income"
"3497","Fund, Tax Exempt Opportunities Fund, California Fund, Connecticut Fund,"
"3498","Massachusetts Fund, Michigan Fund, Minnesota Fund, New Jersey Fund, New York"
"3499","Fund, North Carolina Fund, Ohio Fund, Oregon Fund, Pennsylvania Fund"
"3500","and Virginia Fund) (the Funds) for the year ended December 31, 2013, in"
"3501","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"3502","Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"3503","financial reporting, including control activities for safeguarding"
"3504","securities, as a basis for designing our audit procedures for the purpose"
"3505","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"3506","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"3507","on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3508","reporting.   Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3509","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"3510","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"3511","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"3512","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"3513","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"3514","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"3515","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"3516","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal"
"3517","control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"3518","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"3519","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"3520","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"3521","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"3522","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"3523","and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"3524","authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"3525","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"3526","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"3527","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3528","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"3529","may not prevent or detect misstatements.   Also, projections of any"
"3530","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"3531","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"3532","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3533","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"3534","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"3535","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"3536","detect misstatements on a timely basis.   A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"3537","or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"3538","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"3539","the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented"
"3540","or detected on a timely basis."
"3541","Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"3542","First Investors Tax Exempt Funds"
"3543","Page Two"
"3544","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"3545","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3546","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"3547","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"3548","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).   However, we noted no"
"3549","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"3550","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider"
"3551","to be material weaknesses, as defined above, as of December 31, 2013."

"3553","Shareholders and Board of Trustees of the First Investors Tax Exempt Funds"

"4071","	the death or incapacity of the maker of that proxy is"

"4078","	otherwise specifically limited by their terms, proxies"

"4080","	of a Shareholders' meeting.  A proxy purporting to be"
"4081","	executed by or on behalf of a Shareholder shall be"
"4082","	deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its"
"4083","	exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall"

"4105","	Trust shall so act, and if the Secretary has not designated"
"4106","	a person, then the meeting shall elect a secretary for the"
"4107","	meeting."
"4108","      The Board of Trustees of the Trust shall be entitled to make"
"4109","	such rules and regulations for the conduct of meetings of"
"4110","	Shareholders as it shall deem necessary, appropriate or"
"4111","	convenient.  Subject to such rules and regulations of the"
"4112","	Board of Trustees, if any, the chairperson of any meeting"
"4113","	of the Shareholders shall determine the order of business"
"4114","	and the procedures for conduct of business at the meeting,"
"4115","	including regulation of the manner of voting, the conduct"
"4116","	of discussion, the appointment of inspectors and the"
"4117","	determination of all questions relating to the"
"4118","	qualifications of voters, the validity of proxies, and"
"4119","	the acceptance or rejection of votes."
"4120","      Section 8. Record Date."
"4121","        The Trustees may fix in advance a date up to one-hundred"
"4122","	and twenty (120) days before the date of any Shareholders'"
"4123","	meeting as a record date for the determination of the"
"4124","	Shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, any"
"4125","	such meeting.  The Shareholders of record entitled to vote"
"4126","	at a Shareholders' meeting shall be deemed the Shareholders"
"4127","	of record at any meeting reconvened after one or more"
"4128","	adjournments, unless the Trustees have fixed a new record"
"4129","	date."
"4130","      Section 9. Action Without a Meeting."
"4131","        Shareholders may take any action without a meeting if a"
"4132","	majority (or such greater amount as may be required by"
"4133","	law) of the Outstanding Shares entitled to vote on the"
"4134","	matter consent to the action in writing and such written"
"4135","	consents are filed with the records of Shareholders'"
"4136","	meetings.  Such written consent shall be treated for"
"4137","	all purposes as a vote at a meeting of the Shareholders."
"4138","Article VI"

"4140","      Section 1. No Share Certificates."
"4141","        Neither the Trust nor any Series or Class shall issue"
"4142","	certificates certifying the ownership of Shares, unless"
"4143","	the Trustees may otherwise specifically authorize such"
"4144","	certificates."
"4145","      Section 2. Register."
"4146","        A register shall be kept by the Trust under the"
"4147","	direction of the Trustees which shall contain the names"
"4148","	and addresses of the Shareholders and interests held by"
"4149","	each Shareholder.  Each such register shall be"
"4150","	conclusive as to the identity of the Shareholders of"
"4151","	the Trust and the persons who shall be entitled to"
"4152","	payments of distributions or otherwise to exercise or"
"4153","	enjoy the rights of Shareholders.  No Shareholder"
"4154","	shall be entitled to receive payment of any"
"4155","	distribution, nor to have notice given to it as"
"4156","	herein provided, until it has given its address to"
"4157","	such officer or agent of the Trustees as shall keep"
"4158","	the said register for entry thereon."
"4159","      Section 3. Transfer of Shares."
"4160","        The Trustees shall make such rules as they consider"
"4161","	appropriate for the transfer of shares and similar"

"4164","	surrender to the Trust or the transfer agent of the"
"4165","	Trust of such certificate for shares duly endorsed"
"4166","	or accompanied by proper evidence of succession,"
"4167","	assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be"
"4168","	the duty of the Trust to issue a new certificate to"
"4169","	the person entitled thereto, cancel the old"
"4170","	certificate and record the transaction upon its books."
"4171","Article VII"
"4172","INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND REPORTS"
"4173","      Every Trustee shall have the absolute right at any"
"4174","	reasonable time to inspect all books, records, and"
"4175","	documents of every kind and the physical properties"
"4176","	of the Trust.  This inspection by a Trustee may be"
"4177","	made in person or by an agent or attorney and the"
"4178","	right of inspection includes the right to copy and"
"4179","	make extracts of documents.  No Shareholder shall"
"4180","	have any right to inspect any account or book or"
"4181","	document of the Trust except as conferred by law or"
"4182","	otherwise by the Trustees."
"4183","Article VIII"
"4184","AMENDMENTS"

"4187","Article IX"
"4188","GENERAL MATTERS"
"4189","      Section 1. Checks, Drafts, Evidence of Indebetedness."
"4190","        All checks, drafts, or other orders for payment of"
"4191","	money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness"
"4192","	issued in the name of or payable to the Trust shall"
"4193","	be signed or endorsed in such manner and by such"
"4194","	person or persons as shall be designated from time"
"4195","	to time in accordance with the resolution of the"
"4196","	Board of Trustees."
"4197","      Section 2. Contracts and Instruments; How Executed."
"4198","        The Trustees, except as otherwise provided in these"
"4199","	By-laws, may authorize any officer or officers, agent"
"4200","	or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any"
"4201","	instrument in the name of and on behalf of the Trust"
"4202","	and this authority may be general or confined to"
"4203","	specific instances; and unless so authorized or"
"4204","	ratified by the Trustees or within the agency power"
"4205","	of an officer, no officer, agent, or employee shall"
"4206","	have any power or authority to bind the Trust by any"
"4207","	contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to"
"4208","	render it liable for any purpose or for any amount."
"4209","      Section 3. Advance Payment of Indemnifiable Expenses."
"4210","        Expenses incurred by an agent in connection with the"
"4211","	preparation and presentation of a defense to any"
"4212","	proceeding may be paid by the Trust from time to time"
"4213","	prior to final disposition thereof upon receipt of an"
"4214","	undertaking by, or on behalf of, such agent that such"
"4215","	amount will be paid over by him or her to the Trust"
"4216","	if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not"
"4217","	entitled to indemnification; provided, however, that"
"4218","	(a) such agent shall have provided appropriate"
"4219","	security for such undertaking, (b) the Trust is"
"4220","	insured against losses arising out of any such"
"4221","	advance payments, or (c) either a majority of the"
"4222","	Trustees who are neither Interested Persons of the"
"4223","	Trust nor parties to the proceeding, or independent"
"4224","	legal counsel in a written opinion, shall have"
"4225","	determined, based upon a review of the readily"
"4226","	available facts (as opposed to a trial-type inquiry"
"4227","	or full investigation), that there is reason to"
"4228","	believe that such agent will be found entitled to"
"4229","	indemnification."
"4230","      Section 4. Severability."
"4231","          The provisions of these By-laws are severable.  If"
"4232","	the Board of Trustees determines, with the advice of"
"4233","	counsel, that any provision hereof conflicts with the"
"4234","	1940 Act, the regulated investment company provisions"
"4235","	of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or"
"4236","	other applicable laws and regulations, the conflicting"
"4237","	provision shall be deemed never to have constituted a"
"4238","	part of these By-laws; provided, however, that such"
"4239","	determination shall not affect any of the remaining"
"4240","	provisions of these By-laws or render invalid or"
"4241","	improper any action taken or omitted prior to such"
"4242","	determination.  If any provision hereof shall be held"
"4243","	invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such"
"4244","	invalidity or unenforceability shall attach only to"
"4245","	such provision only in such jurisdiction and shall"
"4246","	not affect any other provision of these By-laws."
"4247","      Section 5. Headings."
"4248","        Headings are placed in these By-laws for convenience"
"4249","	of reference only and in case of any conflict, the"
"4250","	text of these By-laws rather than the headings shall"
"4251","	control."
