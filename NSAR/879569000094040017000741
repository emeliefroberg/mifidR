"509","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"510","To the Board of Directors and"
"511","Shareholders of"
"512","Federated Fixed Income Securities, Inc."
"513","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"514","statements of Federated Municipal Ultrashort Fund, a"
"515","portfolio of Federated Fixed Income Securities, Inc., (the"
"516","Fund) as of and for the year ended September 30, 2017, in"
"517","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"518","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"519","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"520","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"521","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"522","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"523","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"524","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"525","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"526","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"527","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"528","maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"529","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"530","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"531","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"532","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"533","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"534","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"535","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"536","with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's"
"537","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"538","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"539","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"540","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"541","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"542","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"543","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"544","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"545","and expenditures of the company are being made in"
"546","accordance with authorizations of management and Trustees"
"547","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"548","regarding prevention or timely detection of the"
"549","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the"
"550","company's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"551","financial statements."
"552","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"553","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"554","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"555","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"556","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"557","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"558","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"559","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"560","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"561","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"562","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"563","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"564","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"565","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"566","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"567","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"568","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"569","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"570","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"571","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"572","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"573","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"574","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"575","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal"
"576","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"577","including controls over safeguarding securities that we"
"578","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"579","September 30, 2017."
"580","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"581","of management and the Board of Directors of Federated Fixed"
"582","Income Securities, Inc. and the Securities and Exchange"
"583","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used"
"584","by anyone other than those specified parties."

"909","that the Adviser is acting solely in the capacity as an agent of"
"910","the Corporation and that any such person, partnership,"
"911","Corporation or other legal entity must look solely to the"
"912","Corporation in question for enforcement of any claim against the"
"913","Corporation, as the Adviser assumes no personal liability"
"914","whatsoever for obligations of the Corporation entered into by"
"915","the Adviser in its capacity as attorney-in-fact for the"
"916","Corporation."
"917","   Each person, partnership, Corporation or other legal entity"
"918","which deals with a Fund of the Corporation through the Adviser"
"919","in its capacity as agent and attorney-in-fact of the"
"920","Corporation, is hereby expressly put on notice (i) that all"
"921","persons or entities dealing with the Corporation must look"
"922","solely to the assets of the Fund of the Corporation on whose"
"923","behalf the Adviser is acting pursuant to its powers hereunder"
"924","for enforcement of any claim against the Corporation, as the"
"925","Directors, officers and/or agents of such Corporation, the"
"926","shareholders of the various classes of shares of the Corporation"
"927","and the other Funds of the Corporation assume no personal"
"928","liability whatsoever for obligations entered into on behalf of"
"929","such Fund of the Corporation, and (ii) that the rights,"
"930","liabilities and obligations of any one Fund are separate and"
"931","distinct from those of any other Fund of the Corporation."
"932","   The execution of this Limited Power of Attorney by the"
"933","Corporation acting on behalf of the several Funds shall not be"
"934","deemed to evidence the existence of any express or implied joint"
"935","undertaking or appointment by and among any or all of the Funds."
"936","Liability for or recourse under or upon any undertaking of the"
"937","Adviser pursuant to the power or authority granted to the"
"938","Adviser under this Limited Power of Attorney under any rule of"
"939","law, statute or constitution or by the enforcement of any"
"940","assessment or penalty or by legal or equitable proceedings or"
"941","otherwise shall be limited only to the assets of the Fund of the"
"942","Corporation on whose behalf the Adviser was acting pursuant to"
"943","the authority granted hereunder."
"944","   The Corporation hereby agrees that no person, partnership,"
"945","Corporation or other legal entity dealing with the Adviser shall"
"946","be bound to inquire into the Adviser's power and authority"
"947","hereunder and any such person, partnership, Corporation or other"
"948","legal entity shall be fully protected in relying on such power"
"949","or authority unless such person, partnership, Corporation or"
"950","other legal entity has received prior written notice from the"
"951","Corporation that this Limited Power of Attorney has been"
"952","revoked. This Limited Power of Attorney shall be revoked and"
"953","terminated automatically upon the cancellation or termination of"
"954","the Investment Advisory Contract between the Corporation and the"
"955","Adviser.  Except as provided in the immediately preceding"
"956","sentence, the powers and authorities herein granted may be"
"957","revoked or terminated by the Corporation at any time provided"
"958","that no such revocation or termination shall be effective until"
"959","the Adviser has received actual notice of such revocation or"
"960","termination in writing from the Corporation."
"961","   This Limited Power of Attorney constitutes the entire"
"962","agreement between the Corporation and the Adviser, may be"
"963","changed only by a writing signed by both of them, and shall bind"
"964","and benefit their respective successors and assigns; provided,"
"965","however, the Adviser shall have no power or authority hereunder"
"966","to appoint a successor or substitute attorney in fact for the"
"967","Corporation."
"968","   This Limited Power of Attorney shall be governed and"
"969","construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of"
"970","Pennsylvania without reference to principles of conflicts of"
"971","laws.  Without limiting any other authority expressly granted"
"972","hereunder, for purposes of Pennsylvania law, this Limited Power"
"973","of Attorney shall be deemed to constitute a power used in a"
"974","commercial transaction which authorizes an agency relationship"
"975","which is exclusively granted to facilitate transfer of stock,"
"976","bonds and other assets and which may be exercised  independently"
"977","of any other agent designated by the Corporation and includes,"
"978","but is not limited to, the power to engage in stock, bond and"
"979","other securities transactions as specified by 20 Pa.C.S. Section"
"980","5603(k).  The authority granted to the Adviser by this Limited"
"981","Power of Attorney may be delegated by the Adviser to one or more"
"982","successor agents or subadvisors,  or to other persons the"
"983","Adviser in its sole discretion determines are appropriate or"
"984","necessary.  If any provision hereof, or any power or authority"
"985","conferred upon the Adviser herein, would be invalid or"
"986","unexercisable under applicable law, then such provision, power"
"987","or authority shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to"
"988","render it valid or exercisable while most nearly preserving its"
"989","original intent, and no provision hereof, or power or authority"
"990","conferred upon the Adviser herein, shall be affected by the"
"991","invalidity or the non-exercisability of another provision"
"992","hereof, or of another power or authority conferred herein."
"993","   This Limited Power of Attorney may be executed in as many"
"994","identical counterparts as may be convenient and by the different"
"995","parties hereto on separate counterparts.  This Limited Power of"
"996","Attorney shall become binding on the Corporation when the"
"997","Corporation shall have executed at least one counterpart and the"
"998","Adviser shall have accepted its appointment by executing this"
"999","Limited Power of Attorney.  Immediately after the execution of a"
"1000","counterpart original of this Limited Power of Attorney and"
"1001","solely for the convenience of the parties hereto, the"
"1002","Corporation and the Adviser will execute sufficient counterparts"
"1003","so that the Adviser shall have a counterpart executed by it and"
"1004","the Corporation, and the Corporation shall have a counterpart"
"1005","executed by the Corporation and the Adviser.  Each counterpart"
"1006","shall be deemed an original and all such taken together shall"
"1007","constitute but one and the same instrument, and it shall not be"
"1008","necessary in making proof of this Limited Power of Attorney to"
"1009","produce or account for more than one such counterpart."
"1010","   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Limited"
"1011","Power of Attorney to be executed by its duly authorized officer"
"1012","as of the date first written above."
