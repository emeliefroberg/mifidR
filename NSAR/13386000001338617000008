"817","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"818","Accounting Firm"
"819","To the Board of Trustees and"
"820","Shareholders of"
"821","Federated Global Allocation Fund"
"822","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"823","statements of Federated Global Allocation Fund, (the"
"824","Fund), as of and for the year ended November 30,"
"825","2016, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"826","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"827","States), we considered the Fund's internal control"
"828","over financial reporting, including controls over"
"829","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"830","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"831","opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"832","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"833","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"834","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"835","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"836","opinion."
"837","Management of the Fund is responsible for"
"838","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"839","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"840","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"841","management are required to assess the expected"
"842","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"843","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"844","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"845","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"846","preparation of financial statements for external"
"847","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"848","accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"849","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"850","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"851","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"852","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"853","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"854","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"855","to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"856","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"857","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"858","company are being made in accordance with"
"859","authorizations of management and directors of the"
"860","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"861","regarding prevention or timely detection of the"
"862","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the"
"863","company's assets that could have a material effect on"
"864","the financial statements."
"865","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"866","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"867","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"868","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"869","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"870","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"871","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"872","deteriorate."
"873","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"874","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"875","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"876","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"877","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"878","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"879","a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"880","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"881","possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's"
"882","annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"883","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"884","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"885","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"886","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"887","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"888","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"889","standards established by the Public Company"
"890","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"891","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"892","internal control over financial reporting and its"
"893","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"894","securities that we consider to be a material weakness"
"895","as defined above as of November 30, 2016."
"896","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"897","use of management and the Board of Trustees of"
"898","Federated Global Allocation Fund and the Securities"
"899","and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be"
"900","and should not be used by anyone other than those"

(F)	LARGE TICKET PURCHASES

Unless otherwise indicated on the Schedule to this Exhibit, a financial
intermediary that places an order to purchase $1,000,000 or more of Class A
Shares shall receive from the principal underwriter an advance commission
equal to 75 basis points (0.75%) of the public offering price. In such event,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan or this Exhibit, such
Class A Shares shall be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge upon
redemption within 24 months of purchase equal to 75 basis points (0.75%) of
the lesser of (x) the purchase price of the Class A Shares or (y) the
redemption price of the Class A Shares. Any contingent deferred sales charge
received upon redemption of Class A Shares shall be paid to the principal
underwriter in consideration of the advance commission.

(G)	REDUCING OR ELIMINATING THE SALES LOAD

Contingent upon notification to the Fund's principal underwriter or transfer
agent, in applying the exceptions set forth in this Section 3, the purchase
amount shall take into account:

*
Discounts achieved by combining concurrent
purchases of and/or current investment in
Class A, Class B, Class C, Class F, and Class
R Shares, made or held by (or on behalf of)
the investor, the investor's spouse, and the
investor's children under age 21 (regardless
of whether the purchases or investments are
made or held directly or through an
investment professional or through a single-
participant retirement account); provided that
such purchases and investments can be linked
using tax identification numbers (TINs),
social security numbers (SSNs), or Broker
Identification Numbers (BINs); and
*
Letters of intent to purchase a certain amount
of Class A Shares within a thirteen month
period.

	(H)	WAIVER OF SALES LOAD

	Continent upon notification to the Fund's Transfer Agent,
no sales load shall be assessed on purchases of Class A Shares made:

*
	within 120 days of redeeming shares of an
equal or greater amount;
*
	through a program offered by a Financial
Intermediary that provides for the purchase of
Shares without imposition of a sales charge (for
example, a wrap account, self-directed
brokerage account, retirement or other fee-
based program offered by the Financial
Intermediary) and where the Financial
Intermediary has agreed with the principal
underwriter not to receive a dealer reallowance
on purchases under such program;
*
	with reinvested dividends or capital gains;
*
	or Class A Shares, issued in connection with the
merger, consolidation, or acquisition of the
assets of another fund.  Further, no sales load
shall be assessed on purchases of Shares made
by a shareholder that originally became a
shareholder of a Federated Fund pursuant to the
terms of an agreement and plan of
reorganization which permits shareholders to
acquire Shares at NAV provided that such
Shares are held directly with the Fund's transfer
agent.  If the Shares are held through a financial
intermediary the sales charge waiver will not
apply;
*
	by Federated Life Members (Federated
shareholders who originally were issued shares
through the Liberty Account, which was an
account for the Liberty Family of Funds on
February 28, 1987, or who invested through an
affinity group prior to August 1, 1987, into the
Liberty Account);
*
	by Directors, Trustees, employees, former
employees and sales representatives of the
Fund, the Adviser, the principal underwriter
and their affiliates, employees of any
investment professional that sells Shares
according to a sales agreement with the
principal underwriter, by the immediate family
members of the above persons, and by trusts,
pensions or profit-sharing plans for the above
persons; and
*
	pursuant to the exchange privilege.


 (I)	WAIVER OF CONTINGENT DEFFERED SALES CHARGE ON
LARGE-TICKET PURCHASES

Contingent upon notification to the Fund's principal underwriter or transfer
agent, the 75 basis point (0.75%) CDSC applicable in connection with the
large-ticket purchase program described above, will not be imposed on
redemptions:

*
	following the death of the last surviving
shareholder or post-purchase disability, as
defined in Section 72(m)(7) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986;
*
	due to the termination of a trust following the
death of the trustor/grantor or beneficiary,
provided that the trust document specifically
states that the trust is terminated upon the death
*
	representing minimum required distributions
(RMD) from an Individual Retirement
Account or other retirement plan as required
under the Internal Revenue Code;
*
	of Shares that were reinvested within 120 days
of a previous redemption;
*
	of Shares held by the Directors, Trustees,
employees, former employees and sales
representatives of the Fund, the Adviser, the
principal underwriter and their affiliates,
employees of any investment professional that
sells Shares according to a sales agreement with
the principal underwriter, by the immediate
family members of the above persons, and by
trusts, pension or profit-sharing plans for the
above persons;
*
	of Shares originally purchased through a
program offered by a Financial Intermediary
that provides for the purchase of Shares without
imposition of a sales charge (for example, a
wrap account, self-directed brokerage account,
retirement, or other fee-based program offered
by the Financial Intermediary) and where the
Financial Intermediary has agreed with the
principal underwriter not to receive an
advanced commission on purchases under such
program;
*
	of Shares purchased with reinvested dividends
or capital gains;
*
	imposed by the Fund when it closes an account
for not meeting the minimum balance
requirements; and
*
	of Shares which were purchased pursuant to an
exchange privilege if the Shares were held for
the applicable CDSC holding period.

4.	SPECIAL OFFER PROGRAM

[NOTE: The 30 month CDSC period connected with of this program expired in
September of 2002]
During the Special Offer Program which took place in March, 2000, the sales
load was waived on purchases of Class A Shares of Federated Aggressive
Growth Fund, Federated Communications Technology Fund, Federated Large
Cap Growth Fund, and Federated International Small Company Fund (the
Special Offer Funds).  Instead, the principal underwriter paid an advance
commission of 2.00% of the offering price of the Special Offer Funds to
intermediaries participating in the Special Offer Program.  Class A Shares
purchased through this Special Offer were subject to a CDSC of 2.00% on
redemptions which occurred within 30 months after the purchase, which amount
was to be paid to the principal underwriter in consideration for advancing the
commission to intermediaries.  Class A Shares of the Special Offer Funds
purchased during the Special Offer Program could be exchanged with Class A
Shares of other Special Offer Funds with no imposition of a sales load or CDSC
fee.  Class A Shares of the Special Offer Funds purchased during the Special
Offer Program which were exchanged for Class A Shares of other Funds during
the 30 month CDSC period incurred the CDSC fee upon redemption.  However,
no sales load was charged for such an exchange.

5.	REDEMPTION FEE

For purposes of Rule 11a-3 under the Act, any redemption fee received upon the
redemption or exchange of Class A Shares will be applied to fees incurred or
amount expended in connection with such redemption or exchange.  The balance
of any redemption fees shall be paid to the Fund.

A Fund shall waive any redemption fee with respect to (i) non-participant
directed redemptions or exchanges involving Class A Shares held in retirement
plans established under Section 401(a) or 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
(the Code), custodial plan accounts established under Section 493(b)(7)
of the Code, or deferred compensation plans established under Section 457 of
the Code; (ii) redemptions or exchanges involving Class A Shares held in plans
administered as college savings programs under Section 529 of the Code; and
(iii) Class A Shares redeemed due to the death of the last surviving
shareholder on the account.

sales by financial intermediaries in consideration of the payment of an
advance commission paid by the principal underwriter.  Financial
intermediaries may perform shareholder services and receive a
shareholder service fee for their services. In consideration of advancing
commissions and/or the provision of shareholder services, the principal
underwriter may receive the contingent deferred sales charges paid upon
redemption of Class B Shares, and/or shareholder service fees and/or
fees under a 12b-1 plan. In connection with this basic arrangement, Class
B Shares will bear the following fees and expenses:

	(B)	WAIVER OF CDSC
Contingent upon notification to the Fund's principal underwriter or
transfer agent, no CDSC will be imposed on redemptions:
*
following the death of the last surviving
shareholder or post-purchase disability, as defined
in Section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986;
*
	due to the termination of a trust following the death
of the trustor/grantor or beneficiary, provided that
the trust document specifically states that the trust
is terminated upon the death
*
	representing minimum required distributions
(RMD) from an Individual Retirement Account
or other retirement plan as required under the
Internal Revenue Code;
*
of Shares that were reinvested within 120 days of a
previous redemption;
*
of Shares held by the Directors, Trustees,
employees, former employees and sales
representatives of the Fund, the Adviser, the
principal underwriter and their affiliates, employees
of any investment professional that sells Shares
according to a sales agreement with the principal
underwriter, by the immediate family members of
the above persons, and by trusts, pension or profit-
sharing plans for the above persons;
*
of Shares originally purchased through a program
offered by a Financial Intermediary that provides
for the purchase of Shares without imposition of a
sales charge (for example, a wrap account, self-
directed brokerage account, retirement, or other
fee-based program offered by the Financial
Intermediary) and where the Financial Intermediary
has agreed with the principal underwriter not to
receive an advanced commission on purchases
under such program;
*
of Shares purchased with reinvested dividends or
capital gains;
*
imposed by the Fund when it closes an account for
not meeting the minimum balance requirements;
and
*
of Shares which were purchased pursuant to an
exchange privilege if the Shares were held for the
applicable CDSC holding period.


	(C) SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL PROGRAM
Contingent upon notification to the principal underwriter or the
Fund's transfer agent, no CDSC will be imposed on redemptions that
are qualifying redemptions of Class B Shares under a Systematic
Withdrawal Program as described in the applicable prospectus and
statement of additional information.

4.	REDEMPTION FEE
For purposes of Rule 11a-3 under the Act, any redemption fee received
upon the redemption or exchange of Class B Shares will be applied to
fees incurred or amount expended in connection with such redemption or
exchange.  The balance of any redemption fees shall be paid to the Fund.
A Fund shall waive any redemption fee with respect to (i) non-
participant directed redemptions or exchanges involving Class B Shares
held in retirement plans established under Section 401(a) or 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code (the Code), custodial plan accounts established
under Section 493(b)(7) of the Code, or deferred compensation plans
established under Section 457 of the Code;  (ii) redemptions or
exchanges involving Class B Shares held in plans administered as
college savings programs under Section 529 of the Code; and (iii) Class
B Shares redeemed due to the death of the last surviving shareholder on
the account.

CLASS C SHARES EXHIBIT
TO
MULTIPLE CLASS PLAN
(REVISED 1/1/17)

1.	SEPARATE ARRANGEMENT AND EXPENSE
ALLOCATION

For purposes of Rule 18f-3 under the Act, the basic distribution and
shareholder servicing arrangement of the Class C Shares will consist of
sales by financial intermediaries in consideration of an advance
commission of up to 1.00% of the public offering price, paid by the
principal underwriter. Financial intermediaries may also provide
shareholder services and may receive shareholder services fees therefor.
Additionally, the principal underwriter and financial intermediaries may
receive distribution and/or administrative service fees under the 12b-1
Plan. In cases where the principal underwriter has advanced a
commission to the financial intermediary, such 12b-1 fees will be paid to
the financial intermediary beginning in the thirteenth month after
purchase.  In consideration of advancing commissions, the principal
underwriter will receive the contingent deferred sales charges paid upon
redemption of Class C Shares and payments made under the 12b-1 Plan
for twelve months following the purchase.  In connection with this basic
arrangement, Class C Shares will bear the following fees and expenses:

At the election of the
shareholder, Class C
Shares that are not subject
to a contingent deferred
sales charge (CDSC)
may be converted to any
other Share Class of the
same Fund, provided that
the shareholder meets the
eligibility requirements for
the Share Class into which
the conversion is sought,
as applicable.

Class C Shares may be
exchanged for Class C
Shares of any other Fund.
In any exchange, the shareholder shall receive shares having the same
aggregate net asset value as the shares surrendered.  Exchanges to any
other Class shall be treated in the same manner as a redemption and
purchase.
3.	EXCEPTIONS TO BASIC ARRANGEMENTS

For purposes of Rules 22d-1 and 6c-10 under the Act, unless otherwise
specified on the Schedule to this Exhibit, the scheduled variations
contingent deferred sales charges are as follows:

   (A)	 WAIVER OF CDSC

*
following the death of the last surviving
shareholder or post-purchase disability,
as defined in Section 72(m)(7) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986;
*
	due to the termination of a trust
following the death of the trustor/grantor
or beneficiary, provided that the trust
document specifically states that the trust
is terminated upon the death
*
	representing minimum required
distributions (RMD) from an
Individual Retirement Account or other
retirement plan as required under the
Internal Revenue Code;
*
of Shares that were reinvested within 120
days of a previous redemption;
*
of Shares held by the Directors, Trustees,
employees, former employees and sales
representatives of the Fund, the Adviser,
the principal underwriter and their
affiliates, employees of any investment
professional that sells Shares according
to a sales agreement with the principal
underwriter, by the immediate family
members of the above persons, and by
trusts, pension or profit-sharing plans for
the above persons;
*
of Shares originally purchased through a
program offered by a Financial
Intermediary that provides for the
purchase of Shares without imposition of
a sales charge (for example, a wrap
account, self-directed brokerage account,
retirement, or other fee-based program
offered by the Financial Intermediary)
and where the Financial Intermediary has
agreed with the principal underwriter not
to receive an advanced commission on
purchases under such program;
*
of Shares purchased with reinvested
dividends or capital gains;
*
imposed by the Fund when it closes an
account for not meeting the minimum
balance requirements; and
*
of Shares which were purchased pursuant
to an exchange privilege if the Shares
were held for the applicable CDSC
holding period.

4.	REDEMPTION FEE

For purposes of Rule 11a-3 under the Act, any redemption fee received
upon the redemption or exchange of Class C Shares will be applied to
fees incurred or amount expended in connection with such redemption or
exchange.  The balance of any redemption fees shall be paid to the Fund.
A Fund shall waive any redemption fee with respect to (i) non-
participant directed redemptions or exchanges involving Class C Shares
held in retirement plans established under Section 401(a) or 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code (the Code), custodial plan accounts established
under Section 493(b)(7) of the Code, or deferred compensation plans
established under Section 457 of the Code; (ii) redemptions or exchanges
involving Class C Shares held in plans administered as college savings
programs under Section 529 of the Code; and (iii) Class C Shares
redeemed due to the death of the last surviving shareholder on the
account.

:
With respect to the
Kaufmann Fund,
shareholders who are
former shareholders
of the Kaufmann
Fund, Inc. and their
immediate family
members or
shareholders who
have purchased shares
through the financial
intermediary
relationships that
existed for the
Kaufmann Fund may
exchange their Class
R Shares for Class A
Shares of any other
fund. Investors who
are eligible to
purchase Class R
Shares (e.g. 401(k)
plans, 457 plans,
employer sponsored
403(b) plans, profit
sharing and money
purchase pension
plans, defined benefit
plans, non-qualified
deferred

from such plans,
directly or through
financial
intermediaries as well
as IRAs held through
financial
intermediaries who
hold the IRAs in an
omnibus account))
may exchange their
Class R Shares into
Class R Shares of any
other Fund.  A
Grandfathered

exchange into Class R
Shares of another
Fund only if such
shareholder is an
eligible investor in
the Class R Shares of
that Fund.
With respect to the
other funds, Class R
Shares may be
exchanged for Class
R Shares, including
the Kaufmann Fund.

In any exchange, the shareholder shall receive shares having the same
aggregate net asset value as the shares surrendered, after the payment of
any redemption fees to the Fund. Exchanges to any other Class shall be
treated in the same manner as a redemption and purchase.

3.	REDEMPTION FEE

For purposes of Rule 11a-3 under the Act, any redemption fee received
upon the redemption or exchange of Class R Shares will be applied to
fees incurred or amounts expended in connection with such redemption
or exchange. The balance of any redemption fees shall be paid to the
Fund.
A Fund shall waive any redemption fee with respect to Class R Shares
redeemed or exchange by employer-sponsored retirement plans.
