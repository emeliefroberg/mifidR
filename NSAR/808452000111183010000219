"861","<DESCRIPTION>ACCOUNTANT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL"
"862","<TEXT>"
"863","                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"864","TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF BERWYN FUND,"
"865","BERWYN INCOME FUND AND BERWYN CORNERSTONE FUND"
"866","AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE BERWYN FUNDS"
"867","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Berwyn Fund,"
"868","Berwyn  Income  Fund  and  Berwyn  Cornerstone  Fund, each a series of shares of"
"869","beneficial  interest  of The Berwyn Funds, as of and for the year ended December"
"870","31,  2009,  in  accordance  with  the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"871","Oversight  Board  (United  States),  we  considered  their internal control over"
"872","financial  reporting,  including control activities for safeguarding securities,"
"873","as  a  basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"874","our  opinion  on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"875","Form   N-SAR,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the"
"876","effectiveness   of   the  Funds'  internal  control  over  financial  reporting."
"877","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"878","The  management  of  The  Berwyn  Funds  is  responsible  for  establishing  and"
"879","maintaining  effective  internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"880","this  responsibility,  estimates  and  judgments  by  management are required to"
"881","assess  the  expected  benefits and related costs of controls. A Fund's internal"
"882","control  over  financial  reporting  is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"883","assurance  regarding  the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"884","of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes in accordance with accounting"
"885","principles generally accepted in the United States of America. A Fund's internal"
"886","control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"887","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"888","fairly  reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"889","provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to"
"890","permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  accounting"
"891","principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts"
"892","and   expenditures   of  the  fund  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with"
"893","authorizations  of  management  and  trustees  of  the  fund;  and  (3)  provide"
"894","reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"895","acquisition,  use  or  disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"896","effect on the financial statements."
"897","Because  of  inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may"
"898","not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"899","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"900","inadequate  because  of  changes  in conditions or that the degree of compliance"
"901","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"902","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"903","or  operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"904","course   of   performing   their   assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"905","misstatements  on  a  timely  basis.  A  material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"906","combination  of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"907","that  there  is  a  reasonable  possibility  that a material misstatement of the"
"908","Funds'  annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"909","on a timely basis."
"910","Our  consideration  of  the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"911","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in  the  first  paragraph  and  would not"
"912","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"913","weaknesses   under  standards  established  by  the  Public  Company  Accounting"
"914","Oversight  Board  (United  States).  However,  we  noted  no deficiencies in the"
"915","internal control over financial reporting and its operations, including controls"
"916","for  safeguarding  securities  that  we  consider  to be material weaknesses, as"
"917","defined above, as of December 31, 2009."
