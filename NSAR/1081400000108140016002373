"1122","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1123","preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"1124","with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"1125","and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"1126","are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"1127","of management and trustees of the fund; and (3)"
"1128","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1129","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1130","use, or disposition of the funds assets that"
"1131","could have a material effect on the financial"
"1132","statements."
"1133","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1134","control over financial reporting may not prevent"
"1135","or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"1136","any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1137","periods are subject to the risk that controls"
"1138","may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1139","conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"1140","with policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1141","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1142","reporting exists when the design or operation"
"1143","of a control does not allow management or"
"1144","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1145","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1146","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"1147","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1148","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1149","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1150","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1151","Funds annual or interim financial statements"
"1152","will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"1153","basis."
"1154","Our consideration of the Funds internal control"
"1155","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"1156","purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"1157","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"1158","in internal control that might be material"
"1159","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1160","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1161","(United States).  However, we noted no"
"1162","deficiencies in the Funds internal control"
"1163","over financial reporting and its operations,"
"1164","including controls over safeguarding securities"
"1165","that we consider to be a material weakness as"
"1166","defined above as of August 31, 2016."

"1214","INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT"
"1215","This INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT is"
"1216","made as of this 1st day of July 2015, between Wells Fargo Funds"
"1217","Trust (the Trust), a statutory trust organized under the laws of"
"1218","the State of Delaware with its principal place of business at 525"
"1219","Market Street, 12th Floor, San Francisco, California, 94105 and"
"1220","Wells Fargo Funds Management, LLC (the Manager), a limited"
"1221","liability company organized under the laws of the State of"
"1222","Delaware with its principal place of business at 525 Market Street,"
"1223","12th Floor, San Francisco, California, 94105."
"1224","WHEREAS, the Trust is registered under the Investment"
"1225","Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act) as an openend"
"1226","management investment company and is authorized to issue"
"1227","interests (as defined in the Trust's Declaration of Trust, as"
"1228","amended and supplemented from time to time), in separate series;"
"1229","WHEREAS, the Trust desires that the Manager provide"
"1230","investment management services consisting of advisory services"
"1231","and Fund-level (as opposed to class-level) administrative services"
"1232","to each series of the Trust listed on Schedule A hereto as such"
"1233","Schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to time by"
"1234","mutual agreement (each a Fund and collectively the Funds),"
"1235","and the Manager is willing to provide those services on the terms"
"1236","and conditions set forth in this Agreement; and"
"1237","WHEREAS, the Trust has entered into a separate Class-"
"1238","Level Administration Agreement with the Manager for the"
"1239","provision of class-level administrative services (Class-Level
Duties)."
"1240","NOW THEREFORE, the Trust and the Manager agree as follows:"
"1241","Section 1. Appointment of the Manager. The Trust is"
"1242","engaged in the business of investing and reinvesting its assets in"
"1243","securities of the type and in accordance with the limitations"
"1244","specified in its Declaration of Trust, as amended and supplemented"
"1245","from time to time, By-Laws (if any) and Registration Statement"
"1246","filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the"
"1247","Commission) under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act of 1933"
"1248","(the Securities Act), including any representations made in the"
"1249","prospectus and statement of additional information relating to the"
"1250","Funds contained therein and as may be amended or supplemented"
"1251","from time to time, all in such manner and to such extent as may"
"1252","from time to time be authorized by the Trust's Board of Trustees"
"1253","(the Board). The Board is authorized to issue any unissued"
"1254","shares in any number of additional classes or series."
"1255","The investment authority granted to the Manager shall"
"1256","include the authority to exercise whatever powers the Trust may"
"1257","possess with respect to any of its assets held by the Funds,"
"1258","including, but not limited to, the power to exercise rights, options,"
"1259","warrants, conversion privileges, redemption privileges, and to"
"1260","tender securities pursuant to a tender offer, and participate in class"
"1261","actions and other legal proceedings on behalf of the Funds."
"1262","The Trust hereby appoints the Manager, subject to the"
"1263","direction and control of the Board, to manage the investment and"
"1264","reinvestment of the assets in the Funds and, without limiting the"
"1265","generality of the foregoing, to provide the other services specified"
"1266","in Section 2 hereof."
"1267","The Trust hereby appoints the Manger to provide the Fundlevel"
"1268","duties and services as set forth in Section 2(b) hereof, for the"
"1269","compensation and on the terms herein provided, and the Manager"
"1270","hereby accepts such appointment. Each new investment portfolio"
"1271","established in the future by the Trust shall automatically become a"
"1272","Fund for all purposes hereunder as if it were listed on Schedule"
"1273","A, absent written notification to the contrary by either the Trust or"
"1274","the Manager."
"1275","Section 2. Duties of the Manager."
"1276","(a) Advisory Services."
"1277","(i) The Manager shall make decisions with respect to"
"1278","all purchases and sales of securities and other investment assets for"
"1279","the Funds. Among other things, the Manager shall make all"
"1280","decisions with respect to the allocation of the Funds' investments"
"1281","in various securities or other assets, in investment styles and, if"
"1282","applicable, in other investment companies or pooled vehicles in"
"1283","which a Fund may invest. To carry out such decisions, the"
"1284","Manager is hereby authorized, as agent and attorney-in-fact for the"
"1285","Trust, for the account of, at the risk of and in the name of the Trust,"
"1286","to place orders and issue instructions with respect to those"
"1287","transactions of the Funds. In all purchases, sales and other"
"1288","transactions in securities for the Funds, the Manager is authorized"
"1289","to exercise full discretion and act for the Trust in the same manner"
"1290","and with the same force and effect as the Trust might or could do"
"1291","with respect to such purchases, sales or other transactions, as well"
"1292","as with respect to all other things necessary or incidental to the"
"1293","furtherance or conduct of such purchases, sales or other"
"1294","transactions."
"1295","(ii) The Manager will report to the Board at each"
"1296","regular meeting thereof regarding the investment performance of"
"1297","the Funds since the prior report, and will also keep the Board"
"1298","informed of important developments affecting the Trust, each Fund"
"1299","and the Manager, and on its own initiative will furnish the Board"
"1300","from time to time with such information as the Manager may"
"1301","believe appropriate, whether concerning the individual companies"
"1302","whose securities are held by a Fund, the industries in which they"
"1303","engage, or the economic, social or political conditions prevailing in"
"1304","each country in which a Fund maintains investments. The"
"1305","Manager will also furnish the Board with such statistical and"
"1306","analytical information with respect to securities in the Funds as the"
"1307","Manager may believe appropriate or as the Board reasonably may"
"1308","request."
"1309","The Manager shall promptly notify the Trust of (A) any"
"1310","changes regarding the Manager that would impact disclosure in the"
"1311","Trust's Registration Statement, or (B) any violation of any"
"1312","requirement, provision, policy or restriction that the Manager is"
"1313","required to comply with under Section 6 of this Agreement. The"
"1314","Manager shall immediately notify the Trust of any legal process"
"1315","served upon it in connection with its activities hereunder, including"
"1316","any legal process served upon it on behalf of the Funds or the"
"1317","Trust."
"1318","(iii) The Manager will from time to time employ or subcontract"
"1319","the services to certain persons as the Manager believes to"
"1320","be appropriate or necessary to assist in the execution of the"
"1321","Manager's duties hereunder; provided, however, that the"
"1322","employment or sub-contracting with any such person shall not"
"1323","relieve the Manager of its responsibilities or liabilities hereunder"
"1324","and provided further that the Manager shall not have the authority"
"1325","to sub-contract advisory responsibilities without the consent of the"
"1326","Trust. The cost of performance of such duties will be borne and"
"1327","paid by the Manager. No obligation may be imposed on the Trust"
"1328","in any such respect."
"1329","The Manager shall supervise and monitor the activities of its"
"1330","representatives, personnel, sub-contractors, and agents in connection"
"1331","with the execution of its duties and obligations hereunder. The"
"1332","appropriate personnel of the Manager will be made available to"
"1333","consult with the Board at reasonable times and upon reasonable"
"1334","notice concerning the business of the Trust."
"1335","(iv) The Manager shall maintain records relating to"
"1336","portfolio transactions and the placing and allocation of brokerage"
"1337","orders as are required to be maintained by the Trust under the 1940"
"1338","Act. The Manager shall prepare and maintain, or cause to be"
"1339","prepared and maintained, in such form, for such periods and in"
"1340","such locations as may be required by applicable law, all documents"
"1341","and records relating to the services provided by the Manager"

"1347","of the Manager shall be the property of the Trust. The Trust, or the"
"1348","Trust's authorized representatives, shall have access to such books"
"1349","and records at all times during the Manager's normal business"
"1350","hours. Upon the reasonable request of the Trust, copies of any"
"1351","such books and records shall be provided promptly by the Manager"
"1352","to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives."
"1353","(v) With respect to a Fund, the Manager shall have no"
"1354","duties or obligations pursuant to this Agreement other than as"
"1355","specified in Section 2(b) hereof, during any period during which"
"1356","the Fund invests all (or substantially all) of its investment assets in"
"1357","a registered, open-end management investment company, or"
"1358","separate series thereof, in accordance with Section 12(d)(1)(E)"

"1424","nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to"
"1425","require Funds Management to provide any services"

"1427","banking laws and regulations."
"1428","In performing all Fund-level administrative services under"
"1429","this Section 2(b), the Manager shall: (a) act in conformity with the"
"1430","Trust's Declaration of Trust (and By-Laws, if any), the 1940 Act,"

"1439","In connection with its duties under this Section 2(b), the"
"1440","Manager may, at its own expense, enter into sub-administration"
"1441","agreements with other service providers, provided that each such"
"1442","service provider agrees with Manager to comply with this"
"1443","Agreement and all relevant provisions of the 1940 Act and any"
"1444","other applicable laws as may be amended from time to time, and"
"1445","all relevant rules thereunder. Manager will provide the Trust with"
"1446","a copy of each sub-administration agreement it executes relating to"
"1447","the Trust. Manager will be liable for acts or omissions of any such"
"1448","sub-administrators under the standards of care described herein"
"1449","under Section 11."
"1450","Section 3. Delivery of Documents to the Manager. The"
"1451","Trust has furnished the Manager with true, correct and complete"
"1452","copies of the following documents:"
"1453","(a) The Declaration of Trust, as in effect on the date hereof;"
"1454","(b) The Registration Statement filed with the Commission"
"1455","under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act; and"
"1456","(c) Written guidelines, policies and procedures adopted by the"
"1457","Trust."
"1458","The Trust will furnish the Manager with all future"
"1459","amendments and supplements to the foregoing as soon as"
"1460","practicable after such documents become available. The Trust"
"1461","shall furnish the Manager with any further documents, materials or"
"1462","information that the Manager may reasonably request in"
"1463","connection with the performance of its duties hereunder."
"1464","Section 4. Delegation of Responsibilities. The Manager"
"1465","may carry out any of its obligations under this Agreement (other"
"1466","than under Section 2(b) hereof) by employing, subject to"
"1467","supervision by the Manager, one or more Sub-Manager(s) who are"
"1468","registered as investment advisers pursuant to the Investment"
"1469","Advisers Act of 1940 (Sub-Advisers). Each Sub-Adviser's"
"1470","employment will be evidenced by a separate written agreement"
"1471","approved by the Board and, if required under the 1940 Act, by the"
"1472","shareholders of the Fund (unless the Commission or its staff has"
"1473","given authorization or issued an interpretation dispensing with the"
"1474","requirement of shareholder approval). The Manager shall not be"
"1475","liable hereunder for any act or omission of any Sub-Adviser,"
"1476","except for failure to exercise good faith in the employment of the"
"1477","Sub-Adviser and for failure to exercise appropriate supervision of"
"1478","such Sub-Adviser, and as may otherwise be agreed in writing. The"
"1479","Manager shall be solely responsible for compensating any Sub-"
"1480","Adviser for services rendered under any Sub-Advisory Agreement."
"1481","The Manager may, from time to time and at any time, terminate"
"1482","any Sub-Adviser and reassume the responsibilities assigned to such"
"1483","Sub-Adviser with respect to any Fund without obtaining the"
"1484","approval of the shareholders of the Fund."
"1485","Section 5. Control by Board. Any investment"
"1486","management activities undertaken by the Manager pursuant to this"
"1487","Agreement, as well as any other activities undertaken by the"
"1488","Manager on behalf of the Funds, shall at all times be subject to the"
"1489","direction and control of the Board."
"1490","Section 6. Compliance with Applicable Requirements."
"1491","In carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, the Manager"
"1492","shall at all times comply with:"
"1493","(a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"1494","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"1495","(b) the Registration Statement of the Trust, as it may be"
"1496","amended from time to time, filed with the Commission"
"1497","under the Securities Act and the 1940 Act;"
"1498","(c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it"
"1499","may be amended from time to time;"
"1500","(d) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"
"1501","amended, applicable to the Trust or the Funds, and any"
"1502","rules and regulations adopted thereunder; and"
"1503","(e) any other applicable provisions of state or federal law, and"
"1504","any rules and regulations adopted thereunder."
"1505","Section 7. Proxies. The Manager shall have responsibility"
"1506","to vote proxies solicited with respect to issuers of securities in"
"1507","which assets of the Funds are invested in accordance with the"
"1508","Trust's policies on proxy voting."
"1509","Section 8. Broker-Dealer Relationships. In connection"
"1510","with the purchase and sale of securities for the Funds, the Manager"
"1511","is responsible for broker-dealer selection and negotiation of"
"1512","brokerage commission rates. The Manager's primary"
"1513","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain"
"1514","the best price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to"
"1515","execute each particular transaction for a Fund, the Manager will"
"1516","consider among other things: the best net price available, the"
"1517","reliability, integrity and financial condition of the broker-dealer;"
"1518","the size of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value of"
"1519","the expected contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a"
"1520","continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any"
"1521","transaction may be less favorable than that available from another"
"1522","broker-dealer if the difference is reasonably justified by other"
"1523","aspects of the portfolio execution services offered. Subject to such"
"1524","policies as the Board may from time to time determine, the"
"1525","Manager shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have"
"1526","breached any duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely"
"1527","by reason of having caused a Fund to pay a broker or dealer that"
"1528","provides brokerage and research services to the Manager an"
"1529","amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"1530","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker"
"1531","or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if the"
"1532","Manager determines in good faith that such amount of commission"
"1533","was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"1534","research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in"
"1535","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"1536","responsibilities of the Manager with respect to the Fund and to"
"1537","other clients of the Manager. The Manager is further authorized to"
"1538","allocate the orders placed by it on behalf of the Funds to brokers"
"1539","and dealers who also provide brokerage and research services"
"1540","within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange"
"1541","Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith. Such allocation shall be"
"1542","in such amounts and proportions as the Manager shall determine"
"1543","and the Manager will report on said allocations regularly to the"
"1544","Board, indicating the brokers to whom such allocations have been"
"1545","made and the basis therefore."
"1546","Section 9. Expenses. All of the ordinary business"
"1547","expenses incurred in the operations of the Funds and the offering"
"1548","of their shares shall be borne by the Funds unless specifically"
"1549","provided otherwise in this Agreement. The expenses borne by the"
"1550","Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage commissions, taxes,"
"1551","legal, auditing or governmental fees, the cost of preparing share"
"1552","certificates, custodian, transfer agent and shareholder service agent"
"1553","costs, expense of issue, sale, redemption and repurchase of shares,"
"1554","expenses of registering and qualifying shares for sale, expenses"
"1555","relating to trustees and shareholder meetings, the cost of preparing"
"1556","and distributing reports and notices to shareholders, the fees and"
"1557","other expenses incurred by the Funds in connection with"
"1558","membership in investment company organizations and the cost of"
"1559","printing copies of prospectuses and statements of additional"
"1560","information distributed to the Funds' shareholders. In addition to"
"1561","the fees described in Section 10 of this Agreement, the Trust (or its"
"1562","other service providers, as may be provided pursuant to their"
"1563","respective agreements and contracts with the Trust) shall pay all of"
"1564","its Fund-level expenses which are not expressly assumed by the"
"1565","Manager pursuant to Section 2(b) or otherwise hereunder. The"
"1566","Fund-level expenses of legal counsel and accounting experts"
"1567","retained by the Manager, after consulting with the Trust's legal"
"1568","counsel and independent auditors, as may be reasonably necessary"
"1569","or appropriate for the performance by the Manager of its duties"
"1570","under this Agreement, shall be deemed to be Fund-level expenses"
"1571","of, and shall be paid for by, the Trust."
"1572","The Manager shall pay its own expenses in connection with"
"1573","the services to be provided by it pursuant to this Agreement and"
"1574","shall, at its own expense, provide its own office space, facilities"
"1575","and equipment. In addition, the Manager shall be responsible for"
"1576","reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Trust:"
"1577","(a) to amend the Trust's registration statement or supplement the"
"1578","Fund's prospectus, and circulate the same, to reflect a change in"
"1579","the personnel of the Manager responsible for making investment"
"1580","decisions in relation to a Fund; (b) to obtain shareholder approval"
"1581","of a new sub-advisory agreement as a result of a change in
control (as such term in defined in Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940"
"1582","Act) of the Manager, or to otherwise comply with the 1940 Act,"
"1583","the Securities Act, or any other applicable statute, law, rule or"
"1584","regulation, as a result of such change; or (c) to meet other legal or"
"1585","regulatory obligations caused by actions of the Manager."
"1586","Section 10. Compensation."
"1587","(a) As compensation for the investment management services"
"1588","provided under this Agreement, the Trust shall pay the"
"1589","Manager fees, payable monthly, at the annual rates"
"1590","indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such Schedule may be"
"1591","amended or supplemented from time to time. The fees"
"1592","payable pursuant to this Paragraph shall be calculated based"
"1593","on the average daily value (as determined on each business"
"1594","day at the time set forth in the Prospectus for determining"
"1595","net asset value per share) of each Fund's net assets, as"
"1596","appropriate, during the preceding month. If the fee payable"
"1597","to the Manager pursuant to this Paragraph begins to accrue"
"1598","before the end of any month or if this Agreement"
"1599","terminates before the end of any month, the fee for the"
"1600","period from the effective date to the end of that month or"
"1601","from the beginning of that month to the termination date,"
"1602","respectively, shall be prorated according to the proportion"
"1603","that the period bears to the full month in which the"
"1604","effectiveness or termination occurs. For purposes of"
"1605","calculating each such monthly fee, the value of each Fund's"
"1606","net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in that"
"1607","Fund's registration statement as then on file with the SEC"
"1608","for the computation of the value of the Fund's net assets in"
"1609","connection with the determination of the net asset value of"
"1610","Fund shares. For purposes of this Agreement, a business
day for a Fund is any day that the Fund is open for"
"1611","trading;"
"1612","(b) No fee, other than the management fee payable monthly, at"
"1613","the annual rates indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such"
"1614","Schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to"
"1615","time, payable for the Fund-level administrative services set"
"1616","forth in Section 2(b) of this Agreement, shall be payable"
"1617","hereunder with respect to a Fund during any period in"
"1618","which the Fund invests all (or substantially all) of its"

"1620","management investment company, or a single separate"
"1621","series thereof, in accordance with Section 12(d)(1)(E)"
"1622","under the 1940 Act (a Master-Feeder Fund structure);"
"1623","(c) The Manager shall receive a fee as specified below for"
"1624","investment management services consisting of both Fundlevel"
"1625","administrative services and asset allocation services if"
"1626","a Fund invests some of its investment assets in two or more"
"1627","registered, open-end management investment companies,"
"1628","or separate series thereof, in each case, in accordance with"
"1629","Section 12(d)(1)(G) under the Act, the rules thereunder or"
"1630","an exemptive order issued by the Commission exempting"

"2655","such extent as may be directed from time to time by the Adviser."
"2656","The Sub-Adviser acknowledges that the Fund and other mutual"
"2657","funds advised by the Adviser (collectively, the fund complex) may"
"2658","engage in transactions with certain sub-advisers in the fund complex (and"
"2659","their affiliated persons) in reliance on exemptions under Rule 10f-3, Rule"
"2660","12d3-1, Rule 17a-10 and Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act. Accordingly,"
"2661","the Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that it will not consult with any other"
"2662","subadviser of a fund in the fund complex that is not an affiliated person (as"
"2663","that term is defined in the 1940 Act) of Wells Fargo & Company (Wells
Fargo), or an affiliated person of such a sub-adviser, concerning"
"2664","transactions for a fund in securities or other fund assets. With respect to a"
"2665","multi-managed Fund, the Sub-Adviser shall be limited to managing only"
"2666","the discrete portion of the Fund's portfolio as may be determined from"
"2667","time-to-time by the Board or the Adviser, and shall not consult with the"
"2668","any Sub-adviser that is not an affiliated person of Wells Fargo as to any"
"2669","other portion of the Fund's portfolio concerning transactions for the Fund"
"2670","in securities or other Fund assets."
"2671","Section 3. Duties of the Sub-Adviser."
"2672","(a) The Sub-Adviser shall make decisions with respect to all"
"2673","purchases and sales of securities and other investment assets for the Funds."
"2674","To carry out such decisions, the Sub-Adviser is hereby authorized, as"
"2675","agent and attorney-in-fact for the Trust, for the account of, at the risk of"
"2676","and in the name of the Trust, to place orders and issue instructions with"
"2677","respect to those transactions of the Funds. In all purchases, sales and other"
"2678","transactions in securities for the Funds, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to"
"2679","exercise full discretion and act for the Trust in the same manner and with"
"2680","the same force and effect as the Trust might or could do with respect to"
"2681","such purchases, sales or other transactions, as well as with respect to all"
"2682","other things necessary or incidental to the furtherance or conduct of such"
"2683","purchases, sales or other transactions."
"2684","(b) The Sub-Adviser will report to the Board at each regular"
"2685","meeting thereof all material changes in the Funds since the prior report, and"
"2686","will also keep the Board informed of important developments affecting the"
"2687","Trust, the Funds and the Sub-Adviser, and on its own initiative will furnish"
"2688","the Board from time to time with such information as the Sub-Adviser may"
"2689","believe appropriate, whether concerning the individual companies whose"
"2690","securities are held by a Fund, the industries in which they engage, or the"
"2691","economic, social or political conditions prevailing in each country in which"
"2692","the Fund maintains investments. The Sub-Adviser will also furnish the Board"
"2693","with such statistical and analytical information with respect to securities in"
"2694","the Funds as the Sub-Adviser may believe appropriate or as the Board reasonably"
"2695","may request. In making purchases and sales of securities for the Funds, the"
"2696","Sub-Adviser will comply with the policies set from time to time by the Board"
"2697","as well as the limitations imposed by the Trust's Declaration of Trust, as"
"2698","amended from time to time, By-Laws (if any), Registration Statement under"
"2699","the Act and the Securities Act, the limitations in the Act and in the Internal"
"2700","Revenue Code of 1986, as amended applicable to the Trust and the investment"
"2701","objectives, policies and restrictions of the Funds."
"2702","(c) The Sub-Adviser may from time to time employ or associate"
"2703","with such persons as the Sub-Adviser believes to be appropriate or"
"2704","necessary to assist in the execution of the Sub-Adviser's duties hereunder,"
"2705","the cost of performance of such duties to be borne and paid by the Sub-"
"2706","Adviser. No obligation may be imposed on the Trust in any such respect."
"2707","(d) The Sub-Adviser shall maintain records relating to portfolio"
"2708","transactions and the placing and allocation of brokerage orders as are"
"2709","required to be maintained by the Trust under the Act. The Sub-Adviser"
"2710","shall prepare and maintain, or cause to be prepared and maintained, in such"
"2711","form, for such periods and in such locations as may be required by"
"2712","applicable law, all documents and records relating to the services provided"
"2713","by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement required to be prepared and"
"2714","maintained by the Trust pursuant to the rules and regulations of any"
"2715","national, state, or local government entity with jurisdiction over the Trust,"
"2716","including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal"
"2717","Revenue Service. The books and records pertaining to the Trust which are"
"2718","in possession of the Sub-Adviser shall be the property of the Trust. The"
"2719","Trust, or the Trust's authorized representatives (including the Adviser), shall"
"2720","have access to such books and records at all times during the Sub-Adviser's"
"2721","normal business hours. Upon the reasonable request of the Trust, copies of"
"2722","any such books and records shall be provided promptly by the Sub-Adviser"
"2723","to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives."
"2724","Section 4. Control by Board. As is the case with respect to the"
"2725","Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, any investment"
"2726","activities undertaken by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, as"
"2727","well as any other activities undertaken by the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the"
"2728","Funds, shall at all times be subject to the direction and control the Trust's"
"2729","Board."
"2730","Section 5. Compliance with Applicable Requirements. In"
"2731","carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall at"
"2732","all times comply with:"
"2733","(a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"2734","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"2735","(b) the provisions of the registration statement of the Trust, as"
"2736","it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, under the"
"2737","Securities Act and the 1940 Act;"
"2738","(c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it"
"2739","may be amended or supplemented from time to time;"
"2740","(d) the provisions of any By-laws of the Trust, if adopted and"
"2741","as it may be amended from time to time, or resolutions of the Board as"
"2742","may be adopted from time to time;"
"2743","(e) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"
"2744","amended, applicable to the Trust or the Funds;"
"2745","(f) any other applicable provisions of state or federal law; and"
"2746","In addition, any code of ethics adopted by the Sub-Adviser must"
"2747","comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act, as it may be amended from"
"2748","time to time, and any broadly accepted industry practices, if requested by"
"2749","the Trust or the Adviser."
"2750","Section 6. Broker-Dealer Relationships. The Sub-Adviser is"
"2751","responsible for the purchase and sale of securities for the Funds, brokerdealer"
"2752","selection, and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Sub-"
"2753","Adviser's primary consideration in effecting a security transaction will be"
"2754","to obtain the best price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to"
"2755","execute each particular transaction for a Fund, the Sub-Adviser will take"
"2756","the following into consideration: the best net price available, the"
"2757","reliability, integrity and financial condition of the broker-dealer; the size"
"2758","of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value of the expected"
"2759","contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing basis."
"2760","Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any transaction may be less"
"2761","favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the difference is"
"2762","reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio execution services"
"2763","offered. Subject to such policies as the Trust's Board of Trustees may"
"2764","from time to time determine, the Sub-Adviser shall not be deemed to have"
"2765","acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this Agreement"
"2766","or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a Fund to pay a broker or"
"2767","dealer that provides brokerage and research services to the Sub-Adviser an"
"2768","amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in"
"2769","excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have"
"2770","charged for effecting that transaction, if the Sub-Adviser determines in"
"2771","good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to"
"2772","the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker"
"2773","or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the"
"2774","overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund and to"
"2775","other clients of the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser is further authorized to"
"2776","allocate the orders placed by it on behalf of the Funds to brokers and"
"2777","dealers who also provide research or statistical material, or other services"
"2778","to the Funds or to the Sub-Adviser. Such allocation shall be in such"
"2779","amounts and proportions as the Sub-Adviser shall determine and the Sub-"
"2780","Adviser will report on said allocations regularly to the Board of Trustees"
"2781","of the Trust indicating the brokers to whom such allocations have been"
"2782","made and the basis therefor."
"2783","Section 7. Expenses of the Fund. All of the ordinary business"
"2784","expenses incurred in the operations of the Funds and the offering of their"
"2785","shares shall be borne by the Funds unless specifically provided otherwise"
"2786","in this Agreement. These expenses borne by the Trust include, but are not"
"2787","limited to, brokerage commissions, taxes, legal, auditing or governmental"
"2788","fees, the cost of preparing share certificates, custodian, transfer agent and"
"2789","shareholder service agent costs, expense of issue, sale, redemption and"
"2790","repurchase of shares, expenses of registering and qualifying shares for"
"2791","sale, expenses relating to trustees and shareholder meetings, the cost of"
"2792","preparing and distributing reports and notices to shareholders, the fees and"
"2793","other expenses incurred by the Funds in connection with membership in"
"2794","investment company organizations and the cost of printing copies of"
"2795","prospectuses and statements of additional information distributed to the"
"2796","Funds' shareholders."
"2797","Section 8. Compensation. As compensation for the sub-advisory"
"2798","services provided under this Agreement, the Adviser shall pay the Sub-"
"2799","Adviser fees, payable monthly, the annual rates indicated on Schedule A"
"2800","hereto, as such Schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to"
"2801","time. It is understood that the Adviser shall be responsible for the Sub-"
"2802","Adviser's fee for its services hereunder, and the Sub-Adviser agrees that it"
"2803","shall have no claim against the Trust or the Funds with respect to"
"2804","compensation under this Agreement."
"2805","Section 9. Standard of Care. The Trust and Adviser shall expect of"
"2806","the Sub-Adviser, and the Sub-Adviser will give the Trust and the Adviser"
"2807","the benefit of, the Sub-Adviser's best judgment and efforts in rendering its"
"2808","services to the Trust, and as an inducement to the Sub-Adviser's"
"2809","undertaking these services at the compensation level specified, the Sub-"
"2810","Adviser shall not be liable hereunder for any mistake in judgment. In the"
"2811","absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, negligence or reckless disregard"
"2812","of obligations or duties hereunder on the part of the Sub-Adviser or any of"
"2813","its officers, directors, employees or agents, the Sub-Adviser shall not be"
"2814","subject to liability to the Trust or to any shareholders in the Trust for any"
"2815","act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering services"
"2816","hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding"
"2817","or sale of any security."
"2818","Section 10. Non-Exclusivity. The services of the Sub-Adviser to"
"2819","the Adviser and the Trust are not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the"
"2820","Sub-Adviser shall be free to render investment advisory and"
"2821","administrative or other services to others (including other investment"
"2822","companies) and to engage in other activities. It is understood and agreed"
"2823","that officers or directors of the Sub-Adviser are not prohibited from"
"2824","engaging in any other business activity or from rendering services to any"
"2825","other person, or from serving as partners, officers, directors or trustees of"
"2826","any other firm or trust, including other investment advisory companies."
"2827","Section 11. Records. The Sub-Adviser shall, with respect to orders"
"2828","the Sub-Adviser places for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities of"
"2829","the Funds, maintain or arrange for the maintenance of the documents and"
"2830","records required pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act as well as"
"2831","trade tickets and confirmations of portfolio trades and such other records"
"2832","as the Adviser or the Funds' Administrator reasonably requests to be"
"2833","maintained. All such records shall be maintained in a form acceptable to"
"2834","the Funds and in compliance with the provisions of Rule 31a-1 or any"
"2835","successor rule. All such records will be the property of the Funds, and"
"2836","will be available for inspection and use by the Funds and their authorized"
"2837","representatives (including the Adviser). The Sub-Adviser shall promptly,"
"2838","upon the Trust's request, surrender to the Funds those records which are"
"2839","the property of the Trust or any Fund. The Sub-Adviser will promptly"
"2840","notify the Funds' Administrator if it experiences any difficulty in"
"2841","maintaining the records in an accurate and complete manner."
"2842","Section 12. Term and Approval. This Agreement shall become"
"2843","effective with respect to a Fund after it is approved in accordance with the"
"2844","express requirements of the 1940 Act, and executed by the Trust, Adviser"
"2845","and Sub-Adviser and shall thereafter continue from year to year, provided"
"2846","that the continuation of the Agreement is approved in accordance with the"
"2847","requirements of the 1940 Act, which currently requires that the"
"2848","continuation be approved at least annually:"
"2849","(a) (i) by the Trust's Board of Trustees or (ii) by the vote of a
majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund (as defined in"
"2850","Section 2(a)(42) of the 1940 Act), and"
"2851","(b) by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Trust's Trustees"
"2852","who are not parties to this Agreement or interested persons (as defined"
"2853","in the 1940 Act) of a party to this Agreement (other than as Trustees of the"
"2854","Trust), by votes cast in person at a meeting specifically called for such"
"2855","purpose."
"2856","Section 13. Termination. As required under the 1940 Act, this"
"2857","Agreement may be terminated with respect to a Fund at any time, without"
"2858","the payment of any penalty, by vote of the Trust's Board of Trustees or by"
"2859","vote of a majority of a Fund's outstanding voting securities, or by the"
"2860","Adviser or Sub-Adviser, on sixty (60) days written notice to the other"
"2861","party. The notice provided for herein may be waived by the party entitled"
"2862","to receipt thereof. This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the"
"2863","event of its assignment, the term assignment for purposes of this"
"2864","paragraph having the meaning defined in Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act,"
"2865","as it may be interpreted by the Commission or its staff in interpretive"
"2866","releases, or applied by the Commission staff in no-action letters, issued"
"2867","under the 1940 Act."
"2868","Section 14. Indemnification by the Sub-Adviser. The Trust shall"
"2869","not be responsible for, and the Sub-Adviser shall indemnify and hold the"
"2870","Trust or any Fund of the Trust harmless from and against, any and all"
"2871","losses, damages, costs, charges, counsel fees, payments, expenses and"
"2872","liability arising out of or attributable to the willful misfeasance, bad faith,"
"2873","negligent acts or reckless disregard of obligations or duties of the Sub-"
"2874","Adviser or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents."
"2875","Section 15. Indemnification by the Trust. In the absence of willful"
"2876","misfeasance, bad faith, negligence or reckless disregard of duties"
"2877","hereunder on the part of the Sub-Adviser or any of its officers, directors,"
"2878","employees or agents, the Trust hereby agrees to indemnify and hold"
"2879","harmless the Sub-Adviser against all claims, actions, suits or proceedings"
"2880","at law or in equity whether brought by a private party or a governmental"

"2883","securities, whether of the Funds or other securities, undertaken by the"
"2884","Funds, their officers, directors, employees or affiliates, resulting from any"
"2885","violations of the securities laws, rules, regulations, statutes and codes,"
"2886","whether federal or of any state, by the Funds, their officers, directors,"
"2887","employees or affiliates. Federal and state securities laws impose liabilities"
"2888","under certain circumstances on persons who act in good faith, and nothing"
"2889","herein shall constitute a waiver or limitation of any rights which a Fund may"
"2890","have and which may not be waived under any applicable federal and state"
"2891","securities laws."
"2892","Section 16. Notices. Any notices under this Agreement shall be in"
"2893","writing, addressed and delivered or mailed postage paid to the other party"
"2894","at such address as such other party may designate for the receipt of such"

"2903","interpretation of any term or provision of this Agreement having a"
"2904","counterpart in or otherwise derived from a term or provision of the 1940"
"2905","Act shall be resolved by reference to such terms or provision of the 1940"
"2906","Act and to interpretations thereof, if any, by the United States Courts or in"
"2907","the absence of any controlling decision of any such court, by rules,"
"2908","regulations or orders of the Commission, or interpretations of the"
"2909","Commission or its staff, or Commission staff no-action letters, issued"
"2910","pursuant to the 1940 Act. In addition, where the effect of a requirement of"

"2921","amended October 28, 1999, May 9, 2000 and July 25, 2000. No provision"
"2922","of this Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated"
"2923","orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against"
"2924","which enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is"
"2925","sought. If shareholder approval of an amendment is required under the"
"2926","1940 Act, no such amendment shall become effective until approved by a"
"2927","vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of the affected Funds."
"2928","Otherwise, a written amendment of this Agreement is effective upon the"
"2929","approval of the Board of Trustees, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser."
"2930","Section 19. Wells Fargo Name. The Sub-Adviser and the Trust"
"2931","each agree that the name Wells Fargo, which comprises a component of"

"2940","commercial purpose, other than a grant of such right to another registered"
"2941","investment company not advised by the Adviser or one of its affiliates;"
"2942","and (iv) in the event that the Adviser or an affiliate thereof is no longer"
"2943","acting as investment adviser to any Fund or class of a Fund, the Trust"
"2944","shall, upon request by the Adviser, promptly take such action as may be"
"2945","necessary to change its corporate name to one not containing the words"
"2946","Wells Fargo and following such change, shall not use the words Wells
Fargo, or any combination thereof, as a part of its corporate name or for"
"2947","any other commercial purpose, and shall use its best efforts to cause its"
"2948","trustees, officers and shareholders to take any and all actions that the"
"2949","Adviser may request to effect the foregoing and to reconvey to the Adviser"
"2950","any and all rights to such words."
