"2447","<PAGE>"
"2448","     SECTION 2. DUTIES OF THE ADVISER."
"2449","     (a) The Adviser shall make decisions with respect to all purchases and"
"2450","sales of securities and other investment assets for the Funds. Among other"
"2451","things, the Adviser shall make all decisions with respect to the allocation of"
"2452","the Funds' investments in various securities or other assets, in investment"

"2456","the risk of and in the name of the Trust, to place orders and issue instructions"
"2457","with respect to those transactions of the Funds. In all purchases, sales and"
"2458","other transactions in securities for the Funds, the Adviser is authorized to"
"2459","exercise full discretion and act for the Trust in the same manner and with the"
"2460","same force and effect as the Trust might or could do with respect to such"

"2471","conditions prevailing in each country in which a Fund maintains investments. The"
"2472","Adviser will also furnish the Board with such statistical and analytical"
"2473","information with respect to securities in the Funds as the Adviser may believe"
"2474","appropriate or as the Board reasonably may request."

"2485","that the employment or sub-contracting with any such person shall not relieve"
"2486","the Adviser of its responsibilities or liabilities hereunder and provided"
"2487","further that the Adviser shall not have the authority to sub-contract advisory"
"2488","responsibilities without the consent of the Trust. The cost of performance of"
"2489","such duties will be borne and paid by the Adviser. No obligation may be imposed"
"2490","on the Trust in any such respect."
"2491","          The Adviser shall supervise and monitor the activities of its"
"2492","representatives, personnel, sub-contractors, and agents in connection with the"

"2529","     SECTION 4. DELEGATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES. The Adviser may carry out any of"
"2530","its obligations under this Agreement by employing, subject to supervision by the"
"2531","Adviser, one or more Sub-Adviser(s) who are registered as investment advisers"
"2532","pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Sub-Advisers). Each"
"2533","Sub-Adviser's employment will be evidenced by a separate written agreement"
"2534","approved by the Board and, if required under the 1940 Act, by the shareholders"
"2535","of the Fund (unless the Commission or its staff has given authorization or"
"2536","issued an interpretation dispensing with the requirement of shareholder"
"2537","approval). The Adviser shall not be liable hereunder for any act or omission of"
"2538","any Sub-Adviser, except for failure to exercise good faith in the employment of"
"2539","the Sub-Adviser and for failure to exercise appropriate supervision of such"
"2540","Sub-Adviser, and as may otherwise be agreed in writing. The Adviser shall be"
"2541","solely responsible for compensating any Sub-Adviser for services rendered under"
"2542","any Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Adviser may, from time to time and at any time,"
"2543","terminate any Sub-Adviser and reassume the responsibilities assigned to such"
"2544","Sub-Adviser with respect to any Fund without obtaining the approval of the"
"2545","shareholders of the Fund."

"2547","<PAGE>"
"2548","     SECTION 5. CONTROL BY BOARD. Any investment activities undertaken by the"
"2549","Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any other activities undertaken"
"2550","by the Adviser on behalf of the Funds, shall at all times be subject to the"
"2551","direction and control of the Board."
"2552","     SECTION 6. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS. In carrying out its"
"2553","obligations under this Agreement, the Adviser shall at all times comply with:"
"2554","     (a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"2555","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"2556","     (b) the Registration Statement of the Trust, as it may be amended from time"
"2557","to time, filed with the Commission under the Securities Act and the 1940 Act;"
"2558","     (c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it may be"
"2559","amended from time to time;"
"2560","     (d) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,"
"2561","applicable to the Trust or the Funds, and any rules and regulations adopted"
"2562","thereunder; and"
"2563","     (e)any other applicable provisions of state or federal law, and any rules"
"2564","and regulations adopted thereunder."
"2565","     SECTION 7. PROXIES. The Adviser shall have responsibility to vote proxies"
"2566","solicited with respect to issuers of securities in which assets of the Funds are"
"2567","invested in accordance with the Trust's policies on proxy voting."
"2568","     SECTION 8. BROKER-DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. In connection with the purchase and"
"2569","sale of securities for the Funds, the Adviser is responsible for broker-dealer"
"2570","selection and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Adviser's primary"
"2571","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain the best"
"2572","price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular"
"2573","transaction for a Fund, the Adviser will consider among other things: the best"
"2574","net price available, the reliability, integrity and financial condition of the"
"2575","broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value"
"2576","of the expected contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing"
"2577","basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any transaction may be less"
"2578","favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the difference is"
"2579","reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio execution services"
"2580","offered. Subject to such policies as the Board may from time to time determine,"
"2581","the Adviser shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any"
"2582","duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a"
"2583","Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and research services to"
"2584","the Adviser an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"2585","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would"
"2586","have charged for effecting that transaction, if the Adviser determines in good"
"2587","faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of"
"2588","the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in"
"2589","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of"
"2590","the Adviser with respect to the Fund and to other clients of the"
"2591","                                       4"
"2592","<PAGE>"
"2593","Adviser. The Adviser is further authorized to allocate the orders placed by it"
"2594","on behalf of the Funds to brokers and dealers who also provide brokerage and"
"2595","research services within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange"
"2596","Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith. Such allocation shall be in such"
"2597","amounts and proportions as the Adviser shall determine and the Adviser will"
"2598","report on said allocations regularly to the Board, indicating the brokers to"
"2599","whom such allocations have been made and the basis therefore."
"2600","     SECTION 9. EXPENSES. All of the ordinary business expenses incurred in the"
"2601","operations of the Funds and the offering of their shares shall be borne by the"
"2602","Funds unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement. The expenses"
"2603","borne by the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage commissions,"

"2741","regulation or order of the Commission, such provision shall be deemed to"
"2742","incorporate the effect of such rule, regulation or order. The duties and"
"2743","obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall be governed by and"
"2744","construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent"
"2745","that state law is not preempted by the provisions of any law of the United"
"2746","States heretofore or hereafter enacted."
"2747","     SECTION 20. AMENDMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. This Agreement supersedes the"
"2748","advisory agreement between the parties hereto dated March 1, 2001. No provision"
"2749","of this Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, but"
"2750","only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which enforcement"
"2751","of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought. If shareholder"
"2752","approval of an amendment is required under the 1940 Act, no such amendment shall"
"2753","become effective until approved by a vote of the majority of the outstanding"
"2754","shares of the affected Funds. Otherwise, a written amendment of this Agreement"
"2755","is effective upon the approval of the Board and the Adviser."
"2756","     SECTION 21. WELLS FARGO NAME. The Adviser and the Trust each agree that the"
"2757","name Wells Fargo, which comprises a component of the Trust's name, is a"
"2758","property right of the parent of the Adviser. The Trust agrees and consents that:"
"2759","(i) it will use the words Wells Fargo as a component of its corporate name,"
"2760","the name of any series or class, or all of the above, and for no other purpose;"
"2761","(ii) it will not grant to any third party the right to use the name Wells
Fargo for any purpose; (iii) the Adviser or any corporate affiliate of the"
"2762","Adviser may use or grant to others the right to use the words Wells Fargo, or"
"2763","any combination or abbreviation thereof, as all or a portion of a corporate or"
"2764","business name or for any commercial purpose, other than a grant of such right to"
"2765","another registered investment company not advised by the Adviser or one of its"
"2766","affiliates; and (iv) in the event that the Adviser or an affiliate thereof is no"
"2767","longer acting as investment adviser to any Fund, the Trust shall, upon request"
"2768","by the Adviser, promptly take such action as may be necessary to change its"
"2769","corporate name to one not containing the words Wells Fargo and following such"
"2770","change, shall not use the words Wells Fargo, or any combination thereof, as a"
"2771","part of its corporate name or for any other commercial purpose, and shall use"
"2772","its best efforts to cause its trustees, officers and shareholders to take any"
"2773","and all actions that the Adviser may request to effect the foregoing and to"
"2774","reconvey to the Adviser any and all rights to such words."
"2775","     SECTION 22. RISK ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. The Adviser does not guarantee the future"
"2776","performance of the Funds or any specific level of performance, the success of"
"2777","any investment decision or strategy that the Adviser may use, or the success of"
"2778","the Adviser's overall management of the Funds. The Trust understands that"
"2779","investment decisions made for the Funds by the Adviser are subject to various"
"2780","market, currency, economic and business risks, and that those investment"
"2781","decisions will not always be profitable. The Adviser will manage only the"
"2782","securities, cash and other investments for which management responsibility is"
"2783","delegated to it and which are held in the Funds' account(s) and, in making"
"2784","investment decisions for the Funds, the Adviser will not consider any other"
"2785","securities, cash or other investments owned by the Trust."

"3429","January 31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of"
"3430","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"3431","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"3432","control over financial reporting, including controls"
"3433","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"3434","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"3435","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"3436","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"3437","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"3438","of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3439","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3440","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"3441","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"3442","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"3443","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"3444","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"3445","company's internal control over financial reporting is"
"3446","a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"3447","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"3448","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"3449","purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"3450","principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"3451","reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"3452","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"3453","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"3454","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"3455","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"3456","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"3457","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"3458","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"3459","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"3460","of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"3461","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"3462","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition"
"3463","of the company's assets that could have a material effect"
"3464","on the financial statements."
"3465","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"3466","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"3467","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"3468","future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"3469","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"3470","the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may"
"3471","deteriorate."
"3472","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"3473","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"3474","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"3475","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3476","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"3477","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"3478","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"3479","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"3480","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"3481","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3482","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"3483","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"3484","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"3485","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"3486","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"3487","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we"
"3488","noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over"
"3489","financial reporting and its operations, including controls"
"3490","over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"3491","material weakness as defined above as of January 31, 2014."

"3620","securities are held by a Fund, the industries in which they engage, or the"
"3621","economic, social or political conditions prevailing in each country in which"
"3622","the Fund maintains investments. The Sub-Adviser will also furnish the Board"
"3623","with such statistical and analytical information with respect to securities in"

"3633","with such persons as the Sub-Adviser believes to be appropriate or"
"3634","necessary to assist in the execution of the Sub-Adviser's duties hereunder,"

"3637","(d) The Sub-Adviser shall maintain records relating to portfolio"
"3638","transactions and the placing and allocation of brokerage orders as are"
"3639","required to be maintained by the Trust under the Act. The Sub-Adviser"
"3640","shall prepare and maintain, or cause to be prepared and maintained, in such"
"3641","form, for such periods and in such locations as may be required by"
"3642","applicable law, all documents and records relating to the services provided"

"3644","maintained by the Trust pursuant to the rules and regulations of any"
"3645","national, state, or local government entity with jurisdiction over the Trust,"
"3646","including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal"
"3647","Revenue Service. The books and records pertaining to the Trust which are"
"3648","in possession of the Sub-Adviser shall be the property of the Trust. The"
"3649","Trust, or the Trust's authorized representatives (including the Adviser), shall"
"3650","have access to such books and records at all times during the Sub-Adviser's"
"3651","normal business hours. Upon the reasonable request of the Trust, copies of"
"3652","any such books and records shall be provided promptly by the Sub-Adviser"
"3653","to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives."
"3654","Section 4. Control by Board. As is the case with respect to the"
"3655","Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, any investment"
"3656","activities undertaken by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, as"
"3657","well as any other activities undertaken by the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the"
"3658","Funds, shall at all times be subject to the direction and control the Trust's"
"3659","Board."
"3660","Section 5. Compliance with Applicable Requirements. In"
"3661","carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall at"
"3662","all times comply with:"
"3663","(a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"3664","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"3665","(b) the provisions of the registration statement of the Trust, as"
"3666","it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, under the"
"3667","Securities Act and the 1940 Act;"
"3668","(c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it"
"3669","may be amended or supplemented from time to time;"
"3670","(d) the provisions of any By-laws of the Trust, if adopted and"
"3671","as it may be amended from time to time, or resolutions of the Board as"
"3672","may be adopted from time to time;"
"3673","(e) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"
"3674","amended, applicable to the Trust or the Funds;"
"3675","(f) any other applicable provisions of state or federal law; and"
"3676","In addition, any code of ethics adopted by the Sub-Adviser must"
"3677","comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act, as it may be amended from"
"3678","time to time, and any broadly accepted industry practices, if requested by"
"3679","the Trust or the Adviser."
"3680","Section 6. Broker-Dealer Relationships. The Sub-Adviser is"
"3681","responsible for the purchase and sale of securities for the Funds, brokerdealer"
"3682","selection, and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Sub-"
"3683","Adviser's primary consideration in effecting a security transaction will be"
"3684","to obtain the best price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to"
"3685","execute each particular transaction for a Fund, the Sub-Adviser will take"
"3686","the following into consideration: the best net price available, the"
"3687","reliability, integrity and financial condition of the broker-dealer; the size"
"3688","of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value of the expected"
"3689","contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing basis."
"3690","Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any transaction may be less"
"3691","favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the difference is"
"3692","reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio execution services"
"3693","offered. Subject to such policies as the Trust's Board of Trustees may"
"3694","from time to time determine, the Sub-Adviser shall not be deemed to have"
"3695","acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this Agreement"
"3696","or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a Fund to pay a broker or"
"3697","dealer that provides brokerage and research services to the Sub-Adviser an"
"3698","amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in"
"3699","excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have"
"3700","charged for effecting that transaction, if the Sub-Adviser determines in"
"3701","good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to"
"3702","the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker"
"3703","or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the"
"3704","overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund and to"
"3705","other clients of the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser is further authorized to"
"3706","allocate the orders placed by it on behalf of the Funds to brokers and"
"3707","dealers who also provide research or statistical material, or other services"
"3708","to the Funds or to the Sub-Adviser. Such allocation shall be in such"
"3709","amounts and proportions as the Sub-Adviser shall determine and the Sub-"
"3710","Adviser will report on said allocations regularly to the Board of Trustees"
"3711","of the Trust indicating the brokers to whom such allocations have been"
"3712","made and the basis therefor."
"3713","Section 7. Expenses of the Fund. All of the ordinary business"
"3714","expenses incurred in the operations of the Funds and the offering of their"
"3715","shares shall be borne by the Funds unless specifically provided otherwise"
"3716","in this Agreement. These expenses borne by the Trust include, but are not"
"3717","limited to, brokerage commissions, taxes, legal, auditing or governmental"
"3718","fees, the cost of preparing share certificates, custodian, transfer agent and"
"3719","shareholder service agent costs, expense of issue, sale, redemption and"
"3720","repurchase of shares, expenses of registering and qualifying shares for"
"3721","sale, expenses relating to trustees and shareholder meetings, the cost of"
"3722","preparing and distributing reports and notices to shareholders, the fees and"
"3723","other expenses incurred by the Funds in connection with membership in"
"3724","investment company organizations and the cost of printing copies of"
"3725","prospectuses and statements of additional information distributed to the"
"3726","Funds' shareholders."
"3727","Section 8. Compensation. As compensation for the sub-advisory"
"3728","services provided under this Agreement, the Adviser shall pay the Sub-"
"3729","Adviser fees, payable monthly, the annual rates indicated on Schedule A"
"3730","hereto, as such Schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to"
"3731","time. It is understood that the Adviser shall be responsible for the Sub-"
"3732","Adviser's fee for its services hereunder, and the Sub-Adviser agrees that it"
"3733","shall have no claim against the Trust or the Funds with respect to"
"3734","compensation under this Agreement."
"3735","Section 9. Standard of Care. The Trust and Adviser shall expect of"
"3736","the Sub-Adviser, and the Sub-Adviser will give the Trust and the Adviser"
"3737","the benefit of, the Sub-Adviser's best judgment and efforts in rendering its"
"3738","services to the Trust, and as an inducement to the Sub-Adviser's"
"3739","undertaking these services at the compensation level specified, the Sub-"
"3740","Adviser shall not be liable hereunder for any mistake in judgment. In the"
"3741","absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, negligence or reckless disregard"
"3742","of obligations or duties hereunder on the part of the Sub-Adviser or any of"
"3743","its officers, directors, employees or agents, the Sub-Adviser shall not be"
"3744","subject to liability to the Trust or to any shareholders in the Trust for any"
"3745","act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering services"
"3746","hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding"
"3747","or sale of any security."
"3748","Section 10. Non-Exclusivity. The services of the Sub-Adviser to"
"3749","the Adviser and the Trust are not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the"
"3750","Sub-Adviser shall be free to render investment advisory and"
"3751","administrative or other services to others (including other investment"
"3752","companies) and to engage in other activities. It is understood and agreed"
"3753","that officers or directors of the Sub-Adviser are not prohibited from"
"3754","engaging in any other business activity or from rendering services to any"
"3755","other person, or from serving as partners, officers, directors or trustees of"
"3756","any other firm or trust, including other investment advisory companies."
"3757","Section 11. Records. The Sub-Adviser shall, with respect to orders"
"3758","the Sub-Adviser places for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities of"
"3759","the Funds, maintain or arrange for the maintenance of the documents and"
"3760","records required pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act as well as"
"3761","trade tickets and confirmations of portfolio trades and such other records"
"3762","as the Adviser or the Funds' Administrator reasonably requests to be"
"3763","maintained. All such records shall be maintained in a form acceptable to"
"3764","the Funds and in compliance with the provisions of Rule 31a-1 or any"
"3765","successor rule. All such records will be the property of the Funds, and"
"3766","will be available for inspection and use by the Funds and their authorized"
"3767","representatives (including the Adviser). The Sub-Adviser shall promptly,"
"3768","upon the Trust's request, surrender to the Funds those records which are"
"3769","the property of the Trust or any Fund. The Sub-Adviser will promptly"
"3770","notify the Funds' Administrator if it experiences any difficulty in"
"3771","maintaining the records in an accurate and complete manner."
"3772","Section 12. Term and Approval. This Agreement shall become"
"3773","effective with respect to a Fund after it is approved in accordance with the"
"3774","express requirements of the 1940 Act, and executed by the Trust, Adviser"
"3775","and Sub-Adviser and shall thereafter continue from year to year, provided"
"3776","that the continuation of the Agreement is approved in accordance with the"
"3777","requirements of the 1940 Act, which currently requires that the"
"3778","continuation be approved at least annually:"

"3782","who are not parties to this Agreement or interested persons (as defined"
"3783","in the 1940 Act) of a party to this Agreement (other than as Trustees of the"
"3784","Trust), by votes cast in person at a meeting specifically called for such"
"3785","purpose."

"3787","Agreement may be terminated with respect to a Fund at any time, without"

"3789","vote of a majority of a Fund's outstanding voting securities, or by the"
"3790","Adviser or Sub-Adviser, on sixty (60) days written notice to the other"
"3791","party. The notice provided for herein may be waived by the party entitled"
"3792","to receipt thereof. This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the"
