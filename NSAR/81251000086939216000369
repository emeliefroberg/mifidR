"565","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"566","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"567","Putnam Global Equity Fund:"
"568","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"569","of Putnam Global Equity Fund ( the Fund ) as of and for the year"
"570","ended October 31, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the"
"571","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"572","considered the Funds internal control over financial reporting,"
"573","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"574","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"575","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"576","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"577","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"578","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no"
"579","such opinion."
"580","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"581","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"582","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"583","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"584","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"585","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"586","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"587","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"588","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"589","A companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"590","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"591","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"592","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"593","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"594","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"595","financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"596","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"597","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"598","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"599","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"600","or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material"
"601","effect on the financial statements."
"602","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"603","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"604","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"605","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"606","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"607","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"608","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"609","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"610","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"611","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"612","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"613","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"614","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"615","material misstatement of a funds annual or interim financial"
"616","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"617","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"618","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"619","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"620","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"621","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"622","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"623","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"624","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"625","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"626","October 31, 2016."
"627","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"628","management and the Board of Trustees of Putnam Global Equity"
"629","Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"630","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"631","specified parties."

"705","PUTNAM FUNDS"
"706","SUB-MANAGEMENT CONTRACT"
"707","      This Sub-Management Contract is dated as of February 27,"
"708","2014 between PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, LLC, a Delaware"
"709","limited liability company (the Manager) and PUTNAM INVESTMENTS"
"710","LIMITED, a company organized under the laws of England and Wales"
"711","(the Sub-Manager)."
"712","      WHEREAS, the Manager is the investment manager of each of"
"713","the investment companies registered under the United States"
"714","Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, that are identified"
"715","on Schedule A hereto, as it may from time to time be amended by"
"716","the Manager (the Funds), and a registered investment adviser"
"717","under the United States Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as"
"718","amended;"
"719","      WHEREAS, the Sub-Manager is licensed as an investment"
"720","manager by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom"
"721","(the FCA); and"
"722","      WHEREAS, the Manager desires to engage the Sub-Manager from"
"723","time to time to manage a portion of certain of the Funds:"
"724","      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants"
"725","herein contained, it is agreed as follows:"
"726","1.	SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BY SUB-MANAGER."
"727","      (a)	The Sub-Manager, at its expense, will furnish"
"728","continuously an investment program for that portion of any Fund"
"729","the management of which is allocated from time to time by the"
"730","Manager to the Sub-Manager (an Allocated Sleeve). The Manager"
"731","shall, in its sole discretion, determine which Funds will have an"
"732","Allocated Sleeve and the amount of assets allocated from time to"
"733","time to each such Allocated Sleeve; provided that, with respect"
"734","to any Fund, the Trustees of such Fund must have approved the use"
"735","of the Sub-Manager prior to the creation of an Allocated Sleeve"
"736","for such Fund. The Sub-Manager will determine what investments"
"737","shall be purchased, held, sold or exchanged by any Allocated"
"738","Sleeve and what portion, if any, of the assets of the Allocated"
"739","Sleeve shall be held uninvested and shall, on behalf of the Fund,"
"740","make changes in the Funds investments held in such Allocated"
"741","Sleeve."
"742","      (b)	The Manager may also, at its discretion, request the"
"743","Sub-Manager to provide assistance with purchasing and selling"
"744","securities for any Fund, including the placement of orders with"
"745","broker-dealers selected in accordance with Section 1(d), even if"
"746","the Manager has not established an Allocated Sleeve for such"
"747","Fund."
"748","      (c)	The Sub-Manager at its expense will furnish all"
"749","necessary investment and management facilities, including"
"750","salaries of personnel, required for it to execute its duties"
"751","faithfully."
"752","      (d)	The Sub-Manager shall place all orders for the purchase"
"753","and sale of portfolio investments for any Allocated Sleeve with"
"754","brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Manager. In the selection"
"755","of such brokers or dealers and the placing of such orders, the"
"756","Sub-Manager shall use its best efforts to obtain for the related"
"757","Fund the most favorable price and execution available, except to"
"758","the extent it may be permitted to pay higher brokerage"
"759","commissions for brokerage and research services as described"
"760","below. In using its best efforts to obtain for the Fund the most"
"761","favorable price and execution available, the Sub-Manager, bearing"
"762","in mind the Funds best interests at all times, shall consider all"
"763","factors it deems relevant, including by way of illustration,"
"764","price, the size of the transaction, the nature of the market for"
"765","the security, the amount of the commission, the timing of the"
"766","transaction taking into account market prices and trends, the"
"767","reputation, experience and financial stability of the broker or"
"768","dealer involved and the quality of service rendered by the broker"
"769","or dealer in other transactions. Subject to such policies as the"
"770","Trustees of the Funds may determine, the Sub-Manager shall not be"
"771","deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty"
"772","created by this Contract or otherwise solely by reason of its"
"773","having caused a Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides"
"774","brokerage and research services to the Manager or the Sub-Manager"
"775","an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"776","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker"
"777","or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if"
"778","the Sub-Manager determines in good faith that such amount of"
"779","commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"780","brokerage and research services provided by such broker or"
"781","dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or"
"782","its overall responsibilities with respect to the Fund and to"
"783","other clients of the Manager or the Sub-Manager as to which the"
"784","Manager or the Sub-Manager exercises investment discretion. The"
"785","Sub-Manager agrees that in connection with purchases or sales of"
"786","portfolio investments for any Fund, neither the Sub-Manager nor"
"787","any officer, director, employee or agent of the Sub-Manager shall"
"788","act as a principal or receive any commission other than as"
"789","provided in Section 3."
"790","      (e)	The Sub-Manager shall not be obligated to pay any"
"791","expenses of or for the Manager or any Fund not expressly assumed"
"792","by the Sub-Manager pursuant to this Section 1."
"793","      (f)	In the performance of its duties, the Sub-Manager will"
"794","comply with the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of"
"795","Trust and By-Laws of each applicable Fund and such Funds stated"
"796","investment objectives, policies and restrictions, and will use"
"797","its best efforts to safeguard and promote the welfare of such"
"798","Fund and to comply with other policies which the Manager or the"
"799","Trustees may from time to time determine and shall exercise the"
"800","same care and diligence expected of the Manager."
"801","2.	OTHER AGREEMENTS, ETC."
"802","      It is understood that any of the shareholders, Trustees,"
"803","officers and employees of a Fund may be a shareholder, director,"
"804","officer or employee of, or be otherwise interested in, the Sub-"
"805","Manager, and in any person controlled by or under common control"
"806","with the Sub-Manager, and that the Sub-Manager and any person"
"807","controlled by or under common control with the Sub-Manager may"
"808","have an interest in such Fund. It is also understood that the"
"809","Sub-Manager and any person controlled by or under common control"
"810","with the Sub-Manager have and may have advisory, management,"
"811","service or other contracts with other organizations and persons,"
"812","and may have other interests and business."
"813","3.	COMPENSATION."
"814","      Except as provided below, the Manager will pay to the Sub-"
"815","Manager as compensation for the Sub-Managers services rendered, a"
"816","fee, computed and paid quarterly at the annual rate of 0.35% per"
"817","annum of average aggregate net asset value of the assets in"
"818","equity and asset allocation Allocated Sleeves and 0.40% per annum"
"819","of average aggregate net asset value of the assets in fixed"
"820","income Allocated Sleeves, except for fixed income Allocated"
"821","Sleeves in certain fixed income Funds enumerated as follows (with"
"822","the per annum fee provided in parentheses): Putnam Money Market"
"823","Liquidity Fund (0.20%), Putnam Government Money Market Fund"
"824","(0.20%), Putnam Short Term Investment Fund (0.20%), Putnam Money"
"825","Market Fund (0.25%),  Putnam VT Government Money Market Fund"
"826","(0.25%), Putnam Short Duration Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam Short-"
"827","Term Municipal Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam American Government"
"828","Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam U.S."
"829","Government Income Trust (0.25%), Putnam VT American Government"
"830","Income Fund (0.25%), and Putnam VT Income Fund (0.25%)."
"831","      Such average net asset value shall be determined by taking"
"832","an average of all of the determinations of such net asset value"
"833","during a quarter at the close of business on each business day"
"834","during such quarter while this Contract is in effect. Such fee"
"835","shall be payable for each quarter within 30 days after the close"
"836","of such quarter. The Sub-Manager shall look only to the Manager"
"837","for payment of its fees. No Fund shall have any responsibility"
"838","for paying any fees due the Sub-Manager."
"839","      With respect to each of Putnam High Income Securities Fund,"
"840","Putnam Master Intermediate Income Trust and Putnam Premier Income"
"841","Trust, the Manager will pay to the Sub-Manager as compensation"
"842","for the Sub-Managers services rendered, a fee, computed and paid"
"843","quarterly at the annual rate of 0.40% of Average Weekly Assets in"
"844","Allocated Sleeves. Average Weekly Assets means the average of the"
"845","weekly determinations of the difference between the total assets"
"846","of the Fund (including any assets attributable to leverage for"
"847","investment purposes) attributable to an Allocated Sleeve and the"
"848","total liabilities of the Fund (excluding liabilities incurred in"
"849","connection with leverage for investment purposes) attributable to"
"850","such Allocated Sleeve, determined at the close of the last"
"851","business day of each week, for each week which ends during the"
"852","quarter. Such fee shall be payable for each quarter within 30"
"853","days after the close of such quarter. As used in this Section 3,"
"854","leverage for investment purposes means any incurrence of"
"855","indebtedness the proceeds of which are to be invested in"
"856","accordance with the Funds investment objective. For purposes of"
"857","calculating Average Weekly Assets, liabilities associated with"
"858","any instruments or transactions used to leverage the Funds"
"859","portfolio for investment purposes (whether or not such"
"860","instruments or transactions are covered within the meaning of the"
"861","Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules and regulations"
"862","thereunder, giving effect to any interpretations of the"
"863","Securities and Exchange Commission and its staff) are not"
"864","considered liabilities. For purposes of calculating Average"
"865","Weekly Assets, the total assets of the Fund will be deemed to"
"866","include (a) any proceeds from the sale or transfer of an asset"
"867","(the Underlying Asset) of the Fund to a counterparty in a reverse"
"868","repurchase or dollar roll transaction and (b) the value of such"
"869","Underlying Asset as of the relevant measuring date."
"870","      In the event that the Managers management fee from any of"
"871","Putnam High Income Securities Fund, Putnam Master Intermediate"
"872","Income Trust or Putnam Premier Income Trust is reduced pursuant"
"873","to the investment management contract between such Fund and the"
"874","Manager because during any Measurement Period (as defined below)"
"875","the amount of interest payments and fees with respect to"
"876","indebtedness or other obligation of the Fund incurred for"
"877","investment leverage purposes, plus additional expenses"
"878","attributable to any such leverage for investment purposes,"
"879","exceeds the portion of the Funds net income and net short-term"
"880","capital gains (but not long-term capital gains) accruing during"
"881","such Measurement Period as a result of the fact that such"
"882","indebtedness or other obligation was outstanding during the"
"883","Measurement Period, the fee payable to  the Sub-Manager with"
"884","respect to such Fund shall be reduced in the same proportion as"
"885","the fee paid to the Manager with respect to such Fund is so"
"886","reduced. Measurement Period shall be any period for which"
"887","payments of interest or fees (whether designated as such or"
"888","implied) are payable in connection with any indebtedness or other"
"889","obligation of the Fund incurred for investment purposes."
"890","      If the Sub-Manager shall serve for less than the whole of a"
"891","quarter, the foregoing compensation shall be prorated."
"892","4.	ASSIGNMENT TERMINATES THIS CONTRACT; AMENDMENTS OF THIS"
"893","CONTRACT."
"894","      This Contract shall automatically terminate without the"
"895","payment of any penalty, in the event of its assignment; and this"
"896","Contract shall not be amended with respect to any Allocated"

"898","vote, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of"
"899","voting on such approval, of a majority of the Trustees of the"
"900","related Fund who are not interested persons of such Fund or of"
"901","the Manager."
"902","5.	EFFECTIVE PERIOD AND TERMINATION OF THIS CONTRACT."
"903","      This Contract shall become effective upon its execution, and"
"904","shall remain in full force and effect continuously thereafter"
"905","(unless terminated automatically as set forth in Section 4) until"

"907","      (a)	Either party hereto or, with respect to any Allocated"
"908","Sleeve, the related Fund may at any time terminate this Contract"
"909","by not more than sixty days nor less than thirty days written"
"910","notice delivered or mailed by registered mail, postage prepaid,"
"911","to the other party, or"
"912","      (b)	With respect to any Allocated Sleeve, if (i) the"
"913","Trustees of the related Fund or the shareholders by the"
"914","affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of such"

"916","not interested persons of such Fund or of the Manager, by vote"
"917","cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on"
"918","such approval, do not specifically approve at least annually the"
"919","continuance of this Contract, then this Contract shall"
"920","automatically terminate at the close of business on the"
"921","anniversary of its execution, or upon the expiration of one year"
"922","from the effective date of the last such continuance, whichever"
"923","is later, or"
"924","      (c)	With respect to any Allocated Sleeve, automatically"
"925","upon termination of the Managers investment management contract"
"926","with the related Fund."
"927","      Action by a Fund under (a) above may be taken either (i) by"
"928","vote of a majority of its Trustees, or (ii) by the affirmative"
"929","vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of such Fund."
"930","      Termination of this Contract pursuant to this Section 5 will"
"931","be without the payment of any penalty."
"932","6.	CERTAIN DEFINITIONS."
"933","      For the purposes of this Contract, the affirmative vote of a"
"934","majority of the outstanding shares of a Fund means the"

"936","shareholders of such Fund, (a) of the holders of 67% or more of"
"937","the shares of such Fund present (in person or by proxy) and"
"938","entitled to vote at such meeting, if the holders of more than 50%"
"939","of the outstanding shares of such Fund entitled to vote at such"
"940","meeting are present in person or by proxy, or (b) of the holders"
"941","of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such Fund entitled"
"942","to vote at such meeting, whichever is less."
"943","      For the purposes of this Contract, the terms affiliated"
"944","person, control, interested person and assignment shall have"
"945","their respective meanings defined in the United States Investment"
"946","Company Act of 1940 and the Rules and Regulations thereunder (the"
"947","1940 Act), subject, however, to such exemptions as may be granted"
"948","by the Securities and Exchange Commission under said Act; the"

"952","services shall have the meaning given in the United States"
"953","Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Rules and Regulations"
"954","thereunder."
"955","7.	NON-LIABILITY OF SUB-MANAGER."
"956","      In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross"
"957","negligence on the part of the Sub-Manager, or reckless disregard"

"962","8.	ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS."
"963","      (a)	The Sub-Manager represents that it is regulated by the"
