"464","ACCOUNTING"
"465","FIRM"
"466","To the Shareholders"
"467","of Lifetime"
"468","Achievement Fund"
"469","and the Board of"
"470","Trustees of Northern"

"472","In planning and"
"473","performing our audit of"
"474","the financial statements"
"475","of Lifetime Achievement"
"476","Fund, a series of shares"
"477","of  beneficial interest of"
"478","Northern Lights Fund"
"479","Trust III (the Fund), as"
"480","of and for the year"
"481","ended December 31,"
"482","2012, in accordance"
"483","with the standards of"
"484","the Public Company"
"485","Accounting Oversight"
"486","Board (United States)"
"487","(PCAOB), we"
"488","considered its internal"
"489","control over financial"
"490","reporting, including"
"491","control activities for"
"492","safeguarding securities,"
"493","as a basis for designing"
"494","our auditing procedures"
"495","for the purpose of"
"496","expressing our opinion"
"497","on the financial"
"498","statements and to"
"499","comply with the"
"500","requirements of Form"
"501","N-SAR but not for the"
"502","purpose of expressing"
"503","an opinion on the"
"504","effectiveness of the"
"505","Fund's internal control"
"506","over financial reporting."
"507","Accordingly, we express"
"508","no such opinion."
"509","The management of"
"510","Northern Lights Fund"
"511","Trust III is responsible"
"512","for establishing and"
"513","maintaining effective"
"514","internal control over"
"515","financial reporting.  In"
"516","fulfilling this"
"517","responsibility, estimates"
"518","and judgments by"
"519","management are"
"520","required to assess the"
"521","expected benefits and"
"522","related costs of controls."
"523","A company's internal"
"524","control over financial"
"525","reporting is a process"
"526","designed to provide"
"527","reasonable assurance"
"528","regarding the reliability"
"529","of financial reporting and"
"530","the preparation of"
"531","financial statements for"
"532","external purposes in"
"533","accordance with"
"534","accounting principles"
"535","generally accepted in"
"536","the United States of"
"537","America (GAAP).  A"
"538","company's internal"
"539","control over financial"
"540","reporting includes those"
"541","policies and procedures"
"542","that (1) pertain to the"
"543","maintenance of records"
"544","that, in reasonable"
"545","detail, accurately and"
"546","fairly reflect the"
"547","transactions and"
"548","dispositions of the"
"549","assets of the company;"
"550","(2) provide reasonable"
"551","assurance that"
"552","transactions are"
"553","recorded as necessary"
"554","to permit preparation of"
"555","financial statements in"
"556","accordance with GAAP,"
"557","and that receipts and"
"558","expenditures of the"
"559","company are being"
"560","made only in"
"561","accordance with"
"562","authorizations of"
"563","management and"
"564","directors of the"
"565","company; and (3)"
"566","provide reasonable"
"567","assurance regarding"
"568","prevention or timely"
"569","detection of"
"570","unauthorized"
"571","acquisition, use or"
"572","disposition of a"
"573","company's assets that"
"574","could have a material"
"575","effect on the financial"
"576","statements."
"577","Because of its inherent"
"578","limitations, internal"
"579","control over financial"
"580","reporting may not"
"581","prevent or detect"
"582","misstatements.  Also,"
"583","projections of any"
"584","evaluation of"
"585","effectiveness to future"
"586","periods are subject to"
"587","the risk that controls"
"588","may become inadequate"
"589","because of changes in"
"590","conditions, or that the"
"591","degree of compliance"
"592","with the policies or"
"593","procedures may"
"594","deteriorate."
"595","A deficiency in internal"
"596","control over financial"
"597","reporting exists when"
"598","the design or operation"
"599","of a control does not"
"600","allow management or"
"601","employees, in the"
"602","normal course of"
"603","performing their"
"604","assigned functions, to"
"605","prevent or detect"
"606","misstatements on a"
"607","timely basis. A material"
"608","weakness is a"
"609","deficiency, or a"
"610","combination of"
"611","deficiencies, in internal"
"612","control over financial"
"613","reporting, such that"
"614","there is a reasonable"
"615","possibility that a material"
"616","misstatement of the"
"617","Fund's annual or interim"
"618","financial statements will"
"619","not be prevented or"
"620","detected on a timely"
"621","basis."
"622","Our consideration of the"
"623","Fund's internal control"
"624","over financial reporting"
"625","was for the limited"
"626","purpose described in the"
"627","first paragraph and"
"628","would not necessarily"
"629","disclose all deficiencies"
"630","in internal control that"
"631","might be material"
"632","weaknesses under"
"633","standards established"
"634","by the PCAOB."
"635","However, we noted no"
"636","deficiencies in the"
"637","internal control over"
"638","financial reporting and"
"639","its operations, including"
"640","controls for safeguarding"
"641","securities that we"
"642","consider to be material"
"643","weaknesses, as defined"
"644","above, as of December"
"645","31, 2012."
"646","This report is intended"
"647","solely for the"
"648","information and use of"
"649","management, the"
"650","shareholders of Lifetime"
"651","Achievement Fund, the"
"652","Board of Trustees of"
"653","Northern Lights Fund"
"654","Trust III, and the"
"655","Securities and"
"656","Exchange Commission"
"657","and is not intended to"
"658","be and should not be"
"659","used by anyone other"
"660","than these specified"
