"13234","the investments of the Portfolio; and shall pay the salaries and fees of all officers of the Fund, of all Trustees of the Fund who"
"13235","are &quot;interested persons&quot; of the Fund or of the Adviser and of all personnel of the Fund or the Adviser performing services"
"13236","relating to research, statistical and investment activities.  The Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with the Portfolio, to buy, sell, lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment"
"13237","instruments on behalf of the Portfolio.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times"
"13238","be subject to the control and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."
"13239","</P>"
"13240","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(b)	Management Services.  The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for the performance by its affiliates of) the"

The Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees, perform various services for the Portfolio, including but not limited to: (i) providing the Portfolio with office space, equipment and facilities (which may be its own) for maintaining its organization; (ii) on behalf of the"

"13252","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(c)	The Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's account with brokers or dealers selected by the Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the Adviser.  The"
"13253","Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Portfolio and"
"13254","at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to"
"13255","execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as"
"13256","those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts"
"13257","over which the Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer"

"13260","Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"

"13262","transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they"
"13263","exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to"

"13274","Adviser shall receive a monthly management fee, payable monthly as soon as practicable after the last day of each month, composed"
"13275","of a Basic Fee and a Performance Adjustment.  Except as otherwise provided in sub-paragraph (e) of this paragraph 3, the Performance Adjustment is added to or subtracted from the Basic Fee depending on whether the Portfolio experienced better or worse performance than an appropriate index (the &quot;Index&quot;).  The Performance Adjustment is not cumulative.  An increased fee will result even"
"13276","though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been behind that of the"
"13277","Index, and, conversely, a reduction in the fee will be made for a month even though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been ahead of that of the Index.  The Basic Fee and the Performance Adjustment"
"13278","will be computed as follows:"

"13280","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(a)	Basic Fee Rate:  The annual Basic Fee Rate shall be the sum of the Group Fee Rate and the Individual Fund Fee Rate"
"13281","calculated to the nearest millionth decimal place as follows:"

"13283","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(i) Group Fee Rate.  The Group Fee Rate shall be based upon the monthly average of the net assets of the registered"
"13284","investment companies having Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser (computed in the manner set forth in"
"13285","the fund's Declaration of Trust or other organizational document) determined as of the close of business on each business day"
"13286","throughout the month.  The Group Fee Rate shall be determined on a cumulative basis pursuant to the following schedule:"

"14773","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(b)	Management Services.  The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for the performance by its affiliates of) the"

"14786","Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Portfolio and"
"14787","at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to"
"14788","execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as"
"14789","those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts"

"14807","month, composed of a Basic Fee and a Performance Adjustment.  Except as otherwise provided in sub-paragraph (e) of this"
"14808","paragraph 3, the Performance Adjustment is added to or subtracted from the Basic Fee depending on whether the Portfolio"
"14809","experienced better or worse performance than an appropriate index (the &quot;Index&quot;).  The Performance Adjustment is not cumulative.  An increased fee will result even though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the"
"14810","performance period has been behind that of the Index, and, conversely, a reduction in the fee will be made for a month even"
"14811","though the performance of the Portfolio over some period of time shorter than the performance period has been ahead of that"
"14812","of the Index.  The Basic Fee and the Performance Adjustment will be computed as follows:"

"14814","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(a)	Basic Fee Rate:  The annual Basic Fee Rate shall be the sum of the Group Fee Rate and the Individual Fund"
"14815","Fee Rate calculated to the nearest millionth decimal place as follows:"

"14817","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(i) Group Fee Rate.  The Group Fee Rate shall be based upon the monthly average of the net assets of the"

"14819","manner set forth in the fund's Declaration of Trust or other organizational document) determined as of the close of business"
"14820","on each business day throughout the month.  The Group Fee Rate shall be determined on a cumulative basis pursuant to the"

"16408","<P ALIGN=CENTER>FIDELITY MANAGEMENT &amp; RESEARCH COMPANY"
"16409","</P>"
"16410","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	AGREEMENT made this 19th day of September, 2012, by and between FMR Co., Inc., a Massachusetts corporation with principal offices at 82 Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Sub-Adviser&quot;) and Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, a Massachusetts corporation with principal offices at 82 Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Adviser&quot;)."
"16411","</P>"
"16412","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Adviser has entered into a Management Contract with Fidelity Devonshire Trust, a Massachusetts business trust which may issue one or more series of shares of beneficial interest (hereinafter called the"
"16413","&acute;&acute;Fund&quot;), on behalf of Fidelity Advisor Series Stock Selector Large Cap Value Fund (hereinafter called the &acute;&acute;Portfolio&quot;), pursuant to which the Adviser is to act as investment manager and adviser to the Portfolio, and"
"16414","</P>"
"16415","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Sub-Adviser was formed for the purpose of providing investment management of equity and"
"16416","high income funds and advising generally with respect to equity and high income instruments<B>.</B>"
"16417","</P>"
"16418","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises hereinafter set forth, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser agree as follows:"
"16419","</P>"
"16420","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	1.	(a)  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Adviser, direct the investments of all or"
"16421","such portion of the Portfolio's assets as the Adviser shall designate in accordance with the investment objective, policies and limitations as provided in the Portfolio's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as amended from time"
"16422","to time, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and rules thereunder, as amended from time to time (the &acute;&acute;1940 Act&quot;),"
"16423","and such other limitations as the Portfolio may impose by notice in writing to the Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish for the use of the Portfolio office space and all necessary office facilities, equipment and"
"16424","personnel for servicing the investments of the Portfolio; and shall pay the salaries and fees of all personnel of the"
"16425","Sub-Adviser performing services for the Portfolio relating to research, statistical and investment activities.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with the Portfolio or the Adviser, to buy, sell,"
"16426","lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment instruments on behalf of the Portfolio.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times be subject to the control"
"16427","and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."
"16428","</P>"
"16429","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(b)  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations, information or analyses to the Fund and the"
"16430","Adviser as the Fund's Board of Trustees or the Adviser may request from time to time or as the Sub-Adviser may"
"16431","deem to be desirable.  The Sub-Adviser shall make recommendations to the Fund's Board of Trustees with respect to"
"16432","Portfolio policies, and shall carry out such policies as are adopted by the Trustees.  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to"
"16433","review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other services as the Sub-Adviser shall from time to time determine to"
"16434","be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under this Agreement and which are not otherwise furnished by the"
"16435","Adviser."
"16436","</P>"
"16437","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(c)  The Sub-Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's"
"16438","account with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the"
"16439","Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices"
"16440","which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"16441","Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser, Adviser or their affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess"
"16442","of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either"
"16443","that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to"
"16444","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the"
"16445","commissions paid by the Portfolio to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were"
"16446","reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio."
"16447","</P>"
"16448","<P ID=C__\desktop\FMR_Co_FMR_sub_09-19-12_2.html.2 ALIGN=LEFT>	2.	As compensation for the services to be furnished by the Sub-Adviser hereunder, the Adviser agrees"

"16450","any) that the Portfolio is obligated to pay the Adviser under the Portfolio's Management Contract with the Adviser in"
"16451","respect of that portion of the Portfolio's assets managed by the Sub-Adviser during such month.  Such fee shall not"
"16452","be reduced to reflect expense reimbursements or fee waivers by the Adviser, if any, in effect from time to time."

"16454","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	3.	It is understood that Trustees, officers, and shareholders of the Fund are or may be or become interested in the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser as directors, officers or otherwise and that directors, officers and stockholders of the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser are or may be or become similarly interested in the Fund, and that the Adviser"
"16455","or the Sub-Adviser may be or become interested in the Fund as a shareholder or otherwise."
"16456","</P>"
"16457","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	4.	It is understood that the Portfolio will pay all its expenses other than those expressly stated to be"
"16458","payable by the Sub-Adviser hereunder or by the Adviser under the Management Contract with the Portfolio."
"16459","</P>"
"16460","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	5.	The Services of the Sub-Adviser to the Adviser are not to be deemed to be exclusive, the Sub-Adviser being free to render services to others and engage in other activities, provided, however, that such other services"
"16461","and activities do not, during the term of this Agreement, interfere, in a material manner, with the Sub-Adviser's ability to meet all of its obligations with respect to rendering investment advice hereunder.  The Sub-Adviser shall for all"
"16462","purposes be an independent contractor and not an agent or employee of the Adviser or the Fund."
"16463","</P>"
"16464","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	6.	In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of obligations"
"16465","or duties hereunder on the part of the Sub-Adviser, the Sub-Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Advisor,"
"16466","the Trust or to any shareholder of the Portfolio for any act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering"
"16467","services hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security."
"16468","</P>"
"16469","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	7.	(a)	Subject to prior termination as provided in sub-paragraph (d) of this paragraph 7, this Agreement shall continue in force until July 31, 2014<B> </B>and indefinitely thereafter, but only so long as"
