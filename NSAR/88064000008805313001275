"2277","To the Trustees of DWS Investment Trust and the"

"2279","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"2280","statements of DWS Mid Cap Growth Fund (the Fund), as"
"2281","of and for the year ended September 30, 2013, in"
"2282","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"2283","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"2284","considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"2285","reporting, including control activities for safeguarding"
"2286","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"2287","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"2288","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"2289","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"2290","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"2291","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"2292","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"2293","over financial reporting."
"2294","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"2295","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"2296","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"2297","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"2298","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"2299","A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"2300","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2301","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"2302","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"2303","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2304","principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"2305","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"2306","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"2307","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2308","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"2309","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2310","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2311","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"2312","and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"2313","made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"2314","management and directors of the fund; and (3)  provide"
"2315","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"

"2317","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"2318","financial statements."
"2319","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"

"2323","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2324","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"2325","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2326","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"2327","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"2328","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"2329","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2330","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"2331","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2332","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"2333","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2334","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"2335","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2336","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"

"2338","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"2339","all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting"
"2340","that might be material weaknesses under standards"

"2533","and for the year ended September 30, 2013, in accordance"

"2535","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's"
"2536","internal control over financial reporting, including control"
"2537","activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"2538","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2539","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"

"2541","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"2542","of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"2543","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"2544","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"

"2546","The management of the Fund is responsible for"

"2549","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"2550","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"2551","A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"

"2559","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"

"2702","Item 77E - DWS Investment Trust"
"2703","On December 7, 2010, DWS Investment Trust (the"
"2704","Trust) was named as a defendant in the First"
"2705","Amended Complaint filed by the Official"
"2706","Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the U.S."
"2707","Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in the"
"2708","lawsuit styled Official Committee of Unsecured"
"2709","Creditors of Tribune Company, et al., v. Fitzsimons"
"2710","et al. (the Lawsuit).  The Lawsuit arises out of a"
"2711","leveraged buyout transaction (LBO) in 2007 by"
"2712","which loans were made to the Tribune Company to"
"2713","fund the LBO and shares of the Tribune Company"
"2714","held by shareholders were tendered for or were"
"2715","converted to a right to receive cash.  Following the"
"2716","completion of the LBO in 2007, the Tribune"
"2717","Company filed for bankruptcy.  The Lawsuit seeks"
"2718","to recover all payments made to the shareholders in"
"2719","the LBO.  The Lawsuit has been consolidated in a"
"2720","multi-district litigation in the United States District"
"2721","Court for the Southern District of New York, case"
"2722","no. 12-MC-2296.  The Court issued a scheduling"
"2723","order which stays all substantive proceedings in the"
"2724","Lawsuit until after the decision on motions to"
"2725","dismiss based on certain defenses common to the"
"2726","defendants filed in related cases.  On September 23,"
"2727","2013, the District Court entered an Order granting"
"2728","the defendants' motion to dismiss in the related"
"2729","cases, and the plaintiffs in the related cases have"
"2730","appealed the order. Despite the dismissal of those"
"2731","related actions, the Lawsuit will continue to seek"
"2732","recovery of all amounts that the Trust received on a"
"2733","theory of intentional fraudulent conveyance.  On"
"2734","November 21, 2013, the District Court entered"
"2735","Master Case Order No. 4 setting forth the"
"2736","procedures to govern the Lawsuit and effectively"
"2737","lifting the above-referenced stay. Management is"
"2738","currently assessing the Lawsuit and has not yet"
"2739","determined the effect, if any, on any series of the"
"2740","Trust."
"2741","DWS S&P 500 Index Fund, the only fund in the"
"2742","Trust that was the beneficial holder of shares of the"
"2743","Tribune Company, has been reorganized into DWS"

"2745","funds have exposure in the litigation."
