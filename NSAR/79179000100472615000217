"453","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"454","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"455","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"456","Steward Funds, Inc. and Capstone Series Fund, Inc."
"457","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"458","Steward Funds, Inc. comprising Steward Large Cap Enhanced Index"
"459","Fund, Steward Select Bond Fund, Steward International Enhanced Index"
"460","Fund, and Steward Global Equity Income Fund, and Capstone Series"
"461","Fund, Inc. comprising Steward Small-Mid Cap Enhanced Index Fund"
"462","(collectively referred to as the 'Funds'), as of and for the year ended April"
"463","30, 2015, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"464","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"465","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"466","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"467","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"468","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"469","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control"
"470","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"471","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"472","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"473","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required"
"474","to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's"
"475","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"476","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"477","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"478","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  A"
"479","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"480","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"481","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"482","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"483","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"484","financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"485","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"486","authorizations of management and directors of the fund; and (3) provide"
"487","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"488","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could"
"489","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"490","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"491","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any"
"492","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"493","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"494","that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"495","deteriorate."
"496","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"497","design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"498","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to"
"499","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is"
"500","a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"501","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"502","material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial"
"503","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"504","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"505","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"506","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"507","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"508","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"509","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"510","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider"
"511","to be a material weakness as defined above as of April 30, 2015."
"512","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"513","and the Board of Directors of the Funds and the Securities and Exchange"
"514","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
"515","other than these specified parties."

"526","The Steward Funds have been named as defendants and as putative"
"527","members of a proposed defendant class in Kirschner v. FitzSimons (In re"
"528","Tribune Co.), No. 12-2652 (S.D.N.Y.) (the 'FitzSimons action') and Deutsche"
"529","Bank Trust Co. Americas v. Employees Retirement Fund of the City of"
"530","Dallas, Texas, No. 11-9568 (S.D.N.Y.) (the 'Deutsche Bank action') as a"
"531","result of the sale by Steward Large Cap Enhanced Index Fund (then known"
"532","as Steward Domestic All-Cap Equity Fund) and Steward Multi-Manager"
"533","Equity Fund (a fund that is no longer in existence) of their shares in the"
"534","Tribune Company ('Tribune') in a 2007 leveraged buyout transaction"
"535","('LBO') by which Tribune converted to a privately-held company. Both"
"536","lawsuits have been consolidated with the majority of the other Tribune-"
"537","related lawsuits in the multidistrict litigation proceeding In re Tribune Co."
"538","Fraudulent Conveyance Litig., No. 11-2296 (S.D.N.Y.) (the 'MDL"
"539","Proceeding'). None of these lawsuits alleges any wrongdoing on the part of"
"540","the Steward Funds. On September 23, 2013, the Court granted the"
"541","defendants' motion to dismiss the Deutsche Bank action on the basis that"
"542","the plaintiffs lacked standing. Both sides appealed the decision to the U. S."
"543","Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The appeals have been fully"
"544","briefed, and oral argument in the appeals took place on November 5, 2014."
"545","The Court has not yet issued a decision on the appeals."
"546","On May 23, 2014, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the Fifth"
"547","Amended Complaint in the FitzSimons action, including a global motion to"
"548","dismiss Count I, which is the claim brought against former Tribune"
"549","shareholders for intentional fraudulent conveyance under U.S. federal law."
"550","The Court has not yet issued a decision on any of these motions. At this"
"551","state of the proceedings, the Steward Funds are not able to make a reliable"
"552","prediction as to these lawsuits or the effect, if any, on the net asset value"
"553","of the Funds."
"554","Capstone Asset Management Company was named as a defendant in"
"555","Weisfelner, as Trustee of the LB Creditor Trust v. Fund 1 (In re Lyondell"
"556","Co.), Adversary Proceeding No. 10-4609 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.) (the 'Creditor"
"557","Trust action'), and responded to a subpoena issued in Weisfelner, as Trustee"
"558","of the LB Litigation Trust v. A. Holmes and H. Holmes TTEE (In re Lyondell"
"559","Co.), Adversary Proceeding No. 10-5525 (S.D.N.Y.) (the 'Litigation Trust"
"560","action'). A third action, entitled Weisfelner, as Trustee of the LB Creditor"
"561","Trust v. Reichman, Adversary Proceeding No. 12-1570 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.) (the"
"562","'Reichman action'), arose out of the same facts and circumstances alleged in"
"563","the other two actions. All three cases related to the 2008 bankruptcy of"
"564","Lyondell Chemical Company ('Lyondell'), shares of which were sold by"
"565","Steward Large Cap Enhanced Index Fund pursuant to the cash out merger"
"566","of Lyondell shareholders in connection with the combination of Lyondell"
"567","and Basell AF in 2007. None of these lawsuits alleged any wrongdoing on"
"568","the part of Steward Large Cap Enhanced Index Fund."
"569","On January 8, 2015, the Creditor Trust action plaintiff, the Litigation Trust"
"570","action plaintiff, and CAMCO executed a final Settlement Agreement"
"571","resolving all claims arising from the Steward Large Cap Enhanced Index"
"572","Fund's receipt of proceeds in the Lyondell merger. On January 28, 2015, the"
"573","Creditor Trust action plaintiff dismissed CAMCO (named in the complaint"
"574","as 'Capstone Asset Management a/k/a Capstone Asset Management"
"575","Company') from the Creditor Trust action. This entity was an unnamed"
"576","member of a putative defendant class in the Litigation Trust action and was"
"577","not a named party in that action. The Settlement Agreement also releases"
"578","such putative class claims against CAMCO."
