"1904","to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1905","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1906","reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"1907","the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"1908","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1909","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1910","statements in accordance with generally"
"1911","accepted accounting principles, and that"
"1912","receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"1913","being made only in accordance with"
"1914","authorizations of management of the fund"
"1915","and trustees of the trust; and (3) provide"
"1916","reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1917","or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1918","acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's"
"1919","assets that could have a material effect on"
"1920","the financial statements."
"1921","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1922","control over financial reporting may not"
"1923","prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"1924","projections of any evaluation of"
"1925","effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"1926","the risk that controls may become"
"1927","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"1928","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1929","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1930","A deficiency in internal control over"
"1931","financial reporting exists when the design or"
"1932","operation of a control does not allow"
"1933","management or employees, in the normal"
"1934","course of performing their assigned"
"1935","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"1936","on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1937","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"1938","in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1939","such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"1940","that a material misstatement of a fund's"
"1941","annual or interim financial statements will"
"1942","not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"1943","basis."
"1944","Our consideration of the Fund's internal"
"1945","control over financial reporting was for the"
"1946","limited purpose described in the first"
"1947","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"1948","disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"1949","that might be material weaknesses under"
"1950","standards established by the Public"
"1951","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1952","(United States).  However, we noted no"
"1953","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control"
"1954","over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1955","including controls for safeguarding"
"1956","securities that we consider to be a material"
"1957","weakness, as defined above, as of September"
"1958","30, 2013."
