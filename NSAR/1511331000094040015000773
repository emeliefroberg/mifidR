"695","Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"696","The Destra Investment Trust II"
"697","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"698","statements of The Destra Investment Trust II, comprising"
"699","the Destra Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred and Income Fund"
"700","(formerly the Destra Preferred and Income Securities"
"701","Fund) and the Destra Focused Equity Fund (collectively,"
"702","the Funds) as of and for the year ended September 30,"
"703","2015, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"704","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"705","considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"706","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"707","securities, as a basis for designing audit procedures"
"708","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"709","financial statements and to comply with the requirements"

"725","control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"726","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"727","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"728","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"729","assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"730","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"731","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"732","generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"733","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made"
"734","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"735","directors of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"736","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"737","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the"
"738","fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"739","financial statements."
"740","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"741","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"742","misstatements. Also projections of any evaluation of"
"743","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"744","that controls may become inadequate because of changes"
"745","in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies"
"746","and procedures may deteriorate."
"747","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"748","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"749","control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"750","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to"
"751","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"752","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"753","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"754","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"755","that a material misstatement of the Funds' annual or"
"756","interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"757","detected on a timely basis."
"758","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"759","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"760","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"761","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"762","control over financial reporting that might be material"
"763","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"764","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"765","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal"
"766","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"767","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"768","consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as"
"769","of September 30, 2015."
