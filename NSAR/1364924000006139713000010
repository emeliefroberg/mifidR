The Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with the Portfolio, to buy,"
"7134","sell, lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment instruments on"
"7135","behalf of the Portfolio.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all"
"7136","times be subject to the control and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."
"7137","</P>"
"7138","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(b)	Management Services.  The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for the performance"
"7139","by its affiliates of) the management and administrative services necessary for the operation of the Fund."
"7140","The Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees of the Fund, perform various services for the Portfolio, including but not limited to: (i) providing the Portfolio with office space, equipment"
"7141","and facilities (which may be its own) for maintaining its organization; (ii) on behalf of the Portfolio, supervising relations with, and monitoring the performance of, any sub-advisers, custodians, depositories,"

"7159","in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those"
"7160","terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for"
"7161","executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess of the amount of commission another"
"7162","broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Adviser determines in good faith"
"7163","that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review"
"7164","the commissions paid by the Portfolio to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods"

"9219","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Sub-Adviser may place orders pursuant to its investment determinations for the Fund"

"9223","payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as"
"9224","the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms"
"9225","available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will"
"9226","consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the"
"9227","security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or"
"9228","dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best"
"9229","overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as"
"9230","amended (the &quot;1934 Act&quot;)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser"
"9231","or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for"
"9232","the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions"
"9233","at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of"
"9234","seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the"
"9235","Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission"
"9236","than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation"
"9237","to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms"
"9238","of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in"
"9239","compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such"
"9240","brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other"
"9241","clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject"
"9242","to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions."

"10174","<P>To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Fidelity Rutland Square Trust"
"10175","II:</P>"
"10176","<P></P>"
"10177","<P>In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Fidelity"
"10178","Rutland Square Trust II: Strategic Advisers Core Fund, Strategic Advisers Core"
"10179","Multi-Manager Fund, Strategic Advisers Short Duration Fund, Strategic Advisers"

"10181","Value Fund, and Strategic Advisers Value Multi-Manager Fund<FONT face=Georgia>"
"10182","</FONT>(collectively, the Trust) as of and for the year ended May 31, 2012, in"
"10183","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"10184","(United States), we considered the Trust's internal control over financial"
"10185","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"10186","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"10187","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"10188","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's"
"10189","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an"
"10190","opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial"
"10191","reporting.</P>"
"10192","<P>The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"10193","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"10194","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"10195","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"10196","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"10197","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"10198","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"10199","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"10200","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"10201","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"10202","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"10203","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"10204","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"10205","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Trust are being"
"10206","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"10207","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"10208","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a Trust's assets"
"10209","that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
"10210","<P>Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"10211","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"10212","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"10213","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"10214","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"

"10219","<P>&nbsp;</P>"
"10220","<P></P>"
"10221","<P></P>"
"10222","<P>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"10223","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"10224","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"10225","misstatements on a timely basis. <BR>A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"10226","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"10227","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"10228","Trust's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"10229","on a timely basis.</P>"
"10230","<P>Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting"
"10231","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"10232","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"10233","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"10234","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"10235","deficiencies in the Trust's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"10236","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to"
"10237","be material weaknesses as defined above as of May 31, 2012.</P>"
