"1257","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1258","To the Board of Trustees  of MFS Series  Trust III and the  Shareholders  of MFS"
"1259","High  Income  Fund  and MFS High  Yield  Opportunities  Fund:  In  planning  and"
"1260","performing  our audits of the  financial  statements of MFS High Income Fund and"
"1261","MFS High Yield Opportunities Fund (the Funds) (each a portfolio comprising MFS"
"1262","Series Trust III) as of and for the year ended  January 31, 2011,  in accordance"
"1263","with the  standards of the Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board (United"
"1264","States),  we considered the Funds'  internal  control over financial  reporting,"
"1265","including  controls over safeguarding  securities,  as a basis for designing our"
"1266","auditing  procedures  for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1267","statements and to comply with the  requirements  of Form N-SAR,  but not for the"
"1268","purpose of expressing  an opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Funds'  internal"
"1269","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1270","The  management of the Funds is responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining"
"1271","effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.   In  fulfilling  this"
"1272","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1273","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"1274","financial  reporting  is a process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance"
"1275","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"1276","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1277","accounting  principles.  A fund's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting"
"1278","includes those policies and  procedures  that (1) pertain to the  maintenance of"
"1279","records  that,  in  reasonable   detail,   accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the"
"1280","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide  reasonable"
"1281","assurance that  transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of"
"1282","financial   statements  in  accordance   with  generally   accepted   accounting"
"1283","principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"1284","in accordance with  authorizations  of management and trustees of the trust; and"
"1285","(3) provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection of"
"1286","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"1287","a material effect on the financial statements."
"1288","Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting"
"1289","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1290","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1291","inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the degree of compliance"
"1292","with the  policies or  procedures  may  deteriorate.  A  deficiency  in internal"
"1293","control  over  financial  reporting  exists  when the design or  operation  of a"
"1294","control  does not  allow  management  or  employees,  in the  normal  course  of"
"1295","performing  their assigned  functions,  to prevent or detect  misstatements on a"
"1296","timely  basis.  A  material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or a  combination  of"
"1297","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1298","reasonable  possibility  that a material  misstatement  of the fund's  annual or"
"1299","interim  financial  statements  will not be  prevented  or  detected on a timely"
"1300","basis."
"1301","Our  consideration of the Funds' internal  control over financial  reporting was"
"1302","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in the  first  paragraph  and  would  not"
"1303","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1304","weaknesses  under  standards   established  by  the  Public  Company  Accounting"
"1305","Oversight  Board  (United   States).  However,  we  noted  no"
"1306","deficiencies in the Funds' internal  control over financial  reporting and their"
"1307","operation,  including controls for safeguarding securities,  that we consider to"
"1308","be a material weakness, as defined above, as of January 31, 2011."
