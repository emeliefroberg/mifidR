Report of Independent Registered Public Acc
ounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Federated Income Securities Trust:

In planning and performing our audit of the f
inancial statements of Federated Enhanced
Treasury Income Fund (one of the portfolios c
onstituting Federated Income Securities
Trust) (the ?Fund?) as of and for the year en
ded November 30, 2015, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accountin
g Oversight Board (United States), we
considered the Fund?s internal control over f
inancial reporting, including controls over
safeguarding securities, as a basis for design
ing our auditing procedures for the purpose
of expressing our opinion on the financial s
tatements and to comply with the
requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Fund?s internal control
 over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we
express no such opinion.

The management of the Fund is responsible f
or establishing and maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting.
 In fulfilling this responsibility, estimate
s and
judgments by management are required to asse
ss the expected benefits and related costs
of controls. A company?s internal control ov
er financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the re
liability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for exte
rnal purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.  A company?s
 internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (
1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly refl
ect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
 assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial
 statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that rec
eipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authoriz
ations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assuran
ce regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposit
ion of a company?s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, interna
l control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, proje
ctions of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of
 compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

A deficiency in internal control over financ
ial reporting exists when the design or
operation of a control does not allow manage
ment or employees, in the normal course of
performing their assigned functions, to prev
ent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a com
bination of deficiencies, in internal control
over financial reporting, such that there is
 a reasonable possibility that a material





misstatement of the company?s annual or inte
rim financial statements will not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Our consideration of the Fund?s internal con
trol over financial reporting was for the
limited purpose described in the first para
graph and would not necessarily disclose all
deficiencies in internal control that might
 be material weaknesses under standards
established by the Public Company Accountin
g Oversight Board (United States).
However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fu
nd?s internal control over financial reporting
and its operation, including controls over
safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a
material weakness as defined above as of N
ovember 30, 2015.

This report is intended solely for the infor
mation and use of management and the Board
of Trustees of the Fund and the Securities a
nd Exchange Commission and is not intended
to be and should not be used by anyone othe
r than these specified parties.

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm


To the Shareholders and
Board of Trustees of
Federated Income Securities Trust

In planning and performing our audit of the
financial statements of Federated Capital
Income Fund (the ?Fund?), a portfolio of
Federated Income Securities Trust, as of and
for the year ended November 30, 2015, in
accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), we considered the Fund?s
internal control over financial reporting,
including controls over safeguarding
securities, as a basis for designing our auditing
procedures for the purpose of expressing our
opinion on the financial statements and to
comply with the requirements of Form N-
SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund?s
internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Management of the Fund is responsible for
establishing and maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting. In fulfilling
this responsibility, estimates and judgments by
management are required to assess the
expected benefits and related costs of controls.
A company?s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company?s internal
control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of the
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company?s assets that could have a
material affect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

A deficiency in internal control over financial
reporting exists when the design or operation
of a control does not allow management or
employees, in the normal course of
performing their assigned functions, to
prevent or detect misstatements on a timely
basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or
a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting, such that
there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the Fund?s annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis.

Our consideration of the Fund?s internal
control over financial reporting was for the
limited purpose described in the first
paragraph and would not necessarily disclose
all deficiencies in internal control that might
be material weaknesses under standards
established by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
However, we noted no deficiencies in the
Fund?s internal control over financial
reporting and its operation, including controls
over safeguarding securities that we consider
to be a material weakness as defined above as
of November 30, 2015.

This report is intended solely for the
information and use of management and the
Board of Trustees of Federated Income
Securities Trust and the Securities and
Exchange Commission and is not intended to
be and should not be used by anyone other
than those specified parties.
