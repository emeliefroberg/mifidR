"940","<TEXT>"
"941","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"942","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"943","Franklin Templeton Global Allocation Fund"
"944","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Franklin"
"945","Templeton Global Allocation Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year ended"
"946","May 31, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"947","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"948","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"949","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"950","of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"
"951","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"952","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"953","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness"
"954","of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"955","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"956","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"957","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"958","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal"
"959","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"960","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"961","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"962","generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over"
"963","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"964","to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"965","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"966","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"967","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"968","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures"
"969","of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"970","management and trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance"
"971","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"972","or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"973","financial statements."
"974","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"975","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"976","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"977","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"978","that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"979","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"980","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"981","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"982","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"983","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"984","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"985","misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"986","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"987","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"988","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"989","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"990","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"991","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we"
"992","noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"993","and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"994","consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of May 31, 2013."
"995","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"996","the Board of Trustees of Franklin Templeton International Trust and the"
"997","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should"
"998","not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1016","SUPPLEMENT DATED DECEMBER 28, 2012"
"1017","TO THE PROSPECTUS DATED OCTOBER 1, 2012"
"1018","OF"
"1019","FRANKLIN TEMPLETON GLOBAL ALLOCATION FUND"
"1020","(Franklin Templeton International Trust)"
"1021","The prospectus is amended as follows:"
"1022","I. For the Fund Details Principal Investment Policies and Practices section"
"1023","the paragraph beginning For purposes of pursuing its investment goal,.."
"1024","on page 15 is revised as follows:"
"1025","For purposes of pursing its investment goal, the Fund regularly enters into"
"1026","various transactions involving derivative instruments. The tactical"
"1027","allocation portion primarily uses stock index futures, government bond"
"1028","futures, equity total return swaps and currency forwards and futures"
"1029","contracts. Futures contracts, total return swaps and currency forward"
"1030","contracts may allow the Fund to obtain net long or net negative/short"
"1031","exposures to specific securities, securities indices, interest rates,"
"1032","credits, or currencies without having actually to purchase or sell underlying"
"1033","securities or other investments. The Fund may maintain significant positions"
"1034","in currency-related derivative instruments which could expose a large amount"
"1035","of the Fund's assets to obligations under the instruments. The derivative"
"1036","instruments in the tactical allocation portion may be used to adjust or"
"1037","obtain net long or net negative (short) exposure to various asset classes,"
"1038","regions, currencies, sectors or securities, for hedging purposes, or to"
"1039","otherwise enhance Fund returns. The use of derivative instruments may"
"1040","allow the investment manager to make tactical allocations with fewer"
"1041","transaction costs than it might otherwise incur by changing allocations to"
"1042","the separate portions of the core portfolio."
"1043","II. For the Fund Details Principal Investment Policies and Practices"
"1044","section the following paragraph has been added:"
"1045","Swap agreements, such as equity total return swaps, are contracts between the"
"1046","Fund and, typically, a brokerage firm, bank, or other financial institution"
"1047","(the swap counterparty) for periods ranging from a few days to multiple"
"1048","years.  In a basic swap transaction, the Fund agrees with its counterparty"
"1049","to exchange the returns (or differentials in rates of return) earned or"
"1050","realized on a particular notional amount of underlying instruments."
"1051","The notional amount is the set amount selected by the parties as the"
"1052","basis on which to calculate the obligations that they have agreed to"
"1053","exchange.  The parties typically do not actually exchange the notional"
"1054","amount.  Instead, they agree to exchange the returns that would be earned"
"1055","or realized if the notional amount were invested in the given instruments."
"1056","In a total return swap, the Fund and the swap counterparty agree to swap"
"1057","the total return (including, typically, income and capital gains"
"1058","distributions, principal prepayment or credit losses) of an underlying"
"1059","reference asset (e.g., securities index) in exchange for a regular payment,"
"1060","at a floating rate, at a fixed rate or the total rate of return on another"
"1061","financial instrument.  The Fund may take either position in a total return"
"1062","swap (i.e., the Fund may receive or pay the total return on the underlying"
"1063","reference asset or index)."
