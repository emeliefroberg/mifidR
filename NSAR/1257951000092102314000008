"1173","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"1174","Accounting Firm"
"1175","To the Board of Trustees and Shareowners of"
"1176","Pioneer Series Trust I"
"1177","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1178","statements of Pioneer Series Trust I (comprised of"
"1179","Pioneer Oak Ridge Large Cap Growth Fund and"
"1180","Pioneer Oak Ridge Small Cap Growth Fund) (the"
"1181","Company) as of and for the year ended November"
"1182","30, 2013 in accordance with the standards of the"
"1183","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1184","(United States), we considered the Company's"
"1185","internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1186","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1187","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"1188","of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1189","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"1190","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"1191","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's"
"1192","internal control over financial reporting."
"1193","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1194","The management of the Company is responsible"
"1195","for establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1196","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1197","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1198","management are required to assess the expected"
"1199","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"1200","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"1201","designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1202","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1203","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"1204","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1205","accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"1206","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1207","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1208","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1209","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1210","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1211","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1212","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1213","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"1214","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1215","expenditures of the company are being made only"
"1216","in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1217","and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"1218","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"1219","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"1220","disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"1221","material effect on the financial statements."
"1222","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1223","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1224","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1225","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1226","risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"1227","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1228","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1229","deteriorate."
"1230","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1231","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1232","control does not allow management or employees,"
"1233","in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1234","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1235","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1236","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"1237","over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1238","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"1239","of the company's annual or interim financial"
"1240","statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"1241","timely basis."
"1242","Our consideration of the Company's internal control"
"1243","over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1244","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1245","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"1246","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1247","standards established by the Public Company"
"1248","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1249","However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"1250","Company's internal control over financial reporting"
"1251","and its operation, including controls over"
"1252","safeguarding securities, which we consider to be a"
"1253","material weakness as defined above as of"
"1254","November 30, 2013."
"1255","This report is intended solely for the information"
