"1073","acquiring fund shares that you receive in a merger will have a total dollar"

"1364","WHAT AM I BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON?"
"1365","As a shareholder of the merging (Target) fund, you are being asked to approve"
"1366","the merger of your fund into a surviving (Acquiring) fund. Your fund's Board of"
"1367","Trustees believes that the merger is in the best interests of your fund and that"
"1368","the interests of existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result of the"
"1369","merger. As such, they recommend that you vote to approve it."
"1370","Upon approval by shareholders, as well as the satisfaction of other closing"
"1371","conditions, the target fund will transfer all of its assets to the acquiring"
"1372","fund, and the acquiring fund will assume all of the liabilities of the target"
"1373","fund in exchange for shares of a comparable class of the acquiring fund. The"
"1374","acquiring fund shares that you receive in a merger will have a total dollar"
"1375","value equal to that of the target fund shares that you hold at the time of the"
