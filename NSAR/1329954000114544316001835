"3009","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"3010","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"3011","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"3012","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"3013","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"3014","and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
