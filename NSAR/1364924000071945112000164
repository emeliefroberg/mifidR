"6613","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Sub-Adviser may place orders pursuant to its investment determinations for the Fund directly"

"6616","of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments"
"6617","of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser"
"6618","deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund,"
"6619","the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall"
"6620","terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition"
"6621","and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and"
"6622","in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and"
"6623","research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as"
"6624","amended (the &quot;1934 Act&quot;)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its"

"6627","analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than"
"6628","may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and"
"6629","efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes"
"6630","brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such"
"6631","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such"
"6632","broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to"
"6633","other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to"

"7143","the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall"
"7144","terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition"
"7145","and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and"
"7146","in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and"
"7147","research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as"
"7148","amended (the &quot;1934 Act&quot;)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its"

"7151","analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than"
"7152","may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and"
"7153","efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes"
"7154","brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such"
"7155","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such"
"7156","broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to"
"7157","other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to"
"7158","any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio"

"7485","<P>&nbsp;</P>"
"7486","<P>To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Fidelity Rutland Square Trust"
"7487","II:</P>"
"7488","<P></P>"
"7489","<P>In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements Fidelity"
"7490","Rutland Square Trust II: Strategic Advisers Core Income Fund, Strategic Advisers"
"7491","Emerging Markets Fund, Strategic Advisers Income Opportunities Fund, Strategic"
"7492","Advisers International Fund, Strategic Advisers International II Fund, Strategic"
"7493","Advisers Small Mid Cap Fund, Strategic Advisers Small Mid Cap Multi Manager"
"7494","Fund, Strategic Advisers U.S. Opportunity Fund, and Strategic Advisers U.S."
"7495","Opportunity II Fund (collectively, the Trust) as of and for the year ended"
"7496","February 29, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"7497","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust's internal"
"7498","control over financial reporting, including control activities for safeguarding"
"7499","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"7500","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"7501","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"7502","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"7503","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's"
"7504","internal control over financial reporting.</P>"
"7505","<P>The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"7506","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"7507","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"7508","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"7509","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"7510","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"7511","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"7512","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"7513","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"7514","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"7515","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"7516","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"7517","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"7518","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Trust are being"
"7519","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"7520","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"7521","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a Trust's assets"
"7522","that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
"7523","<P>Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"7524","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"7525","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"7526","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"7527","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"

"7532","<P>&nbsp;</P>"
"7533","<P></P>"
"7534","<P></P>"
"7535","<P>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"7536","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"7537","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"7538","misstatements on a timely basis. material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"7539","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"7540","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"7541","Trust's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"7542","on a timely basis.</P>"
"7543","<P>Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting"
"7544","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"7545","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"7546","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"7547","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"7548","deficiencies in the Trust's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"7549","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"7550","be material weaknesses as defined above as of February 29, 2012.</P>"
