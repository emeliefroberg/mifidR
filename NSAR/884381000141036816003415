"480","In our opinion, the accompanying statement of"
"481","assets and liabilities, including the schedule of"
"482","portfolio investments, and the related statements"
"483","of operations and of changes in net assets and the"
"484","financial highlights present fairly, in all material"
"485","respects, the financial position of the Muni"
"486","Intermediate Portfolio (the sole portfolio"
"487","constituting The Glenmede Portfolios, hereafter"
"488","referred to as the Fund) at October 31, 2016, the"
"489","results of its operations for the year then ended,"
"490","the changes in its net assets for each of the two"
"491","years in the period then ended and the financial"
"492","highlights for each of the five years in the period"
"493","then ended, in conformity with accounting"
"494","principles generally accepted in the United States"
"495","of America.  These financial statements and"
"496","financial highlights (hereafter referred to as"
"497","financial statements) are the responsibility of the"
"498","Fund's management.  Our responsibility is to"
"499","express an opinion on these financial statements"
"500","based on our audits. We conducted our audits of"
"501","these financial statements in accordance with the"
"502","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"503","Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards"
"504","require that we plan and perform the audit to"
"505","obtain reasonable assurance about whether the"
"506","financial statements are free of material"
"507","misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a"
"508","test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and"
"509","disclosures in the financial statements, assessing"
"510","the accounting principles used and significant"
"511","estimates made by management, and evaluating"
"512","the overall financial statement presentation.  We"
"513","believe that our audits, which included"
"514","confirmation of securities at October 31, 2016 by"
"515","correspondence with the custodian and brokers,"
"516","and the application of alternative auditing"
"517","procedures where securities purchased had not"
"518","been received, provide a reasonable basis for our"
"519","opinion."
