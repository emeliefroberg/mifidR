"1393","Item 77D - DWS Diversified Market Neutral"
"1394","Fund (formerly DWS Disciplined Market"
"1395","Neutral Fund) (a series of DWS Market Trust)"
"1396","Effective on or about July 19, 2013, the Fund"
"1397","changed its name to DWS Diversified Market"
"1398","Neutral Fund."
"1399","Effective on or about July 19, 2013, the Fund"
"1400","changed its principal investment strategy to:"
"1401","Main investments. The fund seeks to achieve its"
"1402","investment objective by employing a multi-manager"
"1403","approach whereby portions of the fund's assets are"
"1404","allocated to separate investment management teams,"
"1405","including subadvisors, that employ different market"
"1406","neutral investment strategies. Pursuant to the"
"1407","investment management teams' different investment"
"1408","strategies, the fund's investment portfolio is"
"1409","primarily comprised of exposure to long and short"
"1410","positions in securities and other investments from"
"1411","US, foreign and emerging markets. Each investment"
"1412","management team buys (takes long positions in)"
"1413","securities and other investments that it believes are"
"1414","undervalued and sells short securities and other"
"1415","investments (e.g., borrows the investment and then"
"1416","sells it) that it believes are overvalued. The fund's"
"1417","long equity investments will consist mainly of"
"1418","common stocks, but may also include investments"
"1419","in other types of equities such as preferred stocks or"
"1420","convertible stocks."
"1421","Management process. The Advisor provides or"
"1422","oversees the provision of all investment advisory"
"1423","and portfolio management services for the fund."
"1424","The fund's different investment management teams,"
"1425","including subadvisors, select individual portfolio"
"1426","securities for the assets assigned to them. The"
"1427","Advisor, subject to the approval of the Board, has"
"1428","ultimate responsibility to recommend to the Board"
"1429","the hiring, termination and replacement of any"
"1430","subadvisors. The Advisor currently allocates the"
"1431","fund's assets among three different investment"
"1432","management teams, including two subadvisors, that"
"1433","employ different market neutral strategies."
"1434","In selecting investment management teams, the"
"1435","Advisor seeks to identify investment management"
"1436","teams that, based on their investment strategies and"
"1437","historical performance, have the potential, in the"
"1438","opinion of the Advisor, to perform independently of"
"1439","each other and achieve low correlation to, and lower"
"1440","volatility than the markets. When determining how"
"1441","to allocate assets of the fund among the investment"
"1442","management teams, the Advisor will consider a"
"1443","variety of factors, including the investment strategy,"
"1444","the investment sub-strategy and expected return"
"1445","potential, and the manner in which the investment"
"1446","management teams' historical and expected"
"1447","investment returns correlate with each other. In"
"1448","addition, additional guidelines will also be"
"1449","employed and monitored by the Advisor to ensure"
"1450","each investment management team's compliance"
"1451","with its stated mandate and risk framework."
"1452","The Advisor currently allocates the fund's assets"
"1453","across two sub-advised sleeves managed by"
"1454","Pyramis Global Advisors, LLC (Pyramis) and"
"1455","Henderson Alternative Investment Advisor Limited"
"1456","(Henderson) and one sleeve managed by the"
"1457","Advisor. Each investment management team will"
"1458","employ different market neutral investment"
"1459","strategies when managing the assets of the fund"
"1460","allocated to it."
"1461","Derivatives. In implementing their respective"
"1462","strategies, the investment management teams"
"1463","generally may use futures contracts and total return"
"1464","swaps, which are each a type of derivative (a"
"1465","contract whose value is based on, for example,"
"1466","indices, currencies or securities), as a substitute for"
"1467","direct investment in a particular security or market"
"1468","or to maintain full long and short exposure. In"
"1469","addition, the respective investment management"
"1470","teams may use forward currency contracts to hedge"
"1471","exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange"
"1472","rates on foreign currency denominated portfolio"
"1473","holdings or to facilitate transactions in foreign"
"1474","currency denominated securities."
"1475","The fund may also use various types of derivatives"
"1476","(i) for hedging purposes; (ii) for risk management;"
"1477","(iii) for non-hedging purposes to seek to enhance"
"1478","potential gains; or (iv) as a substitute for direct"
"1479","investment in a particular asset class or to keep cash"
"1480","on hand to meet shareholder redemptions."
"1481","Securities Lending. The fund may lend securities"
"1482","(up to one-third of total assets) to approved"
"1483","institutions."
"1484","Pyramis' Market Neutral Strategy: The strategy"
"1485","utilizes a long/short market neutral approach with"
"1486","the ability to go wherever research identifies the"
"1487","best opportunities both domestically and globally."
"1488","To isolate sources of performance spread (i.e., the"
"1489","performance differential between the long and short"
"1490","portfolios), portfolio management focuses on"
"1491","strong, company-level catalysts and fundamentally"
"1492","driven themes in the marketplace that can be"
"1493","translated into long and short positions via pair"
"1494","trades. From a valuation perspective, portfolio"
"1495","management looks for stocks that are trading at"
"1496","reasonable valuations relative to growth prospects"
"1497","and relative to peers. Stocks are typically sold when"
"1498","the investment thesis behind the stock's inclusion in"
"1499","the strategy has played out, if there is a change to"
"1500","the investment thesis given new information, or if"
"1501","portfolio management simply sees better"
"1502","opportunity elsewhere."
"1503","When constructing the portfolio, portfolio"
"1504","management is able to draw input from research"
"1505","analysts located in various countries around the"
"1506","globe. Day-to-day decision making within the"
"1507","strategy generally takes place in a collaborative"
"1508","team context, with final security selection and"
"1509","accountability resting with portfolio management."
"1510","The focus of the team context is to incorporate"
"1511","multiple viewpoints reached from a variety of"
"1512","perspectives and activities. The approach"
"1513","encourages active discussion among team members,"
"1514","resulting in a higher level and quality of idea"
"1515","generation. Daily meetings, as well as informal"
"1516","interactions, set the platform for optimal"
"1517","communication."
"1518","In implementing the strategy, portfolio management"
"1519","generally may use futures contracts and total return"
"1520","swaps."
"1521","Henderson's Market Neutral Strategy: The"
"1522","strategy is a 'best ideas' global, highly liquid equity"
"1523","long/short strategy that focuses exclusively on"
"1524","public equities. In choosing securities, portfolio"
"1525","management utilizes a bottom up, fundamental"
"1526","stock-selection criteria based on deep fundamental"
"1527","analysis. Regional investment teams contribute"
"1528","investment ideas and recommendations which are"
"1529","pooled together to form one portfolio. The strategy"
"1530","utilizes a mix of fundamental investment disciplines"
"1531","that include both growth and value strategies to"
"1532","reduce volatility and correlation. Portfolio"
"1533","management adopts an active management"
"1534","approach to adapt the portfolio to rapidly changing"
"1535","market and macro conditions.  Portfolio"
"1536","management conducts rigorous portfolio stress"
"1537","testing and analysis to seek to preserve capital"
"1538","through all market cycles. Long and short positions"
"1539","are typically exited when fundamentals change. For"
"1540","example, stock, sector or regional shifts in"
"1541","sentiment may all contribute to a decision to reduce"
"1542","or increase exposures in long and short positions"
"1543","respectively."
"1544","In implementing the strategy, portfolio management"
"1545","generally may use futures contracts and forward"
"1546","currency contracts. Typically, the strategy may"
"1547","result in a long bias. Portfolio management"
"1548","generally may look to achieve market neutrality by"
"1549","reducing the net exposure through the use of"
"1550","appropriate index futures contracts."
"1551","The Advisor's Market Neutral Strategy: The"
"1552","long/short strategy employs a proprietary multi-"
"1553","factor quantitative model that ranks securities based"
"1554","on expected performance over a defined time"
"1555","horizon. The rankings are supported through factor"
"1556","selection and weightings that reflect the efficacy"
"1557","and consistency of all the factors that are analyzed."
"1558","The model utilizes numerous quantitative factors"
"1559","across broad categories such as valuation,"
"1560","momentum, profitability, earnings and sales growth"
"1561","and equity change. In constructing the portfolio,"
"1562","market neutrality will be achieved by investing"
"1563","equal dollar amounts in the long and short"

"1577","Board of Trustees of DWS Market Trust"
"1578","In planning and performing our audits of the"

"1580","Neutral Fund (formerly DWS Disciplined Market"
"1581","Neutral Fund) and DWS Select Alternative"
"1582","Allocation Fund (each a series of DWS Market"
"1583","Trust) (collectively, the Company), as of and for"
"1584","the year ended August 31, 2013, in accordance"
"1585","with the standards of the Public Company"
"1586","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1587","considered the Company?s internal control over"
"1588","financial reporting, including controls over"
"1589","safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1590","designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1591","purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1592","financial statements and to comply with the"
"1593","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1594","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1595","effectiveness of the Company?s internal control"
"1596","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"1597","express no such opinion."
"1598","The management of the Company is"
"1599","responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1600","effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1601","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1602","judgments by management are required to"
"1603","assess the expected benefits and related costs"
"1604","of controls. A company?s internal control over"
"1605","financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1606","provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1607","reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1608","preparation of financial statements for external"
"1609","purposes in accordance with generally"
"1610","accepted accounting principles. A company?s"
"1611","internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1612","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"1613","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1614","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1615","transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"1616","the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"1617","that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1618","permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1619","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1620","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"1621","the company are being made only in"
"1622","accordance with authorizations of management"
"1623","and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"1624","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"1625","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1626","use or disposition of a company?s assets that"
"1627","could have a material effect on the financial"
"1628","statements."
"1629","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1630","control over financial reporting may not prevent"
"1631","or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"1632","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"1633","are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1634","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"1635","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1636","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1637","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1638","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"1639","a control does not allow management or"
"1640","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1641","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1642","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"1643","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1644","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1645","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1646","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1647","company?s annual or interim financial"
"1648","statements will not be prevented or detected on"
"1649","a timely basis."
