"798","Report of Independent"
"799"," Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"800","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"801","Federated Index Trust:"
"802","In planning and performing"
"803","our audits of the financial"
"804"," statements of Federated Mid-Cap"
"805","Index Fund and Federated Max-Cap"
"806","Index Fund (the two portfolios"
"807"," constituting"
"808","Federated Index Trust)"
"809","(collectively, the Funds)"
"810","as of and for the year ended October"
"811","31, 2010, in accordance with"
"812","the standards of the Public"
"813","Company Accounting Oversight"
"814","Board (United States), we"
"815","considered the Funds' internal"
"816"," control over financial reporting,"
"817","including controls over safeguarding"
"818","securities, as a basis for"
"819"," designing our auditing"
"820","procedures for the purpose of"
"821"," expressing our opinion on the"
"822"," financial statements and to"
"823","comply with the requirements"
"824","of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"825"," purpose of expressing an"
"826","opinion on the effectiveness"
"827","of the Funds' internal control"
"828"," over financial reporting."
"829","Accordingly, we express no such"
"830"," opinion."
"831","The management of the Funds is"
"832"," responsible for establishing"
"833","and maintaining effective"
"834","internal control over financial"
"835","reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"836","responsibility, estimates and"
"837","judgments by management are required"
"838","to assess the expected benefits and"
"839"," related costs"
"840","of controls.  A company's internal"
"841","control over financial reporting is"
"842","a process designed"
"843","to provide reasonable assurance"
"844"," regarding the reliability of"
"845"," financial reporting and the"
"846","preparation of financial statements"
"847","for external purposes in accordance"
"848","with generally"
"849","accepted accounting principles."
"850","A company's internal control over"
"851","financial reporting"
"852","includes those policies and"
"853","procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"854","maintenance of records that,"
"855","in reasonable detail, accurately"
"856","and fairly reflect the transactions"
"857"," and dispositions of the"
"858","assets of the company; (2) provide"
"859","reasonable assurance that transactions"
"860"," are recorded as"
"861","necessary to permit preparation of"
"862","financial statements in accordance"
"863","with generally"
"864","accepted accounting principles, and"
"865","that receipts and expenditures of"
"866","the company are"
"867","being made only in accordance with"
"868"," authorizations of management and"
"869"," directors of the"
"870","company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"871","assurance regarding prevention or"
"872","timely detection"
"873","of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"874","or disposition of a company's assets"
"875"," that could have a"
"876","material effect on the financial"
"877","statements."
"878","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"879","internal control over financial"
"880","reporting may not"
"881","prevent or detect misstatements."
"882"," Also, projections of any evaluation"
"883","of effectiveness to"
"884","future periods are subject to the"
"885","risk that controls may become"
"886","inadequate because of"
"887","changes in conditions, or that the d"
"888","egree of compliance with the policies"
"889"," or procedures"
"890","may deteriorate."
"891","A deficiency in internal control over"
"892","financial reporting exists when the design or"
"893","operation of a control does not"
"894","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"895","performing their assigned functions,"
"896"," to prevent or detect misstatements"
"897","on a timely basis."
"898","A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"899"," or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"900"," internal control"
"901","over financial reporting, such that"
"902"," there is a reasonable possibility"
"903","that a material"
"904","misstatement of the company's annual"
"905"," or interim financial statements will not be"
"906","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"907","Our consideration of the Funds' internal"
"908"," control over financial reporting was for the"
"909","limited purpose described in the first"
"910","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"911","deficiencies in internal control that"
"912"," might be material weaknesses under standards"
"913","established by the Public Company Accounting"
"914","Oversight Board (United States)."
"915","However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"916","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"917","and its operation, including controls over"
"918"," safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"919","material weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2010."
"920","This report is intended solely for the"
"921","information and use of management and"
"922"," the Board"
"923","of Trustees of the Funds and the Securities"
"924","and Exchange Commission and is not"
"925","intended to be and should not be used by"
"926"," anyone other than these specified parties."

"937","ITEM 77E.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"938","Since February 2004, Federated"
"939","and related entities (collectively,"
"940"," Federated) have been named as"
"941","defendants in several lawsuits that"
"942"," are now pending in the United States"
"943","District Court for the Western"
"944","District of Pennsylvania. These lawsuits"
"945","have been consolidated into a single"
"946"," action alleging excessive"
"947","advisory fees involving one of the"
"948","Federated-sponsored mutual funds (Funds)."
"949","       Federated and its counsel have been"
"950","defending this litigation. Additional"
"951","lawsuits based upon"
"952","similar allegations may be filed in the future."
"953"," The potential impact of these lawsuits,"
"954"," all of which seek"
"955","monetary damages, attorneys' fees and expenses,"
"956"," and future potential similar suits is uncertain."
"957"," Although"
"958","we do not believe that these lawsuits will have"
"959"," a material adverse effect on the Funds, there can be no"
"960","assurance that these suits, ongoing adverse"
"961","publicity and/or other developments resulting from the"
"962","allegations in these matters will not result"
"963","in increased redemptions, or reduced sales, of shares of the"
"964","Funds or other adverse consequences for the Funds."
