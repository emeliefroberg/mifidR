"1501","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1502","Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"1503","Aquila Municipal Trust"
"1504","New York, New York"
"1505","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1506","statements of Aquila Churchill Tax-Free of Kentucky,"
"1507","Aquila Narragansett Tax-Free Income Fund, Aquila"
"1508","Tax-Free Fund of Colorado, Aquila Tax-Free Fund for"
"1509","Utah and Aquila Tax-Free Trust of Arizona, each a"
"1510","series of Aquila Municipal Trust (the 'Trust'), as"
"1511","of and for the year ended March 31, 2014, in accordance"
"1512","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1513","Oversight Board (United States), we considered their"
"1514","internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1515","control activities for safeguarding securities, as a"
"1516","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1517","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1518","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"1519","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"1520","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal"
"1521","control over financial reporting.   Accordingly, we"
"1522","express no such opinion."
"1523","The management of the Trust is responsible for"
"1524","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1525","control over financial reporting.   In fulfilling"
"1526","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1527","management are required to assess the expected"
"1528","benefits and related costs of controls.   A company's"
"1529","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1530","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1531","regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"1532","and the preparation of financial statements for"
"1533","external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1534","accepted accounting principles.   A company's"
"1535","internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1536","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"1537","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1538","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"1539","and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"1540","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1541","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1542","financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1543","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"1544","and expenditures of the company are being made only"
"1545","in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1546","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1547","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"1548","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of"
"1549","a company's assets that could have a material effect"
"1550","on the financial statements."
"1551","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1552","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1553","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"1554","future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1555","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"1556","that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1557","procedures may deteriorate."
"1558","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1559","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1560","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1561","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1562","misstatements on a timely basis.   A material weakness is"
"1563","a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1564","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1565","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1566","company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"1567","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1568","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial"
"1569","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1570","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"1571","in internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1572","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1573","Board (United States).   However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"1574","Trust's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1575","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities,"
"1576","which we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above,"
"1577","as of March 31, 2014."
"1578","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1579","management, Shareholders and Board of Trustees of Aquila"
"1580","Municipal Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission,"
"1581","and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
"1582","other than these specified parties."

The Fund understands that purchases from underwriters include a commission or concession paid by the issuer to the underwriter and that principal transactions placed through dealers include a spread between the bid and asked prices.&#160;&#160;In allocating transactions to dealers, the Manager is authorized and shall authorize any Sub-Adviser, to consider, in determining whether a particular dealer will provide best execution, the dealer's reliability, integrity, financial condition and risk in positioning the securities involved, as well as the difficulty of the transaction in question, and thus need not pay the lowest spread or commission available if the Manager determines in good faith that the amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by the dealer, viewed either in terms of the particular transaction or the Manager's overall responsibilities.&#160;&#160;If, on the foregoing basis, the transaction in question could be allocated to two or more dealers, the Manager is authorized, in making such allocation, to consider whether a dealer has provided research services, as further discussed below.&#160;&#160;Such research may be in written form or through direct contact with individuals and may include quotations on portfolio securities and information on particular issuers and industries, as well as on market, economic, or institutional activities.&#160;&#160;The Fund recognizes that no dollar value can be placed on such research services or on execution services and that such research services may or may not be useful to the Fund and may be used for the benefit of the Manager or its other clients.

The Fund understands that purchases from underwriters include a commission or concession paid by the issuer to the underwriter and that principal transactions placed through dealers include a spread between the bid and asked prices.&#160;&#160;In allocating transactions to dealers, the Manager is authorized and shall authorize any Sub-Adviser, to consider, in determining whether a particular dealer will provide best execution, the dealer's reliability, integrity, financial condition and risk in positioning the securities involved, as well as the difficulty of the transaction in question, and thus need not pay the lowest spread or commission available if the Manager determines in good faith that the amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by the dealer, viewed either in terms of the particular transaction or the Manager's overall responsibilities.&#160;&#160;If, on the foregoing basis, the transaction in question could be allocated to two or more dealers, the Manager is authorized, in making such allocation, to consider whether a dealer has provided research services, as further discussed below.&#160;&#160;Such research may be in written form or through direct contact with individuals and may include quotations on portfolio securities and information on particular issuers and industries, as well as on market, economic, or institutional activities.&#160;&#160;The Fund recognizes that no dollar value can be placed on such research services or on execution services and that such research services may or may not be useful to the Fund and may be used for the benefit of the Manager or its other clients. The Manager shall cause the foregoing provisions, in substantially the same form, to be included in any Sub-Advisory Agreement.</font></div>

The Fund understands that purchases from underwriters include a commission or concession paid by the issuer to the underwriter and that principal transactions placed through dealers include a spread between the bid and asked prices.&#160;&#160;In allocating transactions to dealers, the Manager is authorized and shall authorize any Sub-Adviser, to consider, in determining whether a particular dealer will provide best execution, the dealer's reliability, integrity, financial condition and risk in positioning the securities involved, as well as the difficulty of the transaction in question, and thus need not pay the lowest spread or commission available if the Manager determines in good faith that the amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by the dealer, viewed either in terms of the particular transaction or the Manager's overall responsibilities.&#160;&#160;If, on the foregoing basis, the transaction in question could be allocated to two or more dealers, the Manager is authorized, in making such allocation, to consider whether a dealer has provided research services, as further discussed below. Such research may be in written form or through direct contact with individuals and may include quotations on portfolio securities and information on particular issuers and industries, as well as on market, economic, or institutional activities.&#160;&#160;The Fund recognizes that no dollar value can be placed on such research services or on execution services and that such research services may or may not be useful to the Fund and may be used for the benefit of the Manager or its other clients. The Manager shall cause the foregoing provisions, in substantially the same form, to be included in any Sub-Advisory Agreement.</font></div>
