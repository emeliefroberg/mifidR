"1759","that it is desirable for the Fund that the Adviser have access to"
"1760","supplemental investment and market research and security and"
"1761","economic analysis provided by brokers who may execute"
"1762","brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than would"
"1763","otherwise result when allocating brokerage transactions to other"
"1764","brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and"
"1765","efficient execution.  Therefore, the Adviser is authorized to place"
"1766","orders for the purchase and sale of securities for the Fund with"
"1767","such brokers, subject to review by the Trust s Board of Trustees"
"1768","from time to time with respect to the extent and continuation of"
"1769","this practice.  It is understood that the services provided by such"
"1770","brokers may be useful or beneficial to the Adviser in connection"
"1771","with its services to other clients."
"1772","       On occasions when the Adviser deems the purchase or sale"
"1773","of a security to be in the best interest of the Fund as well as other"
"1774","clients, the Adviser, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and"
"1775","regulations, may, but shall be under no obligation to, aggregate the"
"1776","securities to be so sold or purchased in order to obtain the most"
"1777","favorable price or lower brokerage commissions and efficient"
"1778","execution.  In such event, allocation of the securities so purchased"
"1779","or sold, as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be"
"1780","made by the Adviser in the manner it considers to be the most"
"1781","equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund"
"1782","and to such other clients."

"1784","       Except for the services and facilities to be provided by the"
"1785","Adviser pursuant to a separate administration agreement with the"
"1786","Trust, the Fund assumes and shall pay all expenses for all other"

"1863","       SECTION 4.	Advisory Fee."
"1864","       In return for its advisory services, the Fund will pay the"
"1865","Adviser a monthly fee, computed and accrued daily, based on an"
"1866","annual rate of 2.45% of the Fund s  Average Daily Managed"
"1867","Assets.    Average Daily Managed Assets  of the Trust shall mean"
"1868","the average daily value of the total assets of the Trust, less all"
"1869","accrued liabilities of the Trust (other than the aggregate amount of"
"1870","any outstanding borrowings constituting financial leverage).  The"
"1871","Adviser may waive a portion of its fees.  If this Agreement"
"1872","becomes effective subsequent to the first day of a month or shall"
"1873","terminate before the last day of a month, compensation for such"
"1874","month shall be computed in a manner consistent with the"
"1875","calculation of the fees payable on a monthly basis.  Subject to the"
"1876","provisions of Section 5 below, the accrued fees will be payable"
"1877","monthly as promptly as possible after the end of each month"
"1878","during which this Agreement is in effect."
"1879","       SECTION 5.	Reimbursements."
"1880","       The parties agree that they may negotiate from time to"
"1881","time for the Adviser to reimburse certain costs and expenses of the"
"1882","Fund.  If such an agreement is in effect, the determination of"
"1883","whether reimbursement for such costs and expenses is due the"
"1884","Fund from the Adviser will be made on an accrual basis once"
"1885","monthly, and if it is so determined that such reimbursement is due,"
"1886","the accrued amount of such reimbursement that is due shall serve"
"1887","as an offset to the investment advisory fee payable monthly by the"
"1888","Fund to the Adviser pursuant to  Section 4  hereof, and the amount"
"1889","to be paid by the Adviser to the Fund as soon as is practicable at"
"1890","the end of a fiscal year of the Fund shall be equal to the difference"
"1891","between the aggregate reimbursement due the Fund from the"
"1892","Adviser for that fiscal year and the aggregate offsets made by the"
"1893","Fund against the aggregate investment advisory fees payable to the"
"1894","Adviser pursuant to  Section 4  hereof for that fiscal year by virtue"
"1895","of such aggregate reimbursement.  The foregoing limitation on"
"1896","reimbursement of costs and expenses shall exclude distribution and"
"1897","service fees, brokerage commissions, short sale dividend expense,"
"1898","taxes, deferred organization expenses and extraordinary expenses"
"1899","(as determined by the Board of the Trustees of the Fund in the"
"1900","exercise of its business judgment)."
"1901","       SECTION 6.	Indemnification."
"1902","       (a)	The Trust hereby agrees to indemnify the"
"1903","Adviser and each of the Adviser s partners, officers,"
"1904","employees, and agents (including any individual who"
"1905","serves at the Adviser s request as director, officer, partner,"
"1906","trustee or the like of another corporation) and controlling"
"1907","persons (each such person being an  Indemnitee  ) against"
"1908","any liabilities and expenses, including amounts paid in"
"1909","satisfaction of judgments, in compromise or as fines and"
"1910","penalties, and counsel fees (all as provided in accordance"
"1911","with applicable state law) reasonably incurred by such"
"1912","Indemnitee in connection with the defense or disposition"
"1913","of any action, suit or other proceeding, whether civil or"
"1914","criminal, before any court or administrative or"
"1915","investigative body in which he may be or may have been"
"1916","involved as a party or otherwise or with which he may be"
"1917","or may have been threatened, while acting in any capacity"
"1918","set forth above in this paragraph or thereafter by reason of"
"1919","his having acted in any such capacity, except with respect"
"1920","to any matter as to which he shall have been adjudicated"
"1921","not to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that"
"1922","his action was in the best interest of the Trust and"
"1923","furthermore, in the case of any criminal proceeding, so"
"1924","long as he had no reasonable cause to believe that the"
"1925","conduct was unlawful, provided, however, that (1) no"
"1926","Indemnitee shall be indemnified hereunder against any"
"1927","liability to the Trust or its shareholders or any expense of"
"1928","such Indemnitee arising by reason of (i) willful"
"1929","misfeasance, (ii) bad faith, (iii) gross negligence (iv)"
"1930","reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of"
"1931","his position (the conduct referred to in such clauses (i)"
"1932","through (iv) being sometimes referred to herein as"
"1933","Disabling Conduct ), (2) as to any matter disposed of by"
"1934","settlement or a compromise payment by such Indemnitee,"
"1935","pursuant to a consent decree or otherwise, no"
"1936","indemnification either for said payment or for any other"
"1937","expenses shall be provided unless there has been a"
"1938","determination that such settlement or compromise is in the"
"1939","best interests of the Trust and that such Indemnitee appears"
"1940","to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that his"
"1941","action was in the best interests of the Trust and did not"
"1942","involve Disabling Conduct by such Indemnitee and"
"1943","(3) with respect to any action, suit or other proceeding"
"1944","voluntarily prosecuted by any Indemnitee as plaintiff,"
"1945","indemnification shall be mandatory only if the prosecution"
"1946","of such action, suit or other proceeding by such"
"1947","Indemnitee was authorized by a majority of the full Board"
"1948","of the Trust.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust"
"1949","shall not be obligated to provide any such indemnification"
"1950","to the extent such provision would waive any right that the"
"1951","Trust cannot lawfully waive."
"1952","       (b)	The Trust shall make advance payments in"
"1953","connection with the expenses of defending any action with"
"1954","respect to which indemnification might be sought"
"1955","hereunder if the Trust receives a written affirmation of the"
"1956","Indemnitee s good faith belief that the standard of conduct"
"1957","necessary for indemnification has been met and a written"
"1958","undertaking to reimburse the Trust unless it is"
"1959","subsequently determined that he is entitled to such"
"1960","indemnification and if the Trustees of the Trust determine"
"1961","that the facts then known to them would not preclude"
"1962","indemnification. In addition, at least one of the following"
"1963","conditions must be met: (1) the Indemnitee shall provide"
"1964","adequate security for his undertaking, (2) the Trust shall be"
"1965","insured against losses arising by reason of any lawful"
"1966","advances, (3) a majority of a quorum of Trustees of the"
"1967","Trust who are neither  interested persons  of the Trust (as"
"1968","defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) nor parties to"
"1969","the proceeding ( Disinterested Non-Party Trustees ) or an"
"1970","independent legal counsel in a written opinion, shall"
"1971","determine, based on a review of readily available facts (as"
"1972","opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), that there is reason to"
"1973","believe that the Indemnitee ultimately will be found"
"1974","entitled to indemnification or (4) there is not a"
"1975","Disinterested Non-Party Trustee, Indemnitee provides the"
"1976","written affirmation referred to above."
"1977","       (c)	All determinations with respect to"
"1978","indemnification hereunder shall be made (1) by a final"
"1979","decision on the merits by a court or other body of"
"1980","competent jurisdiction before whom the proceeding was"
"1981","brought that such Indemnitee is not liable by reason of"
"1982","Disabling Conduct or, (2) in the absence of such a"
"1983","decision, by (i) a majority vote of a quorum of the"
"1984","Disinterested Non-Party Trustees of the Trust, or (ii) if"
"1985","such a quorum is not obtainable or even if obtainable, if a"
"1986","majority vote of such quorum so directs, independent legal"
"1987","counsel in a written opinion."
"1988","       (d)	Each Indemnitee shall, in the performance"
"1989","of its duties, be fully and completely justified and"
"1990","protected with regard to any act or any failure to act"
"1991","resulting from reliance in good faith upon the books of"
"1992","account or other records of the Trust, upon an opinion of"
"1993","counsel, or upon reports made to the Trust by any of the"
"1994","Trust s officers or employees or by any advisor,"
"1995","administrator, manager, distributor, selected dealer,"
"1996","accountant, appraiser or other expert or consultant selected"
"1997","with reasonable care by the Trustees, officers or"
"1998","employees of the Trust, regardless of whether such counsel"
"1999","or other person may also be a Trustee."
"2000","       (e)	The rights accruing to any Indemnitee"
"2001","under these provisions shall not exclude any other right to"
"2002","which he may be lawfully entitled."
"2003","       SECTION 7.	Relations with Fund."
"2004","       Subject to and in accordance with the organizational"
"2005","documents of the Adviser and the Trust, as well as their policies"
"2006","and procedures and codes of ethics, it is understood that Trustees,"
"2007","officers, agents and shareholders of the Fund are or may be"
"2008","interested in the Adviser (or any successor thereof) as directors,"
"2009","officers or otherwise, that partners, officers and agents of the"
"2010","Adviser (or any successor thereof) are or may be interested in the"
"2011","Fund as Trustees, officers, agents, shareholders or otherwise, and"
"2012","that the Adviser (or any such successor thereof) is or may be"
"2013","interested in the Fund as a shareholder or otherwise."
"2014","       SECTION 8.	Liability of Adviser."
"2015","       The Adviser shall not be liable to the Fund for any error of"
"2016","judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Fund in"
"2017","connection with the matters to which this Agreement relates;"
"2018","provided, however, that no provision of this Agreement shall be"
"2019","deemed to protect the Adviser against any liability to the Fund or"
"2020","its shareholders to which it might otherwise be subject by reason of"
"2021","any Disabling Conduct nor shall any provision hereof be deemed"
"2022","to protect any trustee or officer of the Fund against any such"
"2023","liability to which he might otherwise be subject by reason of any"
"2024","Disabling Conduct."
"2025","       SECTION 9.	Duration and Termination of this"
"2026","Agreement."
"2027","       (a)	Duration.  This Agreement shall become effective"
"2028","on the date first set forth above, such date being the date on which"
"2029","this Agreement has been executed following: (1) the approval of"
"2030","the Trust s Board of Trustees, including approval by a vote of a"
"2031","majority of the Trustees who are not  interested persons  (as"
"2032","defined in the 1940 Act) of the Adviser or the Fund, cast in person"
"2033","at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval; and"
"2034","(2) the approval by a  vote of a majority of the outstanding voting"
"2035","securities  (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund. Unless"
"2036","terminated as herein provided, this Agreement shall remain in full"
"2037","force and effect until the date that is two years after the effective"
"2038","date of this Agreement.  Subsequent to such initial period of"
"2039","effectiveness, this Agreement shall continue in full force and"
"2040","effect, subject to paragraph 9(c), so long as such continuance is"
"2041","approved at least annually (a) by either the Trust s Board of"
"2042","Trustees or by a  vote of a majority of the outstanding voting"
"2043","securities  (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund and (b) in"
"2044","either event, by the vote of a majority of the Trustees of the Fund"
"2045","who are not parties to this Agreement or  interested persons  (as"
"2046","defined in the 1940 Act) of any such party, cast in person at a"
"2047","meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval."
"2048","       (b)	Amendment.  No provision of this Agreement may"
"2049","be amended, waived, discharged or terminated orally, but only by"
"2050","an instrument in writing signed by the party against which"

"2052","sought.  Any amendment of this Agreement shall be subject to the"
"2053","1940 Act including the interpretation thereof that amendments that"
"2054","do not increase the compensation of the Adviser or otherwise"
"2055","fundamentally alter the relationship of the Trust with the Adviser"
"2056","do not require shareholder approval if approved by the requisite"
"2057","majority of the Trust s Trustees who are not  interested persons  (as"
"2058","defined in the 1940 Act) of the Trust."
"2059","       (c)	Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated"
"2060","at any time, without payment of any penalty, by vote of the Trust s"
"2061","Board of Trustees, or by a  vote of a majority of the outstanding"
"2062","voting securities  (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund, or by"
"2063","the Adviser, in each case on not more than 60 days  nor less than"
"2064","30 days  prior written notice to the other party."
"2065","       (d)	Automatic Termination.  This Agreement shall"
"2066","automatically and immediately terminate in the event of its"
"2067","assignment  (as defined in the 1940 Act)."
"2068","       SECTION 10.	Services Not Exclusive."
"2069","       The services of the Adviser to the Fund hereunder are not"
"2070","to be deemed exclusive, and the Adviser (and its affiliates) shall be"
"2071","free to render similar services to others so long as its services"
"2072","hereunder are not impaired thereby; provided, however, that the"
"2073","Adviser will undertake no activities that, in its reasonable good"
"2074","faith judgment, will adversely affect the performance of its"
"2075","obligations under this Agreement.  In addition, the parties may"
"2076","enter into other agreements pursuant to which the Adviser provides"
"2077","administrative or other, non-investment advisory services to the"
"2078","Fund, and the Adviser may be compensated for such other"
"2079","services."
"2080","       SECTION 11.	Notices."
"2081","       Notices under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall"
"2082","be addressed, and delivered or mailed postage prepaid, to the other"
"2083","party at such address as such other party may designate from time"

"2090","       This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the"
"2091","laws of the State of Delaware, and the applicable provisions of the"
"2092","1940 Act.  To the extent that applicable law of the State of"
"2093","Delaware, or any of the provisions herein, conflict with applicable"
"2094","provisions of the 1940 Act, the latter shall control.  If any"
"2095","provision of this Agreement shall be held or made invalid by a"
"2096","court decision, statute, rule or otherwise, the remainder of this"
"2097","Agreement shall not be affected thereby.  This Agreement may be"
"2098","executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be"
"2099","deemed to be an original, but such counterparts shall, together,"
"2100","constitute only one instrument."
"2101","       SECTION 13.	Miscellaneous."
"2102","	The Adviser agrees to advise the Fund of any change of its"
"2103","membership (which shall mean its general partner) within a"

"2105","definitive agreement that would result in a change of control"
"2106","(within the meaning of the 1940 Act) of the Adviser, it agrees to"
"2107","give the Fund the lesser of 60 days  written notice and such notice"
"2108","as is reasonably practicable before consummating the transaction."
"2109","       Where the effect of a requirement of the 1940 Act"
"2110","reflected in or contemplated by any provisions of this Agreement"

"2174","SECTION 1.	Appointment of Adviser."
"2175","      The Trust hereby appoints the Adviser to act as"
"2176","manager and investment adviser to the Fund for the period"
"2177","and on the terms herein set forth. The Adviser accepts such"
"2178","appointment and agrees to render the services herein set"
"2179","forth, for the compensation herein provided."
"2180","SECTION 2.	Duties of Adviser."
"2181","      The Adviser, at its own expense, shall furnish the"
"2182","following services and facilities to the Fund:"
"2183","      (a) Investment Program. The Adviser"
"2184","shall (i) furnish continuously an investment"
"2185","program for the Fund, (ii) determine (subject to the"
"2186","overall supervision and review of the Trust s Board of"
"2187","Trustees) the investments to be purchased, held, sold"
"2188","or exchanged by the Fund and the portion, if any,"
"2189","of the assets of the Fund to be held uninvested,"
"2190","(iii) make changes in the investments of the Fund"
"2191","and (iv) vote, exercise consents and exercise all"

"2194","the other affairs and business of the Fund and"
"2195","matters incidental thereto pursuant to a separate"
"2196","administration agreement with the Trust, subject"
"2197","always to the control of the Trust s Board of Trustees,"
"2198","and to the provisions of the organizational"
"2199","documents of the Trust, the Registration"
"2200","Statement of the Trust with respect to the Fund and"
"2201","its shares of beneficial interest ( Shares ), including"
"2202","the Fund s prospectus(es) and statement of additional"
"2203","information, and the 1940 Act, in each case as from"
"2204","time to time amended and in effect. Subject to the"
"2205","foregoing, the Adviser shall have the authority to"
"2206","engage one or more sub-advisers in connection with"
"2207","the portfolio management of the Fund, which sub-"
"2208","advisers may be affiliates of the Adviser; provided,"
"2209","however, that the Adviser shall remain responsible to"
"2210","the Trust with respect to its duties and obligations on"
"2211","behalf of the Fund set forth in this Agreement."
"2212","       (b) Portfolio Transactions. The Adviser"
"2213","shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of"
"2214","portfolio securities for the account of the Fund"
"2215","with brokers or dealers selected by the Adviser,"
"2216","although the Fund will pay the actual brokerage"
"2217","commissions on portfolio transactions in accordance"
"2218","with Section 3(d)."
"2219","      In placing portfolio transactions for the Fund, it is"
"2220","recognized that the Adviser will give primary consideration"
"2221","to securing the most favorable price and efficient"
"2222","execution. Consistent with this policy, the Adviser may"
"2223","consider the financial responsibility, research and investment"
"2224","information and other services provided by brokers or"
"2225","dealers who may effect or be a party to any such transaction"
"2226","or other transactions to which other clients of the Adviser"
"2227","may be a party. It is understood that neither the Fund nor the"
"2228","Adviser has adopted a formula for allocation of the Fund s"
"2229","investment transaction business. It is also understood that it is"
"2230","desirable for the Fund that the Adviser have access to"
"2231","supplemental investment and market research and"
"2232","security and economic analysis provided by brokers who"
"2233","may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the"
"2234","Fund than would otherwise result when allocating brokerage"
"2235","transactions to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most"
"2236","favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, subject to"
"2237","Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the"
"2238","Adviser is authorized to place orders for the purchase and"
"2239","sale of securities for the Fund with such brokers, subject"
"2240","to review by the Trust s Board of Trustees from time to time"
"2241","with respect to the extent and continuation of this practice."
"2242","It is understood that the services provided by such"
"2243","brokers may be useful or beneficial to the Adviser in"
"2244","connection with its services to other clients."
"2245","      On occasions when the Adviser deems the purchase"
"2246","or sale of a security to be in the best interest of the Fund as"
"2247","well as other clients, the Adviser, to the extent permitted by"
"2248","applicable laws and regulations, may, but shall be under no"
"2249","obligation to, aggregate the securities to be so sold or"
"2250","purchased in order to obtain the most favorable price or"
"2251","lower brokerage commissions and efficient execution. In"
"2252","such event, allocation of the securities so purchased or sold,"
"2253","as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will"
"2254","be made by the Adviser in the manner it considers to be"
"2255","the most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary"
"2256","obligations to the Fund and to such other clients."
"2257","SECTION 3.	Allocation of Expenses."
"2258","      Except for the services and facilities to be provided"
"2259","by the Adviser pursuant to a separate administration"
"2260","agreement with the Trust, the Fund assumes and shall pay"
"2261","all expenses for all other Fund operations and activities,"
"2262","and shall reimburse the Adviser for any such expenses"
"2263","incurred by the Adviser. Unless the prospectus(es) or"
"2264","statement of additional information of the Fund provides"

"2339","SECTION 4.	Advisory Fee."
"2340","     In return for its advisory services, the Fund will pay"
"2341","the Adviser a monthly fee, computed and accrued daily,"
"2342","based on an annual rate of 1.00% of the Fund s  Average"

"2344","with respect to the period in question, to one or more sub-"
"2345","adviser(s) to the Fund pursuant to any sub-advisory"
"2346","agreement in effect with respect to such period.   Average"
"2347","Daily Managed Assets  of the Fund shall mean the average"
"2348","daily value of the total assets of the Fund, less all accrued"
"2349","liabilities of the Fund (other than the aggregate amount of"
"2350","any outstanding borrowings constituting financial"
"2351","leverage). The Adviser may waive a portion of its fees. If"
"2352","this Agreement becomes effective subsequent to the first day"
"2353","of a month or shall terminate before the last day of a month,"
"2354","compensation for such month shall be computed in a"
"2355","manner consistent with the calculation of the fees payable on"

"2357","the accrued fees will be payable monthly as promptly as"
"2358","possible after the end of each month during which this"
"2359","Agreement is in effect."
"2360","SECTION 5.	Reimbursements."
"2361","     The parties agree that they may negotiate from time to"
"2362","time for the Adviser to reimburse certain costs and expenses"
"2363","of the Fund. If such an agreement is in effect, the"
"2364","determination of whether reimbursement for such costs and"
"2365","expenses is due the Fund from the Adviser will be made on"
"2366","an accrual basis once monthly, and if it is so determined"
"2367","that such reimbursement is due, the accrued amount of"
"2368","such reimbursement that is due shall serve as an offset"
"2369","to the investment advisory fee payable monthly by the"
"2370","Fund to the Adviser pursuant to Section 4 hereof, and the"
"2371","amount to be paid by the Adviser to the Fund as soon as is"
"2372","practicable at the end of a fiscal year of the Fund shall be"
"2373","equal to the difference between the aggregate reimbursement"
"2374","due the Fund from the Adviser for that fiscal year and the"
"2375","aggregate offsets made by the Fund against the aggregate"
"2376","investment advisory fees payable to the Adviser pursuant"
"2377","to Section 4 hereof for that fiscal year by virtue of such"
"2378","aggregate reimbursement. The foregoing reimbursement of"
"2379","costs and expenses shall exclude distribution and service"
"2380","fees, brokerage commissions, short sale dividend and interest"
"2381","expense, taxes, organizational expenses and extraordinary"
"2382","expenses (as determined by the Board of the Trustees of the"
"2383","Fund in the exercise of its business judgment)."
"2384","SECTION 6.	Indemnification."
"2385","      (a)	The Trust hereby agrees to indemnify"
"2386","the Adviser and each of the Adviser s partners, officers,"
"2387","employees, and agents (including any individual who serves"
"2388","at the Adviser s request as director, officer, partner,"
"2389","trustee or the like of another corporation) and controlling"
"2390","persons (each such person being an  Indemnitee ) against"
"2391","any liabilities and expenses, including amounts paid in"
"2392","satisfaction of judgments, in compromise or as fines and"
"2393","penalties, and counsel fees (all as provided in accordance"
"2394","with applicable state law) reasonably incurred by such"
"2395","Indemnitee in connection with the defense or disposition of"
"2396","any action, suit or other proceeding, whether civil or"
"2397","criminal, before any court or administrative or investigative"
"2398","body in which he may be or may have been involved as a"
"2399","party or otherwise or with which he may be or may"
"2400","have been threatened, while acting in any capacity set forth"
"2401","above in this paragraph or thereafter by reason of his having"
"2402","acted in any such capacity, except with respect to any matter"
"2403","as to which he shall have been adjudicated not to have"
"2404","acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that his action"
"2405","was in the best interest of the Trust and furthermore, in the"
"2406","case of any criminal proceeding, so long as he had no"
"2407","reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was"
"2408","unlawful, provided, however, that (1) no Indemnitee shall be"
"2409","indemnified hereunder against any liability to the Trust or its"
"2410","shareholders or any expense of such Indemnitee arising by"
"2411","reason of (i) willful misfeasance, (ii) bad faith, (iii)"
"2412","gross negligence (iv) reckless disregard of the duties"
"2413","involved in the conduct of his position (the conduct"
"2414","referred to in such clauses (i) through (iv) being"
"2415","sometimes referred to herein as  Disabling Conduct ), (2) as"
"2416","to any matter disposed of by settlement or a compromise"
"2417","payment by such Indemnitee, pursuant to a consent decree or"
"2418","otherwise, no indemnification either for said payment or"
"2419","for any other expenses shall be provided unless there has"
"2420","been a determination that such settlement or compromise is"
"2421","in the best interests of the Trust and that such Indemnitee"
"2422","appears to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief"
"2423","that his action was in the best interests of the Trust and did"
"2424","not involve Disabling Conduct by such Indemnitee and (3)"
"2425","with respect to any action, suit or other proceeding"
"2426","voluntarily prosecuted by any Indemnitee as plaintiff,"
"2427","indemnification shall be mandatory only if the prosecution"
"2428","of such action, suit or other proceeding by such Indemnitee"
"2429","was authorized by a majority of the full Board of Trustees of"
"2430","the Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust shall not"
"2431","be obligated to provide any such indemnification to the"
"2432","extent such provision would waive any right that the Trust"
"2433","cannot lawfully waive."
"2434","      (b)	The Trust shall make advance payments in"
"2435","connection with the expenses of defending any action with"
"2436","respect to which indemnification might be sought hereunder"
"2437","if the Trust receives a written affirmation of the Indemnitee s"
"2438","good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for"
"2439","indemnification has been met and a written undertaking to"
"2440","reimburse the Trust unless it is subsequently determined that"
"2441","he is entitled to such indemnification and if the Trustees of"
"2442","the Trust determine that the facts then known to them would"
"2443","not preclude indemnification. In addition, at least one of"
"2444","the following conditions must be met: (1) the Indemnitee"
"2445","shall provide adequate security for his undertaking, (2) the"
"2446","Trust shall be insured against losses arising by reason of any"
"2447","lawful advances, (3) a majority of a quorum of Trustees of"
"2448","the Trust who are neither  interested persons  of the Trust (as"
"2449","defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) nor parties to the"
"2450","proceeding ( Disinterested Non-Party Trustees ) or an"
"2451","independent legal counsel in a written opinion, shall"
"2452","determine, based on a review of readily available facts (as"
"2453","opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), that there is reason to"
"2454","believe that the Indemnitee ultimately will be found entitled"
"2455","to indemnification or (4) if there is not a Disinterested Non-"
"2456","Party Trustee, Indemnitee provides the written affirmation"
"2457","referred to above."
"2458","      (c)	All determinations with respect to"
"2459","indemnification hereunder shall be made (1) by a final"
"2460","decision on the merits by a court or other body of competent"
"2461","jurisdiction before whom the proceeding was brought that"
"2462","such Indemnitee is not liable by reason of Disabling"
"2463","Conduct or, (2) in the absence of such a decision, by (i) a"
"2464","majority vote of a quorum of the Disinterested Non-Party"
"2465","Trustees of the Trust, or (ii) if such a quorum is not"
"2466","obtainable or even if obtainable, if a majority vote of"
"2467","such quorum so directs, independent legal counsel in a"
"2468","written opinion."
"2469","      (d)	Each Indemnitee shall, in the performance of"
"2470","its duties, be fully and completely justified and protected with"
"2471","regard to any act or any failure to act resulting from reliance"
"2472","in good faith upon the books of account or other records of"
"2473","the Trust, upon an opinion of counsel, or upon reports made"
"2474","to the Trust by any of the Trust s officers or employees or by"
"2475","any advisor, administrator, manager, distributor, selected"
"2476","dealer, accountant, appraiser or other expert or consultant"
"2477","selected with reasonable care by the Trustees, officers or"
"2478","employees of the Trust, regardless of whether such counsel or"
"2479","other person may also be a Trustee."
"2480","      (e)	The rights accruing to any Indemnitee under"
"2481","these provisions shall not exclude any other right to which he"
"2482","may be lawfully entitled."
"2483","SECTION 7.	Relations with Fund."
"2484","      Subject to and in accordance with the organizational"
"2485","documents of the Adviser and the Trust, as well as their"
"2486","policies and procedures and codes of ethics, it is understood"
"2487","that Trustees, officers, agents and shareholders of the Fund"
"2488","are or may be interested in the Adviser (or any successor"
"2489","thereof) as directors, officers or otherwise, that partners,"
"2490","officers and agents of the Adviser (or any successor thereof)"
"2491","are or may be interested in the Fund as Trustees, officers,"
"2492","agents, shareholders or otherwise, and that the Adviser (or"
"2493","any such successor thereof) is or may be interested in the"
"2494","Fund as a shareholder or otherwise."
"2495","SECTION 8.	Liability of Adviser."
"2496","      The Adviser shall not be liable to the Fund for any"
"2497","error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered"
"2498","by the Fund in connection with the matters to which this"
"2499","Agreement relates; provided, however, that no provision of"
"2500","this Agreement shall be deemed to protect the Adviser"
"2501","against any liability to the Fund or its shareholders to"
"2502","which it might otherwise be subject by reason of any"
"2503","Disabling Conduct nor shall any provision hereof be deemed"
"2504","to protect any trustee or officer of the Fund against any such"
"2505","liability to which he might otherwise be subject by reason of"
"2506","any Disabling Conduct."
"2507","SECTION 9.	Duration and Termination of this"
"2508","Agreement."
"2509","      (a) Duration. This Agreement shall become"
"2510","effective on the date first set forth above, such date being"
"2511","the date on which this Agreement has been executed"
"2512","following: (1) the approval of the Trust s Board of Trustees,"
"2513","including approval by a vote of a majority of the Trustees"
"2514","who are not  interested persons  (as defined in the 1940"
"2515","Act) of the Adviser or the Fund, cast in person at a"

"2546","      (c)	Termination.  This Agreement may be"

"2553","      (d)	Automatic Termination.  This Agreement"
"2554","shall automatically and immediately terminate in the event of"

"2556","SECTION 10.	Services Not Exclusive."
"2557","      The services of the Adviser to the Fund hereunder"
"2558","are not to be deemed exclusive, and the Adviser (and its"
"2559","affiliates) shall be free to render similar services to others"
"2560","so long as its services hereunder are not impaired thereby;"
"2561","provided, however, that the Adviser will undertake no"
"2562","activities that, in its reasonable good faith judgment, will"
"2563","adversely affect the performance of its obligations under this"
"2564","Agreement. In addition, the parties may enter into other"
"2565","agreements pursuant to which the Adviser provides"
"2566","administrative or other, non-investment advisory services to"
"2567","the Fund, and the Adviser may be compensated for such"
"2568","other services."
"2569","SECTION 11.	Notices."
"2570","      Notices under this Agreement shall be in writing and"
"2571","shall be addressed, and delivered or mailed postage prepaid,"

"2579","      This Agreement shall be construed in accordance"

"2582","of the State of Delaware, or any of the provisions herein,"
"2583","conflict with applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, the"
"2584","latter shall control. If any provision of this Agreement shall"
"2585","be held or made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or"
"2586","otherwise, the remainder of this Agreement shall not be"
"2587","affected thereby. This Agreement may be executed in any"
"2588","number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be"
"2589","an original, but such counterparts shall, together, constitute"
"2590","only one instrument."
"2591","SECTION 13.	Miscellaneous."
"2592","      The Adviser agrees to advise the Fund of any"
"2593","change of its membership (which shall mean its general"

"2597","Act) of the Adviser, it agrees to give the Fund the lesser"

"2637","between Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors, L.P."
"2638","(formerly, Pyxis Capital, L.P., and formerly Highland Funds"

"2642","(the  Trust ), on behalf of its series listed on Exhibit A"
"2643","attached hereto and made a part hereof, as such Exhibit A"
"2644","may be amended from time to time (each a  Fund )."
"2645","      WHEREAS, the Adviser, the Trust and the Fund were"
"2646","each renamed, as stated above, as of February 8, 2013 and as"
"2647","of January 9, 2012;"
"2648","      WHEREAS, these changes did not arise from or"

"2652","as such under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as"

"2654","      WHEREAS, the Adviser is engaged principally in the"
"2655","business of rendering investment management services and is"
"2656","registered as an investment adviser under the Investment"
"2657","Advisers Act of 1940, as amended;"
"2658","      NOW, THEREFORE, WITNESSETH: That it is"
"2659","hereby agreed between the parties hereto that this Agreement"
"2660","be amended and restated as of February 8, 2013 pursuant to"
"2661","Section 9(b) hereof as follows:"
"2662","      SECTION 1.	Appointment of Adviser."
"2663","      The Trust hereby appoints the Adviser to act as"
"2664","manager and investment adviser to each Fund for the period"
"2665","and on the terms herein set forth. The Adviser accepts such"
"2666","appointment and agrees to render the services herein set"
"2667","forth, for the compensation herein provided."
"2668","      SECTION 2.	Duties of Adviser."
"2669","      The Adviser, at its own expense, shall furnish the"
"2670","following services and facilities to each Fund:"
"2671","      (a)	Investment Program. The Adviser"
"2672","shall (i) furnish continuously an investment program"
"2673","for each Fund, (ii) determine (subject to the overall"
"2674","supervision and review of the Trust s Board of"
"2675","Trustees) the investments to be purchased, held, sold"
"2676","or exchanged by each Fund and the portion, if any, of"
"2677","the assets of the Fund to be held uninvested,"
"2678","(iii) make changes in the investments of a Fund and"
"2679","(iv) vote, exercise consents and exercise all other"
"2680","rights pertaining to such investments.  The Adviser"
"2681","also shall manage, supervise and conduct the other"
"2682","affairs and business of each Fund and matters"
"2683","incidental thereto pursuant to a separate"
"2684","administration agreement with the Trust, subject"
"2685","always to the control of the Trust s Board of Trustees,"
"2686","and to the provisions of the organizational documents"
"2687","of the Trust, the Registration Statement of the Trust"
"2688","with respect to each Fund and its shares of beneficial"
"2689","interest ( Shares ), including each Fund s"
"2690","prospectus(es) and statement of additional"
"2691","information, and the 1940 Act, in each case as from"
"2692","time to time amended and in effect. Subject to the"
"2693","foregoing, the Adviser shall have the authority to"
"2694","engage one or more sub-advisers in connection with"
"2695","the portfolio management of a Fund, which sub-"
"2696","advisers may be affiliates of the Adviser; provided,"
"2697","however, that the Adviser shall remain responsible to"
"2698","the Trust with respect to its duties and obligations on"
"2699","behalf of each Fund set forth in this Agreement."
"2700","      (b)	Portfolio Transactions. The Adviser"
"2701","shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of"
"2702","portfolio securities for the account of each Fund with"
"2703","brokers or dealers selected by the Adviser, although"
"2704","the Fund will pay the actual brokerage commissions"
"2705","on portfolio transactions in accordance with"
"2706","Section 3(d)."
"2707","      In placing portfolio transactions for a Fund, it is"
"2708","recognized that the Adviser will give primary consideration"
"2709","to securing the most favorable price and efficient execution."
"2710","Consistent with this policy, the Adviser may consider the"
"2711","financial responsibility, research and investment information"
"2712","and other services provided by brokers or dealers who may"
"2713","effect or be a party to any such transaction or other"
"2714","transactions to which other clients of the Adviser may be a"
"2715","party. It is understood that neither the Fund nor the Adviser"
"2716","has adopted a formula for allocation of a Fund s investment"
"2717","transaction business. It is also understood that it is desirable"
"2718","for the Funds that the Adviser have access to supplemental"
"2719","investment and market research and security and economic"
"2720","analysis provided by brokers who may execute brokerage"
"2721","transactions at a higher cost to a Fund than would otherwise"
"2722","result when allocating brokerage transactions to other brokers"
"2723","on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient"
"2724","execution. Therefore, subject to Section 28(e) of the"
"2725","Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Adviser is authorized to"
"2726","place orders for the purchase and sale of securities for a Fund"
"2727","with such brokers, subject to review by the Trust s Board of"
"2728","Trustees from time to time with respect to the extent and"
"2729","continuation of this practice. It is understood that the services"
"2730","provided by such brokers may be useful or beneficial to the"
"2731","Adviser in connection with its services to other clients."
"2732","      On occasions when the Adviser deems the purchase"
"2733","or sale of a security to be in the best interest of a Fund as"
"2734","well as other clients, the Adviser, to the extent permitted by"
"2735","applicable laws and regulations, may, but shall be under no"
"2736","obligation to, aggregate the securities to be so sold or"
"2737","purchased in order to obtain the most favorable price or"
"2738","lower brokerage commissions and efficient execution. In"
"2739","such event, allocation of the securities so purchased or sold,"
"2740","as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be"
"2741","made by the Adviser in the manner it considers to be the"
"2742","most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to"
"2743","the Fund and to such other clients."
"2744","      SECTION 3.	Allocation of Expenses."
"2745","      Except for the services and facilities to be provided"
"2746","by the Adviser pursuant to a separate administration"
"2747","agreement with the Trust, each Fund assumes and shall pay"
"2748","all expenses for all other Fund operations and activities, and"
"2749","shall reimburse the Adviser for any such expenses incurred"
"2750","by the Adviser. Unless the prospectus(es) or statement(s) of"
"2751","additional information of the Fund provides otherwise, the"
"2752","expenses to be borne by a Fund shall include, without"
"2753","limitation:"
"2754","      (a)	all expenses of organizing the Fund;"
"2755","      (b)	the charges and expenses of any"

"2759","portfolio securities and other property, including the"
"2760","costs of servicing shareholder investment accounts,"
"2761","and bookkeeping, accounting and pricing services"
"2762","provided to the Fund (other than those utilized by the"
"2763","Adviser in providing the services described in"
"2764","Section 2);"
"2765","      (c)	the charges and expenses of"
"2766","bookkeeping, accounting and auditors;"
"2767","      (d)	brokerage commissions and other costs"
"2768","incurred in connection with transactions in the"
"2769","portfolio securities of the Fund, including any portion"
"2770","of such commissions attributable to brokerage and"
"2771","research services as defined in Section 28(e) of the"
"2772","Securities Exchange Act of 1934;"
"2773","      (e)	taxes, including issuance and transfer"
"2774","taxes, and trust registration, filing or other fees"
"2775","payable by the Fund to federal, state or other"
"2776","governmental agencies;"
"2777","      (f)	expenses, including the cost of printing"
"2778","certificates, relating to the issuance of Shares of the"
"2779","Fund;"
"2780","      (g)	expenses involved in registering and"
"2781","maintaining registrations of the Fund and of its Shares"
"2782","with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC"
"2783",") and various states and other jurisdictions, including"
"2784","reimbursement of actual expenses incurred by the"
"2785","Adviser or others in performing such functions for the"
"2786","Fund, and including compensation of persons who are"
"2787","employees of the Adviser, in proportion to the"
"2788","relative time spent on such matters;"
"2789","      (h)	expenses of shareholders  and trustees"
"2790","meetings, including meetings of committees, and of"
"2791","preparing, printing and mailing proxy statements,"
"2792","quarterly reports, if any, semi-annual reports, annual"
"2793","reports and other communications to existing"
"2794","shareholders;"
"2795","(i)	expenses of preparing and printing"
"2796","prospectuses and marketing materials;"
"2797","      (j)	compensation and expenses of trustees"
"2798","who are not affiliated with the Adviser;"
"2799","      (k)	charges and expenses of legal counsel"
"2800","in connection with matters relating to the Fund,"
"2801","including, without limitation, legal services rendered"
"2802","in connection with the Fund s trust and financial"

"2804","of Shares of the Fund and registration and"

"2812","expense of obtaining and maintaining a fidelity bond"
"2813","as required by Section 17(g) of the 1940 Act which"
"2814","may also cover the Adviser;"
"2815","      (n)	expenses incurred in obtaining and"
"2816","maintaining any surety bond or similar coverage with"
"2817","respect to securities of the Fund;"
"2818","      (o)	interest payable on Fund borrowings;"
"2819","      (p)	such other non-recurring expenses of"
"2820","the Fund as may arise, including expenses of actions,"
"2821","suits or proceedings to which the Trust on behalf of"
"2822","the Fund is a party and expenses resulting from the"
"2823","legal obligation that the Trust on behalf of the Fund"
"2824","may have to provide indemnity with respect thereto;"
"2825","      (q)	expenses and fees reasonably"
"2826","incidental to any of the foregoing specifically"
"2827","identified expenses; and"
"2828","      (r)	all other expenses permitted by the"
"2829","prospectus(es) and statement of additional"
"2830","information of the Fund as being paid by the Fund."
"2831","      SECTION 4.	Advisory Fee."
"2832","      In return for its advisory services, each Fund will pay"
"2833","the Adviser a monthly fee, computed and accrued daily,"
"2834","based on an annual rate set forth in Exhibit A hereto of each"
"2835","Fund s  Average Daily Managed Assets.   Average Daily"
"2836","Managed Assets  of a Fund shall mean the average daily"
"2837","value of the total assets of the Fund, less all accrued"
"2838","liabilities of the Fund (other than the aggregate amount of"
"2839","any outstanding borrowings constituting financial leverage)."
"2840","The Adviser may waive a portion of its fees. If this"
"2841","Agreement becomes effective subsequent to the first day of a"
"2842","month or shall terminate before the last day of a month,"
"2843","compensation for such month shall be computed in a manner"
"2844","consistent with the calculation of the fees payable on a"
"2845","monthly basis. Subject to the provisions of Section 5 below,"
"2846","the accrued fees will be payable monthly as promptly as"
"2847","possible after the end of each month during which this"
"2848","Agreement is in effect."
"2849","      SECTION 5.	Reimbursements."
"2850","      The parties agree that they may negotiate from time"
"2851","to time for the Adviser to reimburse certain costs and"
"2852","expenses of a Fund. If such an agreement is in effect, the"
"2853","determination of whether reimbursement for such costs and"
"2854","expenses is due a Fund from the Adviser will be made on an"
"2855","accrual basis once monthly, and if it is so determined that"
"2856","such reimbursement is due, the accrued amount of such"
"2857","reimbursement that is due shall serve as an offset to the"
"2858","investment advisory fee payable monthly by the Fund to the"
"2859","Adviser pursuant to Section 4 hereof, and the amount to be"
"2860","paid by the Adviser to the Fund as soon as is practicable at"
"2861","the end of a fiscal year of the Fund shall be equal to the"
"2862","difference between the aggregate reimbursement due the"
"2863","Fund from the Adviser for that fiscal year and the aggregate"
"2864","offsets made by the Fund against the aggregate investment"
"2865","advisory fees payable to the Adviser pursuant to Section 4"
"2866","hereof for that fiscal year by virtue of such aggregate"
"2867","reimbursement. The foregoing reimbursement of costs and"
"2868","expenses shall exclude distribution and service fees,"
"2869","brokerage commissions, short sale dividend and interest"
"2870","expense, taxes, organizational expenses and extraordinary"
"2871","expenses (as determined by the Board of the Trustees of the"
"2872","Fund in the exercise of its business judgment)."
"2873","      SECTION 6.	Indemnification."
"2874","      (a)	The Trust hereby agrees to indemnify the"
"2875","Adviser and each of the Adviser s partners, officers,"
"2876","employees, and agents (including any individual who serves"
"2877","at the Adviser s request as director, officer, partner, trustee or"
"2878","the like of another corporation) and controlling persons (each"
"2879","such person being an  Indemnitee ) against any liabilities and"
"2880","expenses, including amounts paid in satisfaction of"
"2881","judgments, in compromise or as fines and penalties, and"
"2882","counsel fees (all as provided in accordance with applicable"
"2883","state law) reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in"
"2884","connection with the defense or disposition of any action, suit"
"2885","or other proceeding, whether civil or criminal, before any"
"2886","court or administrative or investigative body in which he may"
"2887","be or may have been involved as a party or otherwise or with"
"2888","which he may be or may have been threatened, while acting"
"2889","in any capacity set forth above in this paragraph or thereafter"
"2890","by reason of his having acted in any such capacity, except"
"2891","with respect to any matter as to which he shall have been"
"2892","adjudicated not to have acted in good faith in the reasonable"
"2893","belief that his action was in the best interest of the Trust and"
"2894","furthermore, in the case of any criminal proceeding, so long"
"2895","as he had no reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was"
"2896","unlawful, provided, however, that (1) no Indemnitee shall be"
"2897","indemnified hereunder against any liability to the Trust or its"
"2898","shareholders or any expense of such Indemnitee arising by"
"2899","reason of (i) willful misfeasance, (ii) bad faith, (iii) gross"
"2900","negligence (iv) reckless disregard of the duties involved in"
"2901","the conduct of his position (the conduct referred to in such"
"2902","clauses (i) through (iv) being sometimes referred to herein as"
"2903","Disabling Conduct ), (2) as to any matter disposed of by"
"2904","settlement or a compromise payment by such Indemnitee,"
"2905","pursuant to a consent decree or otherwise, no indemnification"
"2906","either for said payment or for any other expenses shall be"
"2907","provided unless there has been a determination that such"
"2908","settlement or compromise is in the best interests of the Trust"
"2909","and that such Indemnitee appears to have acted in good faith"
"2910","in the reasonable belief that his action was in the best"
"2911","interests of the Trust and did not involve Disabling Conduct"
"2912","by such Indemnitee and (3) with respect to any action, suit or"
"2913","other proceeding voluntarily prosecuted by any Indemnitee"
"2914","as plaintiff, indemnification shall be mandatory only if the"
"2915","prosecution of such action, suit or other proceeding by such"
"2916","Indemnitee was authorized by a majority of the full Board of"
"2917","Trustees of the Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the"
"2918","Trust shall not be obligated to provide any such"
"2919","indemnification to the extent such provision would waive any"
"2920","right that the Trust cannot lawfully waive."
"2921","      (b)	The Trust shall make advance payments in"
"2922","connection with the expenses of defending any action with"
"2923","respect to which indemnification might be sought hereunder"
"2924","if the Trust receives a written affirmation of the Indemnitee s"
"2925","good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for"
"2926","indemnification has been met and a written undertaking to"
"2927","reimburse the Trust unless it is subsequently determined that"
"2928","he is entitled to such indemnification and if the Trustees of"
"2929","the Trust determine that the facts then known to them would"
"2930","not preclude indemnification. In addition, at least one of the"
"2931","following conditions must be met: (1) the Indemnitee shall"
"2932","provide adequate security for his undertaking, (2) the Trust"
"2933","shall be insured against losses arising by reason of any lawful"
"2934","advances, (3) a majority of a quorum of Trustees of the Trust"
"2935","who are neither  interested persons  of the Trust (as defined"
"2936","in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) nor parties to the"
"2937","proceeding ( Disinterested Non-Party Trustees ) or an"
"2938","independent legal counsel in a written opinion, shall"
"2939","determine, based on a review of readily available facts (as"
"2940","opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), that there is reason to"
"2941","believe that the Indemnitee ultimately will be found entitled"
"2942","to indemnification or (4) if there is not a Disinterested Non-"
"2943","Party Trustee, Indemnitee provides the written affirmation"
"2944","referred to above."
"2945","      (c)	All determinations with respect to"
"2946","indemnification hereunder shall be made (1) by a final"
"2947","decision on the merits by a court or other body of competent"
"2948","jurisdiction before whom the proceeding was brought that"
"2949","such Indemnitee is not liable by reason of Disabling Conduct"
"2950","or, (2) in the absence of such a decision, by (i) a majority"
"2951","vote of a quorum of the Disinterested Non-Party Trustees of"
"2952","the Trust, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable or even if"
"2953","obtainable, if a majority vote of such quorum so directs,"
"2954","independent legal counsel in a written opinion."
"2955","      (d)	Each Indemnitee shall, in the performance of"
"2956","its duties, be fully and completely justified and protected"
"2957","with regard to any act or any failure to act resulting from"
"2958","reliance in good faith upon the books of account or other"

"2970","      Subject to and in accordance with the organizational"
"2971","documents of the Adviser and the Trust, as well as their"
"2972","policies and procedures and codes of ethics, it is understood"
"2973","that Trustees, officers, agents and shareholders of a Fund are"

"2982","      The Adviser shall not be liable to a Fund for any error"
"2983","of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the"
"2984","Fund in connection with the matters to which this Agreement"

"2993","      SECTION 9.	Duration and Termination of this"
"2994","Agreement."
"2995","      (a)	Duration. This Agreement shall become"
"2996","effective with respect to the initial Funds on Exhibit A on the"
"2997","date first set forth above, such date being the date on which"
"2998","this Agreement has been executed following: (1) the approval"
"2999","of the Trust s Board of Trustees, including approval by a vote"
"3000","of a majority of the Trustees who are not  interested persons"
"3001","(as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Adviser or the Funds, cast"
"3002","in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on"
"3003","such approval; and (2) the approval by a  vote of a majority"
"3004","of the outstanding voting securities  (as defined in the 1940"
"3005","Act) of each Fund. Unless terminated as herein provided, this"
"3006","Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until the date"
"3007","that is two years after the effective date of this Agreement."
"3008","Subsequent to such initial period of effectiveness, this"
"3009","Agreement shall continue in full force and effect, subject to"
"3010","paragraph 9(c), so long as such continuance is approved at"
"3011","least annually (a) by either the Trust s Board of Trustees or"
"3012","by a  vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities"
"3013","(as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund and (b) in either"
"3014","event, by the vote of a majority of the Trustees of the Fund"
"3015","who are not parties to this Agreement or  interested persons"
"3016","(as defined in the 1940 Act) of any such party, cast in person"
"3017","at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such"
"3018","approval.  With respect to each new Fund added to the"
"3019","Agreement on or after the initial effective date, each such"
"3020","Fund shall have an initial term of up to two years beginning"
"3021","on the date indicated on Exhibit A and thereafter, if not"
"3022","terminated, shall continue in effect if approved at least"
"3023","annually as set forth above."
"3024","      (b)	Amendment. No provision of this Agreement"
"3025","may be amended, waived, discharged or terminated orally,"
"3026","but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party"
"3027","against which enforcement of the amendment, waiver,"
"3028","discharge or termination is sought. Any amendment of this"
"3029","Agreement shall be subject to the 1940 Act including the"
"3030","interpretation thereof that amendments that do not increase"
"3031","the compensation of the Adviser or otherwise fundamentally"
"3032","alter the relationship of the Trust with the Adviser do not"
"3033","require shareholder approval if approved by the requisite"
"3034","majority of the Trust s Trustees who are not  interested"
"3035","persons  (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Trust."
"3036","      (c)	Termination. This Agreement may be"
"3037","terminated at any time, without payment of any penalty, by"

"3040","the 1940 Act) of the Funds, or by the Adviser, in each case"
"3041","on not more than 60 days  nor less than 30 days  prior written"
"3042","notice to the other party."
"3043","      (d)	Automatic Termination. This Agreement shall"
"3044","automatically and immediately terminate in the event of its"
"3045","assignment  (as defined in the 1940 Act)."

"3047","      The services of the Adviser to each Fund hereunder"
"3048","are not to be deemed exclusive, and the Adviser (and its"
"3049","affiliates) shall be free to render similar services to others so"
"3050","long as its services hereunder are not impaired thereby;"
"3051","provided, however, that the Adviser will undertake no"
"3052","activities that, in its reasonable good faith judgment, will"
"3053","adversely affect the performance of its obligations under this"
"3054","Agreement. In addition, the parties may enter into other"
"3055","agreements pursuant to which the Adviser provides"
"3056","administrative or other, non-investment advisory services to a"
"3057","Fund, and the Adviser may be compensated for such other"
"3058","services."
"3059","      SECTION 11.	Notices."
"3060","      Notices under this Agreement shall be in writing and"
"3061","shall be addressed, and delivered or mailed postage prepaid,"
"3062","to the other party at such address as such other party may"

"3064","Until further notice to the other party, the address of each"

"3069","      This Agreement shall be construed in accordance"
"3070","with the laws of the State of Delaware and the applicable"
"3071","provisions of the 1940 Act. To the extent that applicable law"
"3072","of the State of Delaware, or any of the provisions herein,"
"3073","conflict with applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, the latter"
"3074","shall control. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held"
"3075","or made invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or"
"3076","otherwise, the remainder of this Agreement shall not be"
"3077","affected thereby. This Agreement may be executed in any"
"3078","number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be"
"3079","an original, but such counterparts shall, together, constitute"
"3080","only one instrument."
"3081","      SECTION 13.	Miscellaneous."
"3082","      The Adviser agrees to advise each Fund of any"
"3083","change of its membership (which shall mean its general"
"3084","partner) within a reasonable time after such change. If the"
"3085","Adviser enters into a definitive agreement that would result"
"3086","in a change of control (within the meaning of the 1940 Act)"
"3087","of the Adviser, it agrees to give each Fund the lesser of"
"3088","60 days  written notice and such notice as is reasonably"
"3089","practicable before consummating the transaction."
"3090","      Where the effect of a requirement of the 1940 Act"
"3091","reflected in or contemplated by any provisions of this"
"3092","Agreement is altered by a rule, regulation or order of the"
"3093","SEC, whether of special or general application, such"
"3094","provision shall be deemed to incorporate the effect of such"
"3095","rule, regulation or order."

"3136","Firm"
"3137","To the Board of Trustees of Highland Funds I and"
"3138","Shareholders of Highland Long/Short Equity Fund (formerly,"
"3139","Pyxis Long/Short Equity Fund), Highland Long/Short"
"3140","Healthcare Fund (formerly, Pyxis Long/Short Healthcare"
"3141","Fund), and Highland Floating Rate Opportunities Fund"
"3142","(formerly, Pyxis Floating Rate Opportunities Fund):"
"3143","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"3144","statements of Highland Long/Short Equity Fund (formerly,"
"3145","Pyxis Long/Short Equity Fund), Highland Long/Short"
"3146","Healthcare Fund (formerly, Pyxis Long/Short Healthcare"
"3147","Fund), and Highland Floating Rate Opportunities Fund"
"3148","(formerly, Pyxis Floating Rate Opportunities Fund) (the"
"3149","Funds) (three of the funds constituting Highland Funds I"
"3150","(formerly Pyxis Funds I) (the Trust) as of and for the year"
"3151","ended June 30, 2013 in accordance with the standards of the"
"3152","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"3153","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3154","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"3155","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"3156","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"3157","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"3158","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"3159","Funds' internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"3160","we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"3161","Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"3162","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"3163","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"3164","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"3165","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"3166","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's"
"3167","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed"
"3168","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"3169","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"3170","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"3171","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"3172","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"3173","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"3174","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"3175","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"3176","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"3177","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"3178","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"3179","and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"3180","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"3181","of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"3182","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"3183","or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"3184","effect on the financial statements."
"3185","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"3186","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"3187","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"3188","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3189","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"3190","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"3191","deteriorate."
"3192","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"3193","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"3194","management or employees, in the normal course of"
"3195","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3196","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"3197","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"3198","over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"3199","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"3200","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"3201","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3202","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3203","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"3204","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"3205","in internal control over financial reporting that might be"
"3206","material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"3207","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"3208","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal"
"3209","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"3210","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be"
"3211","material weaknesses as defined above as of June 30, 2013."
"3212","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"3213","management and the Board of Trustees of the Trust and the"
"3214","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to"
