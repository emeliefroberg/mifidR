"1482","August 31, 2010, in accordance with the"
"1483","standards of the Public Company"
"1484","Accounting Oversight Board (United"

"1486","control over financial reporting, including"
"1487","controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"1488","basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"1489","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1490","the financial statements and to comply with"
"1491","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"1492","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1493","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal"
"1494","control over financial reporting."
"1495","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1496","The management of the Trust is responsible"
"1497","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"1498","internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"1499","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1500","judgments by management are required to"
"1501","assess the expected benefits and related"
"1502","costs of controls.  A trust's internal control"
"1503","over financial reporting is a process designed"
"1504","to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1505","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1506","preparation of financial statements for"
"1507","external purposes in accordance with"
"1508","generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1509","trust's internal control over financial"
"1510","reporting includes those policies and"

"1512","maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1513","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1514","transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"1515","the trust; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"1516","that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1517","permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1518","accordance with generally accepted"
"1519","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1520","expenditures of the trust are being made"
"1521","only in accordance with authorizations of"

"1523","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1524","prevention or timely detection of"
"1525","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition"
"1526","of a trust's assets that could have a material"
"1527","effect on the financial statements."
"1528","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"

"1533","the risk that controls may become"
"1534","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"1535","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1536","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1537","A deficiency in internal control over"

"1540","management or employees, in the normal"
"1541","course of performing their assigned"
"1542","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"1543","on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1544","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"1545","in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1546","such that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"1547","a material misstatement of a trust's annual or"
"1548","interim financial statements will not be"
"1549","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1550","Our consideration of the Trust's internal"
"1551","control over financial reporting was for the"
