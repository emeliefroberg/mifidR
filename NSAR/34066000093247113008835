"572","<TEXT>"
"573","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"574","Firm"
"575","To the Board of Trustees and the Shareholders of Vanguard"
"576","Explorer Fund"
"577","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"578","of Vanguard Explorer Fund (the ?Fund?) as of and for the year"
"579","ended October 31, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the"
"580","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"581","considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"582","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"583","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"584","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"585","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"586","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"587","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express"
"588","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"589","over financial reporting."
"590","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"591","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"592","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"593","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"594","related costs of controls.  A company?s internal control over"
"595","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"596","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"597","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"598","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"599","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"600","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"601","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"602","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"603","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"604","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"605","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"606","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"607","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"608","trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"609","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"610","acquisition, use or disposition of a company?s assets that could"
"611","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"612","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"613","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"614","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"615","are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"616","because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"617","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"618","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"619","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"620","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"621","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"622","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"623","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"624","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"625","material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial"
"626","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"627","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"628","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"629","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"630","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"631","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"632","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"633","no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"634","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"635","securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"636","above as of October 31, 2013."
"637","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"638","management and the Board of Trustees of Vanguard Explorer"
"639","Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"640","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"641","these specified parties."

"749","Prospectus Text Changes"
"750","In the More on the Fund section, the text in the ?Plain Talk About Fund"
"751","Expenses? is restated as follows:"
"752","All mutual funds have operating expenses. These expenses, which are deducted"
"753","from a fund?s gross income, are expressed as a percentage of the net assets of"
"754","the fund. Assuming that operating expenses remain as stated in the Fees and"
"755","Expenses section, Vanguard Explorer Fund?s expense ratios would be as"
"756","follows: for Investor Shares, 0.51%, or $5.10 per $1,000 of average net assets;"
"757","for Admiral Shares, 0.34%, or $3.40 per $1,000 of average net assets. The"
"758","average expense ratio for small-cap growth funds in 2012 was 1.47%, or $14.70"
"759","per $1,000 of average net assets (derived from data provided by Lipper Inc.,"
"760","which reports on the mutual fund industry)."
"761","In the More on the Fund section, under ?Security Selection,? the following"
"762","is added:"
"763","Stephens Investment Management Group, LLC (SIMG), employs a disciplined,"
"764","bottom-up investment selection process that combines rigorous fundamental"
"765","analysis with quantitative screening in an effort to identify companies that"
"766","exhibit potential for superior earnings growth that is unrecognized by the"
"767","markets. SIMG has two screens?one for core growth stocks and one for"
"768","catalyst stocks. Core growth stocks have strong growth franchises, recurring"
"769","revenue, and above-average growth rates; catalyst stocks, in comparison, are"
"770","experiencing change that could lead to accelerated earnings growth. While there"
"771","are two screens, there are common elements in both types of stocks that SIMG"
"772","seeks, such as higher forward growth rates, above-median price-to-earnings"
"773","ratios, higher return on equity, and positive earnings revisions."
"774","In the Investment Advisors section, the following is added:"
"775","? Stephens Investment Management Group, LLC, 111 Center Street, Suite 860,"
"776","Little Rock, AR 72201, is an investment advisory firm founded in 2005. As of"
"777","April 30, 2013, SIMG managed approximately $1.5 billion in assets."
"778","Also in the Investment Advisors section, the following replaces similar text:"
"779","The Fund pays each of its investment advisors (other than Vanguard) a base fee"
"780","plus or minus a performance adjustment. Each base fee, which is paid quarterly,"
"781","is a percentage of average daily net assets managed by the advisor during the"
"782","most recent fiscal quarter. The base fee has breakpoints, which means that the"
"783","percentage declines as assets go up. The performance adjustment, also paid"
"784","quarterly, is based on the cumulative total return of each advisor?s portion of"
"785","the Fund relative to that of the Russell 2500 Growth Index (for Kalmar, SIMG,"
"786","and Wellington Management), the Russell 2000 Growth Index (for Chartwell), a"
"787","50/50 blend of the Russell 2000 Growth Index and the Russell 2500 Growth"
"788","Index (for Granahan), or a 50/50 blend of the Russell 2500 Index and the Russell"
"789","2500 Growth Index (for Century Capital) over the preceding 36-month period"
"790","(60-month period for SIMG). When the performance adjustment is positive, the"
"791","Fund?s expenses increase; when it is negative, expenses decrease. Vanguard"
"792","provides investment advisory services to the Fund on an at-cost basis."
"793","Also in the Investment Advisors section, the following is added to the list of"
"794","managers primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund:"
"795","Ryan E. Crane, CFA, Chief Investment Officer of SIMG. He has worked in"
"796","investment management since 1995; has been with SIMG since 2005; and has"
"797","managed a portion of the Fund since 2013."
"798","CFA? is a trademark owned by CFA Institute."
"799","? 2013 The Vanguard Group, Inc. All rights reserved."
"800","Vanguard Marketing Corporation, Distributor. PS 24 082013"
