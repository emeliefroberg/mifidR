"1027","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1028","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"1029","Direxion Funds"
"1030","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund (Consolidated) and Direxion Indexed CVT Strategy Fund (the &#147;Funds&#148;), which comprise the Direxion Funds as of and for the period ended October 31, 2017, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1031","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. The Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Funds; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Funds are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Funds; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Funds&#146; assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1032","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1033","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds&#146; annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1034","Our consideration of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting and their operations, including controls for safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2017."
"1035","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the Board of Trustees of the Direxion Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1123","       The Direxion Indexed Managed Futures Strategy Fund (the &#147;Fund&#148;) will close to investments as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on October 13, 2017 (the &#147;Closing Date&#148;) (except for reinvested dividend or capital gains distributions). The Fund&#146;s assets will be converted to cash or cash equivalents and, as a result, the Fund will no longer pursue its stated investment objective after the close of trading on  October 20, 2017 in order to pursue an  orderly liquidation.  The Fund will be liquidated on October 27, 2017   (the &#147;Liquidation Date&#148;)."
"1124","       Shareholders of the Fund may continue to redeem shares of the Fund on or before the Liquidation Date. Any shareholder who has not redeemed shares of the Fund, or exchanged them for shares of other investment series of the Direxion Funds (the &#147;Trust&#148;) prior to the Liquidation Date will receive a payment representing the shareholder&#146;s proportionate interest in the net assets of the Fund as of the Liquidation Date. Shareholders remaining in the Fund after the Closing Date may bear increased transaction costs incurred in connection with the disposition of the Fund&#146;s portfolio holdings. Such transaction costs would reduce distributable capital gains, if any. Fund shareholders who hold Class A and/or Institutional Class shares will not incur the redemption fee of 1.00% on shares redeemed after the close of trading on the Closing Date. Shareholders who hold Class C shares will not incur the contingent deferred sales charge on shares redeemed after the close of trading on the Closing Date."
"1125","       Exchanges and redemptions will include accrued capital gains and dividends, if any. The redemption, sale or liquidation of your Fund shares will be a taxable event on which you will realize a taxable gain (or loss), to the extent your tax basis in the shares is lower (or higher) than the liquidation proceeds that you receive. If you own Fund shares in a tax-deferred account, such as an individual retirement account, 401(k) plan or 403(b) account, distribution to the account of the liquidation proceeds will not be subject to current income taxation. You should consult your tax adviser about the Fund&#146;s liquidation and its tax consequences to you, if any."
"1126","       Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (&#147;Rafferty&#148;), the Fund&#146;s investment adviser, informed the Board of Trustees (the &#147;Board&#148;) of the Trust of its view that the Fund could not continue to conduct its business and operations in an economically efficient manner over the long term due to the Fund&#146;s inability to attract sufficient investment assets to maintain a competitive operating structure and recommended the Fund&#146;s closure and liquidation to the Board. The Board determined, after considering Rafferty&#146;s recommendation, that it is in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders to liquidate and terminate the Fund as described above."
