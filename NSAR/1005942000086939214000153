"2754","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2755","To the Trustees of Putnam Funds Trust and Shareholders of"
"2756","Putnam Retirement Income Fund Lifestyle 2:"
"2757","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"2758","statements of Putnam Retirement Income Fund Lifestyle 2 (the"
"2759","Fund) as of and for the year ended August 31, 2014, in"
"2760","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"2761","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"2762","the Funds internal control over financial reporting,"
"2763","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"2764","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2765","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"2766","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"2767","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"2768","Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"2769","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"2770","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"2771","reporting."
"2772","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"2773","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"2774","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"2775","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"2776","benefits and related costs of controls.  A funds internal"
"2777","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"2778","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"2779","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"2780","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"2781","generally accepted accounting principles.  A funds internal"
"2782","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"2783","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"2784","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"2785","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"2786","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"2787","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"2788","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2789","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"2790","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"2791","management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"2792","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"2793","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of"
"2794","a funds assets that could have a material effect on the"
"2795","financial statements."
"2796","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2797","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2798","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"2799","future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"2800","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"2801","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"2802","deteriorate."
"2803","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"2804","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"2805","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"2806","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2807","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"2808","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2809","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"2810","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2811","Funds annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"2812","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2813","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"2814","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"2815","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"2816","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting"
"2817","that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"2818","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"2819","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"2820","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"2821","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"2822","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above"
"2823","as of August 31, 2014."
"2824","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"2825","of management and the Board of Trustees of Putnam Retirement"
"2826","Income Fund Lifestyle 2 and the Securities and Exchange"
"2827","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used"

"2899","Meetings of Trustees"
"2900","      2.1  Regular Meetings.  Regular meetings of the Trustees"
"2901","may be held without call or notice at such places and at such"
"2902","times as the Trustees may from time to time determine, provided"
"2903","that notice of the first regular meeting following any such"
"2904","determination shall be given to absent Trustees."
"2905","      2.2  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Trustees"
"2906","may be held at any time and at any place designated in the call"

"2910","each Trustee by the Clerk or an Assistant Clerk or by the"
"2911","officer or the Trustees calling the meeting."
"2912","      2.3  Notice of Special Meetings.  It shall be sufficient"
"2913","notice to a Trustee of a special meeting: (a) to send notice (i)"
"2914","by mail at least forty-eight hours before the meeting, (ii) by"
"2915","courier at least forty-eight hours before the meeting, (iii) by"

"2945","means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear"
"2946","each other at the same time and participation by such means"

"2948","be taken by the Trustees may also be taken without a meeting if"
"2949","one or more written consents thereto are signed by a majority of"
"2950","the Trustees.  Any written consent may be given by mail,"

"2959","execute such written consent, provided that the effectiveness of"
"2960","such action shall not be impaired by any delay or failure to"
"2961","furnish such notice."
"2962","ARTICLE 3"
"2963","Officers"
"2964","      3.1  Enumeration; Qualification.  The officers of the Trust"
"2965","shall be a President, a Treasurer, a Clerk and such other"
"2966","officers (including Vice President, which shall include the"
"2967","office of Executive Vice President), if any, as the Trustees"
"2968","from time to time may in their discretion elect.  The Trust may"
"2969","also have such agents as the Trustees from time to time may in"
"2970","their discretion appoint.  In addition, there shall be a Chair"
"2971","of the Trustees, who will be considered an officer of the"
"2972","Trustees and not of the Trust.  The Chair of the Trustees shall"
"2973","be a Trustee and may but need not be a Shareholder; and any"
"2974","other officer may but need not be a Trustee or a Shareholder."
"2975","Any two or more offices may be held by the same person."
"2976","      3.2  Election.  The Chair of the Trustees, the President,"

"2984","or she dies, resigns, is removed or becomes disqualified.  Each"
"2985","other officer shall hold office, and each agent shall retain"
"2986","authority, at the pleasure of the Trustees. Notwithstanding the"
"2987","foregoing, the tenure of any officer of the Trust who is an"
"2988","employee or officer of the Trusts investment adviser or its"
"2989","affiliates shall automatically terminate contemporaneously with"
"2990","the termination of such persons employment with, or service as"
"2991","officer of, the Trusts investment adviser and all of its"
"2992","affiliates."
"2993","      3.4  Powers.  Subject to the other provisions of these"
"2994","Bylaws, each officer shall have, in addition to the duties and"

"3000","      3.5  Chair.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide, the"

"3004","the Trustees may from time to time designate, but shall have no"
"3005","individual authority to act for the Trust as an officer of the"
"3006","Trust.  The Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who"
"3007","are not interested persons of the Trust, as that term is defined"
"3008","in the 1940 Act, may appoint one or more persons to perform the"
"3009","duties of the Chair of the Trustees in the event of his or her"
"3010","absence at any meeting or in the event of his or her disability."
"3011"," The Chair of the Trustees shall also have the power to appoint"
"3012","one or more persons to perform the duties of the Chair of the"
"3013","Trustees in the event of his or her absence at any meeting."
"3014","      3.6  President.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide by"
"3015","vote or otherwise, the President shall be the principal"

"3065","person at a meeting), or (b) evidenced by one or more written"

"3148","Share certificates.  In that event, each Shareholder shall be"
"3149","entitled to a certificate stating the number of Shares of each"
"3150","class owned by him or her, in such form as shall be prescribed"
"3151","from time to time by the Trustees.  Such certificate shall be"
"3152","signed by the President or a Vice President and by the Treasurer"
"3153","or an Assistant Treasurer.  Such signatures may be facsimile if"
"3154","the certificate is signed by a transfer agent or by a registrar."
"3155"," In case any officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature"
"3156","has been placed on such certificate shall cease to be such"
"3157","officer before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by"
"3158","the Trust with the same effect as if he or she were such officer"
"3159","at the time of its issue."
"3160","      9.3  Loss of Certificates.  The transfer agent of the"
"3161","Trust, with the approval of any two officers of the Trust, is"
"3162","authorized to issue and countersign replacement certificates for"
"3163","the Shares of the Trust which have been lost, stolen or"
"3164","destroyed upon (i) receipt of an affidavit or affidavits of loss"
"3165","or non-receipt and of an indemnity agreement executed by the"
"3166","registered holder or his or her legal representative and"
"3167","supported by an open penalty surety bond, said agreement and"
"3168","said bond in all cases to be in form and content satisfactory to"
"3169","and approved by the President or the Treasurer, or (ii) receipt"
"3170","of such other documents as may be approved by the Trustees."
"3171","      9.4  Issuance of New Certificate to Pledgee.  A pledgee of"
"3172","Shares transferred as collateral security shall be entitled to a"
"3173","new certificate if the instrument of transfer substantially"
"3174","describes the debt or duty that is intended to be secured"
"3175","thereby.  Such new certificate shall express on its face that it"
"3176","is held as collateral security, and the name of the pledgor"
"3177","shall be stated thereon, who alone shall be liable as a"
"3178","Shareholder and entitled to vote thereon."
"3179","      9.5  Discontinuance of Issuance of Certificates.  The"
"3180","Trustees may at any time discontinue the issuance of Share"
"3181","certificates and may, by written notice to each Shareholder whom"
"3182","the Trust believes to hold a Share certificate, require the"
"3183","surrender of Share certificates to the Trust for cancellation."
"3184","Such surrender and cancellation shall not affect the ownership"
"3185","of Shares in the Trust."

"3191","one-tenth of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote at such"

"3193","neglects for more than 30 days to provide such notice, the"
"3194","Trustees or the Shareholders so requesting may, in the name of"
"3195","the Clerk, call the meeting by giving notice thereof in the"

"3482","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"3483","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"3484","Putnam Funds Trust:"
"3485","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"3486","of Putnam Emerging Markets Equity Fund (the Fund), a series of"
"3487","Putnam Funds Trust, as of and for the year ended August 31, 2014,"
"3488","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"3489","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds internal"
"3490","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"3491","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"3492","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"3493","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"3494","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"3495","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"3496","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3497","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"3498","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"3499","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"3500","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"3501","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"3502","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"3503","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"3504","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"3505","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"3506","A companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"3507","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"3508","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"3509","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"3510","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"3511","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"3512","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"3513","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"3514","with authorizations of management and trustees of the company;"
"3515","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"3516","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"3517","of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the"
"3518","financial statements."
"3519","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"3520","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"3521","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"3522","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3523","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"3524","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3525","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"3526","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"3527","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"3528","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"3529","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"3530","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"3531","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"3532","material misstatement of a Funds annual or interim financial"
"3533","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3534","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"3535","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"3536","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"3537","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"3538","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"3539","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"3540","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"3541","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"

"3600","ARTICLE 1"
"3601","Agreement and Declaration of Trust and Principal Office"
"3602","      1.1  Agreement and Declaration of Trust.  These Bylaws shall"
"3603","be subject to the Agreement and Declaration of Trust, as from"
"3604","time to time in effect (the Declaration of Trust), of the"
"3605","Massachusetts business trust established by the Declaration of"
"3606","Trust (the Trust).  Capitalized terms used but not defined in"
"3607","these Bylaws have the meanings given to them in the Declaration"
"3608","of Trust."
"3609","      1.2  Principal Office of the Trust.  The principal office of"
"3610","the Trust shall be located in Boston, Massachusetts.  The Trust"

"3613","time determine."
"3614","ARTICLE 2"
"3615","Meetings of Trustees"
"3616","      2.1  Regular Meetings.  Regular meetings of the Trustees may"
"3617","be held without call or notice at such places and at such times"
"3618","as the Trustees may from time to time determine, provided that"
"3619","notice of the first regular meeting following any such"
"3620","determination shall be given to absent Trustees."
"3621","      2.2  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Trustees may"
"3622","be held at any time and at any place designated in the call of"
"3623","the meeting when called by the Chair of the Trustees, the"
"3624","President, the Executive Vice President or the Treasurer or by"
"3625","two or more Trustees, sufficient notice thereof being given to"
"3626","each Trustee by the Clerk or an Assistant Clerk or by the officer"
"3627","or the Trustees calling the meeting."
"3628","      2.3  Notice of Special Meetings.  It shall be sufficient"
"3629","notice to a Trustee of a special meeting: (a) to send notice (i)"
"3630","by mail at least forty eight hours before the meeting, (ii) by"
"3631","courier at least forty eight hours before the meeting, (iii) by"
"3632","electronic mail (e mail), facsimile or other electronic means at"
"3633","least twenty four hours before the meeting, in each case,"
"3634","addressed to the Trustee at his or her usual or last known"
"3635","business or residence address (or e mail address, facsimile"
"3636","number or other appropriate address); or (b) to give notice to"
"3637","him or her in person or by telephone at least twenty four hours"
"3638","before the meeting.  Notice of a special meeting need not be"
"3639","given to any Trustee if a written waiver of notice, executed by"
"3640","him or her before or after the meeting, is filed with the records"
"3641","of the meeting, or to any Trustee who attends the meeting without"
"3642","protesting before or at its commencement the lack of notice to"
"3643","him or her.  Any written waiver of notice may be provided and"
"3644","delivered to the Trust by mail, courier, e mail, facsimile or"
"3645","other electronic means. Neither notice of a meeting nor a waiver"
"3646","of a notice need specify the purposes of the meeting.  All"
"3647","notices shall be deemed to be given when sent."
"3648","      2.4  Quorum.  At any meeting of the Trustees a majority of"
"3649","the Trustees then in office shall constitute a quorum.  Once a"
"3650","quorum has been validly established for a meeting, it cannot be"
"3651","broken by Trustees withdrawing from the meeting.  Any meeting may"
"3652","be adjourned from time to time by a majority of the votes cast"
"3653","upon the question, whether or not a quorum is present, and the"
"3654","meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice."
"3655","      2.5  Telephone Meeting; Action Without a Meeting.  Except as"
"3656","otherwise provided in the Declaration of Trust and these Bylaws,"
"3657","any action to be taken by the Trustees may be taken by a majority"
"3658","of the Trustees present at the meeting of the Trustees (a quorum"
"3659","being present), including any meeting held by means of a"
"3660","conference telephone or other communications equipment by means"
"3661","of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each"
"3662","other at the same time and participation by such means shall"
"3663","constitute presence in person at a meeting. Any action to be"
"3664","taken by the Trustees may also be taken without a meeting if one"
"3665","or more written consents thereto are signed by a majority of the"
"3666","Trustees.  Any written consent may be given by mail, courier, e"
"3667","mail, facsimile or other electronic means.  Copies of such"
"3668","written consents shall be filed with the minutes of the"
"3669","proceedings of the Trustees.  Such consents shall be treated for"
"3670","all purposes as a vote taken at a meeting of the Trustees.  If in"
"3671","accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Trust and"
"3672","these Bylaws any action is taken by the Trustees by written"
"3673","consents of less than all of the Trustees, then prompt notice of"
"3674","any such action shall be furnished to each Trustee who did not"
"3675","execute such written consent, provided that the effectiveness of"
"3676","such action shall not be impaired by any delay or failure to"
"3677","furnish such notice."

"3679","Officers"
"3680","      3.1  Enumeration; Qualification.  The officers of the Trust"
"3681","shall be a President, a Treasurer, a Clerk and such other"
"3682","officers (including Vice President, which shall include the"
"3683","office of Executive Vice President), if any, as the Trustees from"
"3684","time to time may in their discretion elect.  The Trust may also"
"3685","have such agents as the Trustees from time to time may in their"
"3686","discretion appoint.  In addition, there shall be a Chair of the"
"3687","Trustees, who will be considered an officer of the Trustees and"
"3688","not of the Trust.  The Chair of the Trustees shall be a Trustee"
"3689","and may but need not be a Shareholder; and any other officer may"
"3690","but need not be a Trustee or a Shareholder.  Any two or more"
"3691","offices may be held by the same person."
"3692","      3.2  Election.  The Chair of the Trustees, the President,"
"3693","the Treasurer and the Clerk shall be elected by the Trustees upon"

"3696","any time.  Vacancies in any such other office may be filled at"
"3697","any time."
"3698","      3.3  Tenure.  The Chair of the Trustees, the President, the"
"3699","Treasurer and the Clerk shall hold office in each case until he"
"3700","or she dies, resigns, is removed or becomes disqualified.  Each"
"3701","other officer shall hold office, and each agent shall retain"
"3702","authority, at the pleasure of the Trustees. Notwithstanding the"
"3703","foregoing, the tenure of any officer of the Trust who is an"
"3704","employee or officer of the Trusts investment adviser or its"
"3705","affiliates shall automatically terminate contemporaneously with"
"3706","the termination of such persons employment with, or service as"
"3707","officer of, the Trusts investment adviser and all of its"
"3708","affiliates."
"3709","      3.4  Powers.  Subject to the other provisions of these"
"3710","Bylaws, each officer shall have, in addition to the duties and"
"3711","powers set forth in these Bylaws and in the Declaration of Trust,"
"3712","such duties and powers as are commonly incident to the office"
"3713","occupied by him or her as if the Trust were organized as a"
"3714","Massachusetts business corporation and such other duties and"
"3715","powers as the Trustees may from time to time designate."
"3716","      3.5  Chair.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide, the"
"3717","Chair of the Trustees shall preside at all meetings of the"
"3718","Trustees.  The Chair of the Trustees shall have such other duties"
"3719","and powers relating to the operations of the Trustees as the"
"3720","Trustees may from time to time designate, but shall have no"
"3721","individual authority to act for the Trust as an officer of the"
"3722","Trust.  The Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who"
"3723","are not interested persons of the Trust, as that term is defined"
"3724","in the 1940 Act, may appoint one or more persons to perform the"
"3725","duties of the Chair of the Trustees in the event of his or her"
"3726","absence at any meeting or in the event of his or her disability."
"3727","The Chair of the Trustees shall also have the power to appoint"
"3728","one or more persons to perform the duties of the Chair of the"
"3729","Trustees in the event of his or her absence at any meeting."
"3730","      3.6  President.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide by"
"3731","vote or otherwise, the President shall be the principal executive"
"3732","officer of the Trust."
"3733","      3.7  Treasurer.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide by"
"3734","vote or otherwise, the Treasurer shall be the principal financial"
"3735","and accounting officer of the Trust, and shall, subject to the"
"3736","provisions of the Declaration of Trust and to any arrangement"
"3737","made by the Trustees with a custodian, investment adviser,"
"3738","subadviser or manager, or transfer, Shareholder servicing or"
"3739","similar agent, be in charge of the valuable papers, books of"
"3740","account and accounting records of the Trust, and shall have such"
"3741","other duties and powers as may be designated from time to time by"
"3742","the Trustees or by the principal executive officer of the Trust."
"3743","      3.8  Clerk.  The Clerk shall record all proceedings of the"
"3744","Shareholders and the Trustees in books to be kept therefor, which"
"3745","books or a copy thereof shall be kept at the principal office of"
"3746","the Trust.  In the absence of the Clerk from any meeting of the"
"3747","Shareholders or Trustees (or a Committee thereof), an Assistant"
"3748","Clerk, or if there be none or if he or she is absent, a temporary"
"3749","Clerk chosen at such meeting by the chair of such meeting, shall"

"3754","Clerk or to a meeting of the Trustees.  Such resignation shall be"
"3755","effective upon receipt unless specified to be effective at some"
"3756","other time.  The Trustees may remove any officer elected or"
"3757","appointed by them with or without cause.  Except to the extent"
"3758","expressly provided in a written agreement with the Trust, no"
"3759","Trustee or officer resigning and no officer removed shall have"
"3760","any right to any compensation for any period following his or her"
"3761","resignation or removal, or any right to damages on account of"
"3762","such removal."

"3776","communications equipment by means of which all persons"
"3777","participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time"
"3778","(participation by such means shall constitute presence in person"
"3779","at a meeting), or (b) evidenced by one or more written consents,"
"3780","including written consents submitted by mail, courier, e mail,"
"3781","facsimile or other electronic means.  Copies of such written"
"3782","consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of"
"3783","such Committee.  Such consents shall be treated for all purposes"
"3784","as a vote taken at a meeting of such Committee.  If in accordance"
"3785","with the provisions of the Declaration of Trust and these Bylaws"

"3787","Committees members, then prompt notice of any such action shall"
"3788","be furnished to each member who did not execute such written"

"3792","thereof present at any properly called meeting, whether or not"
"3793","they constitute a quorum, may appoint a member of the Trustees to"
"3794","act at that meeting only in the place of any absent member."
"3795","	Except as specifically provided in the votes constituting a"

"3815","determined in advance or in arrears by the Treasurer, and"
"3816","subsequent fiscal years shall end on such date in subsequent"
"3817","years."
"3818","ARTICLE 7"
"3819","Seal"
"3820","      7.1  General.  The seal of the Trust, if any, shall consist"
"3821","of a flat faced die with the word Massachusetts, together with"
"3822","the name of the Trust and the year of its organization cut or"
"3823","engraved thereon but, unless otherwise required by the Trustees,"
"3824","the seal need not be placed on, and its absence shall not impair"

"3827","ARTICLE 8"
"3828","Execution of Papers"

"3842","from time to time determined in accordance with procedures"
"3843","adopted by the Trustees and, in the case of fractional Shares, at"
"3844","a proportionate reduction in such price.  In the case of Shares"
"3845","sold for securities, such securities shall be valued in"
"3846","accordance with procedures approved by the Trustees for"
"3847","determining the value of the assets of the Trust.  The officers"
"3848","of the Trust are severally authorized to take all such actions as"
"3849","may be necessary or desirable to carry out this Section 9.1."
"3850","      9.2  Share Certificates.  In lieu of issuing certificates"
"3851","for Shares, the Trustees or the transfer agent may either issue"
"3852","receipts therefor or may keep accounts upon the books of the"
"3853","Trust for the record holders of such Shares, who shall in either"
"3854","case be deemed, for all purposes hereunder, to be the holders of"
"3855","certificates for such Shares as if they had accepted such"
"3856","certificates and shall be held to have expressly assented and"
"3857","agreed to the terms hereof."
"3858","      The Trustees may at any time authorize the issuance of Share"
"3859","certificates.  In that event, each Shareholder shall be entitled"
"3860","to a certificate stating the number of Shares of each class owned"
"3861","by him or her, in such form as shall be prescribed from time to"
"3862","time by the Trustees.  Such certificate shall be signed by the"
"3863","President or a Vice President and by the Treasurer or an"
"3864","Assistant Treasurer.  Such signatures may be facsimile if the"
"3865","certificate is signed by a transfer agent or by a registrar.  In"
"3866","case any officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has"
"3867","been placed on such certificate shall cease to be such officer"
"3868","before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Trust"
"3869","with the same effect as if he or she were such officer at the"
"3870","time of its issue."
"3871","      9.3  Loss of Certificates.  The transfer agent of the Trust,"
"3872","with the approval of any two officers of the Trust, is authorized"
"3873","to issue and countersign replacement certificates for the Shares"
"3874","of the Trust which have been lost, stolen or destroyed upon (i)"
"3875","receipt of an affidavit or affidavits of loss or non receipt and"
"3876","of an indemnity agreement executed by the registered holder or"
"3877","his or her legal representative and supported by an open penalty"
"3878","surety bond, said agreement and said bond in all cases to be in"
"3879","form and content satisfactory to and approved by the President or"
"3880","the Treasurer, or (ii) receipt of such other documents as may be"
"3881","approved by the Trustees."
"3882","      9.4  Issuance of New Certificate to Pledgee.  A pledgee of"
"3883","Shares transferred as collateral security shall be entitled to a"
"3884","new certificate if the instrument of transfer substantially"
"3885","describes the debt or duty that is intended to be secured"
"3886","thereby.  Such new certificate shall express on its face that it"
"3887","is held as collateral security, and the name of the pledgor shall"
"3888","be stated thereon, who alone shall be liable as a Shareholder and"
"3889","entitled to vote thereon."
"3890","      9.5  Discontinuance of Issuance of Certificates.  The"
"3891","Trustees may at any time discontinue the issuance of Share"
"3892","certificates and may, by written notice to each Shareholder whom"
"3893","the Trust believes to hold a Share certificate, require the"
"3894","surrender of Share certificates to the Trust for cancellation."
"3895","Such surrender and cancellation shall not affect the ownership of"
"3896","Shares in the Trust."
"3897","ARTICLE 10"
"3898","Shareholders"
"3899","      10.1  Call of a Meeting.  The Clerk shall provide notice of"
"3900","a meeting of the Shareholders whenever ordered by the Trustees or"
"3901","requested in writing by the holder or holders of at least one"
"3902","tenth of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote at such meeting."
"3903"," If the Clerk, when so ordered or requested, refuses or neglects"
"3904","for more than 30 days to provide such notice, the Trustees or the"
"3905","Shareholders so requesting may, in the name of the Clerk, call"
"3906","the meeting by giving notice thereof in the manner required when"
"3907","notice is given by the Clerk.  Any previously scheduled meeting"
"3908","of Shareholders may be postponed or cancelled by the Trustees"
"3909","upon public notice given prior to the time previously scheduled"
"3910","for such meeting."
"3911","      10.2  Adjournment.  Any meeting of Shareholders may, by"

"3916","which may be more than 120 days after the date initially set for"
"3917","the meeting, time and place, whether or not a quorum is present"
"3918","with respect to such matter.  Upon motion of the chair of the"
"3919","meeting, the question of adjournment may be (but is not required"

"3924","matter or matters adjourned and, if approved, such adjournment"
"3925","shall take place without further notice other than announcement"
"3926","at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  Unless a proxy"
"3927","is otherwise limited in this regard, any Shares present and"
"3928","entitled to vote at a meeting, including any Shares that are"
"3929","represented by broker non votes, may, at the discretion of the"
"3930","proxies named therein, be voted in favor of such an adjournment."
"3931","Any proposal for which sufficient favorable votes have been"

"3935","that is properly before the meeting."
"3936","      10.3  Conduct of Meetings. Meetings of the Shareholders"
"3937","shall be presided over by the Chair of the Trustees, or, if the"
"3938","Chair is not present at the meeting, then by a Trustee or officer"

"4035","address and the Trustees may from time to time adopt, or may"
"4036","authorize the officers or agents of the Trust to adopt,"
"4037","procedures or policies with respect to communications to"
"4038","Shareholders that are returned to the Trust or its agents as"
"4039","undeliverable and similar matters.  Any Shareholder may waive"
"4040","receipt of any notice or other communication."

"4042","pursuant to telephone or electronically transmitted instructions"
"4043","(including instructions submitted via the Internet) obtained"
"4044","pursuant to procedures reasonably designed to verify that such"

"4046","constitute execution of such proxy by or on behalf of such"
"4047","Shareholder."

"4070","      12.2.  Conversion of Class B Shares. Except as hereinafter"

"4075","earlier time as the Trustees may in their sole discretion"
"4076","determine from time to time as to all Class B Shares purchased on"

"4226","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"4227","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"4228","Putnam Funds Trust:"
"4229","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"4230","of Putnam Global Consumer Fund (the Fund), a series of Putnam"
"4231","Funds Trust, as of and for the year ended August 31, 2014, in"
"4232","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"4233","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds internal"
"4234","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"4235","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"4236","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"4237","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"4238","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"4239","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"4240","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"4241","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"4242","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"4243","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"4244","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"4245","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"4246","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"4247","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"4248","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"4249","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"4250","A companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"4251","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"4252","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"4253","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"4254","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"4255","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"4256","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"4257","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"4258","with authorizations of management and trustees of the company;"
"4259","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"4260","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"4261","of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the"
"4262","financial statements."
"4263","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"4264","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"4265","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"4266","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"4267","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"4268","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"4269","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"4270","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"4271","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"4272","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"4273","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"4274","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"4275","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"4276","material misstatement of a Funds annual or interim financial"
"4277","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"4278","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"4279","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"4280","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"4281","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"4282","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"4283","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"4284","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"4285","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"4286","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"4287","August 31, 2014."

"4385","of the meeting, or to any Trustee who attends the meeting without"
"4386","protesting before or at its commencement the lack of notice to"
"4387","him or her.  Any written waiver of notice may be provided and"

"4405","of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each"
"4406","other at the same time and participation by such means shall"
"4407","constitute presence in person at a meeting. Any action to be"
"4408","taken by the Trustees may also be taken without a meeting if one"
"4409","or more written consents thereto are signed by a majority of the"
"4410","Trustees.  Any written consent may be given by mail, courier, e"

"4628","new certificate if the instrument of transfer substantially"
"4629","describes the debt or duty that is intended to be secured"
"4630","thereby.  Such new certificate shall express on its face that it"
"4631","is held as collateral security, and the name of the pledgor shall"

"4637","the Trust believes to hold a Share certificate, require the"

"4780","authorize the officers or agents of the Trust to adopt,"
"4781","procedures or policies with respect to communications to"
"4782","Shareholders that are returned to the Trust or its agents as"
"4783","undeliverable and similar matters.  Any Shareholder may waive"
"4784","receipt of any notice or other communication."

"4787","(including instructions submitted via the Internet) obtained"

"4819","earlier time as the Trustees may in their sole discretion"

"4975","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"4976","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"4977","Putnam Funds Trust"
"4978","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"4979","of Putnam Global Energy Fund (the Fund), a series of Putnam Funds"
"4980","Trust, as of and for the year ended August 31, 2014, in"
"4981","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"4982","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds internal"
"4983","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"4984","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"4985","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"4986","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"4987","NSAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"4988","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"4989","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"4990","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"4991","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"4992","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"4993","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"4994","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"4995","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"4996","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"4997","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"4998","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"4999","A companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"5000","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"5001","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"5002","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"5003","company (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"5004","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"5005","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"5006","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"5007","with authorizations of management and trustees of the company and"
"5008","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"5009","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the"
"5010","companys assets that could have a material effect on the"
"5011","financial statements."
"5012","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"5013","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"5014","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"5015","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"5016","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"5017","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"5018","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"5019","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"5020","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"5021","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"5022","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"5023","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"5024","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"5025","material misstatement of a Funds annual or interim financial"
"5026","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"5027","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"5028","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"5029","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"5030","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"5031","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"5032","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"5033","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"5034","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"5035","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"5036","August 31, 2014."

"5717","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"5718","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"5719","Putnam Funds Trust"
"5720","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"5721","of Putnam Global Financials Fund (the Fund), a series of Putnam"
"5722","Funds Trust, as of and for the year ended August 31, 2014, in"
"5723","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"5724","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds internal"
"5725","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"5726","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"5727","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"5728","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"5729","NSAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"5730","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"5731","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"5732","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"5733","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"5734","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"5735","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"5736","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"5737","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"5738","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"5739","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"5740","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"5741","A companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"5742","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"5743","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"5744","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"5745","company (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"5746","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"5747","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"5748","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"5749","with authorizations of management and trustees of the company and"
"5750","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"5751","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the"
"5752","companys assets that could have a material effect on the"
"5753","financial statements."
"5754","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"5755","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"5756","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"5757","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"5758","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"5759","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"5760","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"5761","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"5762","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"5763","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"5764","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"5765","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"5766","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"5767","material misstatement of a Funds annual or interim financial"
"5768","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"5769","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"5770","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"5771","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"5772","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"5773","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"5774","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"5775","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"5776","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"5777","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"5778","August 31, 2014."

"6424","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"6425","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"6426","Putnam Funds Trust:"
"6427","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"6428","of Putnam Global Industrials Fund (the Fund), a series of Putnam"
"6429","Funds Trust, as of and for the year ended August 31, 2014, in"
"6430","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"6431","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds"
"6432","internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"6433","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"6434","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"6435","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"6436","Form N SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"6437","the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"6438","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"6439","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"6440","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"6441","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"6442","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"6443","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"6444","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"6445","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"6446","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"6447","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"6448","A companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"6449","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"6450","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"6451","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"6452","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"6453","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"6454","financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"6455","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"6456","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"6457","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"6458","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"6459","or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material"
"6460","effect on the financial statements."
"6461","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"6462","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"6463","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"6464","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"6465","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"6466","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"6467","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"6468","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"6469","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"6470","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"6471","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"6472","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"6473","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"6474","material misstatement of a Funds annual or interim financial"
"6475","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"6476","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"6477","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"6478","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"6479","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"6480","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"6481","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"6482","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"6483","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"6484","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"6485","August 31, 2014."

"6624","of the Trustees shall be a Trustee and may but need not be a"
"6625","Shareholder; and any other officer may but need not be a Trustee or a"

"6642","       3.4  Powers.  Subject to the other provisions of these Bylaws,"
"6643","each officer shall have, in addition to the duties and powers set"
"6644","forth in these Bylaws and in the Declaration of Trust, such duties and"
"6645","powers as are commonly incident to the office occupied by him or her"
"6646","as if the Trust were organized as a Massachusetts business corporation"
"6647","and such other duties and powers as the Trustees may from time to time"
"6648","designate."
"6649","       3.5  Chair.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide, the Chair of"

"6652","the operations of the Trustees as the Trustees may from time to time"
"6653","designate, but shall have no individual authority to act for the Trust"
"6654","as an officer of the Trust.  The Trustees, including a majority of the"
"6655","Trustees who are not   interested persons   of the Trust, as that term"
"6656","is defined in the 1940 Act, may appoint one or more persons to perform"
"6657","the duties of the Chair of the Trustees in the event of his or her"
"6658","absence at any meeting or in the event of his or her disability.  The"
"6659","Chair of the Trustees shall also have the power to appoint one or more"
"6660","persons to perform the duties of the Chair of the Trustees in the"
"6661","event of his or her absence at any meeting."
"6662","       3.6  President.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide by vote or"
"6663","otherwise, the President shall be the principal executive officer of"
"6664","the Trust."
"6665","       3.7  Treasurer.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide by vote or"
"6666","otherwise, the Treasurer shall be the principal financial and"

"6668","of the Declaration of Trust and to any arrangement made by the"

"6671","the valuable papers, books of account and accounting records of the"
"6672","Trust, and shall have such other duties and powers as may be"
"6673","designated from time to time by the Trustees or by the principal"
"6674","executive officer of the Trust."
"6675","       3.8  Clerk.  The Clerk shall record all proceedings of the"
"6676","Shareholders and the Trustees in books to be kept therefor, which"
"6677","books or a copy thereof shall be kept at the principal office of the"
"6678","Trust.  In the absence of the Clerk from any meeting of the"

"7122","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"7123","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"7124","Putnam Funds Trust:"
"7125","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"7126","statements of Putnam Global Technology Fund (the Fund), a"
"7127","series of Putnam Funds Trust, as of and for the year ended"
"7128","August 31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the"
"7129","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"7130","we considered the Funds internal control over financial"
"7131","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"7132","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"7133","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"7134","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"7135","NSAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"7136","the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"7137","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such"
"7138","opinion."
"7139","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"7140","maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"7141","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"7142","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"7143","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"7144","companys internal control over financial reporting is a"
"7145","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"7146","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"7147","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"7148","with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  A"
"7149","companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"7150","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"7151","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"7152","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"7153","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"7154","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"7155","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"7156","accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"7157","the company are being made only in accordance with"
"7158","authorizations of management and trustees of the company;"
"7159","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"7160","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"7161","disposition of the companys assets that could have a"
"7162","material effect on the financial statements."
"7163","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"7164","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"7165","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"7166","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"7167","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"7168","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"7169","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"7170","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"7171","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"7172","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"7173","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"7174","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"7175","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"7176","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"7177","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a"
"7178","Funds annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"7179","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"7180","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"7181","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"7182","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"7183","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"7184","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"7185","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"7186","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal"
"7187","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"7188","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"7189","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"7190","August 31, 2014."
"7191","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"7192","of management and the Board of Trustees of Putnam Funds"
"7193","Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"

"7252","Massachusetts business trust established by the Declaration of"
"7253","Trust (the Trust).  Capitalized terms used but not defined in"

"7261","ARTICLE 2"
"7262","Meetings of Trustees"
"7263","      2.1  Regular Meetings.  Regular meetings of the Trustees"
"7264","may be held without call or notice at such places and at such"
"7265","times as the Trustees may from time to time determine, provided"
"7266","that notice of the first regular meeting following any such"
"7267","determination shall be given to absent Trustees."
"7268","      2.2  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Trustees"
"7269","may be held at any time and at any place designated in the call"
"7270","of the meeting when called by the Chair of the Trustees, the"

"7273","each Trustee by the Clerk or an Assistant Clerk or by the"
"7274","officer or the Trustees calling the meeting."
"7275","      2.3  Notice of Special Meetings.  It shall be sufficient"
"7276","notice to a Trustee of a special meeting: (a) to send notice (i)"
"7277","by mail at least forty eight hours before the meeting, (ii) by"
"7278","courier at least forty eight hours before the meeting, (iii) by"

"7290","lack of notice to him or her.  Any written waiver of notice may"
"7291","be provided and delivered to the Trust by mail, courier, e mail,"
"7292","facsimile or other electronic means. Neither notice of a meeting"

"7295","      2.4  Quorum.  At any meeting of the Trustees a majority of"

"7297","quorum has been validly established for a meeting, it cannot be"
"7298","broken by Trustees withdrawing from the meeting.  Any meeting"

"7306","(a quorum being present), including any meeting held by means of"
"7307","a conference telephone or other communications equipment by"
"7308","means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear"
"7309","each other at the same time and participation by such means"
"7310","shall constitute presence in person at a meeting. Any action to"
"7311","be taken by the Trustees may also be taken without a meeting if"
"7312","one or more written consents thereto are signed by a majority of"
"7313","the Trustees.  Any written consent may be given by mail,"

"7316","proceedings of the Trustees.  Such consents shall be treated for"

"7325","ARTICLE 3"
"7326","Officers"
"7327","      3.1  Enumeration; Qualification.  The officers of the Trust"
"7328","shall be a President, a Treasurer, a Clerk and such other"
"7329","officers (including Vice President, which shall include the"
"7330","office of Executive Vice President), if any, as the Trustees"
"7331","from time to time may in their discretion elect.  The Trust may"
"7332","also have such agents as the Trustees from time to time may in"
"7333","their discretion appoint.  In addition, there shall be a Chair"
"7334","of the Trustees, who will be considered an officer of the"
"7335","Trustees and not of the Trust.  The Chair of the Trustees shall"
"7336","be a Trustee and may but need not be a Shareholder; and any"
"7337","other officer may but need not be a Trustee or a Shareholder."
"7338","Any two or more offices may be held by the same person."
"7339","      3.2  Election.  The Chair of the Trustees, the President,"

"7346","Treasurer and the Clerk shall hold office in each case until he"
"7347","or she dies, resigns, is removed or becomes disqualified.  Each"
"7348","other officer shall hold office, and each agent shall retain"
"7349","authority, at the pleasure of the Trustees. Notwithstanding the"
"7350","foregoing, the tenure of any officer of the Trust who is an"
"7351","employee or officer of the Trusts investment adviser or its"
"7352","affiliates shall automatically terminate contemporaneously with"
"7353","the termination of such persons employment with, or service as"
"7354","officer of, the Trusts investment adviser and all of its"
"7355","affiliates."
"7356","      3.4  Powers.  Subject to the other provisions of these"
"7357","Bylaws, each officer shall have, in addition to the duties and"
"7358","powers set forth in these Bylaws and in the Declaration of"
"7359","Trust, such duties and powers as are commonly incident to the"
"7360","office occupied by him or her as if the Trust were organized as"
"7361","a Massachusetts business corporation and such other duties and"
"7362","powers as the Trustees may from time to time designate."
"7363","      3.5  Chair.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide, the"
"7364","Chair of the Trustees shall preside at all meetings of the"
"7365","Trustees.  The Chair of the Trustees shall have such other"
"7366","duties and powers relating to the operations of the Trustees as"
"7367","the Trustees may from time to time designate, but shall have no"
"7368","individual authority to act for the Trust as an officer of the"
"7369","Trust.  The Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who"
"7370","are not interested persons of the Trust, as that term is defined"
"7371","in the 1940 Act, may appoint one or more persons to perform the"
"7372","duties of the Chair of the Trustees in the event of his or her"
"7373","absence at any meeting or in the event of his or her disability."
"7374"," The Chair of the Trustees shall also have the power to appoint"
"7375","one or more persons to perform the duties of the Chair of the"
"7376","Trustees in the event of his or her absence at any meeting."
"7377","      3.6  President.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide by"
"7378","vote or otherwise, the President shall be the principal"
"7379","executive officer of the Trust."
"7380","      3.7  Treasurer.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide by"
"7381","vote or otherwise, the Treasurer shall be the principal"
"7382","financial and accounting officer of the Trust, and shall,"
"7383","subject to the provisions of the Declaration of Trust and to any"
"7384","arrangement made by the Trustees with a custodian, investment"
"7385","adviser, subadviser or manager, or transfer, Shareholder"
"7386","servicing or similar agent, be in charge of the valuable papers,"
"7387","books of account and accounting records of the Trust, and shall"
"7388","have such other duties and powers as may be designated from time"
"7389","to time by the Trustees or by the principal executive officer of"
"7390","the Trust."
"7391","      3.8  Clerk.  The Clerk shall record all proceedings of the"
"7392","Shareholders and the Trustees in books to be kept therefor,"
"7393","which books or a copy thereof shall be kept at the principal"
"7394","office of the Trust.  In the absence of the Clerk from any"
"7395","meeting of the Shareholders or Trustees (or a Committee"
"7396","thereof), an Assistant Clerk, or if there be none or if he or"
"7397","she is absent, a temporary Clerk chosen at such meeting by the"

"7399","the aforesaid books."

"7401","resign at any time by written instrument signed by him or her"
"7402","and delivered to the Chair of the Trustees, the President or the"
"7403","Clerk or to a meeting of the Trustees.  Such resignation shall"
"7404","be effective upon receipt unless specified to be effective at"
"7405","some other time.  The Trustees may remove any officer elected or"
"7406","appointed by them with or without cause.  Except to the extent"
"7407","expressly provided in a written agreement with the Trust, no"
"7408","Trustee or officer resigning and no officer removed shall have"
"7409","any right to any compensation for any period following his or"

"7411","of such removal."

"7728","such earlier time as the Trustees may in their sole discretion"
"7729","determine from time to time as to all Class B Shares purchased"
"7730","on or before such date as the Trustees may specify.  Class B"

"7732","Putnam Fund will convert into Class A Shares based on the date"
"7733","of the initial purchase of the Class B Shares of such other"

"7861","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"7862","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"7863","Putnam Funds Trust:"
"7864","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"7865","of Putnam Global Telecommunications Fund (the Fund), a series of"
"7866","Putnam Funds Trust, as of and for the year ended August 31,"
"7867","2014, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"7868","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"7869","Funds internal control over financial reporting, including"
"7870","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"7871","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"7872","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"7873","requirements of Form N SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"7874","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"7875","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no"
"7876","such opinion."
"7877","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"7878","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"7879","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"7880","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"7881","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"7882","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"7883","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"7884","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"7885","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"7886","A companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"7887","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"7888","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"7889","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"7890","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"7891","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"7892","financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"7893","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"7894","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"7895","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"7896","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"7897","or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material"
"7898","effect on the financial statements."
"7899","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"7900","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"7901","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"7902","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"7903","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"7904","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"7905","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"7906","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"7907","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"7908","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"7909","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"7910","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"7911","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"7912","material misstatement of a Funds annual or interim financial"
"7913","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"7914","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"7915","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"7916","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"7917","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"7918","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"7919","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"7920","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"7921","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"7922","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"7923","August 31, 2014."
"7924","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"7925","management and the Board of Trustees of Putnam Funds Trust and"
"7926","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be"

"7992","ARTICLE 2"
"7993","Meetings of Trustees"
"7994","       2.1  Regular Meetings.  Regular meetings of the Trustees may be"
"7995","held without call or notice at such places and at such times as the"

"8001","meeting when called by the Chair of the Trustees, the President, the"
"8002","Executive Vice President or the Treasurer or by two or more Trustees,"
"8003","sufficient notice thereof being given to each Trustee by the Clerk or"
"8004","an Assistant Clerk or by the officer or the Trustees calling the"

"8006","       2.3  Notice of Special Meetings.  It shall be sufficient notice"
"8007","to a Trustee of a special meeting: (a) to send notice (i) by mail at"

"8036","telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all"
"8037","persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same"

"8056","(including Vice President, which shall include the office of Executive"
"8057","Vice President), if any, as the Trustees from time to time may in"
"8058","their discretion elect.  The Trust may also have such agents as the"
"8059","Trustees from time to time may in their discretion appoint.  In"
"8060","addition, there shall be a Chair of the Trustees, who will be"
"8061","considered an officer of the Trustees and not of the Trust.  The Chair"
"8062","of the Trustees shall be a Trustee and may but need not be a"
"8063","Shareholder; and any other officer may but need not be a Trustee or a"
"8064","Shareholder.  Any two or more offices may be held by the same person."
"8065","       3.2  Election.  The Chair of the Trustees, the President, the"
"8066","Treasurer and the Clerk shall be elected by the Trustees upon the"

"8071","Treasurer and the Clerk shall hold office in each case until he or she"
"8072","dies, resigns, is removed or becomes disqualified.  Each other officer"
"8073","shall hold office, and each agent shall retain authority, at the"

"8075","any officer of the Trust who is an employee or officer of the Trusts"
"8076","investment adviser or its affiliates shall automatically terminate"
"8077","contemporaneously with the termination of such persons employment"
"8078","with, or service as officer of, the Trusts investment adviser and all"

"8080","       3.4  Powers.  Subject to the other provisions of these Bylaws,"
"8081","each officer shall have, in addition to the duties and powers set"
"8082","forth in these Bylaws and in the Declaration of Trust, such duties and"
"8083","powers as are commonly incident to the office occupied by him or her"
"8084","as if the Trust were organized as a Massachusetts business corporation"
"8085","and such other duties and powers as the Trustees may from time to time"
"8086","designate."
"8087","       3.5  Chair.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide, the Chair of"

"8089","of the Trustees shall have such other duties and powers relating to"
"8090","the operations of the Trustees as the Trustees may from time to time"
"8091","designate, but shall have no individual authority to act for the Trust"
"8092","as an officer of the Trust.  The Trustees, including a majority of the"
"8093","Trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust, as that term is"
"8094","defined in the 1940 Act, may appoint one or more persons to perform"
"8095","the duties of the Chair of the Trustees in the event of his or her"
"8096","absence at any meeting or in the event of his or her disability.  The"
"8097","Chair of the Trustees shall also have the power to appoint one or more"
"8098","persons to perform the duties of the Chair of the Trustees in the"
"8099","event of his or her absence at any meeting."
"8100","       3.6  President.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide by vote or"
"8101","otherwise, the President shall be the principal executive officer of"
"8102","the Trust."
"8103","       3.7  Treasurer.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide by vote or"
"8104","otherwise, the Treasurer shall be the principal financial and"
"8105","accounting officer of the Trust, and shall, subject to the provisions"
"8106","of the Declaration of Trust and to any arrangement made by the"
"8107","Trustees with a custodian, investment adviser, subadviser or manager,"

"8109","the valuable papers, books of account and accounting records of the"
"8110","Trust, and shall have such other duties and powers as may be"
"8111","designated from time to time by the Trustees or by the principal"
"8112","executive officer of the Trust."
"8113","       3.8  Clerk.  The Clerk shall record all proceedings of the"
"8114","Shareholders and the Trustees in books to be kept therefor, which"
"8115","books or a copy thereof shall be kept at the principal office of the"
"8116","Trust.  In the absence of the Clerk from any meeting of the"

"8125","upon receipt unless specified to be effective at some other time.  The"
"8126","Trustees may remove any officer elected or appointed by them with or"
"8127","without cause.  Except to the extent expressly provided in a written"
"8128","agreement with the Trust, no Trustee or officer resigning and no"

"8148","mail, courier, e mail, facsimile or other electronic means.  Copies of"
"8149","such written consents shall be filed with the minutes of the"

"8151","purposes as a vote taken at a meeting of such Committee.  If in"
"8152","accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Trust and these"
"8153","Bylaws any action is taken by written consents of less than all of the"
"8154","Committees members, then prompt notice of any such action shall be"
"8155","furnished to each member who did not execute such written consent,"
"8156","provided that the effectiveness of such action shall not be impaired"
"8157","by any delay or failure to furnish such notice.  In the absence of any"
"8158","member of any such Committee, the members thereof present at any"
"8159","properly called meeting, whether or not they constitute a quorum, may"

"8161","place of any absent member."
"8162","	Except as specifically provided in the votes constituting a"

"8166","	4.2  Authority of Trustees.  The Trustees have the power to"
"8167","rescind any action of any Committee, but no such rescission shall have"
"8168","retroactive effect unless determined so by the Trustees."
"8169","ARTICLE 5"
"8170","Reports"
"8171","       5.1  General.  The Trustees and officers shall render reports at"
"8172","the time and in the manner required by the Declaration of Trust or any"

"8193","Execution of Papers"

"8211","for determining the value of the assets of the Trust.  The officers of"
"8212","the Trust are severally authorized to take all such actions as may be"
"8213","necessary or desirable to carry out this Section 9.1."
"8214","       9.2  Share Certificates.  In lieu of issuing certificates for"
