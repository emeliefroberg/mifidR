"5268","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"5269","To the Board of Trustees of PIMCO Equity Series and Shareholders"
"5270","of each of the funds constituting the PIMCO Equity Series listed"
"5271","in Appendix A"
"5272","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"5273"," each of the funds constituting the PIMCO Equity Series listed in Appendix"
"5274"," A (hereafter referred to as the Funds) as of and for the year ended June"
"5275"," 30, 2017, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"5276"," Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds internal control"
"5277"," over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"5278"," as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"5279"," expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"5280"," requirements of Form NSAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"5281"," opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"5282"," reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness"
"5283"," of the Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"5284","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"5285"," effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"5286"," responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"5287"," assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A funds"
"5288"," internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"5289"," reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"5290"," the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"5291"," with generally accepted accounting principles. A funds internal control"
"5292"," over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"5293"," pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"5294"," and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"5295"," fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"5296"," necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"5297"," generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures"
"5298"," of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"5299"," management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"5300"," regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"5301"," or disposition of a funds assets that could have a material effect on the"
"5302"," financial statements."
"5303","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"5304"," reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"5305"," of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"5306"," risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"5307"," or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"5308"," deteriorate."
"5309","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"5310"," design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"5311"," in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"5312"," or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"5313"," deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"5314"," financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"5315"," a material misstatement of the Funds annual or interim financial statements"
"5316"," will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"5317","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial reporting was"
"5318"," for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"5319"," necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"5320"," reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"5321"," the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"5322"," we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal control over financial"
"5323"," reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"5324"," securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above"
"5325"," as of June 30, 2017."

"6022","As used in this Section, the term SubAdviser shall include any officers,"
"6023","directors, employees or other affiliates of the Sub Adviser performing"

"6044","immediately of any material fact known to the SubAdviser relating to the"
"6045","SubAdviser that is not contained in the Funds Registration Statement"
"6046","regarding the Funds, or any amendment or supplement thereto, but that is"
"6047","required to be disclosed therein, and of any statement contained therein"
"6048","that becomes untrue in any material respect. Notwithstanding the foregoing"
"6049","paragraph, to the extent such information is required to be publicly"
"6050","disclosed pursuant to SEC Regulation FD, SubAdvisers notification"
"6051","obligation is subject to such information having first been publicly"

"6061","net assets of each Fund equal to the lesser of: (i) a fee at"
"6062","the per annum rate  set forth in Exhibit  A attached  hereto,  as may  be"
"6063","amended  from time to time;  or"
"6064","(ii) such fee as may from time to time be agreed upon in writing by the"
"6065","Adviser and the Sub Adviser. If the fee payable to the SubAdviser pursuant"
"6066","to this paragraph begins to accrue after the beginning of any month or if"
"6067","this Agreement terminates before the end of any month, the fee for the"
"6068","period from such date to the end of such month or from the beginning of such"
"6069","month to the date of termination, as the case may be, shall be prorated"
"6070","according to the proportion which such period bears to the full month in"
"6071","which such effectiveness or termination occurs. For purposes of calculating"
"6072","fees, the value of each Funds net assets shall be computed in the manner"
"6073","specified in the Funds Prospectus and the Trusts governing instruments for"
"6074","the computation of the value of the Funds net assets in connection with the"
