"1409","March 31, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the"
"1410","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"

"1414","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"

"1420","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"

"1422","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1423","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1424","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's"

"1440","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1441","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's"
"1442","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1443","statements."
"1444","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"

"1448","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"1449","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1450","deteriorate."
"1451","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1452","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1453","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
