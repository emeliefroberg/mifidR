"2733","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM Investment Securities Funds"
"2734","(Invesco Investment Securities Funds):"
"2735","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of each of"
"2736","the following eight funds:"

"2740","Invesco Global Real Estate Fund                    Invesco Short Duration Inflation Protected Fund"
"2741","Invesco Government Money Market Fund (formerly     Invesco Short Term Bond Fund"
"2742","known as Invesco Money Market Fund)                Invesco U.S. Government Fund"
"2743","Invesco High Yield Fund"
"2744","</TABLE>"
"2745","(hereafter referred to as the Funds), as of and for the year ended"
"2746","February 28, 2017, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"2747","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"2748","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"2749","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2750","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"2751","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"2752","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"2753","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"2754","internal control over financial reporting."
"2755","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"2756","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"2757","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"2758","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"2759","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2760","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"2761","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"2762","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"2763","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2764","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2765","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"2766","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"2767","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"2768","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"2769","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"2770","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"2771","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"2772","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2773","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2774","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2775","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"2776","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"2777","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2778","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"2779","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"2780","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2781","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2782","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"2783","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2784","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"2785","on a timely basis."
"2786","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"2787","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"2788","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"2789","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"2790","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"2791","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"2792","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"2793","be material weaknesses as defined above as of February 28, 2017."

"3507","       (a) To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Trust (or applicable"

"3509","be made a party to, or is involved as a witness in, any proceeding (other than"
"3510","a proceeding by or in the right of the Trust or a Portfolio) by reason of the"
"3511","fact that such person is or was a Covered Person, against expenses, judgments,"
"3512","fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such"
"3513","person in connection with such proceeding."

"3524","Covered Person shall be indemnified for any expenses, judgments, fines, amounts"
"3525","paid in settlement, or other liability or loss arising by reason of disabling"
"3526","conduct. The termination of any proceeding by conviction, or a plea of NOLO"
"3527","CONTENDERE or its equivalent, or an entry of an order of probation prior to"
"3528","judgment, creates a rebuttable presumption that the person engaged in disabling"
"3529","conduct."
"3530","   Section 2. Advance Payment of Indemnification Expenses. To the maximum"

"3544","Trustee or officer of the Trust) unless:"

"3549","such expenses; and"

"3557","Covered Person ultimately will be found entitled to indemnification."
"3558","   Section 3. Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification. Any"
"3559","indemnification required or permitted under this Article VIII (unless ordered"

"3561","authorized in the specific case upon a reasonable determination, based upon a"
"3562","review of the facts, that the Covered Person is entitled to indemnification"
"3563","because (i) he or she is not liable by reason of disabling conduct, or (ii) in"
"3564","cases where there is no liability, he or she has not engaged in disabling"
"3565","conduct. Such determination shall be made by (i) the vote of a majority of a"
"3566","quorum of qualifying Trustees; or (ii) if there are no such Trustees, or if"

"3914","prior authorization or vote of the Shareholders of any Portfolio, or"
