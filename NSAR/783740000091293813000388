"888","             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"889","To the Board of Trustees of MFS Series Trust X and"
"890","Shareholders of MFS Emerging Markets Debt Fund and MFS Emerging Markets Debt"
"891","Local Currency Fund"
"892","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of MFS Emerging"
"893","Markets  Debt  Fund  and  MFS  Emerging  Markets  Debt  Local Currency Fund (the"
"894","Funds)  as  of  and for the year ended July 31, 2013, in accordance  with  the"
"895","standards of the Public  Company  Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"896","considered  the  Funds' internal control  over  financial  reporting,  including"
"897","controls over safeguarding  securities,  as  a  basis for designing our auditing"
"898","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"899","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,  but  not  for the purpose of"
"900","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal  control  over"
"901","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"902","The  management  of  the  Funds  is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"903","effective  internal  control  over  financial   reporting.  In  fulfilling  this"
"904","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"905","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A  company's  internal control"
"906","over  financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance"
"907","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"908","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"909","accounting  principles.  A  company's  internal control over financial reporting"
"910","includes those policies and procedures that  (1)  pertain  to the maintenance of"
"911","records   that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect   the"
"912","transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2) provide"
"913","reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as necessary to permit"
"914","preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with generally  accepted"
"915","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures  of  the  company  are"
"916","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"917","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"918","detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"919","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"920","Because of its  inherent  limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"921","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"922","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"923","inadequate because of changes in conditions,  or  that  the degree of compliance"
"924","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"925","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"926","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,  in the normal"
"927","course   of   performing   their   assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"928","misstatements on a timely basis. A material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or  a"
"929","combination  of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"930","that there is  a  reasonable  possibility  that  a  material misstatement of the"
"931","company's  annual  or  interim financial statements will  not  be  prevented  or"
"932","detected on a timely basis."
"933","<PAGE>"
"934","Our consideration of the  Funds'  internal  control over financial reporting was"
"935","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in  the first  paragraph  and  would  not"
"936","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"937","weaknesses  under  standards  established  by  the   Public  Company  Accounting"
"938","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"939","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,  including controls"
"940","over  safeguarding  securities  that  we consider to be a material  weakness  as"
"941","defined above as of July 31, 2013."
"942","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"943","Board  of  Trustees  of  MFS Series Trust X  and  the  Securities  and  Exchange"
"944","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"945","these specified parties."
