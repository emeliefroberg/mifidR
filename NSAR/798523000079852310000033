"1055","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"1056","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1057","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"1058","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1059","controls. A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1060","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability"
"1061","of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"1062","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1063","principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1064","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1065","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1066","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1067","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1068","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1069","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"1070","the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1071","management and trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable"
"1072","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1073","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a"
"1074","material effect on the financial statements."
"1075","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1076","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"1077","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"1078","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1079","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1080","procedures may deteriorate."
"1081","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1082","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1083","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"1084","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness"
"1085","is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"1086","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1087","material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial statements"
"1088","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1089","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"1090","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1091","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"1092","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"1093","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However,"
"1094","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1095","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"1096","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of"
"1097","September 30, 2009."

"1198","1.	DESCRIPTION OF THE REORGANIZATIONS"
"1199","1.1.	It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Reorganization"
"1200","described herein shall be conducted separately of the others, and a party"
"1201","hereto which is not a party to a Reorganization shall incur no obligations,"
"1202","duties or liabilities with respect to such Reorganization by reason of being"
"1203","a party to this Agreement.  If any one or more Reorganizations should fail"

"1205","Reorganizations in any way.  The parties shall cooperate in preparing, and"

"1210","Commission (Commission) and include a proxy statement with respect to the"
"1211","votes of the shareholders of each Target Fund to approve its Reorganization"
"1212","(collectively, the Registration Statement)."
"1213","1.2.	With respect to the Reorganizations of the CPFI Fund, CPFI Advisor"
"1214","Fund and IDFI Fund, prior to or as of the close of each of the Target Funds'"
"1215","business on the Closing Date (as defined in Paragraph 3.1 hereof) of the"
"1216","Reorganization for that Target Fund, CPFI Portfolio or IDFI Portfolio, as"
"1217","appropriate, shall conduct an in-kind liquidating distribution, and shall"
"1218","deliver to CPFI Fund and CPFI Advisor Fund or IDFI Fund, as appropriate, all"
"1219","of its assets or such pro rata share of its assets as is appropriate given"
"1220","CPFI Fund's and CPFI Advisor Fund's or IDFI Fund's relative ownership of its"
"1221","beneficial interests."
"1222","1.3.	On or as soon as practicable prior to the Closing Date for a"
"1223","Reorganization, the Target Fund (with the assistance of CPFI Portfolio or"
"1224","IDFI Portfolio, to the extent appropriate), will declare and pay to its"
"1225","shareholders of record one or more dividends and/or other distributions so"
"1226","that it will have distributed substantially all (and in no event less"
"1227","than 98%) of its investment company taxable income (computed without regard"
"1228","to any deduction for dividends paid) and realized net capital gain, if any,"
"1229","for the current taxable year through the Closing Date."
"1230","1.4.	Provided that all conditions precedent to a Reorganization have been"
"1231","satisfied as of the Closing Date and based on the representations and"
"1232","warranties each party herein provides to the others, the Trust or Advisor"
"1233","Trust and Franklin Trust or Franklin NY Trust, as appropriate, agree to take"
"1234","the following steps with respect to that Reorganization, the parties to which"
"1235","and classes of shares to be issued in connection with which as set forth in"
"1236","Exhibit A:"
"1237","(a)	The Target Fund shall transfer all of its Assets, as defined and set"
"1238","forth in Paragraph 1.4(b), to the corresponding Acquiring Fund, and the"
"1239","Acquiring Fund in exchange therefore shall deliver to the Target Fund the"
"1240","number of full and fractional Acquiring Fund shares, determined in the manner"
"1241","and as of the time on the Closing Date set forth in Paragraph 2."
"1242","(b)	The assets of the Target Fund to be acquired by the Acquiring Fund"
"1243","shall consist of all assets and property, including, without limitation, all"
"1244","cash, securities, commodities and futures interests, claims (whether absolute"
"1245","or contingent, known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued and including, without"
"1246","limitation, any interest in pending or future legal claims in connection with"
"1247","past or present portfolio holdings, whether in the form of class action"
"1248","claims, opt-out or other direct litigation claims, or regulator or"
"1249","government-established investor recovery fund claims, and any and all"
"1250","resulting recoveries) and dividends or interest receivable that are owned"
"1251","by the Target Fund and any deferred or prepaid expenses shown as an asset"
"1252","on the books of the Target Fund on the Closing Date, except for cash, bank"
"1253","deposits or cash equivalent securities in an estimated amount necessary to"
"1254","(i) discharge the Target Fund's unpaid liabilities on the Target Fund's"
"1255","books at the Closing Date and (ii) pay such contingent liabilities, if any,"
"1256","as the Board of Trustees of the Trust or Advisor Trust, as applicable, shall"
"1257","reasonably deem to exist against the Target Fund at the Closing Date, for"
"1258","which contingent and other appropriate liability reserves shall be established"
"1259","on the Target Fund's books (collectively, Assets)."
"1260","(c)  The Target Fund will use commercially reasonable efforts to discharge"
"1261","all of its known liabilities and obligations prior to the Closing Date."
"1262","Neither the Acquiring Fund nor the Franklin Trust or Franklin NY Trust, as"
"1263","applicable, shall assume any of the liabilities of the Target Fund, whether"
"1264","accrued or contingent, known or unknown, existing at the Closing Date"
"1265","(collectively, Liabilities) and the Acquiring Fund and the Franklin Trust"
"1266","or the Franklin NY Trust, as appropriate, specifically disclaim the"
"1267","assumption of any such Liabilities."

"1269","the Target Fund will distribute to its shareholders of record (Target Fund
Shareholders) with respect to each class of shares, as set forth in Exhibit"
"1270","A, the shares of the Acquiring Fund of the corresponding class received by the"
"1271","Target Fund pursuant to Paragraph 1.4(a), determined as of immediately after"
"1272","the close of business on the Closing Date, on a pro rata basis within that"
"1273","class, and will completely liquidate (except as to the contingent liability"
"1274","reserve provided for in Paragraph 1.4(b) herein).  Such distribution and"
"1275","liquidation will be accomplished, with respect to each class of the Target"
"1276","Fund's shares, by the transfer of the Acquiring Fund shares of the"
"1277","corresponding class then credited to the account of the Target Fund on the"
"1278","books of the Acquiring Fund to open accounts on the share records of the"
"1279","Acquiring Fund in the names of the Target Fund Shareholders of the class."
"1280","The aggregate net asset value of each class of shares of the Acquiring Fund"
"1281","to be so credited to the corresponding class or classes of Target Fund"
"1282","Shareholders shall be equal to the aggregate net asset value of the Target"
"1283","Fund's shares of the corresponding class or classes owned by the Target"
"1284","Fund Shareholders on the Closing Date (as set forth in Exhibit A).  All"
"1285","issued and outstanding shares of the Target Fund will simultaneously be"
"1286","canceled on the books of the Target Fund.  The Acquiring Fund shall not"
"1287","issue certificates representing shares in connection with such exchange."
"1288","(e)	Ownership of Acquiring Fund shares will be shown on its books, as"
"1289","such are maintained by the Acquiring Fund's Transfer Agent, as defined in"
"1290","Paragraph 3.2."
"1291","(f)	Any reporting responsibility of the Target Fund, including, but"
"1292","not limited to, the responsibility for filing regulatory reports, tax"
"1293","returns, or other documents with the Commission, any state securities"
"1294","commission, and any Federal, state or local tax authorities or any other"
"1295","relevant regulatory authority, is and shall remain the responsibility of"
"1296","the Target Fund."
"1297","2.	VALUATION"
"1298","2.1.	With respect to each Reorganization:"
"1299","(a)	The value of the Target Fund's Assets shall be the value of such"
"1300","Assets computed as of immediately after the close of business of the New"
"1301","York Stock Exchange and after the declaration of any dividends on the Closing"
"1302","Date, using the valuation procedures set forth in then-current prospectus"
"1303","and statement of additional information with respect to the Acquiring Fund,"
"1304","and valuation procedures established by the Acquiring Fund's Board of"
"1305","Trustees and provided to the Target Fund prior to the Closing Date."
"1306","(b)	The net asset value of each class of Acquiring Fund shares issued"
"1307","in connection with the Reorganization shall be the net asset value per"
"1308","share computed with respect to that class as of the Closing Date, using"
"1309","the valuation procedures set forth in the Acquiring Fund's then-current"
"1310","prospectus and statement of additional information, and valuation"
"1311","procedures established by the Acquiring Fund's Board of Trustees."
"1312","(c)	The number of each class of Acquiring Fund shares issued (including"
"1313"," fractional shares, if any) in exchange for the Target Fund's Assets shall"
"1314","be determined by dividing the value of the net assets with respect to each"
"1315","class of shares of the Target Fund determined using the same valuation"
"1316","procedures referred to in Paragraph 2.1(a), by the net asset value of an"
"1317","Acquiring Fund share of the corresponding class, as set forth in Exhibit"
"1318","A, determined in accordance with Paragraph 2.1(b)."
"1319","(d)	All computations of value shall be made by the Target Fund's designated"
"1320","recordkeeping agent and shall be subject to review by the Acquiring Fund's"
"1321","recordkeeping agent and by each of the Target Fund's and Acquiring Fund's"
"1322","respective independent registered public accountants."
"1323","3.	CLOSING AND CLOSING DATE"
"1324","3.1.	Each Reorganization shall close on August 28, 2009 or such other date"
"1325","as the parties may agree with respect to any or all Reorganizations"
"1326","(the Closing Date).  All acts taking place at the closing of the"

"1352","Fund's portfolio securities and instruments so held.  The cash to be"

"1356","securities held by the Target Fund for the reason that any of such"
"1357","securities purchased prior to the Closing Date have not yet been delivered"
"1358","to the Target Fund or its broker, then the corresponding Acquiring Fund may,"
"1359","in its sole discretion, waive the delivery requirements of this Paragraph"
"1360","with respect to said undelivered securities if the Target Fund has delivered"
"1361","to the Acquiring Fund or its custodian by or on the Closing Date, and with"

"1369","each class of the Acquiring Fund to be issued to the Target Fund"
"1370","Shareholders, including names, addresses and tax withholding status of"

"1377","Acquiring Fund may reasonably request.  The Acquiring Fund and its transfer"
"1378","agent shall have no obligation to inquire as to the validity, propriety or"
"1379","correctness of any such instruction, information or documentation, but shall,"
"1380","in each case, assume that such instruction, information or documentation is"
"1381","valid, proper, correct and complete."
"1382","(d)	The Trust or Advisor Trust, as appropriate, shall direct Citi Fund"

"1387","Shareholders and the number and percentage ownership of outstanding  shares"

"1391","to the Secretary of the Target Fund, or provide other evidence satisfactory"
"1392","to the Trust that such Acquiring Fund shares have been credited to the"
"1393","Target Fund Shareholders' accounts on the books of the Acquiring Fund."
"1394","At the Closing, each party shall deliver to the other such bills of sale,"
"1395","checks, assignments, certificates, if any, receipts or other documents as"
"1396","such other party or its counsel may reasonably request."
"1397","(e)	In the event that on the Closing Date (a) the New York Stock"
"1398","Exchange or another primary trading market for portfolio securities of the"
"1399","Acquiring Fund or the Target Fund (each, an Exchange) shall be closed to"
"1400","trading or trading thereupon shall be restricted, or (b) trading or the"
"1401","reporting of trading on such Exchange or elsewhere shall be disrupted so"
"1402","that, in the judgment of the Board of Trustees of the Trust or Advisor Trust"
