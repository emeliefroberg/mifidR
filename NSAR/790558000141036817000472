"1522","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"1523","Accounting Firm"
"1524","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"1525","Hartford HLS Series Fund II, Inc."
"1526","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1527","statements of Hartford HLS Series Fund II, Inc. (the"
"1528","Company) as of and for the year ended December"
"1529","31, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the"
"1530","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1531","(United States), we considered the Company's"
"1532","internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1533","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1534","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1535","expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"1536","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"1537","SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"1538","opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's"
"1539","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"1540","we express no such opinion."
"1541","The management of the Company is responsible for"
"1542","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1543","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1544","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1545","management are required to assess the expected"
"1546","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"1547","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"1548","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1549","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1550","preparation of financial statements for external"
"1551","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1552","accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"1553","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1554","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1555","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1556","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1557","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1558","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"1559","to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1560","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1561","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1562","company are being made only in accordance with"
"1563","authorizations of management and directors of the"
"1564","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1565","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1566","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"1567","company's assets that could have a material effect on"
"1568","the financial statements."
"1569","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1570","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1571","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1572","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"1573","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"1574","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1575","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1576","deteriorate."
"1577","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1578","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1579","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1580","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1581","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1582","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"1583","a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"1584","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1585","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1586","company's annual or interim financial statements will"
"1587","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1588","Our consideration of the Company's internal control"
"1589","over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1590","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1591","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"1592","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1593","standards established by the Public Company"
"1594","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1595","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Company's"
"1596","internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1597","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1598","securities that we consider to be a material weakness"
"1599","as defined above as of December 31, 2016."

"1635","All Series of the Registrant"
"1636","On February 25, 2011, Jennifer L. Kasilag, Louis Mellinger,"
"1637","Judith M. Menendez, Jacqueline M. Robinson, and Linda A."
"1638","Russell filed a derivative lawsuit against Hartford Investment"
"1639","Financial Services, LLC (HIFSCO) (now known as Hartford"
"1640","Funds Distributors, LLC) on behalf of six Hartford retail mutual"
"1641","funds in the United States District Court for the District of New"
"1642","Jersey, alleging that HIFSCO received excessive advisory and"
"1643","distribution fees in violation of its statutory fiduciary duty under"
"1644","Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act when serving as investment"
"1645","manager and principal underwriter, respectively, to the Hartford"
"1646","retail mutual funds. Although this action was purportedly filed"
"1647","on behalf of certain of the Hartford Funds, none of the Hartford"
"1648","Funds is itself a defendant to the suit. HIFSCO moved to dismiss"
"1649","and, in September 2011, the motion was granted in part and"
"1650","denied in part, with leave to amend the complaint. In November"
"1651","2011, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on behalf of certain"
"1652","Hartford retail mutual funds, The Hartford Global Health Fund"
"1653","(now known as The Hartford Healthcare Fund), The Hartford"
"1654","Conservative Allocation Fund, The Hartford Growth"
"1655","Opportunities Fund, The Hartford Inflation Plus Fund, The"
"1656","Hartford Advisers Fund (now known as The Hartford Balanced"
"1657","Fund), and The Hartford Capital Appreciation Fund. Plaintiffs"
"1658","seek to rescind the investment management agreements and"
"1659","distribution plans between HIFSCO and these funds and to"
"1660","recover the total fees charged thereunder or, in the alternative, to"
"1661","recover any improper compensation HIFSCO received, in"
"1662","addition to lost earnings. HIFSCO filed a partial motion to"
"1663","dismiss the amended complaint and, in December 2012, the"
"1664","court dismissed without prejudice the claims regarding"
"1665","distribution fees and denied the motion with respect to the"
"1666","advisory fees claims. In March 2014, the plaintiffs filed a new"
"1667","complaint, among other things, added as new plaintiffs The"
"1668","Hartford Floating Rate Fund and The Hartford Small Company"
"1669","Fund and named as a defendant Hartford Funds Management"
"1670","Company, LLC (HFMC), which assumed the role as"
"1671","investment manager to the funds as of January 2013. In June"
"1672","2015, HFMC and HIFSCO moved for summary judgment, and"
"1673","plaintiffs cross-moved for partial summary judgment with"
"1674","respect to The Hartford Capital Appreciation Fund. In March"
"1675","2016, the court, in large part, denied summary judgment for all"
"1676","parties. The court granted judgment for HFMC and HIFSCO"
"1677","with respect to all claims made by The Hartford Small Company"
"1678","Fund and certain claims made by The Hartford Floating Rate"
"1679","Fund. The court further ruled that the appropriate measure of"
"1680","damages on the surviving claims is the difference, if any,"
"1681","between the actual advisory fees paid through trial and those that"
"1682","could have been paid under the applicable legal standard. A"
"1683","bench trial on the issue of liability was held in November 2016"
"1684","and a decision is expected in 2017. HFMC and HIFSCO dispute"
"1685","the allegations and intend to defend vigorously."
