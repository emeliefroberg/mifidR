"4606","reasonable in relation to the benefits received. In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or"
"4607","dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment"

"4610","have charged for effecting that transaction if the Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in"
"4611","relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer. This determination may be viewed in"
"4612","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the commissions paid by"
"4613","the Portfolio to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the benefits to"

"6609","</P>"
"6610","<P ALIGN=LEFT>To the Trustees of Fidelity Massachusetts Municipal Trust and the Shareholders of Fidelity Massachusetts Municipal Income"
"6611","Fund, Fidelity Massachusetts Municipal Money Market Fund and Fidelity Massachusetts AMT Tax-Free Money Market Fund:"
"6612","</P>"
"6613","<P ALIGN=LEFT>In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of  Fidelity Massachusetts Municipal Income Fund, Fidelity"
"6614","Massachusetts Municipal Money Market Fund and Fidelity Massachusetts AMT Tax-Free Money Market Fund (the &quot;Funds&quot;),"
"6615","each a fund of Fidelity Massachusetts Municipal Trust, as of and for the year ended January 31, 2014, in accordance with the"
"6616","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"6617","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"6618","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"6619","we express no such opinion."
"6620","</P>"
"6621","<P ALIGN=LEFT>The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"6622","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"6623","costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"6624","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"6625","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"6626","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's"
"6627","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"6628","</P>"
"6629","<P ALIGN=LEFT>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"6630","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"6631","</P>"
"6632","<P ALIGN=LEFT>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"6633","timely basis.&nbsp; A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"6634","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a fund's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"6635","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"6636","</P>"
"6637","<P ALIGN=LEFT>Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"6638","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"6639","Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as of January 31, 2014."
"6640","</P>"
