"477","<TEXT>"
"478","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"479","To the Board of Trustees of Northern Lights Fund Trust II"
"480","and the Shareholders of Aftershock Strategies Fund"
"481","In planning and performing our audit of the consolidated financial"
"482"," statements of Aftershock Strategies Fund (the Fund), a separate"
"483","series of the Northern Lights Fund Trust II, as of November 30, 2013"
"484","and for the period from December 31, 2012 (commencement of operations)"
"485","through November 30, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the"
"486","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"487","considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"488","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"489","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"490","our opinion on the consolidated financial statements and to comply"
"491","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"492","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"493","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"494","opinion."
"495","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"496","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"497","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"498","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"499","costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"500","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"501","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"502"," of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"503","generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  A fund's internal"
"504","control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"505"," that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"506","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"507","of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"508","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"509","financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"510","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"511","authorizations of management and directors of the fund; and (3)"
"512","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"513","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that"
"514","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"515","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"516","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"517","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"518","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions"
"519","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"520","deteriorate."
"521","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"522","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"523","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"524","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"525","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"526","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"527","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's"
"528","annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented"
"529","or detected on a timely basis."
"530","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"531","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"532","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"533","that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"534","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).However, we"
"535","noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"536","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"537","securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above"
"538","as of November 30, 2013."
"539","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"540","management and the Board of Trustees of Aftershock Strategies Fund, a"
"541","separate series of the Northern Lights Fund Trust II, and the Securities"
"542","and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used"
"543","by anyone other than these specified parties."
