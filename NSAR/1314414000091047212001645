"584","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"585","To the Shareholders of Tatro Capital Tactical Appreciation"
"586","Fund and Board of Trustees of Northern Lights Fund Trust"
"587","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"588","statements of Tatro Capital Tactical Appreciation Fund, a"
"589","series of shares of beneficial interest of Northern Lights"
"590","Fund Trust (the Fund), as of and for the period ended March"
"591","31, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"592","Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we"
"593","considered its internal control over financial reporting, including"
"594","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"595","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"596","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"597","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"598"," effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"599","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"600","The management of Northern Lights Fund Trust is responsible for"
"601","establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"602","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments"
"603"," by management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"604","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"605","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"606"," assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"607","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"608"," accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the"
"609","United States of America (GAAP).  A companys internal control"
"610","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"611","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"612"," detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"613","dispositions of the assets of the company (2) provide reasonable"
"614","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"615","preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP,"
"616","and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"617"," only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"618"," of the company and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"619","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"620","or disposition of a companys assets that could have a material"
"621","effect on the financial statements."
"622","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"623","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"624"," of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject"
"625","to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes"
"626","in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"627","or procedures may deteriorate."
"628","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"629","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"630","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"631","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"632","A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,"
"633","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"634"," reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds"
"635","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"636","detected on a timely basis."
"637","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"638","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"639","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"640","internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"641","established by the PCAOB.  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"642"," internal control over financial reporting and its operations,"
"643","including controls for safeguarding securities that we consider to"
"644"," be material weaknesses, as defined above, as of March 31, 2012."
"645","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"646","management, the shareholders of Tatro Capital Tactical Appreciation"
"647","Fund, the Board of Trustees of Northern Lights Fund Trust and the"
"648","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"649","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."
