"1096","<P style=line-height:14pt; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:16px; text-indent:72px; font-size:12pt align=justify>In connection with its responsibilities under this Section 3, the Adviser is responsible for decisions to buy and sell securities and other investments for the Series&#146; portfolio, broker-dealer selection, and negotiation of commission rates. The Adviser&#146;s primary consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain the best execution for the Series, taking into account the factors specified in the Prospectus and/or Statement of Additional Information for the Company, which include price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dollar spread), the size of the order, the nature of the market for the security, the timing of the transaction, the reputation, experience and financial stability of the broker-dealer involved, the quality of the service, the difficulty of execution, execution capabilities and operational facilities of the firms involved, and the firm&#146;s risk in positioning a block of securities. Accordingly, the price to the Series in any transaction may be less favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the difference is reasonably justified, in the judgment of the Adviser in the exercise of its fiduciary obligations to the Company, by other aspects of the portfolio execution services offered. Subject to such policies as the Board of Directors may determine and consistent with Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;1934 Act&#148;), the Adviser shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of its having caused the Series to pay a broker-dealer for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker-dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if the Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the Adviser&#146;s overall responsibilities with respect to the Series and to its other clients as to which it exercises investment discretion. To the extent consistent with these standards and in accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder, the Adviser is further authorized to allocate the orders placed by it on behalf of the Series to the Adviser if it is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC, to an affiliated broker-dealer, or to such brokers and dealers who also provide research or statistical material or other services to the Series, the Adviser or an affiliate of the Adviser. Such allocation shall be in such amounts and proportions as the Adviser shall determine consistent with the above standards, and the Adviser will report on said allocation regularly to the Board of Directors of the Company indicating the broker-dealers to which such allocations have been made and the basis therefor. </P>"
