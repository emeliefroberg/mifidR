"530","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"531","Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"532","Tax-Free Fund of Colorado"
"533","New York, New York"
"534","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"535","of the Tax-Free Fund of Colorado, as of and for the year ended"
"536","December 31, 2011, in accordance with the standards of the"
"537","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"538","considered its internal control over financial reporting,"
"539","control activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"540","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"541","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"542","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"543"," an opinion on the effectiveness of Fund?s internal control over"
"544"," financial reporting.   Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"545","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"546","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"547","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"548","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"549","related costs of controls.   A company?s internal control over"
"550","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"551","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"552","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"553","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"554","A company?s internal control over financial reporting includes"
"555","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"556","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"557","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"558","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"559","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"560","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"561","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"562","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"563","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"564","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"565","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company?s"
"566","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"567","statements."
"568","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"569","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.   Also,"
"570","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"571","are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"572","because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"573","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"574","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"575","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"576","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"577","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"578","A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"579","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"580","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"581","of the company?s annual or interim financial statements will not"
"582","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"583","Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"584","Tax-Free Fund of Colorado"
"585","Page Two"
"586","Our consideration of the Fund?s internal control over financial"
"587","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"588","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"589","internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"590","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"591","(United States).   However, we noted no deficiencies in Fund?s"
"592","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"593","including controls for safeguarding securities, which we consider"
"594","to be material weaknesses, as defined above, as of December 3,"
"595","2011."
"596","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"597","management, Shareholders and Board of Trustees of Tax-Free Fund of"
"598","Colorado and the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not"
"599","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"600","specified parties."
