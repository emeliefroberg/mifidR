"806","To the Shareholders and"
"807","Board of Trustees of"
"808","Investment Managers Series Trust"
"809","Glendora, California 91740"
"810","In  planning and performing our audit  of"
"811","the financial statements of EP China Fund"
"812","(the   Fund),  a  series  of   Investment"
"813","Managers Series Trust, as of and for  the"
"814","year  ended  June 30, 2011, in accordance"
"815","with  the standards of the Public Company"
"816","Accounting   Oversight   Board    (United"
"817","States),  we  considered  their  internal"
"818","control    over   financial    reporting,"
"819","including    control    activities    for"
"820","safeguarding securities, as a  basis  for"
"821","designing our auditing procedures for the"
"822","purpose of expressing our opinion on  the"
"823","financial  statements and to comply  with"
"824","the  requirements of Form N-SAR, but  not"
"825","for  the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"826","on   the   effectiveness  of  the   Funds"
"827","internal     control    over    financial"
"828","reporting.  Accordingly,  we  express  no"
"829","such opinion."
"830","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"831","for    establishing    and    maintaining"
"832","effective internal control over financial"
"833","reporting.      In    fulfilling     this"
"834","responsibility, estimates  and  judgments"
"835","by  management are required to assess the"
"836","expected  benefits and related  costs  of"
"837","controls.    A companys internal  control"
"838","over  financial reporting  is  a  process"
"839","designed  to provide reasonable assurance"
"840","regarding  the reliability  of  financial"
"841","reporting   and   the   preparation    of"
"842","financial    statements   for    external"
"843","purposes  in  accordance  with  generally"
"844","accepted   accounting   principles.     A"
"845","companys  internal control over financial"
"846","reporting  includes  those  policies  and"
"847","procedures  that  (1)  pertain   to   the"
"848","maintenance   of   records    that,    in"
"849","reasonable detail, accurately and  fairly"
"850","reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"851","of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"852","reasonable  assurance  that  transactions"
"853","are   recorded  as  necessary  to  permit"
"854","preparation  of financial  statements  in"
"855","accordance   with   generally    accepted"
"856","accounting principles, and that  receipts"
"857","and expenditures of the company are being"
"858","made     only    in    accordance    with"
"859","authorizations    of    management    and"
"860","directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"861","reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"862","or   timely   detection  of  unauthorized"
"863","acquisition,  use  or  disposition  of  a"
"864","companys   assets  that  could   have   a"
"865","material    effect   on   the   financial"
"866","statements."
"867","Because of inherent limitations, internal"
"868","control over financial reporting may  not"
"869","prevent or detect misstatements.    Also,"
"870","projections   of   any   evaluation    of"
"871","effectiveness  to  future   periods   are"
"872","subject  to  the risk that  controls  may"
"873","become  inadequate because of changes  in"
"874","conditions,   or  that  the   degree   of"
"875","compliance    with   the   policies    or"
"876","procedures may deteriorate."
"877","A  deficiency  in internal  control  over"
"878","financial  reporting  exists   when   the"
"879","design or operation of a control does not"
"880","allow  management  or employees,  in  the"
"881","normal   course   of   performing   their"
"882","assigned functions, to prevent or  detect"
"883","misstatements  on  a  timely  basis.    A"
"884","material  weakness is  a  deficiency,  or"
"885","combination of deficiencies, in  internal"
"886","control  over  financial reporting,  such"
"887","that  there  is a reasonable  possibility"
"888","that  a  material  misstatement  of   the"
"889","companys   annual  or  interim  financial"
"890","statements  will  not  be  prevented   or"
"891","detected on a timely basis."
"892","Our  consideration  of the  Funds  internal"
"893","control  over financial reporting  was  for"
"894","the  limited purpose described in the first"
"895","paragraph   and   would   not   necessarily"
"896","disclose   all  deficiencies  in   internal"
"897","control  that might be material  weaknesses"
"898","under  standards established by the  Public"
"899","Company  Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"900","States).      However,    we    noted    no"
"901","deficiencies in the Funds internal  control"
"902","over financial reporting and its operation,"
"903","including    controls   for    safeguarding"
"904","securities,   which  we  consider   to   be"

"906","of June 30, 2011."
