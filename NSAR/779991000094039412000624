"1645","Shareholders of the Trust or the appropriate Series or Class"
"1646","thereof, or by an instrument or instruments in writing without a"

"1653","Trustees then in office to be followed by a written notice to"
"1654","Shareholders.  Such Trustee approval may (but need not) be"
"1655","based on factors or events adversely affecting the ability of the"

"1684","of all liabilities, and upon receipt of such releases,"
"1685","indemnities and refunding agreements as they deem"
"1686","necessary for their protection, the Trustee may"
