"586","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"587","To the  Board  of  Trustees  and  the  Shareholders  of  StateplaceMassachusetts"
"588","Investors Trust:"
"589","In  planning  and   performing   our  audit  of  the  financial   statements  of"
"590","Massachusetts  Investors  Trust (the Fund) as of and for the year ended December"
"591","31, 2010, in  accordance  with the  standards of the Public  Company  Accounting"
"592","Oversight Board (United  States),  we considered the Funds internal control over"
"593","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"594","for designing our auditing  procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"595","on the financial  statements and to comply with the  requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"596","but not for the purpose of  expressing  an opinion on the  effectiveness  of the"
"597","Funds internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"598","opinion."
"599","The  management of the Fund is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining"
"600","effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.   In  fulfilling  this"
"601","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"602","expected  benefits and related costs of controls.  A funds internal control over"
"603","financial  reporting  is a process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance"
"604","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"605","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"606","accounting  principles.  A  funds  internal  control  over  financial  reporting"
"607","includes those policies and  procedures  that (1) pertain to the  maintenance of"
"608","records  that,  in  reasonable   detail,   accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the"
"609","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide  reasonable"
"610","assurance that  transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of"
"611","financial   statements  in  accordance   with  generally   accepted   accounting"
"612","principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"613","in accordance with  authorizations  of management and trustees of the trust; and"
"614","(3) provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection of"
"615","unauthorized acquisition,  use, or disposition of a funds assets that could have"
"616","a material effect on the financial statements."
"617","Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting"
"618","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"619","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"620","inadequate  because of changes in  conditions  or that the degree of  compliance"
"621","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"622","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"623","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,  in the normal"
"624","course  of  performing   their   assigned   functions,   to  prevent  or  detect"
"625","misstatements  on a timely  basis.  A material  weakness is a  deficiency,  or a"
"626","combination of deficiencies,  in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"627","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the funds"
"628","annual or interim  financial  statements  will not be prevented or detected on a"
"629","timely basis."
"630","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial reporting was for"
"631","the limited  purpose  described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily"
"632","disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material  weaknesses"
"633","under  standards  established by the Public Company  Accounting  Oversight Board"
"634","(country-regionplaceUnited  States).  However,  we noted no  deficiencies in the"
"635","Funds  internal  control over financial  reporting and its operation,  including"
"636","controls  for  safeguarding  securities,  that  we  consider  to  be a  material"
"637","weakness, as defined above, as of December 31, 2010."
"638","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"639","Trustees  of  Massachusetts  Investors  Trust and the  Securities  and  Exchange"
"640","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
