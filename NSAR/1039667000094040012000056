"1282","Spirit of America Investment Fund, Inc."
"1283","477 Jericho Turnpike"
"1284","Syosset, New York  11791"
"1285","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1286","statements of the Spirit of America Real Estate Income &"
"1287","Growth Fund, Spirit of America Large Cap Value Fund, Spirit of"
"1288","America Income Fund, and Spirit of America High Yield Tax-Free"
"1289","Bond Fund (the Funds), as of and for the year ended December"
"1290","31, 2011, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1291","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1292","considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1293","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"1294","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"1295","of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"1296","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1297","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1298","Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"1299","we express no such opinion."
"1300","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"1301","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1302","reporting.   In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1303","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"1304","benefits and related costs of controls.   A company's internal"
"1305","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1306","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1307","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1308","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1309","accepted accounting principles.   A company's internal control"
"1310","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1311","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"1312","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1313","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"1314","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1315","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1316","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1317","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"1318","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1319","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"1320","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"1321","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"1322","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1323","statements."
"1324","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1325","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1326","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1327","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1328","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"1329","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1330","deteriorate."
"1331","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1332","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1333","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1334","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1335","misstatements on a timely basis.   A material weakness is a"
"1336","deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1337","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1338","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1339","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1340","prevented or detected on a timely basis."

"1344","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"1345","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"1346","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"1347","deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1348","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1349","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).   However, we"
"1350","noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over"
"1351","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"1352","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material"
"1353","weaknesses as defined above as of December 31, 2011."

"1369","Exhibit to Sub-Item 77E - Legal Proceedings for Form N-SAR for"
"1370","12/31/2011"
"1371","On May 27, 2011, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority"
"1372","(FINRA) filed a complaint against David Lerner Associates, Inc."
"1373","(DLA), the Funds' principal underwriter and distributor, related to"
"1374","its sales practices in connection with its role as managing dealer of"
"1375","an unaffiliated Real Estate Investment Trust offering, Apple REIT"
"1376","Ten, Inc. (Apple REIT). In June 2011, several class action"
"1377","complaints were filed against DLA, Apple REIT entities and certain"
"1378","individuals, also in connection with the sale of various Apple REIT"
"1379","securities. In January 2012, FINRA amended its complaint to include"
"1380","allegations of false and misleading communications with the public in"
"1381","connection with certain correspondence with customers and investment"
"1382","seminars; and added David Lerner as an individual respondent. DLA"
"1383","intends to vigorously defend the complaints and expects to be"
"1384","vindicated in court. However, there cannot be any assurance that if"
"1385","FINRA and/or the class action plaintiffs were to ultimately be"
"1386","successful in the pursuit of the claims and if damages and/or other"
"1387","sanctions are assessed against DLA and/or Mr. Lerner, that such"
"1388","sanctions would not materially affect DLA's ability to act as the"
"1389","Funds' principal underwriter and distributor, although it is not"
"1390","considered likely at this time that such material and adverse effects"
"1391","would occur. Management currently expects that any resolution of the"
"1392","action against the Distributor will not have a material adverse"
"1393","impact on the Funds. Neither the Company nor any of the Funds are a"
"1394","party to any of the above listed investigations or actions."
"1395","On May 7, 2010 each of William Mason, the Portfolio Manager for the"
"1396","Income Fund and DLA, the Funds' principal underwriter and"
"1397","distributor, received a Notice of Complaint from the Department of"
