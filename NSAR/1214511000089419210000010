"5554","Important Notice Regarding Change in Investment Policy"
"5555","Change of Name of the Munder Internet Fund to Munder"
"5556","Growth Opportunities Fund"
"5557","At a meeting held on October 28, 2009, the Board of Trustees of"
"5558","Munder Series Trust approved a change in name of the Munder Internet"
"5559","Fund to the Munder Growth Opportunities Fund (Fund) and certain changes"
"5560","to the Funds principal investment strategies, all to be effective on"
"5561","or about January 1, 2010.  The Funds investment objective will remain"
"5562","unchanged.  The Board also approved changes to the Funds investment"
"5563","advisory fee."
"5564","Although the Fund initially will not materially modify its portfolio,"
"5565","Munder Capital Management, the Funds advisor (Advisor), expects to"
"5566","broaden its investment universe by applying the same investment strategy"
"5567","it currently uses in selecting Internet related investments to select a"
"5568","broader range of investments that offer attractive growth opportunities."
"5569","Nonetheless, the Advisor expects to continue to invest substantially"
"5570","in Internet related and information technology companies.  In addition,"
"5571","the Fund will continue to be subject to a fundamental policy that the"
"5572","Fund will concentrate (i.e., invest at least 25% of its assets) in"
"5573","companies engaged in the research, design, development, manufacturing"
"5574","or distribution of products, processes or services for use with"
"5575","Internet related businesses."
"5576","1. Effective on or about January 1, 2010, the Fund hereby changes its"
"5577","   name to the Munder Growth Opportunities Fund and amends the sections"
"5578","   entitled Principal Investment Strategies and Principal Investment"
"5579","   Risks beginning on page 2 of the Prospectus to read as follows:"
"5580","PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES"
"5581","The advisor pursues long-term capital appreciation in the Fund by"
"5582","identifying secular growth trends and investing in equity securities"
"5583","(i.e., common stocks, preferred stocks, depositary receipts, convertible"
"5584","securities and rights and warrants) of companies the advisor"
"5585","believes will benefit from these trends."
"5586","In selecting individual securities for the Fund, the advisor"
"5587","employs a bottom-up analysis, which involves a thorough review of a"
"5588","companys products and services, competitive positioning, balance"
"5589","sheet and financial stability.  In addition, the advisor attempts"
"5590","to identify and evaluate underlying growth drivers for each company"
"5591","and to arrive at a projected fair value for the company."
"5592","A substantial portion of the Funds investments will be in"
"5593","companies positioned to benefit from the secular growth of:"
"5594","The Internet, including companies whose core business models"
"5595","are focused primarily on the Internet, companies that provide the"
"5596","hardware, services and software components that enable advancement"
"5597","or facilitate the usage of the Internet, and companies across a broad"
"5598","range of industries and sectors that utilize the Internet to enhance"
"5599","their business models; and Science and technology, including companies"
"5600","whose core business models are primarily focused on science and"
"5601","technology and companies that benefit from scientific or"
"5602","technological advances."
"5603","The Fund is subject to a fundamental policy, which cannot be"
"5604","changed without shareholder approval, to concentrate (i.e., invest"
"5605","at least 25% of its total assets) in securities of companies engaged in"
"5606","the research, design, development, manufacturing or distribution of"
"5607","products, processes or services for use with Internet related businesses."
"5608","As a result of the foregoing strategies and fundamental policy, the Fund"
"5609","is likely to have a significant level of its investments within the"
"5610","information technology sector.  The Fund may also invest in other sectors,"
"5611","industries and types of companies that the advisor believes exhibit"
"5612","attractive growth characteristics."
"5613","Although the Fund will primarily be invested in domestic securities,"
"5614","up to 25% of the Funds assets may be invested in foreign securities,"
"5615","including emerging market country securities. There is no limit on"
"5616","the market capitalization in which the Fund may invest; therefore,"
"5617","the Funds investments may include small, mid and large capitalization"
"5618","companies."
"5619","The Fund may lend securities with a value of up to 33 1/3% of the Funds"
"5620","total assets (including the loan collateral) to qualified institutions."
"5621","Munder Tax-Free Short Intermediate Bond Fund:"
"5622","At the November 17, 2009 Regular Meeting of the Board of Trustees"
"5623","of Munder Series Trust (MST), the Board approved the following"
"5624","resolutions relating to the investment objective change for"
"5625","the Munder Tax-Free Short & Intermediate Bond Fund:"
"5626","      RESOLVED, that, effective on January 1, 2010, the change to"
"5627","the Tax-Free Short & Intermediate Bond Funds investment objective as follows:"
"5628","To protect capital while providing a competitive level of tax exempt income"
"5629","be, and hereby is, ratified and approved; and further"
"5630","      RESOLVED, that the preparation and filing of supplements or amendments"
"5631","to any registration statement, and the making of any other federal or"
"5632","state filing, execution of documents and taking of such other actions"
"5633","by the appropriate officers of MST as may be necessary or appropriate"
"5634","to carry out the purposes and intents of the preceding resolutions be,"
"5635","and hereby are, ratified and approved."
"5636","In addition, the following description of the change in the investment"
"5637","objective was included in the Prospectus and Summary Prospectus,"
"5638","each dated October 31, 2009:"
"5639","INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE"
"5640","Until January 1, 2010, the Funds investment objective is to provide"
"5641","a competitive level of current interest income exempt from regular"
"5642","federal income taxes and a total return which, over time, exceeds"
"5643","the return provided by tax-free money market instruments. Its"
"5644","secondary objective is preservation of capital. After that date,"
"5645","the Funds investment objective will be to protect capital while"
"5646","providing a competitive level of tax exempt income."

"6548","<TEXT>"
"6549","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"6550","To the Shareholders and"
"6551","Board of Trustees of Munder Series Trust"
"6552","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"6553","of Munder Series Trust  (the Trust) as of and for the year ended"
"6554","June 30, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"6555","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trusts"
"6556","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"6557","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"6558","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"6559","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"6560","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trusts"
"6561","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express"
"6562","no such opinion."
"6563","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"6564","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"6565","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"6566","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"6567","related costs of controls. A companys internal control over"
"6568","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"6569","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"6570","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"6571","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"6572","companys internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"6573","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"6574","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"6575","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"6576","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"6577","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"6578","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"6579","the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"6580","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"6581","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"6582","acquisition, use or disposition of a companys assets that could have"
"6583","a material effect on the financial statements."
"6584","because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"6585","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"6586","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"6587","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"6588","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"6589","procedures may deteriorate."
"6590","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"6591","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"6592","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"6593","or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"6594","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"6595","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"6596","companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"6597","detected on a timely basis."
"6598","Our consideration of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting"
"6599","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"6600","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"6601","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"6602","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"6603","in the Trusts internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"6604","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"6605","material weakness as defined above as of June 30, 2010."
"6606","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"6607","and the Board of Trustees of Munder Series Trust and the Securities and"
"6608","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"6609","anyone other than these specified parties."
