"515","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"516","To the Board of Trustees of Legg Mason Investment Trust and"
"517","Shareholders of Legg Mason Opportunity Trust:"
"518","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"519","statements of Legg Mason Opportunity Trust (comprising Legg"
"520","Mason Investment Trust, the Company) as of and for the year"
"521","ended December 31, 2016, in accordance with the standards of"
"522","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"523","we considered the Company's internal control over financial"
"524","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"525","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"526","of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"527","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"528","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"529","Company's internal control over financial reporting."
"530","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness"
"531","of the Company's internal control over financial reporting."
"532","The management of the Company is responsible for establishing"
"533","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"534","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"535","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"536","benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"537","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"538","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"539","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"540","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"541","accounting principles.  A company's internal control over"
"542","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"543","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"544","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"545","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"546","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"547","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"548","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"549","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"550","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"551","trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"552","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"553","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"554","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"555","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"556","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"557","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"558","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"559","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"560","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"561","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"562","exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"563","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"564","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"565","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"566","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"567","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"568","material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim"
"569","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"570","timely basis."
"571","Our consideration of the Company's internal control over"
"572","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"573","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"574","deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that"
"575","might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"576","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"577","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Company's internal"
"578","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"579","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be"
"580","material weaknesses as defined above as of December 31, 2016."
"581","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"582","management and the Board of Trustees of Legg Mason Investment"
"583","Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"584","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"585","these specified parties."

"612","SUPPLEMENT DATED SEPTEMBER 23, 2016 TO THE SUMMARY PROSPECTUSES, PROSPECTUSES"
"613","AND STATEMENTS OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DATED MAY 1, 2016 FOR LEGG MASON"
"614","OPPORTUNITY TRUST AND FEBRUARY 1, 2016 FOR MILLER INCOME OPPORTUNITY TRUST"
"615","On August 11, 2016, Legg Mason, Inc. (Legg Mason) announced a definitive"
"616","agreement to sell Legg Mason's ownership stake in LMM LLC (LMM) to Bill"
"617","Miller. Currently, 50% of LMM is owned by Legg Mason and 50% of LMM is owned"
"618","by Mr. Miller and an entity controlled by him. The transaction is targeted to"
"619","close (the Closing) in early 2017, but is subject to certain conditions,"
"620","and may be delayed or may not close under certain circumstances. LMM serves"
"621","as the investment manager to Legg Mason Opportunity Trust, a series of Legg"
"622","Mason Investment Trust, and as subadviser to the Miller Income Opportunity"
"623","Trust, a series of Legg Mason Global Asset Management Trust. Legg Mason"
"624","Partners Fund Advisor, LLC (LMPFA), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Legg"
"625","Mason, serves as the administrator to the Legg Mason Opportunity Trust and"
"626","the investment manager to the Miller Income Opportunity Trust."
"627","In connection with the transaction, LMPFA and LMM recommended to each fund's"
"628","Board of Trustees that they approve a reorganization pursuant to which each"
"629","fund will transfer all of its assets to a corresponding newly organized"
"630","series (each, an Acquiring Fund) of the Trust for Advised Portfolios (the"
"631","TAP Trust) (a mutual fund company which is not affiliated with Legg Mason)"
"632","in return for shares of the corresponding Acquiring Fund and the Acquiring"
"633","Fund's assumption of all of the fund's liabilities. Each fund will then"
"634","distribute the shares it receives from the Acquiring Fund to its"
"635","shareholders. In this way, shareholders of Legg Mason Opportunity Trust and"
"636","Miller Income Opportunity Trust will become shareholders of the corresponding"
"637","Acquiring Fund. Legg Mason Opportunity Trust and Miller Income Opportunity"
"638","Trust would then be terminated. On August 31, 2016, each fund's Board of"
"639","Trustees approved the applicable fund reorganization, subject to shareholder"
"640","approval and certain other conditions."
"641","LMM will serve as investment adviser for each Acquiring Fund, thereby"
"642","maintaining the continuity of each fund's investment program. Members of each"
"643","fund's portfolio management team are expected to serve in the same capacity"
"644","for the Acquiring Fund after the fund reorganization. The Closing will have"
"645","the effect of terminating LMM's investment management agreement for Legg"
"646","Mason Opportunity Trust and subadvisory agreement for Miller Income"
"647","Opportunity Trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940."
"648","No sales loads, commissions, or other similar fee will be charged in"
"649","connection with the fund reorganization. A fund will not bear any costs of"
"650","the fund reorganization. The costs of the fund reorganization will be borne"
"651","by LMM, LMPFA, or their affiliates."
"652","Each fund reorganization is subject to the satisfaction of certain"
"653","conditions, including approval by fund shareholders, and shareholder approval"
"654","of the reorganization of the other fund. If the required conditions are"
"655","satisfied, each fund reorganization is expected to occur on or about"
"656","February 24, 2017 or such other date as the parties may agree. While it is"
"657","currently anticipated that each fund's reorganization will take place"
"658","concurrently, the reorganizations may take place at different times or"
"659","certain other conditions of the transaction may be waived with the approval"
"660","of the Boards. Prior to the fund reorganization, shareholders can continue to"
"661","purchase, redeem and exchange shares subject to certain limitations described"
"662","below and in each fund's Prospectus. Only shareholders who hold a fund's"
"663","shares as of the close of business on October 3, 2016 will have the"
"664","opportunity to vote on the applicable fund reorganization. Before the special"
"665","meetings, shareholders of the funds will receive a combined prospectus/proxy"
"666","statement that discusses the fund reorganizations and other matters."
"667","Effective immediately, Class R1 shares of Legg Mason Opportunity Trust and"
"668","Class A2 and Class R shares of Miller Income Opportunity Trust will be closed"
"669","to new purchases and incoming exchanges."
"670","Effective as of the close of business one day prior to the fund"
"671","reorganization, each fund's exchange privilege with other funds in the Legg"
"672","Mason family of funds will cease. Shareholders of each fund will be allowed"
"673","to purchase and redeem shares through the date of the fund reorganization."
"674","It is expected that neither fund nor its shareholders will recognize gain or"
"675","loss as a direct result of the respective fund reorganization and that the"
"676","aggregate tax basis in the Acquiring Fund shares received by the fund"
"677","shareholder will be the same as the shareholder's aggregate tax basis in the"
"678","fund shares. You should talk to your tax adviser about any state, local and"
"679","other tax consequences of your fund's reorganization."
"680","This document is not an offer to sell shares of either Acquiring Fund, nor is"
"681","it a solicitation of an offer to buy any such shares or of any proxy. Proxy"
"682","materials describing the fund reorganizations are expected to be mailed in"
"683","November 2016. Please read the proxy material carefully, when it is"
"684","available, because it contains important information about the fund"
"685","reorganizations and the Acquiring Funds."
