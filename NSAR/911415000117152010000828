"1206","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"1207","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"

"1210","<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>The management of the Funds is responsible"
"1211","for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"

"1215","A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"

"1217","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"

"1219","with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"

"1223","<P STYLE=font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1224","control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"
