"2595","EXHIBIT ITEM No. 77D (g): Policies with"
"2596","respect to security investments"
"2597","From Statement of Additional Information Supplement GOF SA1 11/16:"
"2598","Franklin Alternative Strategies Funds"
"2599","Franklin K2 Alternative Strategies Fund"
"2600","Franklin K2 Global Macro Opportunities Fund"
"2601","Franklin K2 Long Short Credit Fund"
"2602","Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund"
"2603","The Statement of Additional Information is amended as follows:"
"2604","For all Funds, the Goals, Strategies and Risks - Glossary of
Investments, Techniques, Strategies and Their Risks -
Derivative instruments - Interest rate swaps section is"
"2605","replaced with the following:"
"2606","Interest rate swaps.  An interest rate swap is an agreement"
"2607","between two parties to exchange interest rate payment obligations."
"2608","Typically, one party's obligation is based on an interest rate"
"2609","fixed to maturity while the other party's obligation is based"
"2610","on an interest rate that changes in accordance with changes"
"2611","in a designated benchmark (for example, the London Interbank"
"2612","Offered Rate (LIBOR), prime rate, commercial paper rate, or"
"2613","other benchmarks). Alternatively, both payment obligations"
"2614","may be based on an interest rate that changes in accordance with"
"2615","changes in a designated benchmark (also known as a basis swap)."
"2616","In a basis swap, the rates may be based on different"
"2617","benchmarks (for example, LIBOR versus commercial paper) or"
"2618","on different terms of the same benchmark (for example, one-month"
"2619","LIBOR versus three-month LIBOR). Each party's payment obligation"
"2620","under an interest rate swap is determined by reference to a"
"2621","specified notional amount of money. Therefore, interest rate"
"2622","swaps generally do not involve the delivery of securities, other"
"2623","underlying instruments, or principal amounts; rather they entail"
"2624","the exchange of cash payments based on the application of the"
"2625","designated interest rates to the notional amount. Accordingly,"
"2626","barring swap counterparty or FCM default, the risk of loss in an"
"2627","interest rate swap is limited to the net amount of interest"
"2628","payments that the Fund is obligated to make or"
"2629","receive (as applicable), as well as any early termination"
"2630","payment payable by or to the Fund upon early termination of the swap."
"2631","By swapping fixed interest rate payments for floating payments, an"
"2632","interest rate swap can be used to increase or decrease the Fund's"
"2633","exposure to various interest rates, including to hedge interest"
"2634","rate risk. Interest rate swaps are generally used to permit the"
"2635","party seeking a floating rate obligation the opportunity to"
"2636","acquire such obligation at a rate lower than is directly"
"2637","available in the credit markets, while permitting the party"
"2638","desiring a fixed-rate obligation the opportunity to acquire"
"2639","such a fixed-rate obligation, also frequently at a rate lower"
"2640","than is directly available in the credit markets. The success"
"2641","of such a transaction depends in large part on the availability"
"2642","of fixed-rate obligations at interest (or coupon) rates low"
"2643","enough to cover the costs involved. Similarly, a basis swap"
"2644","can be used to increase or decrease the Fund's exposure to"
"2645","various interest rates, including to hedge against or speculate"
"2646","on the spread between the two indexes, or to manage duration. An"
"2647","interest rate swap transaction is affected by changes in interest"
"2648","rates, which, in turn, may affect the prepayment rate of any"
"2649","underlying debt obligations upon which the interest rate"
"2650","swap is based."

"3010","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"3011","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"3012","Franklin Alternative Strategies Funds:"
"3013","In planning and performing our audits of the (consolidated)"
"3014","financial statements of Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy"
"3015","Fund, Franklin K2 Alternative Strategies Fund, Franklin K2 Long"
"3016","Short Credit Fund and Franklin K2 Global Macro Opportunities"
"3017","Fund (four of the Funds comprising Franklin Alternative Strategies"
"3018","Funds) (collectively, the Funds) as of May 31, 2017 and for the"
"3019","year ended May 31, 2017 for Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy"
"3020","Fund and Franklin K2 Alternative Strategies Fund and Franklin K2"
"3021","Long Short Credit Fund and for the period"
"3022","from July 11, 2016 (commencement of operations) through May 31, 2017"
"3023","for Franklin K2 Global Macro Opportunities Fund, in accordance"
"3024","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"3025","Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal control"
"3026","over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"3027","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"3028","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"3029","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"3030","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"3031","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express"
"3032","no such opinion."
"3033","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"3034","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"3035","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"3036","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"3037","costs of controls. A company's internal control over financial"
"3038","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"3039","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"3040","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"3041","generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal"
"3042","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"3043","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"3044","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"3045","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"3046","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"3047","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"3048","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"3049","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only"
"3050","in accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"3051","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"3052","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"3053","use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"3054","material effect on the financial statements."
"3055","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"3056","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"3057","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"3058","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3059","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"3060","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3061","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"3062","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"3063","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"3064","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
"3065","basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"3066","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"3067","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"3068","misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial"
"3069","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3070","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3071","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"3072","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"3073","in internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"3074","standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"3075","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"3076","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"3077","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"3078","securities that we consider to be a material weakness as defined"
"3079","above as of May 31, 2017."
"3080","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"3081","management and Board of Trustees of Franklin Alternative"
"3082","Strategies Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"3083","and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
"3084","other than these specified parties."
