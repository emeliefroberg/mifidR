"1764","January 31, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1765","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"

"1768","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"1769","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"

"1787","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1788","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"

"1803","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1804","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"

"1806","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
