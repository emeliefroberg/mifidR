"4048","reporting. In fulfilling this"
"4049","responsibility, estimates and"
"4050","judgments by management are"
"4051","required to assess the expected"
"4052","benefits and related costs of"
"4053","controls. A company?s internal"
"4054","control over financial"
"4055","reporting is a process designed"
"4056","to provide reasonable"
"4057","assurance regarding the"
"4058","reliability of financial"
"4059","reporting and the preparation"
"4060","of financial statements for"
"4061","external purposes in"
"4062","accordance with generally"
"4063","accepted accounting"
"4064","principles. A company?s"
"4065","internal control over financial"
"4066","reporting includes those"
"4067","policies and procedures that"
"4068","(1) pertain to the maintenance"
"4069","of records that, in reasonable"
"4070","detail, accurately and fairly"
"4071","reflect the transactions and"
"4072","dispositions of the assets of"
"4073","the company; (2) provide"
"4074","reasonable assurance that"
"4075","transactions are recorded as"
"4076","necessary to permit"
"4077","preparation of financial"
"4078","statements in accordance with"
"4079","generally accepted accounting"
"4080","principles, and that receipts"
"4081","and expenditures of the"
"4082","company are being made in"
"4083","accordance with"
"4084","authorizations of management"
"4085","and directors of the company;"
"4086","and (3) provide reasonable"
"4087","assurance regarding"
"4088","prevention or timely detection"
"4089","of the unauthorized"
"4090","acquisition, use, or disposition"
"4091","of the company?s assets that"
"4092","could have a material effect on"
"4093","the financial statements."
"4094","Because of its inherent"
"4095","limitations, internal control"
"4096","over financial reporting may"
"4097","not prevent or detect"
"4098","misstatements. Also,"
"4099","projections of any evaluation"
"4100","of effectiveness to future"
"4101","periods are subject to the risk"
"4102","that controls may become"
"4103","inadequate because of changes"
"4104","in conditions, or that the"
"4105","degree of compliance with the"
"4106","policies or procedures may"
"4107","deteriorate."
"4108","A deficiency in internal"
"4109","control over financial"
"4110","reporting exists when the"
"4111","design or operation of a"
"4112","control does not allow"
"4113","management or employees, in"
"4114","the normal course of"
"4115","performing their assigned"
"4116","functions, to prevent or detect"
"4117","misstatements on a timely"
"4118","basis. A material weakness is"
"4119","a deficiency, or a combination"
"4120","of deficiencies, in internal"
"4121","control over financial"
"4122","reporting, such that there is a"
"4123","reasonable possibility that a"
"4124","material misstatement of the"
"4125","Funds? annual or interim"
"4126","financial statements will not"
"4127","be prevented or detected on a"
"4128","timely basis."
"4129","Our consideration of the"
"4130","Funds? internal control over"
"4131","financial reporting was for the"
"4132","limited purpose described in"

gross negligence, or reckless
disregard of the obligations or
duties under this Contract on the
part of such Co-Adviser, each
Co-Adviser shall not be liable to
the Trust or to any of the Funds
or to any shareholder for any act
or omission in the course of or
connected in any way with
rendering services or for any
losses that may be sustained in

may be amended at any time by
agreement of the parties provided
that the amendment shall be
approved both by the vote of a
majority of the Trustees of the
Trust, including a majority of the

Co-Adviser under this Contract

Adviser, the trustees, officers,
employees, or agents of such Co-
Adviser, or any of them.
       16.	Each Co-
Adviser agrees to maintain the
security and confidentiality of
nonpublic personal information
(NPI?) of Fund customers and
consumers, as those terms are
defined in Regulation S-P, 17
CFR Part 248.  Each Co-Adviser
agrees to use and redisclose such
NPI for the limited purposes of
processing and servicing
transactions; for specific law

purposes; and to service providers
or in connection with joint
marketing arrangements directed

Inc. and the Trust.
       18.	This Contract
shall be construed in accordance
with and governed by the laws of
the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.
       19.	This Contract

LIMITED POWER OF
ATTORNEY


	KNOW ALL MEN BY
THESE PRESENTS, dated as of
August 15, 2014, that Federated
Equity Funds, a business trust
duly organized under the laws of
the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts (the ?Trust?), does
hereby nominate, constitute and
appoint each of Federated Global
Investment Management Corp., a
business corporation duly
organized under the laws of the
State of Delaware, Federated
Equity Management Company of
Pennsylvania, a statutory trust
duly organized under the laws of
the State of Delaware,  and
Federated Investment
Management Company, a
statutory trust duly organized
under the laws of the State of
Delaware (each, severally, a ?Co-
Adviser?), to act hereunder as the
true and lawful agent and
attorney-in-fact of the Trust,
acting severally on behalf of each
of the series portfolios for which
such Co-Adviser acts as an
investment adviser shown on
Schedule 1 attached hereto and
incorporated by reference herein
(each such series portfolio being
hereinafter referred to as a
?Fund? and collectively as the
?Funds?), for the specific purpose
of executing and delivering all
such agreements, instruments,
contracts, assignments, bond
powers, stock powers, transfer
instructions, receipts, waivers,
consents and other documents,
and performing all such acts, as a
Co-Adviser may deem necessary
or reasonably desirable, related to
the acquisition, disposition and/or
reinvestment of the funds and
assets of a Fund of the Trust in
accordance with Adviser?s
supervision of the investment,
sale and reinvestment of the
funds and assets of each Fund
pursuant to the authority granted
to such Co-Adviser as investment
adviser of each Fund under that
certain investment advisory
contract dated August 14, 2014
by and between the Trust and its
Co-Advisers (such investment
advisory contract, as may be
amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to
time is hereinafter referred to as
the ?Investment Advisory
Contract?).

	Each Co-Adviser shall
exercise or omit to exercise the
powers and authorities granted
herein in each case as such Co-
Adviser in its sole and absolute
discretion deems desirable or
appropriate under existing
circumstances.  No Co-Adviser
shall be required hereby to act
collectively, or in concert, with
another Co-Adviser.  The Trust
hereby ratifies and confirms as
good and effectual, at law or in
equity, all that a Co-Adviser, and
its officers and employees, may
do by virtue hereof.  However,
despite the above provisions,
nothing herein shall be construed
as imposing a duty on any Co-
Adviser to act or assume
responsibility for any matters
referred to above or other matters
even though such Co-Adviser
may have power or authority
hereunder to do so.  Nothing in
this Limited Power of Attorney
shall be construed (i) to be an
amendment or modifications of,
or supplement to, the Investment
Advisory Contract, (ii) to amend,
modify, limit or denigrate any
duties, obligations or liabilities of
a Co-Adviser under the terms of
the Investment Advisory Contract
or (iii) exonerate, relieve or
release a Co-Adviser from any
losses, obligations, penalties,
actions, judgments and suits and
other costs, expenses and
disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever which may be
imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against such Co-Adviser
(x) under the terms of the
Investment Advisory Contract or
(y) at law, or in equity, for the
performance of its duties as the
investment adviser of any of the
Funds.

	The Trust hereby agrees
to indemnify and save harmless
each Co-Adviser and its Trustees,
officers and employees (each of
the foregoing an ?Indemnified
Party? and collectively the
?Indemnified Parties?) against
and from any and all losses,
obligations, penalties, actions,
judgments and suits and other
costs, expenses and
disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever which may be
imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against an Indemnified
Party, other than as a
consequence of gross negligence
or willful misconduct on the part
of an Indemnified Party, arising
out of or in connection with this
Limited Power of Attorney or any
other agreement, instrument or
document executed in connection
with the exercise of the authority
granted to such Co-Adviser
herein to act on behalf of the
Trust, including without
limitation the reasonable costs,
expenses and disbursements in
connection with defending such
Indemnified Party against any
claim or liability related to the
exercise or performance of any of
such Co-Adviser?s powers or
duties under this Limited Power
of Attorney or any of the other
agreements, instruments or
documents executed in
connection with the exercise of
the authority granted to such Co-
Adviser herein to act on behalf of
the Trust, or the taking of any
action under or in connection
with any of the foregoing.  The
obligations of the Trust under this
paragraph shall survive the
termination of this Limited Power
of Attorney with respect to
actions taken by a Co-Adviser on
behalf of the Trust during the
term of this Limited Power of
Attorney.  No Fund shall have
any joint or several obligations
with any other Fund to reimburse
or indemnify an Indemnified
Party for any action, event, matter
or occurrence performed or
omitted by or on behalf of a Co-
Adviser in its capacity as agent or
attorney-in-fact of Trust acting on
behalf of any other Fund
hereunder.

	Any person, partnership,
corporation or other legal entity
dealing with a Co-Adviser in its
capacity as attorney-in-fact
hereunder for the Trust is hereby
expressly put on notice that such
Co-Adviser is acting solely in the
capacity as an agent of the Trust
and that any such person,
partnership, corporation or other
legal entity must look solely to
the Trust in question for
enforcement of any claim against
the Trust, as such Co-Adviser
assumes no personal liability
whatsoever for obligations of the
Trust entered into by such Co-
Adviser in its capacity as
attorney-in-fact for the Trust.

	Each person,
partnership, corporation or other
legal entity which deals with a
Fund of the Trust through a Co-
Adviser in its capacity as agent
and attorney-in-fact of the Trust,
is hereby expressly put on notice
(i) that all persons or entities
dealing with the Trust must look
solely to the assets of the Fund of
the Trust on whose behalf such
Co-Adviser is acting pursuant to
its powers hereunder for
enforcement of any claim against
the Trust, as the Trustees, officers
and/or agents of such Trust, the
shareholders of the various
classes of shares of the Trust and
the other Funds of the Trust
assume no personal liability
whatsoever for obligations
entered into on behalf of such
Fund of the Trust, and (ii) that the
rights, liabilities and obligations
of any one Fund are separate and
distinct from those of any other
Fund of the Trust.

	The execution of this
Limited Power of Attorney by the
Trust acting on behalf of the
several Funds shall not be
deemed to evidence the existence
of any express or implied joint
undertaking or appointment by
and among any or all of the
Funds.  Liability for or recourse
under or upon any undertaking of
a Co-Adviser pursuant to the
power or authority granted to
such Co-Adviser under this
Limited Power of Attorney under
any rule of law, statute or
constitution or by the
enforcement of any assessment or
penalty or by legal or equitable
proceedings or otherwise shall be
limited only to the assets of the
Fund of the Trust on whose
behalf such Co-Adviser was
acting pursuant to the authority
granted hereunder.

	The Trust hereby agrees
that no person, partnership,
corporation or other legal entity
dealing with a Co-Adviser shall
be bound to inquire into such Co-
Adviser?s power and authority
hereunder and any such person,
partnership, corporation or other
legal entity shall be fully
protected in relying on such
power or authority unless such
person, partnership, corporation
or other legal entity has received
prior written notice from the
Trust that this Limited Power of
Attorney has been revoked. This
Limited Power of Attorney shall
be revoked and terminated with
respect to a Fund and a Co-
Adviser automatically upon the
cancellation or termination of the
Investment Advisory Contract
between the Trust and such Co-
Adviser with respect to such
Fund.  Except as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence,
the powers and authorities herein
granted may be revoked or
terminated by the Trust at any
time provided that no such
revocation or termination shall be
effective until each Co-Adviser
has received actual notice of such
revocation or termination in
writing from the Trust.

	This Limited Power of
Attorney constitutes the entire
agreement between the Trust and
each Co-Adviser, may be
changed only by a writing signed
by each of them, and shall bind
and benefit their respective
successors and assigns; provided,
however, no Co-Adviser shall
have any  power or authority
hereunder to appoint a successor
or substitute attorney in fact for
the Trust.

	This Limited Power of
Attorney shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the
laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania without reference to
principles of conflicts of laws.  If
any provision hereof, or any
power or authority conferred
upon a Co-Adviser herein, would
be invalid or unexercisable under
applicable law, then such
provision, power or authority
shall be deemed modified to the
extent necessary to render it valid
or exercisable while most nearly
preserving its original intent, and
no provision hereof, or power or
authority conferred upon a Co-
Adviser herein, shall be affected
by the invalidity or the non-
exercisability of another
provision hereof, or of another
power or authority conferred
herein.

	This Limited Power of
Attorney may be executed in as
many identical counterparts as
may be convenient and by the
different parties hereto on
separate counterparts.  This
Limited Power of Attorney shall
become binding on the Trust
when the Trust shall have
executed at least one counterpart
and each Co-Adviser shall have
accepted its appointment by
executing this Limited Power of
Attorney.  Immediately after the
execution of a counterpart
original of this Limited Power of
Attorney and solely for the
convenience of the parties hereto,
the Trust and each Co-Adviser
will execute sufficient
counterparts so that each Co-
Adviser shall have a counterpart
executed by it and the Trust, and
the Trust shall have a counterpart
executed by the Trust and each
Co-Adviser.  Each counterpart
shall be deemed an original and
all such taken together shall
constitute but one and the same
instrument, and it shall not be
necessary in making proof of this
Limited Power of Attorney to
produce or account for more than
one such counterpart.

	IN WITNESS
WHEREOF, the Trust has caused
this Limited Power of Attorney to
be executed by its duly
authorized officer as of the date
first written above.
