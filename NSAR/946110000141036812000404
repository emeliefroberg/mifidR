"1727","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"1728","Credit Suisse Strategic Income Fund (a portfolio of Credit Suisse"
"1729","Opportunity Funds) (the Fund) as of and for the year ended October"
"1730","31, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1731","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's"
"1732","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1733","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1734","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1735","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"1736","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1737","Fund's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"1738","do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"1739","control over financial reporting."
"1740","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1741","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1742","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1743","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"1744","costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"1745","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1746","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1747","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1748","generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control"
"1749","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"1750","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1751","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1752","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"1753","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1754","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1755","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures"
"1756","of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"1757","of management and trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable"
"1758","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1759","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a"
"1760","material effect on the financial statements."
"1761","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1762","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"1763","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"1764","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1765","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1766","procedures may deteriorate."
"1767","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1768","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1769","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1770","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"1771","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1772","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1773","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"1774","of the fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1775","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1776","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1777","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1778","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1779","internal control over financial reporting that might be"
"1780","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1781","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"1782","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"1783","and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"1784","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of"
"1785","October 31, 2012."

"1902","Dear Sirs:"
"1903","      Credit Suisse Asset Management, LLC (the Adviser), a Delaware"
"1904","limited liability company, herewith confirms its agreement with Credit"
"1905","Suisse Asset Management Limited (the Sub-Adviser), a company"
"1906","incorporated in England with limited liability, as follows:"
"1907","1.	Investment Description; Appointment"
"1908","          The Adviser and Credit Suisse Opportunity Funds (the"
"1909","Trust), a Delaware statutory trust, have entered into an Amended"
"1910","and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement dated as of August __,"
"1911","2012 (the Advisory Agreement), pursuant to which the Adviser"
"1912","acts as investment adviser with respect to Credit Suisse Strategic"
"1913","Income Fund (the Fund), a series of the Trust.  The Advisory"
"1914","Agreement authorizes the Adviser to engage a sub-adviser to provide"
"1915","advisory services with respect to the Fund.  The Adviser desires to"
"1916","employ and hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser to act as its sub-adviser"
"1917","upon the terms set forth in this Agreement.  The Sub-Adviser accepts"
"1918","the appointment and agrees to furnish the services set forth below"
"1919","for the compensation provided for herein."
"1920","2.	Services as Sub-Adviser"
"1921","         The Sub-Adviser will provide investment advisory and"
"1922","portfolio management advice to all or that portion of the Fund's"
"1923","assets designated by the Adviser from time to time (the Assets)."
"1924","The Adviser will inform the Sub-Adviser, on a monthly basis, of any"
"1925","changes to the amount of Assets.  Subject to the supervision and"
"1926","direction of the Board of Trustees of the Trust and the Adviser,"
"1927","the Sub-Adviser will (a) act in strict conformity with the Trust's"
"1928","Agreement and Declaration of Trust, the Investment Company Act of"
"1929","1940 (the 1940 Act) and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940"
"1930","(the Advisers Act), as the same may from time to time be amended,"
"1931","(b) manage the Assets in accordance with the Fund's investment"
"1932","objective and policies as stated in the Fund's Prospectus(es) and"
"1933","Statement(s) of Additional Information (the Prospectus and SAI,"
"1934","respectively) and investment parameters provided by the Adviser in"
"1935","writing from time to time, (c) make investment decisions for the Fund"
"1936","with respect to the Assets, (d) place purchase and sale orders for"
"1937","securities on behalf of the Fund with respect to the Assets, and (e)"
"1938","exercise voting rights in respect of the Assets for the Fund.  In"
"1939","providing those services, the Sub-Adviser will provide investment"
"1940","research and supervision of the Assets and conduct a continual program"
"1941","of investment, evaluation and, if appropriate, sale and reinvestment"
"1942","of the Assets.  In addition, the Sub-Adviser will furnish the Fund"
"1943","with whatever statistical information the Fund may reasonably request"
"1944","with respect to the securities that the Fund may hold or contemplate"
"1945","purchasing."
"1946","         Copies of the Prospectus and SAI have been or will be"
"1947","submitted to the Sub-Adviser.  The Adviser agrees to promptly"
"1948","provide the Sub-Adviser with copies of all amendments to the"
"1949","Prospectus and SAI on an ongoing basis.  The Adviser will"
"1950","incorporate the Fund into its monitoring program and provide"
"1951","quarterly reports to the Sub-Adviser relating to surveillance and"
"1952","investment guideline monitoring. Additionally the Adviser will"
"1953","provide a monthly report to the Sub-Adviser stating the amount of"
"1954","assets under management the Sub-Adviser is managing for the Fund."
"1955","         The Sub-Adviser may enter into, make and perform such"
"1956","contracts, agreements and other undertakings as may be required"
"1957","to give effect to the powers delegated herein]."
"1958","         The Sub-Adviser will not have custody over the Assets"
"1959","at any time. For the avoidance of doubt the Sub-Adviser shall"
"1960","not hold client assets (including client money) as defined by the"
"1961","Financial Services Authority (FSA). The Fund's custodian is not"
"1962","an agent selected by the Sub-Adviser and the Sub-Adviser does not"
"1963","accept any liability for any default by the Fund's custodian and"
"1964","is not bound to supervise the Fund's custodian. The Adviser shall"
"1965","instruct the Fund's custodian to provide the Sub-Adviser with such"
"1966","details of the Assets as the Sub-Adviser may require."
"1967","3.	Brokerage"
"1968","         In executing transactions for the Fund, selecting brokers"
"1969","or dealers and negotiating any brokerage commission rates, the"
"1970","Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall"
"1971","terms available in accordance with the Credit Suisse Global and UK"
"1972","Best Execution Policies (the Best Execution Policies) and all"
"1973","applicable laws and regulations, including the requirements of the"
"1974","FSA. By entering into this agreement the Adviser confirms its"
"1975","acceptance of the Best Execution Policies in its own right and on"
"1976","behalf of its clients. If there are any changes to the Best"
"1977","Execution Policies, revised details will be posted on the Sub-"
"1978","Adviser's website (https://www.credit-suisse.com/asset_management/"
"1979","downloads/marketing/order_execution_policy.pdf) and, if the Adviser"
"1980","continues to use the Sub-Adviser's services after that period, it"
"1981","will be deemed to have consented to the change of policy. Where"
"1982","such a change to the Best Execution Policy is a material change,"
"1983","the Sub- Adviser shall notify the Adviser in writing prior to the"
"1984","change being effected. To the extent that the Adviser provides the"
"1985","Sub- Adviser with a specific instruction in relation to an order"
"1986","or any part of an order including selecting to execute on a"
"1987","particular venue, in following the Adviser's instructions the"
"1988","Sub-Adviser will be deemed to have taken all reasonable steps to"
"1989","provide the best possible result in respect of that order or aspect"
"1990","of the order. By entering into this Agreement, the Adviser expressly"
"1991","consents to the Sub-Adviser executing orders outside a regulated"
"1992","market or multi-lateral trading facility (as those terms are"
"1993","defined in the FSA Rules). In assessing the best overall terms"
"1994","available for any portfolio transaction, the Sub-Adviser will"
"1995","consider all factors it deems relevant including, but not limited to,"
"1996","breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security,"
"1997","the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or"
"1998","dealer and the reasonableness of any commission for the specific"
"1999","transaction and for transactions executed through the broker or"
"2000","dealer in the aggregate.  In selecting brokers or dealers to"
"2001","execute a particular transaction and in evaluating the best"
"2002","overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser may consider the"
"2003","brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in"
"2004","Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as the"
"2005","same may from time to time be amended) provided to the Fund"
"2006","and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or an"
"2007","affiliate exercises investment discretion."
"2008","         On occasions when the Sub-Adviser deems the purchase or"
"2009","sale of a security to be in the best interest of the Fund as well"
"2010","as of other investment advisory clients of the Sub-Adviser, the"
"2011","Sub-Adviser may, to the extent permitted by the Credit Suisse"
"2012","Global Allocation Policy applicable laws and regulations,"
"2013","including the requirements of the FSA, but shall not be obligated"
"2014","to, aggregate the securities to be so sold or purchased with those"
"2015","of its other clients.  In such event, allocation of the securities"
"2016","so purchased or sold, as well as the expenses incurred in the"
"2017","transaction, will be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that is"
"2018","fair and equitable, in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser, in the"
"2019","exercise of its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to such other"
"2020","clients, and in accordance with the Credit Suisse Global Allocation"
"2021","Policy.  The Sub-Adviser shall provide to the Adviser and the Fund"
"2022","all information reasonably requested by the Adviser and the Fund"
"2023","relating to the decisions made by the Sub-Adviser regarding"
"2024","allocation of securities purchased or sold, as well as the"
"2025","expenses incurred in a transaction, among the Fund and the"
"2026","Sub-Adviser's other investment advisory clients."
"2027","4.	Information Provided to the Fund"
"2028","         The Sub-Adviser will keep the Fund informed of developments"
"2029","materially affecting the Fund, and will, on its own initiative,"
"2030","furnish the Fund from time to time with whatever information the"
"2031","Sub-Adviser believes is appropriate for this purpose."
"2032","5.	Standard of Care"
"2033","         The Sub-Adviser shall exercise its best judgment in"
"2034","rendering the services listed in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 above."
"2035","The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any error of judgment or"
"2036","mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Adviser or the"
"2037","Fund in connection with the matters to which this Agreement"
"2038","relates, provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to protect"
"2039","or purport to protect the Sub-Adviser against any liability to"
"2040","the Adviser or the Fund to which the Sub-Adviser would otherwise"
"2041","be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross"
"2042","negligence on its part in the performance of its duties or by"
"2043","reason of the Sub-Adviser's reckless disregard of its"
"2044","obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"2045","6.	Compensation"
"2046","         In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to"
"2047","this Agreement, the Adviser will pay the Sub-Adviser an annual"
"2048","fee calculated at an annual rate of [0.15]% of the Fund's average"
"2049","daily net assets.  Such fee shall be calculated and payable monthly."
"2050","         The fee for the period from the date of this Agreement to"
"2051","the end of the year shall be prorated according to the proportion"
"2052","that such period bears to the full yearly period.  Upon any"
"2053","termination of this Agreement before the end of a year, the fee for"
"2054","such part of that year shall be prorated according to the proportion"
"2055","that such period bears to the full yearly period and shall be payable"
"2056","upon the date of termination of this Agreement.  For the purpose of"
"2057","determining fees payable to the Sub-Adviser, the value of the Fund's"
"2058","net assets shall be computed at the times and in the manner specified"
"2059","in the Fund's Prospectus or SAI."
"2060","7.	Expenses"
"2061","         The Sub-Adviser will bear all expenses in connection with"
"2062","the performance of its services under this Agreement."
"2063","8.	Services to Other Companies or Accounts"
"2064","         It is understood that the services of the Sub-Adviser are"
"2065","not exclusive and that the Sub-Adviser now acts, will continue to"
"2066","act and may act in the future as investment adviser to fiduciary"
"2067","and other managed accounts and to one or more other investment"
"2068","companies or series of investment companies, provided that whenever"
"2069","the Fund and one or more other accounts or investment companies or"
"2070","portfolios advised by the Sub-Adviser have available funds for"
"2071","investment, investments suitable and appropriate for each will be"
"2072","allocated in accordance with a formula believed to be equitable to"
"2073","each entity.  In some cases this procedure may adversely affect the"
"2074","size of the position obtainable for the Fund.   In addition, it is"
"2075","understood that the persons employed by the Sub-Adviser to assist"
"2076","in the performance of the Sub-Adviser's duties hereunder will not"
"2077","devote their full time to such service and nothing contained herein"
"2078","shall be deemed to limit or restrict the right of the Sub-Adviser"
"2079","or any affiliate of the Sub-Adviser to engage in and devote time"
"2080","and attention to other businesses or to render services of whatever"
"2081","kind or nature, provided that doing so does not adversely affect"
"2082","the ability of the Sub-Adviser to perform its services under this"
"2083","Agreement."
"2084","9.	Term of Agreement"
"2085","         This Agreement shall continue for an initial two-year"
"2086","period commencing on the date first written above, and thereafter"
"2087","shall continue automatically for successive annual periods,"
"2088","provided such continuance is specifically approved at least"
"2089","annually by (a) the Board of Trustees of the Trust or (b) a vote"
"2090","of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund's"
"2091","outstanding voting securities, provided that in either event the"
"2092","continuance is also approved by a majority of the Board of Trustees"
"2093","of the Trust who are not interested persons (as defined in the"
"2094","1940 Act) of the Fund or any party to this Agreement, by vote"
"2095","cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on"
"2096","such approval.  This Agreement is terminable, without penalty, by"
"2097","the Board of Trustees of the Trust or by vote of holders of a"
"2098","majority of the Fund's shares on 60 days' written notice to the"
"2099","Adviser and the Sub-Adviser, by the Adviser on 90 days' written"
"2100","notice to the Fund and the Sub-Adviser, and by the Sub-Adviser"
"2101","on 90 days' written notice to the Fund and the Adviser.  This"
"2102","Agreement will also terminate automatically in the event of its"
"2103","assignment (as defined in 1940 Act) by any party hereto."
"2104","10.	Customer Status"
"2105","         Under the rules of the FSA (the FSA Rules), customers"
"2106","must be placed in specific categories which are dictated by"
"2107","different considerations including the nature and financial"
"2108","description of the customer, the experience of the customer in"
"2109","certain investments and other factors.  On the basis of the"
"2110","information which the Adviser has given, each of the Adviser"
"2111","and the Fund shall be treated as a Professional Client (as"
"2112","defined in the FSA Rules) in relation to the services to be"
"2113","provided in accordance with this Agreement.  Each of the"
"2114","Adviser and the Fund has the right to request to  be treated"
"2115","as a Retail Client (as defined in the FSA Rules).  If the"
"2116","Sub-Adviser agrees, at its sole discretion, to categorize the"
"2117","Adviser or the Fund as a Retail Client, the Adviser or the"
"2118","Fund, as the case may be, would benefit from the higher level"
"2119","of protection that is afforded to such type of client under"
"2120","the regulatory system of the United Kingdom."
"2121","11.	Miscellaneous"
"2122","         a)	This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed"
"2123","in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York in the United"
"2124","States, including choice of law principles; provided that nothing"
"2125","herein shall be construed in a manner inconsistent with the 1940 Act,"

"2163","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2164","To the Board of Trustees of Credit Suisse Opportunity Funds"
"2165","and the Shareholders of Credit Suisse Managed Futures Strategy Fund:"
"2166","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"2167","Credit Suisse Managed Futures Strategy Fund (a portfolio of Credit"
"2168","Suisse Opportunity Funds) and consolidated Cayman subsidiary (the"
"2169","Fund) as of and for the year ended October 31, 2012, in accordance"
"2170","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"2171","(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"2172","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"2173","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2174","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"2175","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2176","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"2177","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"2178","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"2179","financial reporting."
"2180","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"2181","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"2182","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"2183","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"2184","costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"2185","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2186","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"2187","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"2188","generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control"
"2189","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"2190","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"2191","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2192","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"2193","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2194","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"2195","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures"
"2196","of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"2197","management and trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable"
"2198","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"2199","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"2200","a material effect on the financial statements."
"2201","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2202","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"2203","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"2204","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"2205","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"2206","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2207","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2208","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"2209","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"2210","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"2211","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"2212","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"2213","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"2214","of the fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"2215","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2216","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"2217","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2218","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"2219","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"2220","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"2221","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"2222","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"2223","and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities,"

"2530","Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant including,"
"2531","but not limited to, breadth of the market in the security, the"
"2532","price of the security, the financial condition and execution"
"2533","capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of"
"2534","any commission for the specific transaction and for transactions"
"2535","executed through the broker or dealer in the aggregate.  In"
"2536","selecting brokers or dealers to execute a particular transaction"
"2537","and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Adviser"
"2538","may consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms"
"2539","are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of"
"2540","1934, as the same may from time to time be amended) provided to"
"2541","each Series and Fund and/or other accounts over which the Adviser"
"2542","or an affiliate exercises investment discretion."
"2543","4.	Information Provided to the Fund"
"2544","         The Adviser will keep each Series and Fund informed of"
"2545","developments materially affecting such Series or Fund, and will,"
"2546","on its own initiative, furnish such Series or Fund from time to"
"2547","time with whatever information the Adviser believes is"
"2548","appropriate for this purpose."
"2549","5.	Standard of Care"
"2550","         The Adviser shall exercise its best judgment in"
"2551","rendering the services listed in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 above."

"2553","mistake of law or for any loss suffered by any Series or Fund"
"2554","in connection with the matters to which this Agreement relates,"
"2555","provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to protect or"
"2556","purport to protect the Adviser against any liability to each"
"2557","Fund and Series or to shareholders of such Series or Fund to"
"2558","which the Adviser would otherwise be subject by reason of willful"
"2559","misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the"
"2560","performance of its duties or by reason of the Adviser's reckless"
"2561","disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"2562","6.	Compensation"
"2563","         In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to"
"2564","this Agreement, each Series and Fund will pay the Adviser the"

"2572","the fee for such part of that year shall be prorated according"
"2573","to the proportion that such period bears to the full yearly"
"2574","period and shall be payable upon the date of termination of"

"2578","such Series' or Fund's Prospectus or SAI."
"2579","         With respect to the Credit Suisse Opportunity Funds,"
"2580","such fee shall be calculated and payable monthly. The fee for"
"2581","the Credit Suisse High Yield Bond Fund shall be computed and"
"2582","payable monthly, at the annual rate set forth for the Credit"
"2583","Suisse High Yield Bond Fund on Annex I hereto, of the average"

"2586","constituting leverage)."
"2587","7.	Expenses"

"2618","will continue to act and may act in the future as investment adviser"
"2619","to fiduciary and other managed accounts and to one or more other"
"2620","investment companies or series of investment companies, and such"
"2621","Series or Fund has no objection to the Adviser so acting, provided"
"2622","that whenever such Series or Fund and one or more other accounts or"
"2623","investment companies or portfolios advised by the Adviser have"
"2624","available funds for investment, investments suitable and appropriate"
"2625","for each will be allocated in accordance with a formula believed to"
"2626","be equitable to each entity.  Each Series and Fund recognizes that"
"2627","in some cases this procedure may adversely affect the size of the"
"2628","position obtainable for such Series or Fund.  In addition, each"
"2629","Series and Fund understands that the persons employed by the"

"2633","right of the Adviser or any affiliate of the Adviser to engage"
"2634","in and devote time and attention to other businesses or to render"
"2635","services of whatever kind or nature, provided that doing so does"

"2751","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2752","To the Board of Trustees of Credit Suisse Opportunity Funds"
"2753","and the Shareholders of Credit Suisse Multialternative Strategy Fund:"
"2754","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"2755","Credit Suisse Multialternative Strategy Fund (a portfolio of Credit"
"2756","Suisse Opportunity Funds) and consolidated Cayman subsidiary"
"2757","(the Fund) as of and for the year ended October 31, 2012, in"
"2758","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"2759","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"2760","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"2761","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"2762","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"2763","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"2764","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"2765","Fund's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"2766","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"2767","control over financial reporting."
"2768","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"2769","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"2770","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"2771","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"2772","costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"2773","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"2774","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"2775","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2776","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"2777","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"2778","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"2779","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"2780","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"2781","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2782","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"2783","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance"
"2784","with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3)"
"2785","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"2786","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets"
"2787","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2788","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2789","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"2790","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"2791","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2792","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"2793","procedures may deteriorate."
"2794","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"2795","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"2796","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"2797","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"2798","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2799","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"2800","possibility that a material misstatement of the fund's annual or"
"2801","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"2802","timely basis."
"2803","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"2804","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2805","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"2806","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"2807","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"2808","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"2809","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"2810","and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"2811","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of"
"2812","October 31, 2012."
"2813","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"2814","and the Board of Trustees of Credit Suisse Opportunity Funds and the"
"2815","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should"
"2816","not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."
