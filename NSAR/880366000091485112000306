"556","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"557","The Board of Directors"
"558","Western Asset Global Partners Income Fund Inc.:"
"559","In planning and performing our audit of the Western Asset Global"
"560","Partners Income Fund Inc.(the Fund) as of and for the year"
"561","ended August 31, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the"
"562","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"563","considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"564","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"565","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"566","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"567","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"568","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"569","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"570","express no such opinion."
"571","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"572","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"573","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"574","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"575","related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"576","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"577","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"578","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"579","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"580","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"581","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"582","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"583","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"584","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"585","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"586","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"587","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"588","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"589","and directors of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"590","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"591","acquisition, use, or disposition of the fund's assets that could"
"592","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"593","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"594","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"595","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"596","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"597","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"598","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"599","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"600","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"601","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"602","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"603","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"604","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"605","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"606","material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial"
"607","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"608","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"609","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"610","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"611","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"612","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"613","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"614","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"615","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that"
"616","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"617","August 31, 2012."
"618","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"619","management and the Board of Directors of Western Asset Global"
"620","Partners Income Fund Inc. and the Securities and Exchange"
"621","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by"

"637","TO THE PROSPECTUSES DATED DECEMBER 31, 2011 OF"
"638","LEGG MASON CLEARBRIDGE AGGRESSIVE GROWTH FUND"
"639","Effective August 1, 2012, Class R1 shares will be closed to"
"640","new purchases."
"641","The following amends anything to the contrary in the section"
"642","of the Prospectus titled Choosing a class of
shares to buy to the extent that such fund offers such classes:"
"643","When choosing between Class A and Class C shares, you should"
"644","be aware that, generally speaking, the larger the size of"
"645","your investment and the longer your investment horizon, the"
"646","more likely it will be that Class C shares will not be"
"647","as advantageous as Class A shares. The annual distribution"
"648","and/or service fees on Class C shares may cost you more"
"649","over the longer term than the front-end sales charge and"
"650","service fees you would have paid for larger purchases of"
"651","Class A shares. If you are eligible to purchase"
"652","Class I shares, you should be aware that Class I shares"
"653","are not subject to a front-end sales charge and"
"654","generally have lower annual expenses than Class A or Class"
"655","C shares."
"656","More information about the fund's classes of shares is"
"657","available through the Legg Mason funds' website."
"658","You'll find detailed information about sales charges"
"659","and ways you can qualify for reduced or waived sales"
"660","charges, including:"
"661","The contingent deferred sales charges that apply to the"
"662","redemption of Class B shares, Class C shares and certain"
"663","Class A shares"
"664","The following amends anything to the contrary in the"
"665","section of the Prospectus titled Comparing the fund's
classes to the extent that such fund offers such classes:"
"666","Contingent deferred sales charge"
"667","Class A: 1.00% on purchases of $1 million or more if you"
"668","redeem within 18 months of purchase (or within"
"669","12 months for shares purchased prior to August 1, 2012);"
"670","waived for certain investors"
"671","The following amends anything to the contrary in the section"
"672","of the Prospectus titled Sales charges - Investments of
$1 million or more; the section of the SAI titled Purchase
of Shares for each fund listed on Schedule A; and the"
"673","section of the SAI titled Additional Purchase and Redemption
Information for each fund listed on Schedule B:"
"674","You do not pay an initial sales charge when you buy"
"675","$1,000,000 or more of Class A shares. However, if"
"676","you redeem these Class A shares within 18 months of"
"677","purchase (or within 12 months for shares purchased prior"
"678","to August 1, 2012), you will pay a contingent deferred sales"
"679","charge of 1.00%."
"680","The following amends anything to the contrary in the section"
"681","of the Prospectus titled Retirement and Institutional
Investors - eligible investors for each fund (other than"
"682","Legg Mason Investment Counsel Maryland Tax Free Income Trust)"
"683","to the extent that such fund offers such classes:"
"684","Class A shares may be offered through Service Agents for"
"685","Retirement Plans with omnibus accounts held on the books"
"686","of the fund."
"687","Retirement Plans with omnibus accounts held on the books"
"688","of the fund can generally invest in Class A, Class C,"
"689","Class FI, Class R, Class I and Class IS shares."
"690","The following amends anything to the contrary in the section"
"691","of the Prospectus titled Retirement and Institutional
Investors - eligible investors - Class C shares - Retirement
Plans for each fund (other than Legg Mason Investment"
"692","Counsel Maryland Tax Free Income Trust) to the extent that"
"693","such fund offers such classes:"
"694","Certain retirement plan programs with exchange features in"
"695","effect prior to November 20, 2006, as approved by LMIS,"
"696","will be eligible for exchange from Class C shares to Class"
"697","A shares in accordance with the program terms. Please see"
"698","the SAI for more details."
"699","The following is added to the section of the SAI or, if"
"700","applicable, replaces the corresponding information in the"
"701","SAI for the fund  to the extent that such fund offers such classes:"
"702","Grandfathered Retirement Program with Exchange Features"
"703","Certain retirement plan programs with exchange features"
"704","in effect prior to November 20, 2006 (collectively, the"
"705","Grandfathered Retirement Program), that are authorized"
"706","by the distributor to offer eligible retirement plan investors"
"707","the opportunity to exchange all of their Class C shares for"
"708","Class A shares of an applicable fund sold by the distributor,"
"709","are permitted to maintain such share class exchange feature for"
"710","current and prospective retirement plan investors. Under the"
"711","Grandfathered Retirement Program, Class C shares of a fund may"
"712","be purchased by plans investing less than $3 million. Class C"
"713","shares are eligible for exchange into Class A shares not later"
"714","than eight years after the plan joins the program. They are"
"715","eligible for exchange in the following circumstances:"
"716","If a participating plan's total Class C holdings in all"
"717","non-money market funds sold by the distributor equal"
"718","at least $3,000,000 at the end of the fifth year after"
"719","the date the participating plan enrolled in the"
"720","Grandfathered Retirement Program, the participating plan"
"721","will be offered the opportunity to exchange all"
"722","of its Class C shares for Class A shares of the fund. Such"
"723","participating plans will be notified of the"
"724","pending exchange in writing within 30 days after the fifth"
"725","anniversary of the enrollment date and, unless"
"726","the exchange offer has been rejected in writing, the exchange"
"727","will occur on or about the 90th day after"
"728","the fifth anniversary date. If the participating plan does"
"729","not qualify for the five-year exchange to Class A"
"730","shares, a review of the participating plan's holdings will"
"731","be performed each quarter until either the"
"732","participating plan qualifies or the end of the eighth year."
"733","Any participating plan that has not previously qualified for"
"734","an exchange into Class A shares will be"
"735","offered the opportunity to exchange all of its Class C shares"
"736","for Class A shares of the same fund regardless of asset size"
"737","at the end of the eighth year after the date the participating"
"738","plan enrolled in the Grandfathered Retirement Program. Such plans"
"739","will be notified of the pending exchange in writing"
"740","approximately 60 days before the eighth anniversary of the"
"741","enrollment date and, unless the exchange"
"742","has been rejected in writing, the exchange will occur on or about"
"743","the eighth anniversary date. Once an"
"744","exchange has occurred, a participating plan will not be eligible"
"745","to acquire additional Class C shares, but"
"746","instead may acquire Class A shares of the same fund. Any Class C"
"747","shares not converted will continue to"
"748","be subject to the distribution fee."
"749","For further information regarding this Program, contact your"
"750","Service Agent or the transfer agent."
"751","Participating plans that enrolled in the Grandfathered Retirement"
"752","Program prior to June 2, 2003 should"
"753","contact the transfer agent for information regarding Class C"
"754","exchange privileges applicable to their plan."
