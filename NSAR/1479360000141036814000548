"2539","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of the PIMCO Equity"

"2541","In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and"
"2542","liabilities, including the schedules of investments, and the"
"2543","related statements of operations, of changes in net assets and of"
"2544","cash flows and the financial highlights present fairly, in all"
"2545","material respects, the financial position of PIMCO Balanced"
"2546","Income Fund, PIMCO Dividend and Income Builder Fund,"
"2547","PIMCO EqS(r) Dividend Fund, PIMCO EqS(r) Emerging Markets"
"2548","Fund, PIMCO EqS(r) Long/Short Fund, PIMCO Emerging Multi-"
"2549","Asset Fund and PIMCO EqS Pathfinder Fund(r) (constituting"
"2550","PIMCO Equity Series(r), hereinafter referred to as the Funds)"
"2551","at June 30, 2014, the results of their operations, the changes in"
"2552","each of their net assets, the cash flows for PIMCO EqS"
"2553","Long/Short Fund, and financial highlights of the Funds for each"
"2554","of the periods presented, in conformity with accounting"
"2555","principles generally accepted in the United States of America."
"2556","These financial statements (consolidated financial statements for"
"2557","PIMCO Emerging Multi-Asset Fund and PIMCO EqS Pathfinder"
"2558","Fund(r)) and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as"
"2559","financial statements) are the responsibility of the Funds'"
"2560","management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on"
"2561","these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted"
"2562","our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the"
"2563","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"2564","(United States).  Those standards require that we plan and"
"2565","perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether"
"2566","the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An"
"2567","audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting"
"2568","the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,"
"2569","assessing the accounting principles used and significant"
"2570","estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall"
"2571","financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits,"
"2572","which included confirmation of securities at June 30, 2014 by"
"2573","correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a"
"2574","reasonable basis for our opinion."

"2695","from time to time (Declaration of Trust), of PIMCO Equity"
"2696","Series, a Delaware statutory trust (Trust).  In the event of any"
"2697","inconsistency between the terms hereof and the terms of the"

"2699","control."
"2700","             Section 2.  Definitions.  Capitalized terms used"
"2701","herein and not herein defined are used as defined in the"
"2702","Declaration of Trust."
"2703","ARTICLE II"

"2705","             Section 1.  Principal Office.  The principal"
"2706","executive office of the Trust shall be located in Newport Beach,"
"2707","California, until such time as the Trustees may change the"
"2708","location of the principal executive office of the Trust to any"
"2709","other place."
"2710","             Section 2.  Delaware Office.  The Trustees shall"
"2711","establish a registered office in the State of Delaware and shall"
"2712","appoint as the Trust's registered agent for service of process in"
"2713","the State of Delaware an individual who is a resident of the State"
"2714","of Delaware or a Delaware corporation or a corporation"
"2715","authorized to transact business in the State of Delaware; in each"
"2716","case the business office of such registered agent for service of"
"2717","process shall be identical with the registered Delaware office of"
"2718","the Trust.  The Trustees may designate a successor resident"
"2719","agent, provided, however, that such appointment shall not"
"2720","become effective until written notice thereof is delivered to the"
"2721","Office of the Secretary of the State of Delaware."
"2722","             Section 3.  Other Offices.  The Trustees may at"
"2723","any time establish branch or subordinate offices at any place or"

"2726","ARTICLE III"
"2727","Meetings of Shareholders"
"2728","             Section 1.  Place of Meetings.  Meetings of"
"2729","Shareholders shall be held at any place designated by the"
"2730","Trustees.  In the absence of any such designation, Shareholders'"
"2731","meetings shall be held at the principal executive office of the"
"2732","Trust."
"2733","             Section 2.  Call of Meetings.  There shall be no"
"2734","annual meetings of Shareholders except as required by law."
"2735","Special meetings of the Shareholders of the Trust or of any"
"2736","Series or Class may be called at any time by the Trustees or by"
"2737","the President or the Secretary for the purpose of taking action"
"2738","upon any matter requiring the vote or authority of the"
"2739","Shareholders of the Trust or of any Series or Class as herein"
"2740","provided or provided in the Declaration of Trust or upon any"
"2741","other matter as to which such vote or authority is deemed by the"
"2742","Trustees or the President to be necessary or desirable.  Meetings"
"2743","of the Shareholders of the Trust or of any Series or Class may be"
"2744","called for any purpose deemed necessary or desirable upon the"
"2745","written request of the Shareholders holding at least ten percent"
"2746","(10%) of the Outstanding Shares of the Trust entitled to vote at"
"2747","such meeting, provided that (1) such request shall state the"
"2748","purposes of such meeting and the matters proposed to be acted"
"2749","on, and (2) the Shareholders requesting such meeting shall have"
"2750","paid to the Trust the reasonably estimated cost of preparing and"
"2751","mailing the notice thereof, which the Secretary shall determine"
"2752","and specify to such Shareholders.  If the Secretary fails for more"
"2753","than thirty (30) days to call a special meeting, the Trustees or the"
"2754","Shareholders requesting such a meeting may, in the name of the"
"2755","Secretary, call the meeting by giving the required notice.  If the"
"2756","meeting is a meeting of Shareholders of any Series or Class, but"
"2757","not a meeting of all Shareholders of the Trust, then only a special"
"2758","meeting of Shareholders of such Series or Class need be called"
"2759","and, in such case, only Shareholders of such Series or Class shall"
"2760","be entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting."
"2761","             Section 3.  Notice of Meetings of Shareholders."
"2762","All notices of meetings of Shareholders shall be sent or"
"2763","otherwise given to Shareholders in accordance with Section 4 of"
"2764","this Article III not less than ten (10) nor more than ninety (90)"
"2765","days before the date of the meeting.  The notice shall specify"
"2766","(i) the place, date and hour of the meeting, and (ii) the general"
"2767","nature of the business to be transacted."
"2768","             Section 4.  Manner of Giving Notice; Affidavit"
"2769","of Notice."
"2770","                    (a)	Notice of any meeting of"
"2771","Shareholders shall be (i) given either by hand delivery, first-class"
"2772","mail, telegraphic or other written or electronic communication,"
"2773","charges prepaid, and (ii) addressed to the Shareholder at the"
"2774","address of that Shareholder appearing on the books of the Trust"
"2775","or its transfer agent or given by the Shareholder to the Trust for"
"2776","the purpose of notice.  If no such address appears on the Trust's"
"2777","books or is not given to the Trust, or to the Trust's transfer or"
"2778","similar agent, notice shall be deemed to be waived and therefore"
"2779","unnecessary, unless and until the Shareholder provides the Trust,"
"2780","or the Trust's transfer or similar agent, with his or her address."
"2781","Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when"
"2782","delivered personally or deposited in the mail or sent by telegram"
"2783","or other means of written or electronic communication or, where"
"2784","notice is given by publication, on the date of publication."
"2785","Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be"
"2786","given effectively to Shareholders, any notice to Shareholders"
"2787","given by the Trust shall be effective if given by a single written"
"2788","notice to Shareholders who share an address if consented to by"
"2789","the Shareholders at that address."
"2790","                    (b)	If any notice addressed to a"
"2791","Shareholder at the address of that Shareholder appearing on the"
"2792","books of the Trust is returned to the Trust by the United States"
"2793","Postal Service marked to indicate that the Postal Service is"
"2794","unable to deliver the notice to the Shareholder at that address, all"
"2795","future notices or reports shall be deemed to have been duly given"
"2796","without further mailing if such future notices or reports shall be"
"2797","kept available to the Shareholder, upon written demand of the"
"2798","Shareholder, at the principal executive office of the Trust for a"
"2799","period of one year from the date of the giving of the notice."
"2800","                    (c)	An affidavit of the mailing or"
"2801","other means of giving any notice of any meeting of Shareholders"
"2802","shall be filed and maintained in the minute book of the Trust."
"2803","             Section 5.  Conduct of Meetings of"
"2804","Shareholders.  The meetings of Shareholders shall be presided"
"2805","over by the President, or if he or she is not present, by any Vice"
"2806","President, unless there is an Executive Vice President, or if none"
"2807","of them is present, then any officer of the Trust appointed by the"
"2808","President to act on his or her behalf shall preside over such"
"2809","meetings.  The Secretary, if present, shall act as a Secretary of"
"2810","such meetings, or if he or she is not present or is otherwise"
"2811","presiding over the meeting in another capacity, an Assistant"
"2812","Secretary, if any, shall so act.  If neither the Secretary nor the"
"2813","Assistant Secretary is present or, if present, the Secretary is"
"2814","otherwise presiding over the meeting in another capacity, then"
"2815","any such person appointed by the Secretary to act on his or her"
"2816","behalf shall act as Secretary of such meetings."
"2817","             Section 6.  Adjourned Meeting; Notice.  Any"
"2818","meeting of Shareholders, whether or not a quorum is present,"
"2819","may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of"
"2820","the Shares represented at the meeting, either in person or by"
"2821","proxy.  Notwithstanding the above, broker non-votes will be"
"2822","excluded from the denominator of the calculation of the number"
"2823","of votes required to approve any proposal to adjourn a meeting."
"2824","Notice of adjournment of a Shareholders' meeting to another"
"2825","time or place need not be given, if such time and place are"
"2826","announced at the meeting at which adjournment is taken and the"
"2827","adjourned meeting is held within a reasonable time after the date"
"2828","set for the original meeting.  If the adjournment is for more than"
"2829","sixty (60) days from the date set for the original meeting or a"
"2830","new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of any"
"2831","such adjourned meeting shall be given to each Shareholder of"
"2832","record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance"
"2833","with the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this Article III.  At any"

"2948","either in person or by proxy, provided that either (i) a written"
"2949","instrument authorizing such a proxy to act is executed by the"
"2950","Shareholder or his or her duly authorized attorney-in-fact and"
"2951","dated not more than eleven (11) months before the meeting,"
"2952","unless the instrument specifically provides for a longer period, or"
"2953","(ii) the Trustees adopt an electronic, telephonic, computerized or"
"2954","other alternative to the execution of a written instrument"
"2955","authorizing the proxy to act, and such authorization is received"
"2956","not more than eleven (11) months before the meeting.  A proxy"
"2957","shall be deemed executed by a Shareholder if the Shareholder's"
"2958","name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature,"
"2959","typewriting, telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the"
"2960","Shareholder or the Shareholder's attorney-in-fact.  A valid proxy"
"2961","which does not state that it is irrevocable shall continue in full"
"2962","force and effect unless (i) revoked by the Person executing it"
"2963","before the vote pursuant to that proxy is taken, (a) by a writing"

"2970","notice of the death or incapacity of the maker of that proxy is"

"2974","unless at or prior to exercise of the proxy the Trust receives a"
"2975","specific written notice to the contrary from any one of the two or"
"2976","more Persons.  A proxy purporting to be executed by or on"
"2977","behalf of a Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged"
"2978","at or prior to its exercise and the burden of proving invalidity"
"2979","shall rest on the challenger.  Unless otherwise specifically"
"2980","limited by their terms, proxies shall entitle the Shareholder to"
"2981","vote at any adjournment or postponement of a Shareholders'"
"2982","meeting.  At every meeting of Shareholders, unless the voting is"
"2983","conducted by inspectors, all questions concerning the"
"2984","qualifications of voters, the validity of proxies, and the"
"2985","acceptance or rejection of votes, shall be decided by the"
"2986","chairman of the meeting.  Subject to the provisions of the"
"2987","Declaration of Trust or these By-Laws, all matters concerning"
"2988","the giving, voting or validity of proxies shall be governed by the"
"2989","General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware relating to"

"2996","the meeting or its adjournment or postponement.  If no"
"2997","inspectors of election are so appointed, the chairman of the"
"2998","meeting may appoint inspectors of election at the meeting.  If"
"2999","any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or"
"3000","refuses to act, the chairman of the meeting may appoint a person"
"3001","to fill the vacancy."
"3002","             These inspectors shall:"
"3003","                    (a)	Determine the number of Shares"
"3004","outstanding and the voting power of each, the Shares represented"
"3005","at the meeting, the existence of a quorum and the authenticity,"
"3006","validity and effect of proxies."
"3007","                    (b)	Receive votes, ballots or"
