"898","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"899","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders"
"900","of SunAmerica Money Market Funds, Inc."
"901","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"902","SunAmerica Money Market Fund and SunAmerica Municipal Money"
"903","Market Fund (constituting SunAmerica Money Market Funds, Inc.,"
"904","hereafter referred to as the Funds)  as of and for the year ended"
"905","December 31, 2007, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"906","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"907","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"908","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"909","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"910","to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"911","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"912","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"913","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"914","reporting."
"915","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"916","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"917","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"918","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"919","A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"920","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"921","and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"922","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's"
"923","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"924","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"925","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"926","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"927","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"928","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"929","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made"
"930","only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"931","the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"932","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"933","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"934","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"935","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any"
"936","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"937","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"938","that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"939","deteriorate."
"940","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"941","design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"942","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"943","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"944","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"945","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"946","that a material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial"
"947","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"948","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"949","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"950","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"951","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established"
"952","by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"953","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over"
"954","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"955","securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above"
"956","as of December 31, 2007."
"957","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"958","and the Board of Directors of SunAmerica Money Market Funds, Inc. and"
"959","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"960","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"976","On August 28, 2007, mark to market losses experienced in the"
"977","investment portfolio of SIV Portfolio, PLC (SIV Portfolio)"
"978","(formerly Cheyne Finance PLC (Cheyne)), the issuer of an"
"979","underlying medium term note (the Note) held by the"
"980","SunAmerica Money Market Funds, Inc.-SunAmerica Money"
"981","Market Fund (the Fund), triggered the appointment of receivers"
"982","(Deloitte & Touche LLP) (collectively, the Receiver)."
"983","On October 4, 2007, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the"
"984","rating assigned to the Note.  The Moody's rating for the"
"985","commercial paper was downgraded from P-1 to Not Prime (Not
Prime is below the second highest short-term rating category),"
"986","causing the Note to no longer qualify as an Eligible Security, as"
"987","defined in Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940,"
"988","as amended (the 1940 Act)."
"989","On October 17, 2007, the Receiver determined that SIV Portfolio"
"990","was, or was about to become, unable to pay its debts as they came"
"991","due and that an insolvency event had occurred (Event of
Insolvency). As a result of this determination, the Note became"
"992","immediately due and payable and defaulted as a result of non-"
"993","payment."
"994","In response to the Event of Insolvency, the Board of Directors of"
"995","the Fund (the Board) met on October 24, 2007 to consider"
"996","whether to continue to hold the Note and determined that disposal"
"997","of the Note at that time would not be in the best interests of the"
"998","Fund.  The Board had previously met as a result of the credit"
"999","quality downgrade that occurred on October 4, 2007 that caused"
"1000","the Note to no longer qualify as an Eligible Security, as defined"
"1001","in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act and determined that, based on the"
"1002","recommendations of the investment adviser, among other factors,"
"1003","the Note continued to present minimal credit risks and that disposal"
"1004","of the Note at that time would not be in the best interests of the"
"1005","Fund. In addition, the Fund provided the required notice to the"
"1006","Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 2a-"
"1007","7(c)(6)(iii) under the 1940 Act.  The Note was held by the Fund as"
"1008","of the final day of the reporting period (December 31, 2007)."
"1009","  Standard & Poor's had previously downgraded the Cheyne commercial paper"
"1010","from A-1 to A-2 on August 28, 2007 (A-2 is the second highest short-term"
"1011","paper rating category)."
