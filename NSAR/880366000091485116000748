"2107","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2108","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"2109","Legg Mason Partners Equity Trust:"
"2110","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"2111","of ClearBridge All Cap Value Fund, ClearBridge Small Cap Value"
"2112","Fund, ClearBridge International Small Cap Fund, QS S&P 500 Index"
"2113","Fund (formerly, QS Batterymarch S&P 500 Index Fund), QS"
"2114","International Dividend Fund (formerly, QS Batterymarch"
"2115","International Dividend Fund), and QS Global Dividend Fund"
"2116","(formerly, QS Batterymarch Global Dividend Fund)(the Funds),"
"2117","each a series of Legg Mason Partners Equity Trust, as of and for"
"2118","the year ended September 30, 2016, in accordance with the"
"2119","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"2120","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"2121","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"2122","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"2123","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"2124","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"2125","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"2126","Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"2127","express no such opinion."
"2128","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"2129","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"2130","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"2131","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"2132","related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"2133","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"2134","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"2135","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"2136","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"2137","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"2138","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"2139","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"2140","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"2141","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2142","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2143","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"2144","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"2145","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"2146","fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"2147","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"2148","disposition of the fund's assets that could have a material"
"2149","effect on the financial statements."
"2150","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2151","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2152","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"2153","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2154","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"2155","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2156","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2157","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"2158","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"2159","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"2160","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination"
"2161","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"2162","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"2163","misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial statements"
"2164","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2165","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2166","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2167","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"2168","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"2169","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"2170","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"2171","Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"2172","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that"
"2173","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"2174","September 30, 2016."
"2175","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"

"2193","Item 77E : Legal Proceedings"
"2194","In response to Sub-Items 77E, QS S&P 500 Index Fund,"
"2195","the Registrant incorporates by reference the following:"
"2196","On June 22, 2011, Legg Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC,"
"2197","was served with a summons and complaint in the Supreme"
"2198","Court of the State of New York (New York County)."
"2199","Subsequently, the case was removed to Federal Court."
"2200","The Plaintiffs are Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas"
"2201","and two other indenture trustees for Senior Notes of"
"2202"," Tribune Company.  The Plaintiffs are seeking to set"
"2203","aside payments made to Tribune shareholders in 2007 in"
"2204","connection with the Leveraged Buyout of Tribune Co."
"2205","by billionaire, Sam Zell.  Plaintiffs claim that the"
"2206","payments made to shareholders who tendered their shares"
"2207","were constructive fraudulent conveyances.  In addition"
"2208"," to naming Legg Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC, the"
"2209","lawsuit pleads a putative class of defendants consisting"
"2210","of all shareholders who tendered shares in connection"
"2211","with the LBO.  QS S&P 500 Index Fund (formerly"
"2212","QS Batterymarch S&P 500 Index Fund and formerly"
"2213","Legg Mason Batterymarch"
"2214"," S&P 500 Index Fund) (the QS Fund) and Legg Mason"
"2215"," Partners Variable Equity Index Portfolio (the LMP
 Variable Portfolio) tendered shares.  Bingham McCutchen"
"2216"," (now part of Morgan Lewis) has been retained to represent"
"2217"," Legg Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC. The District Court"
"2218","has dismissed this action for lack of standing, as the"
"2219"," Plaintiff in the Fitzsimmons case (described below) has"
"2220"," not abandoned its action.  However, Plaintiffs appealed"
"2221"," that ruling. Oral argument at the Second Circuit was heard"
"2222","on November 5, 2014, and we are awaiting"
"2223"," a ruling from the Court."
"2224","In a parallel action, the Committee of Unsecured Creditors"
"2225"," seeks the same relief on behalf of the bankruptcy estate"
"2226"," of Tribune Co. This case is generally referred to as the"
"2227"," Fitzsimons case (after the first named Defendant)."
"2228","As of August 31, 2013, the only fund remaining in either"
"2229"," action is the QS Fund, and only in the Fitzsimons case."
"2230","  The LMP Variable Portfolio no longer holds assets,"
"2231","as it was liquidated in May 2009.  The QS Fund was"
"2232","eliminated as a Defendant in the Trustees' case when"
"2233","any defendant who tendered less than $100,000 as part"
"2234"," of the tender offer was dropped from the case."
"2235","In the Fitzsimons case, the Fund's exposure is between"
"2236"," $50,000 and $100,000, based on the amount of proceeds"
"2237","it received from the tender.  An effort to raise the"
"2238"," threshold for named Defendants in the Fitzsimons case"
"2239"," to the same $100,000 that applied in the Trustees'"
"2240","action failed, with the result that the Fund remains"
"2241","a Defendant.  The Defendants have filed a Motion to"
"2242","Dismiss, which was granted with respect to the"
"2243","constructive fraudulent transfer claim.  A petition"
"2244"," for rehearing was denied.  Plaintiffs filed a cert"
"2245"," petition with the Supreme Court during the week of"
"2246","September 12, 2016.  The opposition is due in late"
"2247","October 2016. The intentional fraudulent conveyance"
"2248","claim is still active, although a decision on the"
"2249"," motion to dismiss is pending."

"2385"," determinations for the Fund either"
"2386","directly with the issuer or with any broker or dealer,"

"2402","transaction for the Fund which is"
"2403","in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer"
"2404","would have charged for"
"2405","effecting that transaction if the Subadviser determines in good"
"2406","faith that such amount of"
"2407","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage"
"2408"," and research services"
"2409","provided by such broker or dealer. This determination may be viewed"
"2410","in terms of either that"
"2411","particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the"

"2415","adopt policies and procedures that modify and restrict the Subadviser's"
"2416","authority regarding the"
"2417","execution of the Fund's portfolio transactions provided herein."
"2418","The Subadviser shall exercise"
"2419","voting rights, rights to consent to corporate action and any other"
"2420","rights pertaining to the"
"2421","Allocated Assets subject to such direction as the Board may provide,"
"2422","and shall perform such"
"2423","other functions of investment management and supervision as may"
"2424","be directed by the Board. The"
"2425","Subadviser may execute on behalf of the Fund certain agreements,"
"2426","instruments and documents in"
"2427","connection with the services performed by it under this Agreement."
"2428","These may include, without"

"2438","which is"
"2439","a member of a national securities exchange to effect any"
"2440","transaction on the exchange for the"
"2441","account of the Fund which is permitted by Section 1l(a) of"
"2442","the Exchange Act and Rule 1la2-"
"2443","2(T) thereunder, and the Fund hereby consents to the retention"
"2444","of compensation for such"
"2445","transactions in accordance with Rule"
"2446","1la2-2(T)(a)(2)(iv). Notwithstanding the foregoing,"
"2447","the Subadviser agrees that it will not"
"2448","deal with itself, or with members of the Board or any"
"2449","principal underwriter of the Fund, as"
"2450","principals or agents in making purchases or sales of"
"2451","securities or other property for the"
"2452","account of the Fund, nor will it purchase any securities"
"2453","from an underwriting or selling group"
"2454","in which the Subadviser or its affiliates is participating,"
"2455"," or arrange for purchases and"
"2456","sales of securities between the Fund and another account"
"2457","advised by the Subadviser or its"
"2458","affiliates, except in each case as permitted by the 1940"
"2459","Act and in accordance with such"
"2460","policies and procedures as may be adopted by the Fund from"
"2461","time to time, and will comply with"
"2462","all other provisions of the Governing Documents and the Fund's"
"2463"," then-current Prospectus and"
"2464","Statement of Additional Information relative to the Subadviser"
"2465","and its directors and officers."
"2466","         4.	The Subadviser may delegate to any other one or"
"2467","more companies that the"
"2468","Subadviser controls, is controlled by, or is under common control"
"2469"," with, or to specified"
"2470","employees of any such companies, certain of the Subadviser's duties"
"2471","under this Agreement,"
"2472","provided in each case the Subadviser will supervise the activities"
"2473"," of each such entity or"
"2474","employees thereof, that such delegation will not relieve the Subadviser"
"2475"," of any of its duties"
"2476","or obligations under this Agreement and provided further"
"2477"," that any such arrangements are"
"2478","entered into in accordance with all applicable requirements"
"2479","of the 1940 Act."
"2480","         5.	The Subadviser agrees that it will keep"
"2481","records relating to its services"
"2482","hereunder in accordance with all applicable laws, and in"
"2483","compliance with the requirements of"
"2484","Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Subadviser hereby agrees"
"2485","that any records that it maintains"
"2486","for the Fund are the property of"
"2487","the Fund, and further agrees to surrender promptly to the"
"2488"," Fund any of such records upon the Fund's"
"2489","request. The Subadviser further agrees to arrange for the"
"2490"," preservation of the records required to be"
"2491","maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act for the periods"
"2492"," prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940"
"2493","Act"
"2494","         6.	(a)   The Subadviser, at its expense, shall"

the 1940 Act, by vote of the holders of a
majority of the Fund's outstanding voting securities.

 terms contained on Annex I hereto, if applicable,

 the parties hereto, and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings relating to the subject
 matter hereof Should any part of this Agreement be
