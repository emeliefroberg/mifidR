"524","<TEXT>"
"525","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"526","Accounting Firm"
"527","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of"
"528","SunAmerica Senior Floating Rate Fund, Inc.:"
"529","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"530","statements of SunAmerica Senior Floating Rate Fund,"
"531","Inc. (the Fund) as of and for the year ended December"
"532","31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"533","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"534","we considered the Fund?s internal control over financial"
"535","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"536","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"537","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"538","the financial statements and to comply with the"
"539","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"540","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund?s"
"541","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"542","we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"543","Fund?s internal control over financial reporting."
"544","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"545","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"546","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"547","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"548","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"549","A fund?s internal control over financial reporting is a"
"550","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"551","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"552","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"553","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"554","principles.  A  fund?s internal control over financial"
"555","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"556","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"557","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"558","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"559","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"560","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"561","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"562","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"563","fund are being made only in accordance with"
"564","authorizations of management and directors of the fund;"
"565","and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"566","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"567","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund?s assets that"
"568","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"569","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"570","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"571","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"572","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"573","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"574","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"575","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"576","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"577","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"578","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"579","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"580","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is"
"581","a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"582","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"583","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"584","the Fund?s annual or interim financial statements will"
"585","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"586","Our consideration of the Fund?s internal control over"
"587","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"588","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"589","all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"590","reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"591","standards established by the Public Company"
"592","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"593","we noted no deficiencies in the Fund?s internal control"
"594","over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"595","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to"
"596","be material weaknesses as defined above as of December"
"597","31, 2014."
"598","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"599","of management and the Board of Directors of"
"600","SunAmerica Senior Floating Rate Fund, Inc. and the"
"601","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"602","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"603","than these specified parties."

"706","Hedging"
"707","    On page 19 of the Prospectus, under the"
"708","heading  More Information About the Fund,  in"
"709","the subsection  Glossary   Investment and Other"
"710","Terminology,  the following is hereby added:"
"711"," Credit default swaps are agreements"
"712","between two parties: a buyer of credit"
"713","protection and a seller of credit protection."
"714","The buyer in a credit default swap"
"715","agreement is obligated to pay the seller a"
"716","periodic stream of payments over the term"
"717","of the swap agreement. If no default or other"
"718","designated credit event occurs, the seller of"
"719","credit protection will have received a fixed"
"720","rate of income throughout the term of the"
"721","swap agreement. If a default or designated"
"722","credit event does occur, the seller of credit"
"723","protection must pay the buyer of credit"
"724","protection the full value of the reference"
"725","obligation. As the seller of credit protection,"
"726","the Fund would effectively add leverage"
"727","because, in addition to its net assets, the"
"728","Fund would be subject to investment"
"729","exposure on the par (or other agreed-upon)"
"730","value it had undertaken to pay. Credit"
"731","default swaps may be structured based on an"
"732","index or the debt of a basket of issuers,"
"733","rather than a single issuer, and may be"
"734","customized with respect to the default event"
"735","that triggers purchase or other factors (for"
"736","example, a particular number of defaults"
"737","within a basket, or defaults by a particular"
"738","combination of issuers within the basket,"
"739","may trigger a payment obligation)."
"740","    On page 20 of the Prospectus, under the"
"741","heading  More Information About the Fund,  in"
"742","the subsection  Glossary   Risk Terminology,"
"743","the following are hereby added:"
"744"," Counterparty risk: Counterparty risk is"
"745","the risk that a counterparty to a security,"
"746","loan or derivative held by the Fund becomes"
"747","bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its"
"748","obligations due to financial difficulties. The"
"749","Fund may experience significant delays in"
"750","obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or"
"751","other reorganization proceeding, and there"
"752","may be no recovery or limited recovery in"
"753","such circumstances."
"754"," Credit default swap risk: Credit default"
"755","swaps increase credit risk when the Fund is"
"756","the seller and increase counterparty risk"
"757","when the Fund is the buyer. Credit default"
"758","swap transactions in which the Fund is the"
"759","seller may require the Fund to liquidate"
"760","securities when it may not be advantageous"
"761","to do so in order to satisfy its obligations or"
"762","to meet segregation requirements. The"
"763","absence of a central exchange or market for"
"764","swap transactions has led, in some"
"765","instances, to difficulties in trading and"
"766","valuation, especially in the event of market"
"767","disruptions. Recent legislation will require"
"768","most swaps to be executed through a"
"769","centralized exchange or regulated facility"
"770","and be cleared through a regulated"
"771","clearinghouse. The swap market could be"
"772","disrupted or limited as a result of this"
"773","legislation, which could adversely affect the"
"774","Fund. Moreover, the establishment of a"
"775","centralized exchange or market for swap"
"776","transactions may not result in swaps being"
"777","easier to trade or value."
"778"," Derivatives risk: Derivatives are subject"
"779","to general risks relating to heightened"
"780","sensitivity to market volatility, interest rate"
"781","fluctuations, illiquidity and creditworthiness"
"782","of the counterparty to the derivatives"
"783","transactions."
"784"," Hedging: Hedging is a strategy in which"
"785","the Adviser or Wellington Management"
"786","uses a derivative security to reduce certain"
"787","risk characteristics of an underlying security"
"788","or portfolio of securities. While hedging"
"789","strategies can be very useful and"

"821","Borrowers.  U.S. dollar denominated Loans"
"822","issued by non-U.S. Borrowers must be"
"823","located in a country: (a)(i) whose"
"824","unguaranteed, unsecured and otherwise"
"825","unsupported long-term sovereign debt"
"826","obligations are rated A-3 or better by"

"830","operations; and (b) that does not impose"
"831","withholding taxes on payment of principal,"
"832","interest, fees, or other payments to be made"
"833","by the Borrower. Loans purchased by the"
"834","Fund that are made to non-U.S. Borrowers"
"835","must also meet the credit standards"
"836","established by Wellington Management for"
"837","U.S. Borrowers. There may be greater risk"
"838","in valuing and monitoring the value of"
"839","collateral underlying Loans to non-U.S."
"840","Borrowers. The Fund will not invest in"
"841","unsecured loans of non-U.S. Borrowers. For"
"842","purposes of determining whether a company"
"843","is a  foreign security  (or issued by a non-"
"844","U.S. Borrower), the Fund generally looks to"
"845","the country of incorporation of the issuer."
"846","However, the Fund s portfolio manager may"
"847","determine that certain companies organized"
"848","outside the United States may not be"
"849","deemed to be foreign issuers or non-U.S."
"850","Borrowers if the issuer s or non-U.S."
"851","Borrower s economic fortunes and risks are"
"852","primarily linked with U.S. markets."
"853","    Investments in foreign securities offer"
"854","potential benefits not available from"
"855","investments solely in securities of domestic"
"856","issuers by offering the opportunity to invest"
"857","in foreign issuers that appear to offer growth"
"858","potential, or in foreign countries with"
"859","economic policies or business cycles"
"860","different from those of the U.S., or to reduce"
"861","fluctuations in portfolio value by taking"
"862","advantage of foreign stock markets that do"
"863","not move in a manner parallel to U.S."
"864","markets."
"865","    Investments in foreign securities,"
"866","including securities of emerging market"
"867","countries, present special additional"
"868","investment risks and considerations not"
"869","typically associated with investments in"
"870","domestic securities, including reduction of"
"871","income by foreign taxes; fluctuation in"
"872","value of foreign portfolio investments due"
"873","to changes in currency rates and control"
"874","regulations (i.e., currency blockage);"
"875","transaction charges for currency exchange;"
"876","lack of public information about foreign"
"877","issuers; lack of uniform accounting,"
"878","auditing and financial reporting standards"
"879","comparable to those applicable to domestic"
"880","issuers; less volume on foreign exchanges"
"881","than on U.S. exchanges; greater volatility"
"882","and less liquidity on foreign markets than in"
"883","the U.S.; less regulation of foreign issuers,"
"884","stock exchanges and brokers than the U.S.;"
"885","greater difficulties in commencing lawsuits;"
"886","higher brokerage commission rates and"
"887","custodian fees than the U.S.; increased"
"888","possibilities in some countries of"
"889","expropriation, confiscatory taxation,"
"890","political, financial or social instability or"
"891","adverse diplomatic developments; the"
"892","imposition of foreign taxes on investment"
"893","income derived from such countries and"
"894","differences (which may be favorable or"
"895","unfavorable) between the U.S. economy and"
"896","foreign economies. Emerging market"
"897","countries are deemed to be those countries"
"898","included within the MSCI Emerging"
"899","Markets Index. Historical experience"
"900","indicates that the markets of emerging"
"901","market countries have been more volatile"
"902","than more developed markets; however,"
"903","such markets can provide higher rates of"
"904","return to investors. The Fund may invest in"
"905","securities issued by companies located in"
"906","countries not considered to be major"
"907","industrialized nations. Such countries are"
"908","subject to more economic, political and"
"909","business risk than major industrialized"
"910","nations, and the securities issued by those"
"911","companies may be more volatile, less liquid"
"912","and more uncertain as to payment of"
"913","dividends, interest and principal."
"914","    The performance of investments in"
"915","securities denominated in a foreign currency"
"916","( non-dollar securities ) will depend on,"
"917","among other things, the strength of the"
"918","foreign currency against the dollar and the"
"919","interest rate environment in the country"
"920","issuing the foreign currency. Absent other"
"921","events that could otherwise affect the value"
"922","of non-dollar securities (such as a change in"
"923","the political climate or an issuer s credit"
"924","quality), appreciation in the value of the"
"925","foreign currency generally can be expected"
"926","to increase the value of the Fund s non-"
"927","dollar securities in terms of U.S. dollars. A"
"928","rise in foreign interest rates or decline in the"
"929","value of foreign currencies relative to the"
"930","U.S. dollar generally can be expected to"
"931","depress the value of the Fund s non-dollar"
"932","securities. Currencies are evaluated on the"
"933","basis of fundamental economic criteria (e.g.,"
"934","relative inflation levels and trends, growth"
"935","rate forecasts, balance of payments status"
"936","and economic policies) as well as technical"
"937","and political data. Because the Fund may"
"938","invest in securities that are primarily listed"
"939","on foreign exchanges that trade on"
"940","weekends or other days when the Fund does"
"941","not price its shares, the value of the Fund s"
"942","shares may change on days when a"
"943","shareholder will not be able to purchase or"
"944","redeem shares."
"945","    Additionally, foreign markets,"
"946","especially emerging markets, may have"
"947","different clearance and settlement"
"948","procedures, and in certain markets there"
"949","have been times when settlements have been"
"950","unable to keep pace with the volume of"
"951","securities transactions, making it difficult to"
"952","conduct such transactions. Delays in"
"953","settlement could result in temporary periods"
"954","when a portion of the assets of the Fund is"
"955","uninvested and no return is earned"
"956","thereon. The inability of the Fund to make"
"957","intended security purchases due to"
"958","settlement could cause the Fund to miss"
"959","attractive investment opportunities. The"
"960","inability to dispose of Fund securities due to"
"961","settlement problems could result in losses to"
"962","the Fund due to subsequent declines in"
"963","values of the portfolio securities or, if the"
"964","Fund has entered into a contract to sell the"
"965","security, possible liability to the purchaser."
"966","    On page 7 of the SAI, under the heading"
"967"," INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES,"
"968","the following is hereby added immediately after the"
"969","paragraph captioned  Repurchase Agreements :"
"970"," Credit Default Swaps"
"971","    The Fund may invest in credit default"
"972","swaps. A credit default swap is an"
"973","agreement between two parties: a buyer of"
"974","credit protection and a seller of credit"
"975","protection. The buyer in a credit default"
"976","swap agreement is obligated to pay the"
"977","seller a periodic stream of payments over"
"978","the term of the swap agreement. If no"
"979","default or other designated credit event"
"980","occurs, the seller of credit protection will"
"981","have received a fixed rate of income"
"982","throughout the term of the swap agreement."
"983","If a default or designated credit event does"
"984","occur, the seller of credit protection must"
"985","pay the buyer of credit protection the full"
"986","value of the reference obligation. As the"
"987","seller of credit protection, the Fund would"
"988","effectively add leverage to its portfolio"
"989","because, in addition to its total net assets,"
"990","the Fund would be subject to investment"
"991","exposure on the notional amount of the"
"992","swap. Credit default swaps may be"
"993","structured based on an index or the debt of a"
"994","basket of issuers, rather than a single issuer,"
"995","and may be customized with respect to the"
"996","default event that triggers purchase or other"
"997","factors (for example, a particular number of"
"998","defaults within a basket, or defaults by a"
"999","particular combination of issuers within the"
"1000","basket, may trigger a payment obligation)."
"1001","The Fund s investment exposure to credit"
"1002","default swaps (based on the gross notional"
"1003","exposure) will be limited to 10% of the"
"1004","value of the Fund s net assets. Additionally,"
"1005","the Fund s investment exposure to credit"
"1006","default swaps on corporate issues (based on"
"1007","gross notional exposure) will be limited to"
"1008","2.5% of the value of the Fund s net assets"
"1009","and 1.0% in any one issuer, determined at"
"1010","the time the investment is made."
"1011","    Credit default swaps increase credit"
"1012","risk when the Fund is the seller and increase"
"1013","counterparty risk when the Fund is the"
"1014","buyer. Credit default swap transactions in"
"1015","which the Fund is the seller may require the"
"1016","Fund to liquidate securities when it may not"
"1017","be advantageous to do so in order to satisfy"
"1018","its obligations or to meet segregation"
"1019","requirements. The absence of a central"
"1020","exchange or market for swap transactions"
"1021","has led, in some instances, to difficulties in"
"1022","trading and valuation, especially in the"
"1023","event of market disruptions. Recent"
"1024","legislation will require most swaps to be"
"1025","executed through a centralized exchange or"
"1026","regulated facility and be cleared through a"
"1027","regulated clearinghouse. The swap market"
"1028","could be disrupted or limited as a result of"
"1029","this legislation, which could adversely"
"1030","affect the Fund. Moreover, the"
"1031","establishment of a centralized exchange or"
"1032","market for swap transactions may not result"
"1033","in swaps being easier to trade or value."
"1034","    If the Fund is a seller of protection and"
"1035","a credit event occurs, as defined under the"
"1036","terms of that particular swap agreement, the"
"1037","Fund will either (i) pay to the buyer of"
"1038","protection an amount equal to the notional"
"1039","amount of the swap and take delivery of the"
"1040","referenced obligation, other deliverable"
"1041","obligations or underlying securities"
"1042","comprising the referenced index or (ii) pay a"
"1043","net settlement amount in the form of cash or"
"1044","securities equal to the notional amount of"
"1045","the swap less the recovery value of the"
"1046","referenced obligation or underlying"
"1047","securities comprising the referenced index."
"1048","If the Fund is a buyer of protection and a"
"1049","credit event occurs, as defined under the"
"1050","terms of that particular swap agreement, the"
"1051","Fund will either (i) receive from the seller of"
"1052","protection an amount equal to the notional"
"1053","amount of the swap and deliver the"
"1054","referenced obligation, other deliverable"
"1055","obligations or underlying securities"
"1056","comprising the referenced index or"
"1057","(ii) receive a net settlement amount in the"
"1058","form of cash or securities equal to the"
"1059","notional amount of the swap less the"
"1060","recovery value of the referenced obligation"
"1061","or underlying securities comprising the"
"1062","referenced index. Recovery values are"
"1063","assumed by market makers considering"
"1064","either industry standard recovery rates or"
"1065","entity specific factors and considerations"
"1066","until a credit event occurs. If a credit event"
"1067","has occurred, the recovery value is"
"1068","determined by a facilitated auction whereby"
"1069","a minimum number of allowable broker"
"1070","bids, together with a specified valuation"
"1071","method, are used to calculate the settlement"
"1072","value."
"1073","    Credit default swap agreements on"
"1074","corporate issues involve one party making a"
"1075","stream of payments to another party in"
"1076","exchange for the right to receive a specified"
"1077","return in the event of a default or other"
"1078","credit event. If a credit event occurs and"
"1079","cash settlement is not elected, a variety of"
"1080","other deliverable obligations may be"
"1081","delivered in lieu of the specific referenced"
"1082","obligation. The ability to deliver other"
"1083","obligations may result in a cheapest-to-"
"1084","deliver option (the buyer of protection s"
"1085","right to choose the deliverable obligation"
"1086","with the lowest value following a credit"
"1087","event). The Fund may use credit default"
"1088","swaps on corporate issues to provide a"
"1089","measure of protection against defaults of the"
"1090","issuers (i.e., to reduce risk where the Fund"
"1091","owns or has exposure to the referenced"
"1092","obligation) or to take an active long or short"
"1093","position with respect to the likelihood of a"
"1094","particular issuer s default."
"1095","    Credit default swap agreements on"
"1096","credit indices (CDXs) involve one party"
"1097","making a stream of payments to another"
"1098","party in exchange for the right to receive a"
"1099","specified return in the event of a write-"
"1100","down, principal shortfall, interest shortfall"
"1101","or default of all or part of the referenced"
"1102","entities comprising the credit index. A credit"
"1103","index is a list of a basket of credit"
"1104","instruments or exposures designed to be"
"1105","representative of some part of the credit"
"1106","market as a whole. These indices are made"
"1107","up of reference credits that are judged by a"
"1108","poll of dealers to be the most liquid entities"
"1109","in the credit default swap market based on"
"1110","the sector of the index. Components of the"
"1111","indices may include, but are not limited to,"
"1112","investment grade securities, high yield"
"1113","securities, asset-backed securities, emerging"
"1114","markets, and/or various credit ratings within"
"1115","each sector. Credit indices are traded using"
"1116","credit default swaps with standardized terms"
"1117","including a fixed spread and standard"
"1118","maturity dates. An index credit default swap"
"1119","references all the names in the index, and if"
"1120","there is a default, the credit event is settled"
"1121","based on that name s weight in the index."
"1122","The composition of the indices changes"
"1123","periodically, usually every six months, and"
"1124","for most indices, each name has an equal"
"1125","weight in the index. The Fund may use"
"1126","credit default swaps on credit indices to"
"1127","hedge a portfolio of credit default swaps or"
"1128","bonds with a credit default swap on indices"
"1129","which is less expensive than it would be to"
"1130","buy many credit default swaps to achieve a"
"1131","similar effect. Credit default swaps on"
"1132","indices are benchmarks for protecting"
"1133","investors owning bonds against default, and"
"1134","traders use them to speculate on changes in"
"1135","credit quality."
"1136","    Implied credit spreads, represented in"
"1137","absolute terms, utilized in determining the"
"1138","market value of credit default swap"
"1139","agreements on corporate issues as of period"
"1140","end are disclosed in the footnotes to the"
"1141","Schedules of Investments (in the Annual"
"1142","Report) and serve as an indicator of the"
"1143","current status of the payment/performance"
"1144","risk and represent the likelihood or risk of"
"1145","default for the credit derivative. The implied"
"1146","credit spread of a particular referenced"
"1147","entity reflects the cost of buying /selling"
"1148","protection and may include upfront"
"1149","payments required to be made to enter into"
"1150","the agreement. For credit default swap"
"1151","agreements on credit indices, the quoted"
"1152","market prices and resulting values serve as"
"1153","the indicator of the current status of the"
"1154","payment/performance risk. Wider credit"
"1155","spreads and increasing market values, in"
"1156","absolute terms when compared to the"
"1157","notional amount of the swap, represent a"
"1158","deterioration of the referenced entity s"
"1159","credit soundness and a greater likelihood or"
"1160","risk of default or other credit event"
"1161","occurring as defined under the terms of the"
"1162","agreement."
"1163","    The maximum potential amount of"
"1164","future payments (undiscounted) that the"
"1165","Fund as a seller of protection could be"
"1166","required to make under a credit default swap"
"1167","agreement would be an amount equal to the"
"1168","notional amount of the agreement. These"
"1169","potential amounts would be partially offset"
"1170","by any recovery values of the respective"
"1171","referenced obligations, upfront payments"
"1172","received upon entering into the agreement,"
"1173","or net amounts received from the settlement"
"1174","of buy protection credit default swap"
"1175","agreements entered into by the Fund for the"
"1176","same referenced entity or entities."
"1177","On page 8 of the SAI, under the heading"
"1178"," INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES,"
"1179","the following paragraphs are hereby added"
"1180","immediately after the subsection captioned  Fixed"
"1181","Income Securities :"
"1182"," Forward Contracts on Foreign Currencies"
"1183","    For hedging purposes as a temporary"
"1184","defensive maneuver, the Fund may use"
"1185","forward contracts on foreign currencies"
"1186","( Forward Contracts ). A Forward Contract"
"1187","on foreign currencies involves bilateral"
"1188","obligations of one party to purchase, and"
"1189","another party to sell, a specific currency at a"
"1190","future date (which may be any fixed number"
"1191","of days from the date of the contract agreed"
"1192","upon by the parties), at a price set at the"
"1193","time the contract is entered into. These"
"1194","contracts are traded in the interbank market"
"1195","conducted directly between currency traders"
"1196","(usually large commercial banks) and their"
"1197","customers. No price is paid or received upon"
"1198","the purchase or sale of a Forward Contract"
"1199","on foreign currencies. The Fund does not"
"1200","intend to utilize Forward Contracts on"
"1201","foreign currencies other than for bona fide"
"1202","hedging purposes."
"1203","    The Fund may use Forward Contracts"
"1204","on foreign currencies to protect against"
"1205","uncertainty in the level of future exchange"
"1206","rates. The use of Forward Contracts on"
"1207","foreign currencies does not eliminate"
"1208","fluctuations in the prices of the underlying"
"1209","securities the Fund owns or intends to"
"1210","acquire, but it does fix a rate of exchange in"
"1211","advance. In addition, although Forward"
"1212","Contracts on foreign currencies limit the"
"1213","risk of loss due to a decline in the value of"
"1214","the hedged currencies, at the same time they"
"1215","limit any potential gain that might result"
"1216","should the value of the currencies increase."
"1217","    The Fund may enter into Forward"
"1218","Contracts on foreign currencies with respect"
"1219","to specific transactions. For example, when"
"1220","the Fund enters into a contract for the"
"1221","purchase or sale of a security denominated"
"1222","in or exposed to a foreign currency, or when"
"1223","the Fund anticipates receipt of dividend"
"1224","payments in a foreign currency, the Fund"
"1225","may desire to  lock-in  the U.S. dollar price"
"1226","of the security or the U.S. dollar equivalent"
"1227","of such payment by entering into a Forward"
"1228","Contract on foreign currencies, for a fixed"
"1229","amount of U.S. dollars per unit of foreign"
"1230","currency, for the purchase or sale of the"
"1231","amount of foreign currency involved in the"
"1232","underlying transaction. The Fund will"
"1233","thereby be able to protect itself against a"
"1234","possible loss resulting from an adverse"
"1235","change in the relationship between the"
"1236","currency exchange rates during the period"
"1237","between the date on which the security is"
"1238","purchased or sold, or on which the payment"
"1239","is declared and the date on which such"
"1240","payments are made or received."
"1241","    The Fund may also use Forward"
"1242","Contracts on foreign currencies to lock in"
"1243","the U.S. dollar value of portfolio positions"
"1244","( position hedge ). In a position hedge, for"
"1245","example, when the Fund believes that"
"1246","foreign currency may suffer a substantial"
"1247","decline against the U.S. dollar, it may enter"
"1248","into a Forward Contract on foreign"
"1249","currencies to sell an amount of that foreign"
"1250","currency approximating the value of some"
"1251","or all of the portfolio securities denominated"
"1252","in such foreign currency, or when the Fund"
"1253","believes that the U.S. dollar may suffer a"
"1254","substantial decline against a foreign"
"1255","currency, it may enter into a Forward"
"1256","Contract on foreign currencies to buy that"
"1257","foreign currency for a fixed dollar amount."
"1258","In this situation the Fund may, in the"
"1259","alternative, enter into a Forward Contract on"
"1260","foreign currencies to sell a different foreign"
"1261","currency for a fixed U.S. dollar amount"
"1262","where the Fund believes that the U.S. dollar"
"1263","value of the currency to be sold pursuant to"
"1264","the Forward Contract will fall whenever"
"1265","there is a decline in the U.S. dollar value of"
"1266","the currency in which portfolio securities of"
"1267","the Fund are denominated ( cross-hedged )."
"1268","The Fund may also hedge investments"
"1269","denominated in a foreign currency by"
"1270","entering into forward currency contracts"
"1271","with respect to a foreign currency that is"
"1272","expected to correlate to the currency in"
"1273","which the investments are denominated"
"1274","( proxy hedging )."
"1275","    The Fund will cover outstanding"
"1276","forward currency contracts by maintaining"
"1277","liquid portfolio securities denominated in"
"1278","the currency underlying the Forward"
"1279","Contract or the currency being hedged. To"
"1280","the extent that the Fund is not able to cover"
"1281","its forward currency positions with"
"1282","underlying portfolio securities, the Fund"
"1283","will segregate cash or liquid securities"
"1284","having a value equal to the aggregate"
"1285","amount of the Fund s commitments under"
"1286","Forward Contracts on foreign currencies"
"1287","entered into with respect to position hedges"
"1288","and cross-hedges. If the value of the"
"1289","segregated securities declines, additional"
"1290","cash or securities will be segregated on a"
"1291","daily basis so that the value of the"
"1292","segregated assets will equal the amount of"
"1293","the Fund s commitments with respect to"
"1294","such contracts. As an alternative to"
"1295","segregating assets, the Fund may purchase a"
"1296","call option permitting the Fund to purchase"
"1297","the amount of foreign currency being"
"1298","hedged by a forward sale contract at a price"
"1299","no higher than the Forward Contract on"
"1300","foreign currencies price or the Fund may"
"1301","purchase a put option permitting the Fund to"
"1302","sell the amount of foreign currency subject"
"1303","to a forward purchase contract at a price as"
"1304","high or higher than the Forward Contract on"
"1305","foreign currencies price. Unanticipated"
"1306","changes in currency prices may result in"
"1307","poorer overall performance for the Fund"
"1308","than if it had not entered into such contracts."
"1309","    The precise matching of the Forward"
"1310","Contract on foreign currencies amounts and"
"1311","the value of the securities involved will not"
"1312","generally be possible because the future"
"1313","value of such securities in foreign currencies"
"1314","will change as a consequence of market"
"1315","movements in the value of these securities"
"1316","between the date the Forward Contract on"
"1317","foreign currencies is entered into and the"
"1318","date it is sold. Accordingly, it may be"
"1319","necessary for the Fund to purchase"
"1320","additional foreign currency on the spot (i.e.,"
"1321","cash) on the spot market (and bear the"
"1322","expense of such purchase), if the market"
"1323","value of the security is less than the amount"
"1324","of foreign currency the Fund is obligated to"
"1325","deliver and if a decision is made to sell the"
"1326","security and make delivery of the foreign"
"1327","currency. Conversely, it may be necessary"
"1328","to sell on the spot market some of the"
"1329","foreign currency received upon the sale of"
"1330","the portfolio security if its market value"
"1331","exceeds the amount of foreign currency the"
"1332","Fund is obligated to deliver. The projection"
"1333","of short-term currency market movements is"
"1334","extremely difficult, and the successful"
"1335","execution of a short-term hedging strategy"
"1336","is highly uncertain. Forward Contracts on"
"1337","foreign currencies involve the risk that"
"1338","anticipated currency movements will not be"
"1339","accurately predicted, causing the Fund to"
"1340","sustain losses on these contracts and"
"1341","transactions costs."
"1342","    Currency transactions are also subject"
"1343","to risks different from those of other"
"1344","portfolio transactions. Because currency"
"1345","control is of great importance to the issuing"
"1346","governments and influences economic"
"1347","planning and policy, purchases and sales of"
"1348","currency and related instruments can be"
"1349","adversely affected by government exchange"
"1350","controls, limitations or restrictions on"
"1351","repatriation of currency, and manipulations"
"1352","or exchange restrictions imposed by"
"1353","governments. These forms of governmental"
"1354","actions can result in losses to the Fund if it"
"1355","is unable to deliver or receive currency or"
"1356","monies in settlement of obligations and"
"1357","could also cause hedges it has entered into"
"1358","to be rendered useless, resulting in full"
"1359","currency exposure as well as incurring"
"1360","transaction costs. Buyers and sellers of"
"1361","currency futures contracts are subject to the"
"1362","same risks that apply to the use of futures"
"1363","contracts generally. Further, settlement of a"
"1364","currency futures contract for the purchase of"
"1365","most currencies must occur at a bank based"
"1366","in the issuing nation. Trading options on"
"1367","currency futures contracts is relatively new,"
"1368","and the ability to establish and close out"
"1369","positions on these options is subject to the"
"1370","maintenance of a liquid market that may not"
"1371","always be available. Currency exchange"
"1372","rates may fluctuate based on factors"
"1373","extrinsic to that country s economy."
"1374","    At or before the maturity of a Forward"
"1375","Contract on foreign currencies requiring the"
"1376","Fund to sell a currency, the Fund may either"
"1377","sell a portfolio security and use the sale"
"1378","proceeds to make delivery of the currency"
"1379","or retain the security and offset its"
"1380","contractual obligation to deliver the"
"1381","currency by purchasing a second contract"
"1382","pursuant to which the Fund will obtain, on"
"1383","the same maturity date, the same amount of"
"1384","the currency that it is obligated to deliver."
"1385","Similarly, the Fund may close out a"
"1386","Forward Contract on foreign currencies,"
"1387","requiring it to purchase a specified currency"
"1388","by entering into a second contract entitling"
"1389","it to sell the same amount of the same"
"1390","currency on the maturity date of the first"
"1391","contract. The Fund would realize a gain or"
"1392","loss as a result of entering into such an"
"1393","offsetting Forward Contract on foreign"
"1394","currencies under either circumstance to the"
"1395","extent the exchange rate or rates between"
"1396","the currencies involved moved between the"
"1397","execution dates of the first contract and"
"1398","offsetting contract."
"1399","    The cost to the Fund of engaging in"
"1400","Forward Contracts on foreign currencies"
"1401","varies with factors such as the currencies"
"1402","involved, the length of the contract period"
"1403","and the market conditions then prevailing."
"1404","Because Forward Contracts on foreign"
"1405","currencies are usually entered into on a"
"1406","principal basis, no fees or commissions are"
"1407","involved. Because such contracts are not"
"1408","traded on an exchange, the Fund must"
"1409","evaluate the credit and performance risk of"
"1410","each particular counterparty under a"
"1411","Forward Contract on foreign currencies."
"1412","    Although the Fund values its assets"
"1413","daily in terms of U.S. dollars, it does not"
"1414","intend to convert its holdings of foreign"
"1415","currencies into U.S. dollars on a daily basis."
"1416","The Fund may convert foreign currency"
"1417","from time to time, and investors should be"
"1418","aware of the costs of currency conversion."
"1419","Foreign exchange dealers do not charge a"
"1420","fee for conversion, but they do seek to"
"1421","realize a profit based on the difference"
"1422","between the prices at which they buy and"
"1423","sell various currencies. Thus, a dealer may"
"1424","offer to sell a foreign currency to the Fund"
"1425","at one rate, while offering a lesser rate of"
"1426","exchange should the Fund desire to resell"
"1427","that currency to the dealer."
"1428","Convertible Securities"
"1429","    The Fund may invest up to 5% of its"
"1430","total assets in convertible securities,"
"1431","including convertible bonds and contingent"
"1432","convertible securities. A convertible"
"1433","security is a bond, debenture, note, preferred"
"1434","stock or other security that may be"
"1435","converted into or exchanged for a prescribed"
"1436","amount of common stock or other equity"
"1437","security of the same or a different issuer"
"1438","within a particular period of time at a"
"1439","specified price or formula. A convertible"
"1440","security entitles the holder to receive"
"1441","interest paid or accrued on debt or the"
"1442","dividend paid on preferred stock until the"
"1443","convertible security matures or is redeemed,"
"1444","converted or exchanged. Before conversion,"
"1445","convertible securities have characteristics"
"1446","similar to nonconvertible income securities"
"1447","in that they ordinarily provide a stable"
"1448","stream of income with generally higher"
"1449","yields than those of common stocks of the"
"1450","same or similar issuers, but lower yields"
"1451","than comparable nonconvertible securities."
"1452","The value of a convertible security is"
"1453","influenced by changes in interest rates, with"
"1454","investment value declining as interest rates"
"1455","increase and increasing as interest rates"
"1456","decline. The credit standing of the issuer"
"1457","and other factors also may have an effect on"
"1458","the convertible security s investment"
"1459","value. Convertible securities rank senior to"
"1460","common stock in a corporation s capital"
"1461","structure but are usually subordinated to"
"1462","comparable nonconvertible"
"1463","securities. Convertible securities may be"
"1464","subject to redemption at the option of the"
"1465","issuer at a price established in the"
"1466","convertible security s governing instrument."
"1467","    Holders of convertible securities"
"1468","generally have a claim on the assets of the"
"1469","issuer prior to the common stockholders but"
"1470","may be subordinated to other debt securities"
"1471","of the same issuer. A convertible security"
"1472","may be subject to redemption at the option"
"1473","of the issuer at a price established in a"
"1474","charter provision, indenture or other"
"1475","governing instrument pursuant to which the"
"1476","convertible security was issued. If a"
"1477","convertible security held by the Fund is"
"1478","called for redemption, the Fund will be"
"1479","required to redeem the security, convert it"
"1480","into the underlying common stock or sell it"
"1481","to a third party."
"1482","    Certain preferred and debt securities"
"1483","may include loss absorption characteristics"
"1484","that make the securities more equity"
"1485","like. This is particularly true in the financial"
"1486","services sector. While loss absorption"
"1487","language is relatively rare in the preferred"
"1488","and debt markets today, it may become"
"1489","more prevalent. One preferred or debt"
"1490","structure with loss absorption characteristics"
"1491","is the Contingent Convertible Security"
"1492","(sometimes referred to as a  CoCo ). These"
"1493","securities provide for mandatory conversion"
"1494","into common stock of the issuer under"
"1495","certain circumstances. The mandatory"
"1496","conversion might be automatically triggered"
"1497","for instance, if a company fails to meet the"
"1498","capital minimum described in the security,"
"1499","the company s regulator makes a"
"1500","determination that the security should"
"1501","convert, or the company receives specified"
"1502","levels of extraordinary public support. Since"
"1503","the common stock of the issuer may not pay"
"1504","a dividend, investors in these instruments"
"1505","could experience a reduced income rate,"
"1506","potentially to zero; and conversion would"
"1507","deepen the subordination of the investor,"
"1508","hence worsening standing in a"
"1509","bankruptcy. In addition, some such"
"1510","instruments have a set stock conversion rate"
"1511","that would cause an automatic write-down"
"1512","of capital if the price of the stock is below"
"1513","the conversion price on the conversion"
"1514","date. In another version of a security with"
"1515","loss absorption characteristics, the"
"1516","liquidation value of the security may be"
"1517","adjusted downward to below the original"
"1518","par value under certain circumstances"
"1519","similar to those which would trigger a"
"1520","CoCo. The write down of the par value"
"1521","would occur automatically and would not"
"1522","entitle the holders to seek bankruptcy of the"
"1523","company."
"1524","    Capitalized terms used herein but not"
"1525","defined shall have the meanings assigned to"
"1526","them in the SAI."
