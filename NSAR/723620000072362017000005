"4331","2017, in accordance with the standards of the"
"4332","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"4333","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"4334","control over financial reporting, including controls"
"4335","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"4336","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"4337","of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"4338","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"4339","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"4340","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"4341","internal control over financial reporting."
"4342","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"4343","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"4344","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"4345","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"4346","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"4347","management are required to assess the expected"
"4348","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"4349","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"4350","designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"4351","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"4352","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"4353","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"4354","accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"4355","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"4356","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"4357","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"4358","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"4359","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"4360","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"4361","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"4362","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"4363","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"4364","expenditures of the company are being made only"
"4365","in accordance with authorizations of management"

"4367","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"4368","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"4369","disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"4370","material effect on the financial statements."
"4371","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"4372","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"4373","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"4374","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"4375","risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"4376","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"4377","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"4378","deteriorate."
"4379","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"4380","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"4381","control does not allow management or employees,"
"4382","in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"4383","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"4384","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"4385","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"4386","over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"4387","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"4388","of the company's annual or interim financial"
"4389","statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"4390","timely basis."
"4391","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control"
"4392","over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"4393","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"4394","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"4395","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"4396","standards established by the Public Company"
"4397","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"4398","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"4399","internal control over financial reporting and its"
"4400","operation, including controls over safeguarding"

"4845","or Class held during the preceding twelve months, unless"
"4846","requested by the holders of a majority of the Outstanding"
"4847","Shares of such Series or Class entitled to be voted at such"
"4848","meeting.  A special meeting of Shareholders of any Series or"
"4849","Class shall be held at such time and place as is determined"
"4850","by the Trustees and stated in the notice of that meeting."
"4851","Section 3.  Notice of Meetings; Waiver.  The Secretary"
"4852","shall call a special meeting of Shareholders by giving written"
"4853","notice of the place, date, time, and purposes of that meeting"

"4855","Secretary may deliver or mail, postage prepaid, the written"
"4856","notice of any meeting to each Shareholder entitled to vote at"
"4857","such meeting.  If mailed, notice shall be deemed to be given"

"4860","of the Trust."
"4861","Section 4.  Adjourned Meetings.  A Shareholders' meeting"
"4862","may be adjourned one or more times for any reason,"
"4863","including the failure of a quorum to attend the meeting.  No"

"4870","Any business that might have been transacted at the original"

"4874","meeting to Shareholders of record entitled to vote at such"
"4875","meeting.  Any irregularities in the notice of any meeting or"

"4879","Section 5.  Validity of Proxies.  Subject to the provisions of"
"4880","the Trust Instrument, Shareholders entitled to vote may vote"
"4881","either in person or by proxy; provided, that either (1) the"
"4882","Shareholder or his or her duly authorized attorney has signed"
"4883","and dated a written instrument authorizing such proxy to act,"
"4884","or (2) the Trustees adopt by resolution an electronic,"
"4885","telephonic, computerized or other alternative to execution of"
"4886","a written instrument authorizing the proxy to act, but if a"
"4887","proposal by anyone other than the officers or Trustees is"
"4888","submitted to a vote of the Shareholders of any Series or"
"4889","Class, or if there is a proxy contest or proxy solicitation or"
"4890","proposal in opposition to any proposal by the officers or"

"4892","proxy.  Unless the proxy provides otherwise, it shall not be"

"4894","meeting.  All proxies shall be delivered to the Secretary or"
"4895","other person responsible for recording the proceedings"
"4896","before being voted.  A proxy with respect to Shares held in"
"4897","the name of two or more persons shall be valid if executed"
"4898","by one of them unless at or prior to exercise of such proxy"
"4899","the Trust receives a specific written notice to the contrary"
"4900","from any one of them.  Unless otherwise specifically limited"
"4901","by their terms, proxies shall entitle the Shareholder to vote at"
"4902","any adjournment of a Shareholders' meeting.  A proxy"
"4903","purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Shareholder"
"4904","shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its"
"4905","exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on"
"4906","the challenger.  At every meeting of Shareholders, unless the"
"4907","voting is conducted by inspectors, the chairman of the"
"4908","meeting shall decide all questions concerning the"

"4943","only by a transfer recorded on the books of the Trust by the"

"4947","adopt rules and regulations regarding the method of transfer"
"4948","of such Shares."
"4949","ARTICLE VII."
"4950","INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND REPORTS"

"4972","financial statements filed by the Trust.  The Accountant's"
"4973","certificates and reports shall be addressed both to the"

"4979","submit the selection for ratification or rejection at the next"
"4980","succeeding Shareholders' meeting, if such a meeting is to be"
"4981","held within the Trust's fiscal year.  If the selection is rejected"

"4983","vote of the Trust's outstanding voting securities, either at the"
"4984","meeting at which the rejection occurred or at a subsequent"
"4985","meeting of Shareholders called for the purpose of selecting"
"4986","an Accountant.  The employment of the Accountant shall be"
"4987","conditioned upon the right of the Trust to terminate such"

"5003","ARTICLE X."
"5004","NET ASSET VALUE"
"5005","The term Net Asset Value of any Series shall mean that"
"5006","amount by which the assets belonging to that Series exceed"
"5007","its liabilities, all as determined by or under the direction of"
"5008","the Trustees.  Net Asset Value per Share shall be determined"
"5009","separately for each Series and shall be determined on such"
"5010","days and at such times as the Trustees may determine.  The"
"5011","Trustees shall make such determination with respect to"
"5012","securities for which market quotations are readily available,"
"5013","at the market value of such securities, and with respect to"
"5014","other securities and assets, at the fair value as determined in"
"5015","good faith by or under the direction of the Trustees;"

"5019","rules, regulations and interpretations thereof promulgated or"
"5020","issued by the SEC or insofar as permitted by any order of the"
"5021","SEC applicable to the Series.  The Trustees may delegate any"
"5022","of their powers and duties under this Article X with respect"

"5026","time when such redetermined values shall become effective."

"5028","CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROCEDURES"
"5029","To the extent that a Series of the Trust invests all of its cash"
"5030","and other property in securities issued by a registered"
"5031","investment company or a series thereof that has the same"
"5032","trustees as the Trust (a Master Trust):"
"5033","Section 1.  Monitoring and Reporting Conflicts.   Set forth"
"5034","in this Article are procedures established to address potential"
"5035","conflicts of interest that may arise between the Trust and the"
"5036","Master Trust (collectively, the Trusts). On an ongoing"
"5037","basis, the investment adviser (Manager) of the Master"
"5038","Trust shall be responsible for monitoring the Trusts for the"
"5039","existence of any material conflicts of interest between the"
"5040","Trusts.  The Manager shall be responsible for reporting any"
"5041","potential or existing conflicts to trustees of the Trusts as they"
"5042","may develop."

"5045","Trusts for conflicts of interest."
"5046","Section 3.  Resolution of Conflicts.  If a potential conflict of"
"5047","interest arises, the Trustees shall take such action as is"
"5048","reasonably appropriate to deal with the conflict, up to and"
"5049","including recommending a change in the trustees and"
"5050","implementing such recommendation, consistent with"
"5051","applicable law."
"5052","Section 4.  Annual Review.  The Trustees, including a"
"5053","majority of the Disinterested Trustees, shall determine no"
"5054","less frequently than annually that the operating structure is in"
"5055","the best interest of Shareholders.  The Trustees shall"
"5056","consider, among other things, whether the expenses incurred"
"5057","by the Trust are approximately the same or less than the"
"5058","expenses that the Trust would incur if it invested directly in"
"5059","the type of securities being held by the Master Trust."
