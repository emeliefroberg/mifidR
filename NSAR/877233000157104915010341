"553","for the year ended October 31, 2015, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"

"564","control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"565","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
