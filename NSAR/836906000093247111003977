"1071","January 28, 2011"
"1072","Reorganization of Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund into Vanguard"
"1073","Balanced Index Fund"
"1074","The board of trustees (the ?board?) of Vanguard Malvern Funds"
"1075","(the ?Trust?) has"
"1076","approved an agreement and plan of reorganization (the"
"1077","?agreement?) to"
"1078","reorganize Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund, a series of"
"1079","the Trust, into Vanguard"
"1080","Balanced Index Fund, a series of Vanguard Valley Forge"
"1081","Funds. The agreement"
"1082","requires approval by Asset Allocation Fund shareholders"
"1083","and will be submitted for"
"1084","their consideration at a meeting to be held on January"
"1085","26, 2012. If shareholders"
"1086","approve the agreement, and if certain conditions required"
"1087"," by the agreement are"
"1088","satisfied, the reorganization is expected to occur"
"1089","shortly thereafter."
"1090","Under the agreement, shareholders of the Asset Allocation"
"1091"," Fund will receive new"
"1092","Investor Shares or Admiral? Shares, as appropriate, of"
"1093","the Balanced Index Fund in"
"1094","exchange for their shares of the Asset Allocation Fund,"
"1095","and the Asset Allocation"
"1096","Fund will cease operations. It is anticipated that the"
"1097","reorganization will qualify as a"
"1098","tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes"
"1099"," and that shareholders will"
"1100","not recognize any gain or loss in connection with the"
"1101","reorganization."
"1102","Prior to the shareholder meeting, a combined proxy"
"1103","statement/prospectus will"
"1104","be issued to Asset Allocation Fund shareholders"
"1105","soliciting their approval of the"
"1106","reorganization. The proxy statement/prospectus will"
"1107"," describe the reorganization,"
"1108","provide a description of the new Balanced Index Fund"
"1109"," shares, and include a"
"1110","comparison of the Funds."
"1111","Closed to New Investors"
"1112","Effective immediately, the Asset Allocation Fund is"
"1113","closed to new accounts, and"
"1114","will stop accepting purchase requests from existing"
"1115","accounts shortly before the"
"1116","reorganization is scheduled to occur."
"1117","Changes to the Asset Allocation Fund?s Investment"
"1118","Objective,"
"1119","Strategies, and Investment Advisor"
"1120","The board of trustees of the Asset Allocation Fund"
"1121"," has restructured the Asset"
"1122","Allocation Fund?s investment advisory team, removing"
"1123"," Mellon Capital"
"1124","Management Corporation (Mellon Capital) as investment"
"1125"," advisor and reallocating"
"1126","the Asset Allocation Fund?s assets to Vanguard?s"
"1127","Quantitative Equity Group and"
"1128","Vanguard?s Fixed Income Group. This transition will"
"1129"," involve significant turnover of"
"1130","portfolio securities; however, due to capital loss"
"1131"," carryforwards, it is not expected"
"1132","to have a material tax impact on Asset Allocation"
"1133","Fund shareholders."
"1134","The Asset Allocation Fund?s investment objective and"
"1135"," strategies are changing"
"1136","significantly in conjunction with the change in advisor."
"1137"," The new investment"
"1138","objective, primary investment strategies, and risks of"
"1139","the Asset Allocation Fund"
"1140","will be identical to those of the Balanced Index Fund,"
"1141","so the board has proposed"
"1142","merging the Asset Allocation Fund into the Balanced"
"1143","Index Fund."
"1144","In addition, in conjunction with the changes in investment"
"1145"," advisor, investment"
"1146","objective, primary investment strategies, and risks of"
"1147","the Asset Allocation Fund,"
"1148","it is anticipated that each of the four Vanguard"
"1149","LifeStrategy? Funds, each a fund"
"1150","of funds, will redeem its holdings of the Asset"
"1151","Allocation Fund. Any expense"
"1152","increase resulting from the Asset Allocation Fund?s"
"1153"," reduced asset base will be"
"1154","offset by the decrease in the Asset Allocation Fund?s"
"1155"," advisory expenses and"
"1156","other factors. As a result, the redemption is not"
"1157","expected to lead to an increase"
"1158","in the Asset Allocation Fund?s expense ratios."
"1159","Prospectus and Summary Prospectus Text Changes"
"1160","The following text replaces the text under the headings"
"1161"," identified:"
"1162","Investment Objective"
"1163","With 60% of its assets, the Fund seeks to track the"
"1164","performance of a"
"1165","benchmark index that measures the investment return"
"1166"," of the overall U.S. stock"
"1167","market. With 40% of its assets, the Fund seeks to"
"1168","track the performance of a"
"1169","broad, market-weighted bond index."
"1170","Primary Investment Strategies"
"1171","The Fund employs a ?passive management??or indexing?"
"1172","investment"
"1173","approach designed to track the performance of two"
"1174","benchmark indexes. The"
"1175","Fund invests by sampling its target indexes, meaning"
"1176"," that it holds a range of"
"1177","securities that, in the aggregate, approximate the"
"1178","full indexes in terms of"
"1179","key characteristics."
"1180","With approximately 60% of its assets, the Fund seeks"
"1181"," to track the investment"
"1182","performance of the MSCI US Broad Market Index, which"
"1183"," represents 99.5% or"
"1184","more of the total market capitalization of all the"
"1185","U.S. common stocks regularly"
"1186","traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq"
"1187"," over-the-counter"
"1188","market. The Fund typically holds 1,200?1,300 of the"
"1189","stocks in the Index and a"
"1190","representative sample of the remaining stocks."
"1191","With approximately 40% of its assets, the Fund seeks"
"1192"," to track the investment"
"1193","performance of the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate"
"1194","Float Adjusted Index, which"
"1195","measures a wide spectrum of public, investment-grade,"
"1196"," taxable, fixed income"
"1197","securities in the United States?including government,"
"1198"," corporate, and"
"1199","international dollar-denominated bonds, as well as"
"1200","mortgage-backed and assetbacked"
"1201","securities, all with maturities of more than 1 year."
"1202"," At least 80% of the"
"1203","bond portion of the Fund is invested in bonds held"
"1204","in the Barclays Capital U.S."
"1205","Aggregate Float Adjusted Index, and all of the Fund?s"
"1206"," bond holdings are selected"
"1207","through the sampling process. The bond portion of"
"1208","the Fund maintains a dollarweighted"
"1209","average maturity consistent with that of the Index,"
"1210"," which ranges"
"1211","between 5 and 10 years."
"1212","Primary Risks"
"1213","The Fund is subject to the risks associated with the"
"1214"," stock and bond markets, any"
"1215","of which could cause an investor to lose money. However,"
"1216"," because stock and"
"1217","bond prices can move in different directions or to"
"1218","different degrees, the Fund?s"
"1219","bond holdings may counteract some of the volatility"
"1220"," experienced by the Fund?s"
"1221","stock holdings."
"1222","? With approximately 60% of its assets allocated to"
"1223"," stocks, the Fund is"
"1224","proportionately subject to stock market risk, which"
"1225"," is the chance that stock prices"
"1226","overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in"
"1227","cycles, with periods of rising"
"1228","prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund?s target"
"1229"," index may, at times,"
"1230","become focused in stocks of a particular sector,"
"1231","category, or group of companies."
"1232","? With approximately 40% of its assets allocated to"
"1233"," bonds, the Fund is"
"1234","proportionately subject to bond risks, including"
"1235","interest rate risk, which is the"
"1236","chance that bond prices overall will decline because"
"1237"," of rising interest rates;"
"1238","income risk, which is the chance that the Fund?s"
"1239","income will decline because of"
"1240","falling interest rates; credit risk, which is the"
"1241"," chance that a bond issuer will fail to"
"1242","pay interest and principal in a timely manner, or"
"1243"," that negative perceptions of the"
"1244","issuer?s ability to make such payments will cause"
"1245"," the price of that bond to"
"1246","decline; and call risk, which is the chance that"
"1247","during periods of falling interest"
"1248","rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem)"
"1249"," securities with higher"
"1250","coupons or interest rates before their maturity"
"1251","dates. The Fund would then lose"
"1252","any price appreciation above the bond?s call"
"1253","price and would be forced to"
"1254","reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower"
"1255","interest rates, resulting in a decline"
"1256","in the Fund?s income. For mortgage-backed securities,"
"1257"," this risk is known as"
"1258","prepayment risk."
"1259","? The Fund is also subject to index sampling risk,"
"1260","which is the chance that the"
"1261","securities selected for the Fund will not provide"
"1262","investment performance"
"1263","matching that of the Fund?s target indexes."

"1289","Prospectus Text Changes"
"1290","The following text is added immediately prior to the More"
"1291","on the Fund section:"
"1292","Investing in Index Funds"
"1293","What Is Indexing?"
"1294","Indexing is an investment strategy for tracking the"
"1295","performance of a specified"
"1296","market benchmark, or ?index.? An index is an unmanaged"
"1297"," group of securities"
"1298","whose overall performance is used as a standard to"
"1299","measure the investment"
"1300","performance of a particular market. There are many types"
"1301"," of indexes. Some"
"1302","represent entire markets?such as the U.S. stock market"
"1303"," or the U.S. bond"
"1304","market. Other indexes cover market segments?such as"
"1305","small-capitalization"
"1306","stocks or short-term bonds."
"1307","An index fund holds all, or a representative sample,"
"1308","of the securities that make"
"1309","up its target index. Index funds attempt to mirror"
"1310","the performance of the target"
"1311","index, for better or worse. However, an index fund"
"1312","does not always perform"
"1313","exactly like its target index. For example, like all"
"1314"," mutual funds, index funds have"
"1315","operating expenses and transaction costs. Market"
"1316","indexes do not, and therefore"
"1317","will usually have a slight performance advantage over"
"1318"," funds that track them."
"1319","Index funds typically have the following characteristics:"
"1320","? Variety of investments. Most Vanguard index funds"
"1321","generally invest in the"
"1322","securities of a wide variety of companies and"
"1323","industries."
"1324","? Relative performance consistency. Because they seek"
"1325"," to track market"
"1326","benchmarks, index funds usually do not perform"
"1327","dramatically better or worse"
"1328","than their benchmarks."
"1329","? Low cost. Index funds are inexpensive to run compared"
"1330"," with actively managed"
"1331","funds. They have low or no research costs and typically"
"1332"," keep trading activity?"
"1333","and thus brokerage commissions, dealer markups, and"
"1334","other transaction"
"1335","costs?to a minimum."
"1336","In the More on the Fund section, the following sections"
"1337"," are replaced with"
"1338","this text."
"1339","Market Exposure"
"1340","Stocks"
"1341","Approximately 60% of the Fund?s assets are invested"
"1342"," in stocks."
"1343","The Fund is subject to stock market risk, which is"
"1344","the chance that stock"
"1345","prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to"
"1346","move in cycles, with"
"1347","periods of rising prices and periods of falling"
"1348","prices. The Fund?s target"
"1349","index may, at times, become focused in stocks of"
"1350","a particular sector,"
"1351","category, or group of companies."
"1352","To illustrate the volatility of stock prices, the"
"1353","following table shows the best,"
"1354","worst, and average annual total returns for the U.S."
"1355"," stock market over various"
"1356","periods as measured by the Standard & Poor?s 500"
"1357","Index, a widely used"
"1358","barometer of market activity. (Total returns consist"
"1359"," of dividend income plus"
"1360","change in market price.) Note that the returns shown"
"1361"," do not include the costs of"
"1362","buying and selling stocks or other expenses that a"
"1363","real-world investment"
"1364","portfolio would incur."
"1365","The table covers all of the 1-, 5-, 10-, and 20-year"
"1366"," periods from 1926 through"
"1367","2010. You can see, for example, that although the"
"1368","average return on common"
"1369","stocks for all of the 5-year periods was 10%, average"
"1370"," returns for individual 5-year"
"1371","periods ranged from ?12.4% (from 1928 through 1932)"
"1372"," to 28.6% (from 1995"
"1373","through 1999). These average returns reflect past"
"1374","performance of common"
"1375","stocks; you should not regard them as an indication"
"1376"," of future performance of"
"1377","either the stock market as a whole or the Fund in"
"1378","particular."
"1379","Although the Fund will typically include the largest"
"1380"," 1,200?1,300 stocks in the"
"1381","MSCI US Broad Market Index, it will not include all"
"1382","of the securities in the Index."
"1383","Instead, the Fund will invest in a representative"
"1384","sample of stocks."
"1385","Stocks of publicly traded companies and funds that"
"1386","invest in stocks are often"
"1387","classified according to market value, or market"
"1388","capitalization. These"
"1389","classifications typically include small-cap, mid-cap,"
"1390"," and large-cap. It?s important"
"1391","to understand that, for both companies and stock"
"1392","funds, market-capitalization"
"1393","ranges change over time. Also, interpretations of size"
"1394"," vary, and there are no"
"1395","?official? definitions of small-, mid-, and large-cap,"
"1396"," even among Vanguard fund"
"1397","advisors. The asset-weighted median market capitalization"
"1398"," of the Fund?s stock"
"1399","portfolio as of December 31, 2010, was $29.7 billion."
"1400","Although the MSCI US Broad Market Index is dominated"
"1401","by large-cap stocks"
"1402","(those tracked by the S&P 500 Index), small- and mid"
"1403","-cap stocks are also"

"1412","the MSCI US Broad Market Index was made up of"
"1413","securities that were not in the"
"1414","S&P 500 Index. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks"
"1415"," have been more volatile"
"1416","than?and at times have performed quite differently"
"1417","from?large-cap stocks."
"1418","Bonds"
"1419","Approximately 40% of the Fund?s assets are invested"
"1420"," in bonds."
"1421","The Fund is subject to interest rate risk, which is"
"1422"," the chance that bond"
"1423","prices overall will decline because of rising"
"1424","interest rates. Interest rate"
"1425","risk should be moderate because the average term"
"1426"," of the Fund?s bond"
"1427","portfolio is generally intermediate-term, and"
"1428","because the Fund?s bond"
"1429","holdings represent less than half of the Fund?s"
"1430","assets."
"1431","Although bonds are often thought to be less risky"
"1432","than stocks, there have been"
"1433","periods when bond prices have fallen significantly"
"1434"," because of rising interest"
"1435","rates. For instance, prices of long-term bonds fell"
"1436"," by almost 48% between"
"1437","December 1976 and September 1981."
"1438","To illustrate the relationship between bond prices"
"1439"," and interest rates, the"
"1440","following table shows the effect of a 1% and a"
"1441","2% change (both up and down)"
"1442","in interest rates on the values of three noncallable"
"1443"," bonds of different maturities,"
"1444","each with a face value of $1,000."
"1445","These figures are for illustration only; you should"
"1446"," not regard them as an"

"1458","1 Assuming a 4% coupon."
"1459","Changes in interest rates can affect bond income as"
"1460"," well as bond prices."
"1461","The Fund is subject to income risk, which is the"
"1462","chance that the Fund?s"
"1463","income will decline because of falling interest rates."
"1464"," A fund holding"
"1465","bonds will experience a decline in income when"
"1466","interest rates fall"
"1467","because the fund then must invest in lower-yielding"
"1468"," bonds."
"1469","Although income risk for short- and intermediate-term"
"1470"," bonds?like those held by"
"1471","the Fund?is considered moderate, this risk should be"
"1472"," low for the Fund because"
"1473","it invests only a portion of its assets in bonds."
"1474","Plain Talk About Bonds and Interest Rates"
"1475","As a rule, when interest rates rise, bond prices fall."
"1476"," The opposite is also true:"
"1477","Bond prices go up when interest rates fall. Why do bond"
"1478"," prices and"
"1479","interest rates move in opposite directions? Let?s assume"
"1480"," that you hold a bond"
"1481","offering a 4% yield. A year later, interest rates are on"
"1482"," the rise and bonds of"
"1483","comparable quality and maturity are offered with a 5%"
"1484","yield. With higheryielding"
"1485","bonds available, you would have trouble selling your 4%"
"1486"," bond for the"
"1487","price you paid?you would probably have to lower your"
"1488","asking price. On the"
"1489","other hand, if interest rates were falling and 3% bonds"
"1490"," were being offered,"
"1491","you should be able to sell your 4% bond for more than"
"1492","you paid."
"1493","How mortgage-backed securities are different: In general,"
"1494"," declining interest"
"1495","rates will not lift the prices of mortgage-backed"
"1496","securities?such as GNMAs?"
"1497","as much as the prices of comparable bonds. Why? Because"
"1498"," when interest"
"1499","rates fall, the bond market tends to discount the"
"1500","prices of mortgage-backed"
"1501","securities for prepayment risk?the possibility that"
"1502","homeowners will refinance"
"1503","their mortgages at lower rates and cause the bonds"
"1504","to be paid off prior to"
"1505","maturity. In part to compensate for this prepayment"
"1506","possibility, mortgagebacked"
"1507","securities tend to offer higher yields than other"
"1508","bonds of comparable"
"1509","credit quality and maturity."
"1510","The Fund is subject to call risk, which is the chance"
"1511"," that during periods"
"1512","of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may"
"1513"," call (redeem)"
"1514","securities with higher coupons or interest rates"
"1515","before their maturity"
"1516","dates. The Fund would then lose any price appreciation"
"1517"," above the"
"1518","bond?s call price and would be forced to reinvest"
"1519","the unanticipated"
"1520","proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline"
"1521"," in the Fund?s"
"1522","income. For mortgage-backed securities, this risk is"
"1523","known as"
"1524","prepayment risk."
"1525","Because the Fund invests only a portion of its assets in"
"1526"," callable bonds and"
"1527","mortgage-backed securities, call/prepayment risk for the"
"1528"," Fund should be low."
"1529","The Fund is subject to credit risk, which is the chance"
"1530","that a bond issuer"
"1531","will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner,"
"1532"," or that"
"1533","negative perceptions of the issuer?s ability to make such"
"1534"," payments will"
"1535","cause the price of that bond to decline."
"1536","The credit quality of the Fund is expected to be very"
"1537","high, and thus credit risk"
"1538","should be low."
"1539","Plain Talk About Bond Maturities"
"1540","A bond is issued with a specific maturity date?the date"
"1541"," when the issuer must"
"1542","pay back the bond?s principal (face value). Bond"
"1543","maturities range from less"
"1544","than 1 year to more than 30 years. Typically, the longer"
"1545"," a bond?s maturity, the"
"1546","more price risk you, as a bond investor, face as interest"
"1547"," rates rise?but also"
"1548","the higher yield you could receive. Longer-term bonds"
"1549","are more suitable for"
"1550","investors willing to take a greater risk of price"
"1551","fluctuations to get higher and"
"1552","more stable interest income. Shorter-term bond investors"
"1553"," should be willing to"
"1554","accept lower yields and greater income variability in"
"1555","return for less fluctuation"
"1556","in the value of their investment."
"1557","To a limited extent, the Fund is also exposed to event"
"1558"," risk, which is the chance"
"1559","that corporate fixed income securities held by the"
"1560","Fund may suffer a substantial"
"1561","decline in credit quality and market value because of"
"1562","a corporate restructuring or"
"1563","another corporate event."
"1564","The Fund?s bond holdings help to reduce?but not eliminate"
"1565","?some of the stock"
"1566","market volatility that may be experienced by the Fund."
"1567","Likewise, changes in"
"1568","interest rates may not have as dramatic an effect on the"
"1569"," Fund as they would on"
"1570","a fund made up entirely of bonds. The Fund?s balanced"
"1571","portfolio, in the long run,"
"1572","should result in less investment risk?and a lower"
"1573","investment return?than a"
"1574","fund investing exclusively in common stocks."
"1575","Security Selection"
"1576","Index sampling strategy. Because it would be very"
"1577","expensive and inefficient to"
"1578","buy and sell all the securities held in its target"
"1579","indexes, the Fund uses an index"
"1580","?sampling? technique to select securities. Using"
"1581","sophisticated computer"
"1582","programs, the Fund generally selects a representative"
"1583"," sample of securities that"
"1584","approximates the full target indexes in terms of key"
"1585"," characteristics. In its stock"
"1586","portion, the Fund typically holds 1,200?1,300 of the"
"1587"," stocks in the MSCI US"
"1588","Broad Market Index and a representative sample of the"
"1589"," remaining stocks. In its"
"1590","bond portion, the Fund considers such factors as"
"1591","duration, cash flow, quality,"
"1592","and callability of the underlying bonds when sampling"
"1593"," the Barclays Capital U.S."
"1594","Aggregate Float Adjusted Index. In addition, the Fund"
"1595"," keeps industry sector and"
"1596","subsector exposure for bonds within tight boundaries"
"1597"," compared with that of"
"1598","the Index."
"1599","Because the Fund does not hold all the securities in"
"1600","its target indexes, some of"
"1601","the securities (and issuers) that are held will"
"1602","likely be overweighted compared"
"1603","with the target indexes."
"1604","Plain Talk About Credit Quality"
"1605","A bond?s credit-quality rating is an assessment of the"
"1606"," issuer?s ability to pay"
"1607","interest on the bond and, ultimately, to repay the"
"1608","principal. Credit quality is"
"1609","evaluated by one of the nationally recognized statistical"
"1610"," rating organizations (for"
"1611","example, Moody?s or Standard & Poor?s) or through"
"1612","independent analysis"
"1613","conducted by a fund?s advisor. The lower the rating, the"
"1614"," greater the chance?in"
"1615","the rating agency?s or advisor?s opinion?that the bond"
"1616"," issuer will default, or"
"1617","fail to meet its payment obligations. All things being"
"1618","equal, the lower a bond?s"
"1619","credit rating, the higher its yield should be to"
"1620","compensate investors for"
"1621","assuming additional risk. Investment-grade bonds are"
"1622","those rated in one of the"
"1623","four highest ratings categories. A fund may treat an"
"1624","unrated bond as"
"1625","investment-grade if warranted by the advisor?s analysis."
"1626","The following table shows the number of stocks and bonds"
"1627"," held by the Fund?s"
"1628","target index as of June 30, 2011."
"1629","The Fund is subject to index sampling risk, which is"
"1630"," the chance that"
"1631","the securities selected for the Fund will not provide"
"1632","investment"
"1633","performance matching that of the Fund?s target"
"1634","indexes."
"1635","Types of bonds. The Fund?s target index for bonds,"
"1636"," the Barclays Capital U.S."
"1637","Aggregate Float Adjusted Index, measures a wide"
"1638","spectrum of investmentgrade"
"1639","fixed income securities in the United States?including"
"1640"," government,"
"1641","corporate, and international dollar-denominated bonds,"
"1642"," as well as mortgagebacked"
"1643","and asset-backed securities, all with maturities of"
"1644","more than 1 year."
"1645","An explanation of each type of bond follows:"
"1646","? U.S. government and agency bonds represent loans by"
"1647"," investors to the U.S."
"1648","Treasury Department or a wide variety of government"
"1649","agencies and"
"1650","instrumentalities. Timely payment of principal and"
"1651","interest on U.S. Treasury"
"1652","bonds is always guaranteed by the full faith and"
"1653","credit of the U.S. government;"
"1654","many (but not all) agency bonds have the same guarantee."
"1655","? Corporate bonds are IOUs issued by businesses that"
"1656","want to borrow money"
"1657","for some purpose?often to develop a new product or"
"1658","service, to expand into a"
"1659","new market, or to buy another company. As with other"
"1660"," types of bonds, the"
"1661","issuer promises to repay the principal on a specific"
"1662"," date and to make interest"
"1663","payments in the meantime. The amount of interest"
"1664","offered depends both on"
"1665","market conditions and on the financial health of the"
"1666"," corporation issuing the"
"1667","bonds; a company whose credit rating is not strong"
"1668","will have to offer a higher"
"1669","interest rate to obtain buyers for its bonds."
"1670","Corporate bonds include securities"
"1671","that are backed by a pool of underlying assets"
"1672","(asset-backed securities) or"
"1673","commercial mortgages (commercial mortgage-backed"
"1674"," bonds). The Fund expects"
"1675","to purchase only investment-grade corporate bonds."
"1676","? Mortgage-backed securities represent interests"
"1677","in underlying pools of"
"1678","mortgages. Unlike ordinary bonds, which generally"
"1679","pay a fixed rate of interest at"
"1680","regular intervals and then repay principal upon"
"1681","maturity, mortgage-backed"
"1682","securities pass through both interest and principal"
"1683"," from underlying mortgages"
"1684","as part of their regular payments. Because the"
"1685","mortgages underlying the"
"1686","securities can be prepaid at any time by homeowners"
"1687"," or corporate borrowers,"
"1688","Number of Securities"
"1689","in Target Index"
"1690","Stocks 3,377"
"1691","Bonds 7,979"
"1692","mortgage-backed securities are subject to prepayment"
"1693"," risk. These types of"
"1694","securities are issued by a number of government"
"1695","agencies, including the"
"1696","Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA),"
"1697","the Federal Home Loan"
"1698","Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), and the Federal"
"1699","National Mortgage Association"
"1700","(FNMA). GNMAs are guaranteed by the full faith and"
"1701"," credit of the U.S."
"1702","government as to the timely payment of principal"
"1703","and interest; mortgage-backed"
"1704","securities issued by other government agencies or"
"1705","private corporations are not."
"1706","The Fund may also invest in conventional mortgage-"
"1707","backed securities?which"
"1708","are packaged by private corporations and are not"
"1709","guaranteed by the U.S."
"1710","government?and enter into mortgage-dollar-roll"
"1711","transactions. In a mortgagedollar-"
"1712","roll transaction, a fund sells mortgage-backed"
"1713","securities to a dealer and"
"1714","simultaneously agrees to purchase similar securities"
"1715"," in the future at a"
"1716","predetermined price. These transactions simulate an"
"1717"," investment in mortgagebacked"
"1718","securities and have the potential to enhance the"
"1719","Fund?s returns and"
"1720","reduce its administrative burdens, compared with"
"1721","holding mortgage-backed"
"1722","securities directly. These transactions may increase"
"1723"," a fund?s portfolio turnover"
"1724","rate. Mortgage dollar rolls will be used only if"
"1725","consistent with the Fund?s"
"1726","investment objective and risk profile."
"1727","? International dollar-denominated bonds are bonds"
"1728"," denominated in U.S. dollars"
"1729","and issued by foreign governments and companies."
"1730","To the extent that it owns"
"1731","foreign bonds, the Fund is subject to country risk,"
"1732"," which is the chance that world"
"1733","events?such as political upheaval, financial troubles,"
"1734"," or natural disasters?will"
"1735","adversely affect the value of securities issued by"
"1736","companies in foreign countries."
"1737","In addition, the prices of foreign stocks and the"
"1738","prices of U.S. stocks have, at"
"1739","times, moved in opposite directions. Because the"
"1740","bond?s value is designated in"
"1741","dollars rather than in the currency of the issuer?s"
"1742"," country, the investor is not"
"1743","exposed to currency risk; rather, the issuer assumes"
"1744"," the risk, usually to attract"
"1745","U.S. investors."
"1746","Other Investment Policies and Risks"
"1747","The Fund reserves the right to substitute a different"
"1748"," index for either of the"
"1749","indexes that it currently tracks if a current index"
"1750","is discontinued, if the Fund?s"
"1751","agreement with the sponsor of a current index is"
"1752","terminated, or for any other"
"1753","reason determined in good faith by the Fund?s board"
"1754"," of trustees. In any such"
"1755","instance, the substitute index would measure the"
"1756","same market segment as the"
"1757","current index."
"1758","The Fund may invest in foreign stocks to the extent"
"1759"," necessary to carry out its"
"1760","investment strategy of holding a representative"
"1761","sample of the stocks that make"
"1762","up the index it tracks. It is not expected that the"
"1763","Fund will invest more than 5%"
"1764","of its assets in foreign stocks."
"1765","Up to 20% of the bond portion of the Fund may be used"
"1766"," to purchase nonpublic,"
"1767","investment-grade securities, generally referred to"
"1768","as 144A securities, as well as"
"1769","smaller public issues or medium-term notes not included"
"1770"," in the Barclays Capital"
"1771","U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index because of the"
"1772","size of the issue. Subject to"
"1773","the same 20% limit, the Fund also may invest in"
"1774","relatively conservative classes"
"1775","of collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), which"
"1776"," offer a high degree of"
"1777","cash-flow predictability and a low level of"
"1778","vulnerability to mortgage prepayment"
"1779","risk. To reduce credit risk, these CMOs are purchased"
"1780"," only if issued by agencies"
"1781","of the U.S. government or by private companies that"
"1782","carry high-quality"
"1783","investment-grade ratings. The vast majority of any"
"1784","such securities will have"
"1785","characteristics and risks similar to those in the"
"1786","Index."
"1787","The Fund may invest, to a limited extent, in derivatives."
"1788"," Generally speaking, a"
"1789","derivative is a financial contract whose value is based"
"1790"," on the value of a financial"
"1791","asset (such as a stock, bond, or currency), a physical"
"1792","asset (such as gold, oil, or"
"1793","wheat), or a market index (such as the S&P 500 Index)."
"1794","Investments in"
"1795","derivatives may subject the Fund to risks different from,"
"1796"," and possibly greater"
"1797","than, those of the underlying securities, assets, or"
"1798","market indexes. The Fund will"
"1799","not use derivatives for speculation or for the purpose"
"1800","of leveraging (magnifying)"
"1801","investment returns."
"1802","The Fund may purchase money market instruments and certain"
"1803"," derivatives in"
"1804","order to manage cash flow into and out of the Fund,"
"1805","reduce the Fund?s"
"1806","transaction costs, or add value when these instruments"
"1807"," are favorably priced."
"1808","Vanguard may invest a small portion of the Fund?s assets"
"1809"," in shares of stock and"
"1810","bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs provide returns"
"1811"," similar to those of the"
"1812","stocks and bonds listed in an index or in a subset of an"
"1813"," index. Vanguard may"
"1814","purchase ETFs when doing so will reduce the Fund?s"
"1815","transaction costs or add"
"1816","value because the ETFs are favorably priced."
"1817","In the More on the Fund section, the following is added"
"1818"," immediately following"
"1819","?Cash Management?:"
"1820","Temporary Investment Measures"
"1821","The Fund may temporarily depart from its normal"
"1822","investment policies and"
"1823","strategies when doing so is believed to be in the Fund?s"
"1824"," best interest, so long as"
"1825","the alternative is consistent with the Fund?s investment"
"1826"," objective. For instance,"
"1827","the Fund may invest beyond the normal limits in derivatives"
"1828"," or ETFs that are"
"1829","consistent with the Fund?s objective when those instruments"
"1830"," are more favorably"
"1831","priced or provide needed liquidity, as might be the case"
"1832"," when the Fund receives"
"1833","large cash flows that it cannot prudently invest immediately."
"1834","In the More on the Fund section, ?Turnover Rate? is replaced"
"1835"," with the following:"
"1836","Although the Fund normally seeks to invest for the long term,"
"1837"," it may sell"
"1838","securities regardless of how long they have been held. Generally,"
"1839"," index-oriented"
"1840","funds sell securities only in response to redemption requests"
"1841","or changes in the"
"1842","composition of its target index. The Financial Highlights"
"1843","section of this"
"1844","prospectus shows historical turnover rates for the Fund. A"
"1845"," turnover rate of"
"1846","100%, for example, would mean that the Fund had sold and"
"1847","replaced securities"
"1848","valued at 100% of its net assets within a one-year period."
"1849","Note that the figures"
"1850","shown in the Financial Highlights section reflect turnover"
"1851","rates of the Asset"
"1852","Allocation Fund prior to the changes to its investment"
"1853","objective and primary"
"1854","investment strategies. The average turnover rate for balanced"
"1855"," funds was"
"1856","approximately 59%, as reported by Morningstar, Inc., on"
"1857","December 31, 2010."
"1858","In the More on the Fund section, ?Investment Advisor? is"

"2033","bond fund?prices to"
"2034","interest rate movements. For example, if a bond has"

"2049"," portion of an issuer?s securities"
"2050","may be unavailable for public trading because, for"
"2051"," example, those securities are"
"2052","owned by company insiders on a restricted basis or"

"2054","excluding unavailable securities, float-adjusted"

"2165","Firm"
"2166","To the Board of Trustees of Vanguard Malvern Funds and the"
"2167","Shareholders of"
"2168","Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund"
"2169","Vanguard Capital Value Fund and"
"2170","Vanguard U.S. Value Fund"
"2171","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"2172","statements of Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund, Vanguard"
"2173","Capital Value Fund and Vanguard U.S. Value Fund"
"2174","(constituting Vanguard Malvern Funds, hereafter referred to as"
"2175","the ?Trust?) as of and for the year ended September 30, 2011, in"
"2176","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"2177","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"2178","Trust?s internal control over financial reporting, including"
"2179","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"2180","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"2181","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"2182","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2183","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust?s"
"2184","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not"
"2185","express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal"
"2186","control over financial reporting."
"2187","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing"
"2188","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"2189","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"2190","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"2191","benefits and related costs of controls.  A company?s internal"
"2192","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"2193","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"2194","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"2195","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2196","accounting principles.  A company's internal control over"
"2197","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"2198","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"2199","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2200","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"2201","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2202","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2203","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"2204","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"2205","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"2206","trustees of the company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance"
"2207","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"2208","acquisition, use or disposition of a company?s assets that could"
"2209","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2210","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2211","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2212","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"2213","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2214","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"2215","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2216","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2217","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"2218","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"2219","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"2220","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2221","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"2222","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"2223","material misstatement of the Trust's annual or interim financial"
"2224","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2225","Our consideration of the Trust?s internal control over financial"
"2226","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2227","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"2228","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"2229","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"2230","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"2231","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trust?s internal"
"2232","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"2233","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be"
"2234","material weaknesses as defined above as of September 30, 2011."
"2235","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"2236","management and the Board of Trustees of Vanguard Malvern"
"2237","Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"2238","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"2239","these specified parties."
