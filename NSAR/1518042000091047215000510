"504","REPORT OF"
"505","INDEPENDENT"
"506","REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"507","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"508","To the Shareholders of"
"509","Even Keel Multi-Asset"
"510","Managed Risk Fund"
"511","and the Board of"
"512","Trustees of Northern"
"513","Lights Fund Trust II"
"514","In planning and"
"515","performing our audit of"
"516","the financial statements"
"517","of the Even Keel Multi-"
"518","Asset Managed Risk (the"
"519","Fund), a series of"
"520","shares of beneficial"
"521","interest in the Northern"
"522","Lights Fund Trust II, as of"
"523","May 31, 2015, and for the"
"524","year then ended, in"
"525","accordance with the"
"526","standards of the Public"
"527","Company Accounting"
"528","Oversight Board (United"
"529","States) (PCAOB), we"
"530","considered internal"
"531","control over financial"
"532","reporting, including"
"533","control activities over"
"534","safeguarding securities,"
"535","as a basis for designing"
"536","our auditing procedures"
"537","for the purpose of"
"538","expressing our opinion"
"539","on the financial"
"540","statements and to comply"
"541","with the requirements of"
"542","Form N-SAR, but not for"
"543","the purpose of"
"544","expressing an opinion on"
"545","the effectiveness of the"
"546","Fund's internal control"
"547","over financial reporting."
"548","Accordingly, we express"
"549","no such opinion."
"550","The management of the"
"551","Fund is responsible for"
"552","establishing and"
"553","maintaining effective"
"554","internal control over"
"555","financial reporting.  In"
"556","fulfilling this"
"557","responsibility, estimates"
"558","and judgments by"
"559","management are"
"560","required to assess the"
"561","expected benefits and"
"562","related costs of controls."
"563","A company's internal"
"564","control over financial"
"565","reporting is a process"
"566","designed to provide"
"567","reasonable assurance"
"568","regarding the reliability of"
"569","financial reporting and"
"570","the preparation of"
"571","financial statements for"
"572","external purposes in"
"573","accordance with"
"574","accounting principles"
"575","generally accepted in the"
"576","United States of America"
"577","(GAAP).  A company's"
"578","internal control over"
"579","financial reporting"
"580","includes those policies"
"581","and procedures that (1)"
"582","pertain to the"
"583","maintenance of records"
"584","that, in reasonable detail,"
"585","accurately and fairly"
"586","reflect the transactions"
"587","and dispositions of the"
"588","assets of the company;"
"589","(2) provide reasonable"
"590","assurance that"
"591","transactions are recorded"
"592","as necessary to permit"
"593","preparation of the"
"594","financial statements in"
"595","accordance with GAAP,"
"596","and that receipts and"
"597","expenditures of the"
"598","company are being made"
"599","only in accordance with"
"600","authorizations of"
"601","management and"
"602","trustees of the company;"
"603","and (3) provide"
"604","reasonable assurance"
"605","regarding prevention or"
"606","timely detection of"
"607","unauthorized acquisition,"
"608","use or disposition of a"
"609","company's assets that"
"610","could have a material"
"611","effect on the financial"
"612","statements."
"613","Because of inherent"
"614","limitations, internal"
"615","control over financial"
"616","reporting may not prevent"
"617","or detect misstatements."
"618","Also, projections of any"
"619","evaluation of"
"620","effectiveness to future"
"621","periods are subject to the"
"622","risk that controls may"
"623","become inadequate"
"624","because of changes in"
"625","conditions or that the"
"626","degree of compliance"
"627","with the policies or"
"628","procedures may"
"629","deteriorate."
"630","A deficiency in internal"
"631","control over financial"
"632","reporting exists when the"
"633","design or operation of a"
"634","control does not allow"
"635","management or"
"636","employees, in the normal"
"637","course of performing their"
"638","assigned functions, to"
"639","prevent or detect"
"640","misstatements on a"
"641","timely basis.  A material"
"642","weakness is a deficiency,"
"643","or combination of"
"644","deficiencies, in internal"
"645","control over financial"
"646","reporting, such that there"
"647","is a reasonable possibility"
"648","that a material"
"649","misstatement of the"
"650","Fund's annual or interim"
"651","financial statements will"
"652","not be prevented or"
"653","detected on a timely"
"654","basis."
"655","Our consideration of the"
"656","Fund's internal control"
"657","over financial reporting"
"658","was for the limited"
"659","purpose described in the"
"660","first paragraph and would"
"661","not necessarily disclose"
"662","all deficiencies in internal"
"663","control that might be"
"664","material weaknesses"
"665","under standards"
"666","established by the"
"667","PCAOB.  However, we"
"668","noted no deficiencies in"
"669","the internal control over"
"670","financial reporting and its"
"671","operations, including"
"672","controls over"
"673","safeguarding securities"
"674","that we consider to be"
"675","material weaknesses, as"
"676","defined above, as of May"
"677","31, 2015."
"678","This report is intended"
"679","solely for the information"
"680","and use of management,"
"681","the shareholders of the"
"682","Even Keel Multi-Asset"
"683","Managed Risk Fund, the"
