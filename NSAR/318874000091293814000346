"1509","             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1510","To the Board of Trustees of MFS Series Trust VII and"
"1511","Shareholders of MFS Equity Income Fund"
"1512","In  planning  and performing our audit of the financial statements of MFS Equity"
"1513","Income Fund (the  Fund)  as  of  and  for  the  year  ended  July 31, 2014, in"
"1514","accordance  with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight  Board"
"1515","(United States),  we  considered  the  Fund's  internal  control  over financial"
"1516","reporting,  including  controls  over  safeguarding  securities, as a basis  for"
"1517","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing  our  opinion on"
"1518","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,  but"
"1519","not  for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"1520","internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Accordingly,  we express no such"
"1521","opinion."
"1522","The  management  of  the  Fund  is responsible for establishing and  maintaining"
"1523","effective  internal  control  over  financial   reporting.  In  fulfilling  this"
"1524","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1525","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A  company's  internal control"
"1526","over  financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance"
"1527","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"1528","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1529","accounting  principles.  A  company's  internal control over financial reporting"
"1530","includes those policies and procedures that  (1)  pertain  to the maintenance of"
"1531","records   that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect   the"
"1532","transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2) provide"
"1533","reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as necessary to permit"
"1534","preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with generally  accepted"
"1535","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures  of  the  company  are"
"1536","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"1537","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1538","detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"1539","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1540","Because of its  inherent  limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1541","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1542","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1543","inadequate because of changes in conditions,  or  that  the degree of compliance"
"1544","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1545","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"1546","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,  in the normal"
"1547","course   of   performing   their   assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"1548","misstatements on a timely basis. A material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or  a"
"1549","combination  of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1550","that there is  a  reasonable  possibility  that  a  material misstatement of the"
"1551","company's  annual  or  interim financial statements will  not  be  prevented  or"
"1552","detected on a timely basis."
"1553","<PAGE>"
"1554","Our consideration of the  Fund's  internal  control over financial reporting was"
"1555","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in  the first  paragraph  and  would  not"
"1556","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1557","weaknesses  under  standards  established  by  the   Public  Company  Accounting"
"1558","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"1559","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,  including controls"
"1560","over  safeguarding  securities  that  we consider to be a material  weakness  as"
"1561","defined above as of July 31, 2014."

"2002","      The Trustees may from time to time issue  and  sell  or cause to be issued"
"2003","and  sold  Shares  for cash or other property. The Shares, including  additional"
"2004","Shares which may have  been  repurchased by the Trust (herein sometimes referred"

"2062","                  to such series or class for such fiscal year; and"

"2065","The decision of the Trustees as to what, in  accordance  with generally accepted"

"2068","expenses and charges of the Trust shall be  charged  against  principal and what"
"2069","against income shall be final, all subject to any applicable provisions  of  the"
"2070","1940  Act.  For the purposes of the limitation imposed by this Section 1, Shares"

"2074","      Inasmuch as the computation of net income and gains for federal income tax"
"2075","purposes  may  vary from the computation thereof on the books of the Trust,  the"
"2076","above provisions shall be interpreted to give to the Trustees the power in their"
"2077","discretion to distribute  for  any  fiscal  year  as  ordinary  dividends and as"
"2078","capital  gains  distributions,  respectively,  additional amounts sufficient  to"
"2079","enable the Trust to avoid or reduce liability for  taxes.  Any  payment  made to"
"2080","Shareholders pursuant to clause (ii) and/or clause (iii) of this Section 1 shall"

"2093","                  elects to receive, in effect at such  time  at  or  after  the"
"2094","                  election  as  the  Trustees  may specify, shall not exceed the"
"2095","                  full  amount  of  cash  to  which that  Shareholder  would  be"
"2096","                  entitled if he elected to receive only cash."
"2097","In the case of a distribution payable in cash or  Shares  at  the  election of a"
"2098","Shareholder,  the  Trustees  may  prescribe  whether  a Shareholder, failing  to"
"2099","express his election before a given time shall be deemed to have elected to take"
"2100","Shares rather than cash, or to take cash rather then Shares,  or  to take Shares"
"2101","with cash adjustment of fractions."
"2102","      The  Trustees,  in  their sole discretion, may cause the Trust to  require"
"2103","that all distributions payable to a shareholder in amounts less than such amount"
"2104","or amounts determined from  time  to  time  by  the  Trustees  be  reinvested in"
"2105","additional  shares  of  the Trust rather than paid in cash, unless a shareholder"
"2106","who, after notification that  his distributions will be reinvested in additional"
"2107","shares  in  accordance  with  the  preceding  phrase,  elects  to  receive  such"
"2108","distributions in cash. Where a shareholder  has elected to receive distributions"
"2109","in cash and the postal or other delivery service  is unable to deliver checks to"
"2110","the shareholder's address of record, the Trustees, in their sole discretion, may"
"2111","cause  the  Trust  to  require that such Shareholder's  distribution  option  be"
