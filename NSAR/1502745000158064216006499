"787","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"788","Shareholders and Board of"
"789","Trustees"
"790","Copeland Trust"
"791","Conshohocken, PA"
"792","In planning and performing"
"793","our audits of the financial"
"794","statements of Copeland Risk"
"795","Managed Dividend Growth"
"796","Fund and Cope International"
"797","Risk Managed Dividend"
"798","Growth Fund, as of and for the"
"799","year ended November 30,"
"800","2015, in accordance with the"
"801","standards of the Public"
"802","Company Accounting"
"803","Oversight Board (United"
"804","States), we considered their"
"805","internal control over financial"
"806","reporting, including control"
"807","activities for safeguarding"
"808","securities, as a basis for"
"809","designing our auditing"
"810","procedures for the purpose of"
"811","expressing our opinion on the"
"812","financial statements and to"
"813","comply with the requirements"
"814","of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"815","the purpose of expressing an"
"816","opinion on the effectiveness of"
"817","the Trust's internal control"
"818","over financial reporting."
"819","Accordingly, we express no"
"820","such opinion."
"821","The management of the Fund"
"822","is responsible for establishing"
"823","and maintaining effective"
"824","internal control over financial"
"825","reporting.   In fulfilling this"
"826","responsibility, estimates and"
"827","judgments by management are"
"828","required to assess the expected"
"829","benefits and related costs of"
"830","controls.   A company's"
"831","internal control over financial"
"832","reporting is a process designed"
"833","to provide reasonable"
"834","assurance regarding the"
"835","reliability of financial"
"836","reporting and the preparation"
"837","of financial statements for"
"838","external purposes in"
"839","accordance generally accepted"
"840","accounting principles.   A"
"841","company's internal control"
"842","over financial reporting"
"843","includes those policies and"
"844","procedures that (1) pertain to"
"845","the maintenance of records"
"846","that, in reasonable detail,"
"847","accurately and fairly reflect"
"848","the transactions and"
"849","dispositions of the assets of"
"850","the company; (2) provide"
"851","reasonable assurance that"
"852","transactions are recorded as"
"853","necessary to permit"
"854","preparation of financial"
"855","statements in accordance with"
"856","generally accepted accounting"
"857","principles, and that receipts"
"858","and expenditures of the"
"859","company are being made only"
"860","in accordance with"
"861","authorizations of management"
"862","and directors of the company;"
"863","and (3) provide reasonable"
"864","assurance regarding"
"865","prevention or timely detection"
"866","of unauthorized acquisition,"
"867","use or disposition of a"
"868","company's assets that could"
"869","have a material effect on the"
"870","financial statements."
"871","Because of inherent"
"872","limitations, internal control"
"873","over financial reporting may"
"874","not prevent or detect"
"875","misstatements.   Also,"
"876","projections of any evaluation"
"877","of effectiveness to future"
"878","periods are subject to the risk"
"879","that controls may become"
"880","inadequate because of changes"
"881","in conditions, or that the"
"882","degree of compliance with the"
"883","policies or procedures may"
"884","deteriorate."
"885","A deficiency in internal"
"886","control over financial"
"887","reporting exists when the"
"888","design or operation of a"
"889","control does not allow"
"890","management or employees, in"
"891","the normal course of"
"892","performing their assigned"
"893","functions, to prevent or detect"
"894","misstatements on a timely"
"895","basis.   A material weakness is"
"896","a deficiency, or combination"
"897","of deficiencies, in internal"
"898","control over financial"
"899","reporting, such that there is a"
"900","reasonable possibility that a"
"901","material misstatement of the"
"902","company's annual or interim"
"903","financial statements will not"
"904","be prevented or detected on a"
"905","timely basis."

"910","Our consideration of the"
"911","Funds' internal control over"
"912","financial reporting was for the"
"913","limited purpose described in"
"914","the first paragraph and would"
"915","not necessarily disclose all"
"916","deficiencies in internal control"
"917","that might be material"
"918","weaknesses under standards"
"919","established by the Public"
"920","Company Accounting"
"921","Oversight Board (United"
"922","States).   However, we noted"
"923","no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"924","internal control over financial"
"925","reporting and its operation,"
"926","including controls for"
"927","safeguarding securities, which"
"928","we consider to be material"
"929","weaknesses, as defined above,"
"930","as of November 30, 2015."
