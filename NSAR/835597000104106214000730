"1433","Asset Allocation Trust, SEI Institutional"
"1434","Investments Trust, Adviser Managed Trust, New"
"1435","Covenant Funds and SEI Insurance Products"
"1436","Trust (each a Trust and, collectively, the"
"1437","Trusts) are valuable assets that are vital to"
"1438","the each Trusts success.  The Trusts senior"
"1439","financial officers (SFOs) are responsible for"
"1440","conducting the Trusts business in a manner"
"1441","that demonstrates a commitment to the highest"
"1442","standards of integrity. The Trusts SFOs"
"1443","include the principal executive officer, the"
"1444","principal financial officer, comptroller or"
"1445","principal accounting officer, and any person"
"1446","who performs a similar function."
"1447","The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act)"
"1448","effected sweeping corporate disclosure and"
"1449","financial reporting reform on public"
"1450","companies, including mutual funds, to address"
"1451","corporate malfeasance and assure investors"
"1452","that the companies in which they invest are"
"1453","accurately and completely disclosing financial"
"1454","information.  Under the Act, all public"
"1455","companies (including the Trusts) must either"
"1456","have a code of ethics for their SFOs, or"
"1457","disclose why they do not.  The Act was"
"1458","intended to foster corporate environments"
"1459","which encourage employees to question and"
"1460","report unethical and potentially illegal"
"1461","business practices.  Each Trust has chosen to"
"1462","adopt this Financial Officer Code of Ethics"
"1463","(the Code) to encourage its SFOs to act in a"
"1464","manner consistent with the highest principles"
"1465","of ethical conduct."
"1466","2.	Purposes of the Code"
"1467","The purposes of this Code are:"
"1468","To promote honest and ethical conduct"
"1469","by each Trusts SFOs, including the"
"1470","ethical handling of actual or"
"1471","apparent conflicts of interest"
"1472","between personal and professional"
"1473","relationships;"
"1474","To assist each Trusts SFOs in"
"1475","recognizing and avoiding conflicts of"
"1476","interest, including disclosing to an"
"1477","appropriate person any material"
"1478","transaction or relationship that"
"1479","reasonably could be expected to give"
"1480","rise to such a conflict;"
"1481","To promote full, fair, accurate,"
"1482","timely, and understandable disclosure"
"1483","in reports and documents that the"
"1484","Trusts file with, or submit to, the"
"1485","SEC and in other public"
"1486","communications made by the Trusts;"
"1487","To promote compliance with applicable"
"1488","laws, rules and regulations;"
"1489","To encourage the prompt internal"
"1490","reporting to an appropriate person of"
"1491","violations of this Code; and"
"1492","To establish accountability for"
"1493","adherence to this Code."
"1494","3.	Questions about this Code"
"1495","Each Trusts compliance officer designated to"
"1496","oversee compliance with the Trusts Code of"
"1497","Ethics adopted pursuant to Rule 17j-1 shall"
"1498","serve as Compliance Officer for the"
"1499","implementation and administration of this"
"1500","Code.  You should direct your questions about"
"1501","this Code to the Compliance Officer."
"1502","4.	Conduct Guidelines"
"1503","Each Trust has adopted the following"
"1504","guidelines under which the Trusts SFOs must"
"1505","perform their official duties and conduct the"
"1506","business affairs of the Trust."
"1507","a)	Ethical and honest conduct is of"
"1508","paramount importance.  Each Trusts SFOs"
"1509","must act with honesty and integrity and"
"1510","avoid violations of this Code, including"
"1511","the avoidance of actual or apparent"
"1512","conflicts of interest with the Trust in"
"1513","personal and professional relationships."
"1514","b)	SFOs must disclose material transactions"
"1515","or relationships. Each Trusts SFOs must"
"1516","disclose to the Compliance Officer any"
"1517","actual or apparent conflicts of interest"
"1518","the SFO may have with the Trust that"
"1519","reasonably could be expected to give"
"1520","rise to any violations of this Code."
"1521","Such conflicts of interest may arise as"
"1522","a result of material transactions or"
"1523","business or personal relationships to"
"1524","which the SFO may be a party.  If it is"
"1525","not possible to disclose the matter to"
"1526","the Compliance Officer, it should be"
"1527","disclosed to the Trusts Chief Financial"
"1528","Officer, Chief Executive Officer or"
"1529","another appropriate person.  In addition"
"1530","to disclosing any actual or apparent"
"1531","conflicts of interest in which an SFO is"
"1532","personally involved, the Trusts SFOs"
"1533","have an obligation to report any other"
"1534","actual or apparent conflicts which they"
"1535","discover or of which they otherwise"
"1536","become aware.  If you are unsure whether"
"1537","a particular fact pattern gives rise to"
"1538","a conflict of interest, or whether a"
"1539","particular transaction or relationship"
"1540","is material, you should bring the matter"
"1541","to the attention of the Compliance"
"1542","Officer."
"1543","c)	Standards for quality of information"
"1544","shared with service providers of the"
"1545","Trusts.  Each Trusts SFOs must at all"
"1546","times seek to provide information to the"
"1547","Trusts service providers (adviser,"
"1548","administrator, outside auditor, outside"
"1549","counsel, custodian, etc.) that is"
"1550","accurate, complete, objective, relevant,"
"1551","timely, and understandable."
"1552","d)	Standards for quality of information"
"1553","included in periodic reports. Each"
"1554","Trusts SFOs must at all times endeavor"
"1555","to ensure full, fair, timely, accurate,"
"1556","and understandable disclosure in the"
"1557","Trusts periodic reports."
"1558","e)	Compliance with laws.  Each Trusts SFOs"
"1559","must comply with the federal securities"
"1560","laws and other laws and rules applicable"
"1561","to the Trusts, such as the Internal"
"1562","Revenue Code."
"1563","f)	Standard of care.  Each Trusts SFOs must"
"1564","at all times act in good faith and with"
"1565","due care, competence and diligence,"
"1566","without misrepresenting material facts"
"1567","or allowing your independent judgment to"
"1568","be subordinated. Each Trusts SFOs must"
"1569","conduct the affairs of the Trust in a"
"1570","responsible manner, consistent with this"
"1571","Code."
"1572","g)	Confidentiality of information. Each"
"1573","Trusts SFOs must respect and protect the"
"1574","confidentiality of information acquired"
"1575","in the course of their professional"
"1576","duties, except when authorized by the"
"1577","Trust to disclose it or where disclosure"
"1578","is otherwise legally mandated.  You may"
"1579","not use confidential information"
"1580","acquired in the course of your work for"
"1581","personal advantage."
"1582","h)	Sharing of information and educational"
"1583","standards.  Each Trusts SFOs should"
"1584","share information with relevant parties"
"1585","to keep them informed of the business"
"1586","affairs of the Trust, as appropriate,"
"1587","and maintain skills important and"
"1588","relevant to the Trusts needs."
"1589","i)	Promote ethical conduct. Each Trusts"
"1590","SFOs should at all times proactively"
"1591","promote ethical behavior among peers in"
"1592","your work environment."
"1593","j)	Standards for recordkeeping.  Each"
"1594","Trusts SFOs must at all times endeavor"
"1595","to ensure that the Trusts financial"
"1596","books and records are thoroughly and"
"1597","accurately maintained to the best of"
"1598","their knowledge in a manner consistent"
"1599","with applicable laws and this Code."
"1600","5.	Waivers of this Code"
"1601","You may request a waiver of a provision of"
"1602","this Code by submitting your request in"
"1603","writing to the Compliance Officer for"
"1604","appropriate review.  For example, if a family"
"1605","member works for a service provider that"
"1606","prepares a Trusts financial statements, you"
"1607","may have a potential conflict of interest in"
"1608","reviewing those statements and should seek a"
"1609","waiver of this Code to review the work.  An"
"1610","executive officer of each Trust, or another"
"1611","appropriate person (such as a designated Board"
"1612","or Audit Committee member), will decide"
"1613","whether to grant a waiver.  All waivers of"
"1614","this code must be disclosed to the applicable"
"1615","Trusts shareholders to the extent required by"
"1616","SEC rules."
"1617","6.	Affirmation of the Code"
"1618","Upon adoption of the Code, each Trusts SFOs"
"1619","must affirm in writing that they have"
"1620","received, read and understand the Code, and"
"1621","annually thereafter must affirm that they have"
"1622","complied with the requirements of the Code. To"
"1623","the extent necessary, each Trusts Compliance"
"1624","Officer will provide guidance on the conduct"
"1625","required by this Code and the manner in which"
"1626","violations or suspected violations must be"
"1627","reported and waivers must be requested."
"1628","7.	Reporting Violations"
"1629","In the event that an SFO discovers or, in good"
"1630","faith, suspects a violation of this Code, the"
"1631","SFO must immediately report the violation or"
"1632","suspected violation to the Compliance Officer."
"1633","The Compliance Officer may, in his discretion,"
"1634","consult with another member of the Trusts"
"1635","senior management or the Board in determining"
"1636","how to address the suspected violation.  For"
"1637","example, a Code violation may occur when a"
"1638","periodic report or financial statement of a"
"1639","Trust omits a material fact, or is technically"
"1640","accurate but, in the view of the SFO, is"
"1641","written in a way that obscures its meaning."
"1642","SFOs who report violations or suspected"
"1643","violations in good faith will not be subject"
"1644","to retaliation of any kind.  Reported"
"1645","violations will be investigated and addressed"
"1646","promptly and will be treated as confidential"
"1647","to the extent possible."
"1648","8.	Violations of the Code"
"1649","Dishonest or unethical conduct or conduct that"
"1650","is illegal will constitute a violation of this"
"1651","Code, regardless of whether this Code"
"1652","specifically refers to such particular"
"1653","conduct.  A violation of this Code may result"
"1654","in disciplinary action, up to and including"
"1655","removal as an SFO of the Trust.  A variety of"
"1656","laws apply to the Trusts and their operations,"
"1657","including the Securities Act of 1933, the"
"1658","Investment Company Act of 1940, state laws"
"1659","relating to duties owed by Trust officers, and"
"1660","criminal laws. The Trusts will report any"
"1661","suspected criminal violations to the"
"1662","appropriate authorities, and will investigate,"
"1663","address and report, as appropriate, non-"
"1664","criminal violations."

"1672","SUB-ITEM 77E(a)"
"1673","A lawsuit entitled Steven Curd and Rebel Curd v. SEI"
"1674","Investments Management Corporation was initially"
"1675","filed against SIMC in the U.S. District Court for"
"1676","the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the Court) on"
"1677","December 11, 2013. On August 28, 2014, the Court"
"1678","granted SIMCs motion to dismiss the initial"
"1679","complaint in the lawsuit, but also granted"
"1680","plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint. On October"
"1681","2, 2014, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. In"
"1682","the amended complaint, SEI"
"1683","Investments Global Funds Services (SGFS) was added"
"1684","as a defendant. The plaintiffs bring the case as a"
"1685","shareholder derivative action against SIMC and SGFS"
"1686","on behalf of certain SEI funds. The claims were"
"1687","based on Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act"
"1688","of 1940, as amended, which allows shareholders of a"
"1689","mutual fund to sue the investment adviser of the"
"1690","fund or its affiliates for an alleged breach of"
"1691","fiduciary duty with respect to compensation received"
"1692","by the adviser or its affiliates. The plaintiffs"
"1693","bring the suit against SIMC and SGFS with respect to"
"1694","five specific SEI Funds: the International Equity"
"1695","Fund, which is a series of the SEI Institutional"
"1696","International Trust, the High Yield Bond, Tax-"
"1697","Managed Large Cap, and Tax-Managed Small/Mid Cap"
"1698","Funds, each of which is a series of the SEI"
"1699","Institutional Managed Trust, and the Intermediate"
"1700","Term Municipal Fund, which is a series of the SEI"
"1701","Tax Exempt Trust. The plaintiffs seek: (1) damages"
"1702","for the"
"1703","funds in the amount of the alleged excessive fees"
"1704","earned by SIMC and SGFS beginning from the one year"
"1705","period prior to the filing of the lawsuit, plus"
"1706","interest, costs, and fees; (2) orders declaring that"
"1707","SIMC and SGFS allegedly violated Section 36(b) and"
"1708","enjoining SIMC and SGFS from further alleged"
"1709","violations; and (3) rescission of SIMCs and SGFSs"
"1710","contracts with the funds, and restitution of all"
"1711","allegedly excessive fees paid beginning from the one"
"1712","year period prior to the filing of the lawsuit, plus"
"1713","interest, costs, and fees. SIMC continues to dispute"
"1714","the claims, and intends to continue to vigorously"
"1715","defend the matter."

"1749","       NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as"
"1750","follows:"
"1751","1.	Duties of the Sub-Adviser.  Subject to"
"1752","supervision by the Adviser and the Trusts"
"1753","Board of Trustees, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"1754","manage all of the securities and other assets"
"1755","of each Fund entrusted to it hereunder (the"
"1756","Assets), including the purchase, retention and"
"1757","disposition of the Assets, in accordance with"

"1762","amended or supplemented from time to time"
"1763","(referred to collectively as the Prospectus),"
"1764","and subject to the following:"
"1765","(a)	The Sub-Adviser shall, in consultation"
"1766","with and subject to the direction of the"
"1767","Adviser, determine from time to time"
"1768","what Assets will be purchased, retained"
"1769","or sold by a Fund, and what portion of"
"1770","the Assets will be invested or held"
"1771","uninvested in cash."
"1772","(b)	In the performance of its duties and"
"1773","obligations under this Agreement, the"
"1774","Sub-Adviser shall act in conformity with"
"1775","the Trusts Declaration of Trust (as"
"1776","defined herein), Prospectus, Compliance"
"1777","Policies and Procedures and with the"
"1778","instructions and directions of the"

"1781","with the requirements of the 1940 Act,"
"1782","the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the"
"1783","Code), and all other applicable federal"
"1784","and state laws and regulations, as each"
"1785","is amended from time to time."
"1786","(c)	  	The Sub-Adviser shall determine"
"1787","the Assets to be purchased or sold by a"
"1788","Fund as"
"1789","provided in subparagraph (a) and will"
"1790","place orders with or through such"
"1791","persons, brokers or dealers to carry out"
"1792","the policy with respect to brokerage set"
"1793","forth in a Funds compliance policy and"
"1794","procedures or as the Board of Trustees"
"1795","or the Adviser may direct from time to"
"1796","time, in conformity with all federal"
"1797","securities laws.  In executing Fund"
"1798","transactions and selecting brokers or"
"1799","dealers, the Sub-Adviser will use its"
"1800","best efforts to seek on behalf of each"
"1801","Fund the best overall terms available."
"1802","In assessing the best overall terms"
"1803","available for any transaction, the Sub-"
"1804","Adviser shall consider all factors that"
"1805","it deems relevant, including the breadth"
"1806","of the market in the security, the price"
"1807","of the security, the financial condition"
"1808","and execution capability of the broker"
"1809","or dealer, and the reasonableness of the"
"1810","commission, if any, both for the"
"1811","specific transaction and on a continuing"
"1812","basis.  In evaluating the best overall"
"1813","terms available, and in selecting the"
"1814","broker-dealer to execute a particular"
"1815","transaction, the Sub-Adviser may also"
"1816","consider the brokerage and research"
"1817","services provided (as those terms are"
"1818","defined in Section 28(e) of the"
"1819","Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the"
"1820","Exchange Act)).  Consistent with any"
"1821","guidelines established by the Board of"
"1822","Trustees of the Trust and Section 28(e)"
"1823","of the Exchange Act, the Sub-Adviser is"
"1824","authorized to pay to a broker or dealer"
"1825","who provides such brokerage and research"
"1826","services a commission for executing a"
"1827","portfolio transaction for a Fund which"
"1828","is in excess of the amount of commission"
"1829","another broker or dealer would have"
"1830","charged for effecting that transaction"
"1831","if, but only if, the Sub-Adviser"
"1832","determines in good faith that such"
"1833","commission was reasonable in relation to"
"1834","the value of the brokerage and research"
"1835","services provided by such broker or"
"1836","dealer -- viewed in terms of that"
"1837","particular transaction or in terms of"
"1838","the overall responsibilities of the Sub-"
"1839","Adviser to its discretionary clients,"
"1840","including a Fund.  In addition, the Sub-"
"1841","Adviser is authorized to allocate"
"1842","purchase and sale orders for securities"
"1843","to brokers or dealers (including brokers"
"1844","and dealers that are affiliated with the"
"1845","Adviser, Sub-Adviser or the Trusts"
"1846","principal underwriter) if the Sub-"
"1847","Adviser believes that the quality of the"
"1848","transaction and the commission are"
"1849","comparable to what they would be with"
"1850","other qualified firms.  In no instance,"
"1851","however, will a Funds Assets be"

"2457","       NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as"
"2458","follows:"
"2459","1.	Duties of the Sub-Adviser.  Subject to"
"2460","supervision by the Adviser and the Trusts"
"2461","Board of Trustees, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"2462","manage all of the securities and other assets"
"2463","of each Fund entrusted to it hereunder (the"
"2464","Assets), including the purchase, retention and"
"2465","disposition of the Assets, in accordance with"

"2470","amended or supplemented from time to time"
"2471","(referred to collectively as the Prospectus),"
"2472","and subject to the following:"
"2473","(a)	The Sub-Adviser shall, in consultation"
"2474","with and subject to the direction of the"
"2475","Adviser, determine from time to time"
"2476","what Assets will be purchased, retained"
"2477","or sold by a Fund, and what portion of"
"2478","the Assets will be invested or held"
"2479","uninvested in cash."
"2480","(b)	In the performance of its duties and"
"2481","obligations under this Agreement, the"
"2482","Sub-Adviser shall act in conformity with"
"2483","the Trusts Declaration of Trust (as"
"2484","defined herein),   Prospectus,"
"2485","Compliance Policies and Procedures and"
"2486","with the instructions and directions of"
"2487","the Adviser and of the Board of Trustees"
"2488","of the Trust and will conform to and"
"2489","comply with the requirements of the 1940"
"2490","Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,"
"2491","as amended (the Code), and all other"

"2495","(c)	  	The Sub-Adviser shall determine"
"2496","the Assets to be purchased, retained or"
"2497","sold by a"
"2498","      Fund as provided in subparagraph (a)"
"2499","and will place orders with or through such"
"2500","persons, brokers or dealers to carry out"
"2501","the policy with respect to brokerage set"
"2502","forth in the Compliance Policies and"
"2503","Procedures  as the Board of Trustees or the"
"2504","Adviser may direct in writing from time to"
"2505","time, in conformity with all federal"
"2506","securities laws.  In executing Fund"
"2507","transactions and selecting brokers or"
"2508","dealers, the Sub-Adviser will use its best"
"2509","efforts to seek on behalf of each Fund the"
"2510","best overall terms available.  In assessing"
"2511","the best overall terms available for any"
"2512","transaction, the Sub-Adviser shall consider"
"2513","all factors that it deems relevant,"
"2514","including the breadth of the market in the"
"2515","security, the price of the security, the"
"2516","financial condition and execution"
"2517","capability of the broker or dealer, and the"
"2518","reasonableness of the commission, if any,"
"2519","both for the specific transaction and on a"
"2520","continuing basis.  In evaluating the best"
"2521","overall terms available, and in selecting"
"2522","the broker-dealer to execute a particular"
"2523","transaction, the Sub-Adviser may also"
"2524","consider the brokerage and research"
"2525","services provided (as those terms are"
"2526","defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"2527","Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the"
"2528","Exchange Act)).  Consistent with any"
"2529","guidelines established by the Board of"
"2530","Trustees of the Trust and Section 28(e) of"
"2531","the Exchange Act, the Sub-Adviser is"
"2532","authorized to pay to a broker or dealer who"
"2533","provides such brokerage and research"
"2534","services a commission for executing a"
"2535","portfolio transaction for a Fund which is"
"2536","in excess of the amount of commission"
"2537","another broker or dealer would have charged"
"2538","for effecting that transaction if, but only"
"2539","if, the Sub-Adviser determines in good"
"2540","faith that such commission was reasonable"
"2541","in relation to the value of the brokerage"
"2542","and research services provided by such"
"2543","broker or dealer -- viewed in terms of that"
"2544","particular transaction or in terms of the"
"2545","overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser"
"2546","to its discretionary clients, including a"
"2547","Fund.  In addition, the Sub-Adviser is"
"2548","authorized to allocate purchase and sale"
"2549","orders for securities to brokers or dealers"
"2550","(including brokers and dealers that are"
"2551","affiliated with the Adviser, Sub-Adviser or"
"2552","the Trusts principal underwriter) if the"
"2553","Sub-Adviser believes that the quality of"
"2554","the transaction and the commission are"
"2555","comparable to what they would be with other"
"2556","qualified firms.  In no instance, however,"
"2557","will a Funds Assets be purchased from or"
"2558","sold to the Adviser, Sub-Adviser, the"
"2559","Trusts principal underwriter, or any"
"2560","affiliated person of any of the Trust,"
"2561","Adviser, the Sub-Adviser or the principal"
"2562","underwriter, acting as principal in the"
"2563","transaction, except to the extent permitted"
"2564","by the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"2565","(SEC) and the 1940 Act."
"2566","(d)	The Sub-Adviser shall maintain all books"
"2567","and records with respect to transactions"
"2568","involving the Assets required by"

"2590","preserve for the periods prescribed by"

"2618","services rendered to the Adviser or the"
"2619","Trust."
"2620","(h)	The Sub-Adviser shall promptly notify"
"2621","the Adviser of any financial condition"
"2622","that is reasonably likely to impair the"
"2623","Sub-Advisers ability to fulfill its"

"2677","(k)	On occasions when the Sub-Adviser deems"

"3186","supervision by the Adviser and the Trusts"
"3187","Board of Trustees, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"3188","manage all of the securities and other assets"

"3196","amended or supplemented from time to time"
"3197","(referred to collectively as the Prospectus),"
"3198","and subject to the following:"
"3199","(a)	The Sub-Adviser shall, in consultation"
"3200","with and subject to the direction of the"
"3201","Adviser, determine from time to time"
"3202","what Assets will be purchased, retained"
"3203","or sold by a Fund, and what portion of"
"3204","the Assets will be invested or held"
"3205","uninvested in cash."
"3206","(b)	In the performance of its duties and"

"3209","the Trusts Declaration of Trust (as"
"3210","defined herein), Prospectus, Compliance"
"3211","Policies and Procedures and with the"
"3212","instructions and directions of the"
"3213","Adviser and of the Board of Trustees of"

"3221","the Assets to be purchased or sold by a"
"3222","Fund as"
"3223","provided in subparagraph (a) and will"
"3224","place orders with or through such"
"3225","persons, brokers or dealers to carry out"
"3226","the policy with respect to brokerage set"
"3227","forth in a Funds Prospectus or as the"
"3228","Board of Trustees or the Adviser may"
"3229","direct from time to time, in conformity"
"3230","with all federal securities laws.  In"
"3231","executing Fund transactions and"
"3232","selecting brokers or dealers, the Sub-"
"3233","Adviser will use its best efforts to"
"3234","seek on behalf of each Fund the best"
"3235","overall terms available.  In assessing"
"3236","the best overall terms available for any"
"3237","transaction, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"3238","consider all factors that it deems"
"3239","relevant, including the breadth of the"
"3240","market in the security, the price of the"
"3241","security, the financial condition and"
"3242","execution capability of the broker or"
"3243","dealer, and the reasonableness of the"
"3244","commission, if any, both for the"
"3245","specific transaction and on a continuing"
"3246","basis.  In evaluating the best overall"
"3247","terms available, and in selecting the"
"3248","broker-dealer to execute a particular"
"3249","transaction, the Sub-Adviser may also"
"3250","consider the brokerage and research"
"3251","services provided (as those terms are"
"3252","defined in Section 28(e) of the"
"3253","Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the"
"3254","Exchange Act)).  Consistent with any"
"3255","guidelines established by the Board of"
"3256","Trustees of the Trust and Section 28(e)"
"3257","of the Exchange Act, the Sub-Adviser is"
"3258","authorized to pay to a broker or dealer"
"3259","who provides such brokerage and research"
"3260","services a commission for executing a"
"3261","portfolio transaction for a Fund which"
"3262","is in excess of the amount of commission"
"3263","another broker or dealer would have"
"3264","charged for effecting that transaction"
"3265","if, but only if, the Sub-Adviser"
"3266","determines in good faith that such"
"3267","commission was reasonable in relation to"
"3268","the value of the brokerage and research"
"3269","services provided by such broker or"
"3270","dealer -- viewed in terms of that"
"3271","particular transaction or in terms of"
"3272","the overall responsibilities of the Sub-"
"3273","Adviser to its discretionary clients,"
"3274","including a Fund.  In addition, the Sub-"
"3275","Adviser is authorized to allocate"
"3276","purchase and sale orders for securities"
"3277","to brokers or dealers (including brokers"
"3278","and dealers that are affiliated with the"
"3279","Adviser, Sub-Adviser or the Trusts"
"3280","principal underwriter) if the Sub-"
"3281","Adviser believes that the quality of the"
"3282","transaction and the commission are"
"3283","comparable to what they would be with"
"3284","other qualified firms.  In no instance,"
"3285","however, will a Funds Assets be"
"3286","purchased from or sold to the Adviser,"
"3287","Sub-Adviser, the Trusts principal"
"3288","underwriter, or any affiliated person of"
"3289","either the Trust, Adviser, the Sub-"
"3290","Adviser or the principal underwriter,"
"3291","acting as principal in the transaction,"
"3292","except to the extent permitted by the"
"3293","Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)"
"3294","and the 1940 Act."
"3295","(d)	The Sub-Adviser shall maintain all books"
"3296","and records with respect to transactions"
"3297","involving the Assets required by"

"3859","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"3860","Firm"
"3861","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"3862","SEI Institutional International Trust:"
"3863","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"3864","financial statements of SEI Institutional"
"3865","International Trust, comprised of the International"
"3866","Equity Fund, Emerging Markets Equity Fund,"
"3867","International Fixed Income Fund and Emerging Markets"
"3868","Debt Fund  (collectively, the Funds), as of and for"
"3869","the year ended September 30, 2014, in accordance"
"3870","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"3871","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"3872","Funds internal control over financial reporting,"
"3873","including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"3874","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"3875","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"3876","financial statements and to comply with the"
"3877","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"3878","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"3879","Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"3880","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3881","Management of the Funds is responsible for"
"3882","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"3883","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"3884","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"3885","management are required to assess the expected"
"3886","benefits and related costs of controls. A companys"
"3887","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"3888","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"3889","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"3890","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"3891","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"3892","accounting principles. A companys internal control"
"3893","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"3894","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"3895","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"3896","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"3897","the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"3898","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"3899","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"3900","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"3901","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"3902","expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"3903","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"3904","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"3905","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"3906","of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of"
"3907","the companys assets that could have a material"
"3908","effect on the financial statements."
"3909","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"3910","control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"3911","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"3912","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"3913","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3914","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"3915","the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"3916","procedures may deteriorate."
"3917","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"3918","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"3919","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"3920","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"3921","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"3922","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"3923","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"3924","control over financial reporting, such that there is"
"3925","a reasonable possibility that a material"
"3926","misstatement of the Funds annual or interim"
"3927","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"3928","detected on a timely basis."
"3929","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"3930","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"3931","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3932","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"3933","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"3934","standards established by the Public Company"
"3935","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However,"
"3936","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal"
"3937","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"3938","including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"3939","that we consider to be a material weakness as"
"3940","defined above as of September 30, 2014."
"3941","This report is intended solely for the information"
"3942","and use of management and the Board"
"3943","of Trustees of SEI Institutional International Trust"
"3944","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"3945","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
"3946","other than these specified parties."
