"4826","from time to time, all in such manner and to such extent as may"
"4827","from time to time be authorized by the Trust's Board of Trustees"
"4828","(the Board). The Board is authorized to issue any unissued"
"4829","shares in any number of additional classes or series."
"4830","The investment authority granted to the Manager shall"
"4831","include the authority to exercise whatever powers the Trust may"
"4832","possess with respect to any of its assets held by the Funds,"

"4837","The Trust hereby appoints the Manager, subject to the"

"4856","in various securities or other assets, in investment styles and, if"

"4999","nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to"
"5000","require Funds Management to provide any services"

"5003","In performing all Fund-level administrative services under"
"5004","this Section 2(b), the Manager shall: (a) act in conformity with the"
"5005","Trust's Declaration of Trust (and By-Laws, if any), the 1940 Act,"

"5015","Manager may, at its own expense, enter into sub-administration"
"5016","agreements with other service providers, provided that each such"

"5018","Agreement and all relevant provisions of the 1940 Act and any"
"5019","other applicable laws as may be amended from time to time, and"
"5020","all relevant rules thereunder. Manager will provide the Trust with"
"5021","a copy of each sub-administration agreement it executes relating to"
"5022","the Trust. Manager will be liable for acts or omissions of any such"
"5023","sub-administrators under the standards of care described herein"
"5024","under Section 11."
"5025","Section 3. Delivery of Documents to the Manager. The"
"5026","Trust has furnished the Manager with true, correct and complete"
"5027","copies of the following documents:"
"5028","(a) The Declaration of Trust, as in effect on the date hereof;"
"5029","(b) The Registration Statement filed with the Commission"
"5030","under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act; and"
"5031","(c) Written guidelines, policies and procedures adopted by the"
"5032","Trust."
"5033","The Trust will furnish the Manager with all future"

"5035","practicable after such documents become available. The Trust"
"5036","shall furnish the Manager with any further documents, materials or"
"5037","information that the Manager may reasonably request in"
"5038","connection with the performance of its duties hereunder."
"5039","Section 4. Delegation of Responsibilities. The Manager"
"5040","may carry out any of its obligations under this Agreement (other"
"5041","than under Section 2(b) hereof) by employing, subject to"
"5042","supervision by the Manager, one or more Sub-Manager(s) who are"
"5043","registered as investment advisers pursuant to the Investment"
"5044","Advisers Act of 1940 (Sub-Advisers). Each Sub-Adviser's"
"5045","employment will be evidenced by a separate written agreement"
"5046","approved by the Board and, if required under the 1940 Act, by the"
"5047","shareholders of the Fund (unless the Commission or its staff has"
"5048","given authorization or issued an interpretation dispensing with the"
"5049","requirement of shareholder approval). The Manager shall not be"
"5050","liable hereunder for any act or omission of any Sub-Adviser,"
"5051","except for failure to exercise good faith in the employment of the"
"5052","Sub-Adviser and for failure to exercise appropriate supervision of"
"5053","such Sub-Adviser, and as may otherwise be agreed in writing. The"
"5054","Manager shall be solely responsible for compensating any Sub-"
"5055","Adviser for services rendered under any Sub-Advisory Agreement."
"5056","The Manager may, from time to time and at any time, terminate"
"5057","any Sub-Adviser and reassume the responsibilities assigned to such"
"5058","Sub-Adviser with respect to any Fund without obtaining the"
"5059","approval of the shareholders of the Fund."
"5060","Section 5. Control by Board. Any investment"
"5061","management activities undertaken by the Manager pursuant to this"
"5062","Agreement, as well as any other activities undertaken by the"
"5063","Manager on behalf of the Funds, shall at all times be subject to the"
"5064","direction and control of the Board."
"5065","Section 6. Compliance with Applicable Requirements."
"5066","In carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, the Manager"
"5067","shall at all times comply with:"
"5068","(a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"5069","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"5070","(b) the Registration Statement of the Trust, as it may be"
"5071","amended from time to time, filed with the Commission"
"5072","under the Securities Act and the 1940 Act;"
"5073","(c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it"
"5074","may be amended from time to time;"
"5075","(d) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"
"5076","amended, applicable to the Trust or the Funds, and any"
"5077","rules and regulations adopted thereunder; and"
"5078","(e) any other applicable provisions of state or federal law, and"
"5079","any rules and regulations adopted thereunder."
"5080","Section 7. Proxies. The Manager shall have responsibility"
"5081","to vote proxies solicited with respect to issuers of securities in"
"5082","which assets of the Funds are invested in accordance with the"
"5083","Trust's policies on proxy voting."
"5084","Section 8. Broker-Dealer Relationships. In connection"
"5085","with the purchase and sale of securities for the Funds, the Manager"
"5086","is responsible for broker-dealer selection and negotiation of"
"5087","brokerage commission rates. The Manager's primary"
"5088","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain"
"5089","the best price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to"
"5090","execute each particular transaction for a Fund, the Manager will"
"5091","consider among other things: the best net price available, the"
"5092","reliability, integrity and financial condition of the broker-dealer;"
"5093","the size of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value of"
"5094","the expected contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a"
"5095","continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any"
"5096","transaction may be less favorable than that available from another"
"5097","broker-dealer if the difference is reasonably justified by other"
"5098","aspects of the portfolio execution services offered. Subject to such"
"5099","policies as the Board may from time to time determine, the"
"5100","Manager shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have"
"5101","breached any duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely"
"5102","by reason of having caused a Fund to pay a broker or dealer that"
"5103","provides brokerage and research services to the Manager an"
"5104","amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"5105","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker"
"5106","or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if the"
"5107","Manager determines in good faith that such amount of commission"
"5108","was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"5109","research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in"
"5110","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"5111","responsibilities of the Manager with respect to the Fund and to"
"5112","other clients of the Manager. The Manager is further authorized to"
"5113","allocate the orders placed by it on behalf of the Funds to brokers"
"5114","and dealers who also provide brokerage and research services"
"5115","within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange"
"5116","Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith. Such allocation shall be"
"5117","in such amounts and proportions as the Manager shall determine"
"5118","and the Manager will report on said allocations regularly to the"
"5119","Board, indicating the brokers to whom such allocations have been"
"5120","made and the basis therefore."
"5121","Section 9. Expenses. All of the ordinary business"
"5122","expenses incurred in the operations of the Funds and the offering"
"5123","of their shares shall be borne by the Funds unless specifically"
"5124","provided otherwise in this Agreement. The expenses borne by the"
"5125","Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage commissions, taxes,"
"5126","legal, auditing or governmental fees, the cost of preparing share"
"5127","certificates, custodian, transfer agent and shareholder service agent"
"5128","costs, expense of issue, sale, redemption and repurchase of shares,"
"5129","expenses of registering and qualifying shares for sale, expenses"
"5130","relating to trustees and shareholder meetings, the cost of preparing"
"5131","and distributing reports and notices to shareholders, the fees and"
"5132","other expenses incurred by the Funds in connection with"
"5133","membership in investment company organizations and the cost of"
"5134","printing copies of prospectuses and statements of additional"
"5135","information distributed to the Funds' shareholders. In addition to"
"5136","the fees described in Section 10 of this Agreement, the Trust (or its"
"5137","other service providers, as may be provided pursuant to their"
"5138","respective agreements and contracts with the Trust) shall pay all of"
"5139","its Fund-level expenses which are not expressly assumed by the"
"5140","Manager pursuant to Section 2(b) or otherwise hereunder. The"
"5141","Fund-level expenses of legal counsel and accounting experts"
"5142","retained by the Manager, after consulting with the Trust's legal"
"5143","counsel and independent auditors, as may be reasonably necessary"
"5144","or appropriate for the performance by the Manager of its duties"
"5145","under this Agreement, shall be deemed to be Fund-level expenses"
"5146","of, and shall be paid for by, the Trust."
"5147","The Manager shall pay its own expenses in connection with"
"5148","the services to be provided by it pursuant to this Agreement and"
"5149","shall, at its own expense, provide its own office space, facilities"
"5150","and equipment. In addition, the Manager shall be responsible for"
"5151","reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Trust:"
"5152","(a) to amend the Trust's registration statement or supplement the"
"5153","Fund's prospectus, and circulate the same, to reflect a change in"
"5154","the personnel of the Manager responsible for making investment"
"5155","decisions in relation to a Fund; (b) to obtain shareholder approval"
"5156","of a new sub-advisory agreement as a result of a change in
control (as such term in defined in Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940"
"5157","Act) of the Manager, or to otherwise comply with the 1940 Act,"
"5158","the Securities Act, or any other applicable statute, law, rule or"
"5159","regulation, as a result of such change; or (c) to meet other legal or"
"5160","regulatory obligations caused by actions of the Manager."
"5161","Section 10. Compensation."
"5162","(a) As compensation for the investment management services"
"5163","provided under this Agreement, the Trust shall pay the"
"5164","Manager fees, payable monthly, at the annual rates"
"5165","indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such Schedule may be"
"5166","amended or supplemented from time to time. The fees"
"5167","payable pursuant to this Paragraph shall be calculated based"
"5168","on the average daily value (as determined on each business"
"5169","day at the time set forth in the Prospectus for determining"
"5170","net asset value per share) of each Fund's net assets, as"
"5171","appropriate, during the preceding month. If the fee payable"
"5172","to the Manager pursuant to this Paragraph begins to accrue"
"5173","before the end of any month or if this Agreement"
"5174","terminates before the end of any month, the fee for the"
"5175","period from the effective date to the end of that month or"
"5176","from the beginning of that month to the termination date,"
"5177","respectively, shall be prorated according to the proportion"
"5178","that the period bears to the full month in which the"
"5179","effectiveness or termination occurs. For purposes of"
"5180","calculating each such monthly fee, the value of each Fund's"
"5181","net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in that"
"5182","Fund's registration statement as then on file with the SEC"
"5183","for the computation of the value of the Fund's net assets in"
"5184","connection with the determination of the net asset value of"
"5185","Fund shares. For purposes of this Agreement, a business
day for a Fund is any day that the Fund is open for"
"5186","trading;"
"5187","(b) No fee, other than the management fee payable monthly, at"
"5188","the annual rates indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such"

"6219","with such persons as the Sub-Adviser believes to be appropriate or"
"6220","necessary to assist in the execution of the Sub-Adviser's duties hereunder,"

"6231","national, state, or local government entity with jurisdiction over the Trust,"
"6232","including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal"
"6233","Revenue Service. The books and records pertaining to the Trust which are"
"6234","in possession of the Sub-Adviser shall be the property of the Trust. The"
"6235","Trust, or the Trust's authorized representatives (including the Adviser), shall"
"6236","have access to such books and records at all times during the Sub-Adviser's"
"6237","normal business hours. Upon the reasonable request of the Trust, copies of"
"6238","any such books and records shall be provided promptly by the Sub-Adviser"
"6239","to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives."
"6240","Section 4. Control by Board. As is the case with respect to the"
"6241","Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, any investment"
"6242","activities undertaken by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, as"
"6243","well as any other activities undertaken by the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the"
"6244","Funds, shall at all times be subject to the direction and control the Trust's"
"6245","Board."
"6246","Section 5. Compliance with Applicable Requirements. In"
"6247","carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall at"
"6248","all times comply with:"
"6249","(a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"6250","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"6251","(b) the provisions of the registration statement of the Trust, as"
"6252","it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, under the"
"6253","Securities Act and the 1940 Act;"
"6254","(c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it"
"6255","may be amended or supplemented from time to time;"
"6256","(d) the provisions of any By-laws of the Trust, if adopted and"
"6257","as it may be amended from time to time, or resolutions of the Board as"
"6258","may be adopted from time to time;"
"6259","(e) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"
"6260","amended, applicable to the Trust or the Funds;"
"6261","(f) any other applicable provisions of state or federal law; and"
"6262","In addition, any code of ethics adopted by the Sub-Adviser must"
"6263","comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act, as it may be amended from"
"6264","time to time, and any broadly accepted industry practices, if requested by"
"6265","the Trust or the Adviser."
"6266","Section 6. Broker-Dealer Relationships. The Sub-Adviser is"
"6267","responsible for the purchase and sale of securities for the Funds, brokerdealer"
"6268","selection, and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Sub-"
"6269","Adviser's primary consideration in effecting a security transaction will be"
"6270","to obtain the best price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to"
"6271","execute each particular transaction for a Fund, the Sub-Adviser will take"
"6272","the following into consideration: the best net price available, the"
"6273","reliability, integrity and financial condition of the broker-dealer; the size"
"6274","of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value of the expected"
"6275","contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing basis."
"6276","Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any transaction may be less"
"6277","favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the difference is"
"6278","reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio execution services"
"6279","offered. Subject to such policies as the Trust's Board of Trustees may"
"6280","from time to time determine, the Sub-Adviser shall not be deemed to have"
"6281","acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this Agreement"
"6282","or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a Fund to pay a broker or"
"6283","dealer that provides brokerage and research services to the Sub-Adviser an"
"6284","amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in"
"6285","excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have"
"6286","charged for effecting that transaction, if the Sub-Adviser determines in"
"6287","good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to"
"6288","the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker"
"6289","or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the"
"6290","overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund and to"
"6291","other clients of the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser is further authorized to"
"6292","allocate the orders placed by it on behalf of the Funds to brokers and"
"6293","dealers who also provide research or statistical material, or other services"
"6294","to the Funds or to the Sub-Adviser. Such allocation shall be in such"
"6295","amounts and proportions as the Sub-Adviser shall determine and the Sub-"
"6296","Adviser will report on said allocations regularly to the Board of Trustees"
"6297","of the Trust indicating the brokers to whom such allocations have been"
"6298","made and the basis therefor."
"6299","Section 7. Expenses of the Fund. All of the ordinary business"
"6300","expenses incurred in the operations of the Funds and the offering of their"
"6301","shares shall be borne by the Funds unless specifically provided otherwise"
"6302","in this Agreement. These expenses borne by the Trust include, but are not"
"6303","limited to, brokerage commissions, taxes, legal, auditing or governmental"
"6304","fees, the cost of preparing share certificates, custodian, transfer agent and"
"6305","shareholder service agent costs, expense of issue, sale, redemption and"
"6306","repurchase of shares, expenses of registering and qualifying shares for"
"6307","sale, expenses relating to trustees and shareholder meetings, the cost of"
"6308","preparing and distributing reports and notices to shareholders, the fees and"
"6309","other expenses incurred by the Funds in connection with membership in"
"6310","investment company organizations and the cost of printing copies of"
"6311","prospectuses and statements of additional information distributed to the"
"6312","Funds' shareholders."
"6313","Section 8. Compensation. As compensation for the sub-advisory"
"6314","services provided under this Agreement, the Adviser shall pay the Sub-"
"6315","Adviser fees, payable monthly, the annual rates indicated on Schedule A"
"6316","hereto, as such Schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to"
"6317","time. It is understood that the Adviser shall be responsible for the Sub-"
"6318","Adviser's fee for its services hereunder, and the Sub-Adviser agrees that it"
"6319","shall have no claim against the Trust or the Funds with respect to"
"6320","compensation under this Agreement."
"6321","Section 9. Standard of Care. The Trust and Adviser shall expect of"
"6322","the Sub-Adviser, and the Sub-Adviser will give the Trust and the Adviser"
"6323","the benefit of, the Sub-Adviser's best judgment and efforts in rendering its"
"6324","services to the Trust, and as an inducement to the Sub-Adviser's"
"6325","undertaking these services at the compensation level specified, the Sub-"
"6326","Adviser shall not be liable hereunder for any mistake in judgment. In the"
"6327","absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, negligence or reckless disregard"
"6328","of obligations or duties hereunder on the part of the Sub-Adviser or any of"
"6329","its officers, directors, employees or agents, the Sub-Adviser shall not be"
"6330","subject to liability to the Trust or to any shareholders in the Trust for any"
"6331","act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering services"
"6332","hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding"
"6333","or sale of any security."
"6334","Section 10. Non-Exclusivity. The services of the Sub-Adviser to"
"6335","the Adviser and the Trust are not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the"
"6336","Sub-Adviser shall be free to render investment advisory and"
"6337","administrative or other services to others (including other investment"
"6338","companies) and to engage in other activities. It is understood and agreed"
"6339","that officers or directors of the Sub-Adviser are not prohibited from"
"6340","engaging in any other business activity or from rendering services to any"
"6341","other person, or from serving as partners, officers, directors or trustees of"
"6342","any other firm or trust, including other investment advisory companies."
"6343","Section 11. Records. The Sub-Adviser shall, with respect to orders"
"6344","the Sub-Adviser places for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities of"
"6345","the Funds, maintain or arrange for the maintenance of the documents and"
"6346","records required pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act as well as"
"6347","trade tickets and confirmations of portfolio trades and such other records"
"6348","as the Adviser or the Funds' Administrator reasonably requests to be"
"6349","maintained. All such records shall be maintained in a form acceptable to"
"6350","the Funds and in compliance with the provisions of Rule 31a-1 or any"
"6351","successor rule. All such records will be the property of the Funds, and"
"6352","will be available for inspection and use by the Funds and their authorized"
"6353","representatives (including the Adviser). The Sub-Adviser shall promptly,"
"6354","upon the Trust's request, surrender to the Funds those records which are"
"6355","the property of the Trust or any Fund. The Sub-Adviser will promptly"
"6356","notify the Funds' Administrator if it experiences any difficulty in"
"6357","maintaining the records in an accurate and complete manner."
"6358","Section 12. Term and Approval. This Agreement shall become"
"6359","effective with respect to a Fund after it is approved in accordance with the"
"6360","express requirements of the 1940 Act, and executed by the Trust, Adviser"
"6361","and Sub-Adviser and shall thereafter continue from year to year, provided"
"6362","that the continuation of the Agreement is approved in accordance with the"
"6363","requirements of the 1940 Act, which currently requires that the"

"6369","in the 1940 Act) of a party to this Agreement (other than as Trustees of the"
"6370","Trust), by votes cast in person at a meeting specifically called for such"
"6371","purpose."

"6376","Adviser or Sub-Adviser, on sixty (60) days written notice to the other"
"6377","party. The notice provided for herein may be waived by the party entitled"
"6378","to receipt thereof. This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the"

"6439","orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against"
"6440","which enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is"

"6457","investment company not advised by the Adviser or one of its affiliates;"

"6459","acting as investment adviser to any Fund or class of a Fund, the Trust"
"6460","shall, upon request by the Adviser, promptly take such action as may be"

"7441","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Wells Fargo Funds Trust:"

"7454","Wells Fargo Dynamic Target 2060 Fund (collectively the 'Funds'),"
"7455","twenty-two of the funds comprising the Wells Fargo Funds Trust, as of"
"7456","and for the year ended May 31, 2018, in accordance with the standards"
"7457","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"7458","considered the Funds internal control over financial reporting,"
"7459","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"7460","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"7461","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"7462","requirements of Form N-SAR, but  not for the purpose of expressing an"
"7463","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"7464","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"7465","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"7466","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"7467","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"7468","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"7469","controls. A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"7470","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"7471","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"7472","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"7473","accounting principles (GAAP). A fund's internal control over financial"
"7474","reporting includes  those  policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"7475","the  maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"7476","fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions of the assets of the"
"7477","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"7478","as necessary to permit preparation of  financial statements  in"
"7479","accordance  with GAAP and that receipts  and expenditures of  the fund"
"7480","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"7481","and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"7482","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"7483","use, or disposition of the fund's assets that could have a material"
"7484","effect on the financial statements."
"7485","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"7486","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"7487","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"7488","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"7489","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"7490","procedures may deteriorate."
"7491","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"7492","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"7493","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"7494","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"7495","weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or  a  combination  of  deficiencies,"
"7496","in internal control over financial  reporting,  such  that there is"
"7497","a reasonable  possibility that a  material misstatement of the Funds"
"7498","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"7499","detected  on a timely basis."
"7500","Our consideration of  the  Funds  internal  control  over  financial"
"7501","reporting  was  for  the  limited  purpose  described in the  first"
"7502","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"7503","internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"7504","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"7505","States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal"
"7506","control over financial reporting and their operations, including"
"7507","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"7508","material weakness as defined above as of May 31, 2018."
