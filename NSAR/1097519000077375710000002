"4212","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"

"4214","Columbia Connecticut Municipal Reserves, Columbia Government"
"4215","Plus Reserves, Columbia Government Reserves, Columbia"

"4219","Reserves and Columbia Cash Reserves (each a series of Columbia"
"4220","Funds Series Trust and hereafter collectively referred to as"
"4221","the Funds) as of and for the year ended August 31, 2008, in"
"4222","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"4223","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"4224","internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"4225","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"4226","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"4227","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"4228","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"4229","on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"4230","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"4231","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"4232","reporting."
"4233","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"4234","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"4235","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"4236","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"4237","controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"4238","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"4239","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"4240","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"4241","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"4242","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"4243","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"4244","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"4245","the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"4246","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"4247","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"4248","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance"
"4249","with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3)"
"4250","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"4251","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that"
"4252","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"4253","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"4254","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"4255","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"4256","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"4257","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"4258","procedures may deteriorate."
"4259","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"4260","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"4261","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"4262","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"4263","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"4264","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"4265","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds' annual or"
"4266","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"4267","timely basis."
"4268","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"4269","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"4270","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"4271","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"4272","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"4273","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"4274","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"4275","controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material"
"4276","weaknesses as defined above as of August 31, 2008."

"4284","Item 77E Legal Proceedings:"
"4285","Columbia Nations Funds"
"4286","As of October 16, 2008"
"4287","On February 9, 2005, Banc of America Capital Management, LLC"
"4288","(BACAP, now known as Columbia Management Advisors, LLC) and"
"4289","BACAP Distributors, LLC (BACAP Distributors, now known as"
"4290","Columbia Management Distributors, Inc.) entered into an"
"4291","Assurance of Discontinuance with the New York Attorney General"
"4292","(the NYAG Settlement) and consented to the entry of a cease-"
"4293","and-desist order by the United States Securities and Exchange"
"4294","Commission (the SEC) (the SEC Order) on matters relating to"
"4295","mutual fund trading. A copy of the NYAG Settlement is available"
"4296","as part of the Bank of America Corporation Form 8-K filing on"
"4297","February 10, 2005 and a copy of the SEC Order is available on"
"4298","the SEC's website."
"4299","Under the terms of the SEC Order, BACAP, BACAP Distributors, and"
"4300","their affiliate, Banc of America Securities, LLC (BAS) agreed,"
"4301","among other things, (1) to pay $250 million in disgorgement and"
"4302","$125 million in civil money penalties; (2) to cease and desist"
"4303","from violations of the antifraud provisions and certain other"
"4304","provisions of the federal securities laws; (3) to undertake various"
"4305","remedial measures to ensure compliance with the federal securities"
"4306","laws related to certain mutual fund trading practices; and (4) to"
"4307","retain an independent consultant to review their applicable"
"4308","supervisory, compliance, control and other policies and procedures."
"4309","The NYAG Settlement also requires, among other things, BACAP and"
"4310","BACAP Distributors, along with Columbia Management Advisors, Inc."
"4311","(now merged into Columbia Management Advisors, LLC) and Columbia"
"4312","Funds Distributors, Inc. (now merged into Columbia Management"
"4313","Distributors, Inc.), the investment advisor to and distributor of"
"4314","the funds then known as the Columbia Funds, respectively, to reduce"
"4315","the management fees of Columbia Funds, including the Nations Funds"
"4316","that are now known as Columbia Funds, and other mutual funds,"
"4317","collectively by $32 million per year for five years, for a projected"
"4318","total of $160 million in management fee reductions. Consistent with"
"4319","the terms of the settlements, the Boards of the Nations Funds now"
"4320","known as Columbia Funds have an independent Chairman, are comprised"
"4321","of at least 75% independent trustees and have engaged an independent"
"4322","consultant with a wide range of compliance and oversight"
"4323","responsibilities."
"4324","Pursuant to the procedures set forth in the SEC Order, the $375 million"
"4325","in settlement amounts described above, of which approximately $90"
"4326","million has been earmarked for seventeen of the Nations Funds that are"
"4327","now known as Columbia Funds and their shareholders, is being distributed"
"4328","in accordance with a distribution plan developed by an independent"
"4329","distribution consultant and approved by the SEC on December 27, 2007."
"4330","Distributions under the distribution plan began in mid-June 2008."
"4331","Civil Litigation"
"4332","In connection with the events that resulted in the NYAG Settlement and"
"4333","SEC Order, various parties filed suits against Bank of America"
"4334","Corporation and certain of its affiliates, including BACAP and BACAP"
"4335","Distributors (collectively BAC), Nations Funds Trust (now known as"
"4336","Columbia Funds Series Trust) and its Board of Trustees. On February 20,"
"4337","2004, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred these"
"4338","cases and cases against other mutual fund companies based on similar"
"4339","allegations to the United States District Court in Maryland for"
"4340","consolidated or coordinated pretrial proceedings (the MDL)."
"4341","Subsequently, additional related cases were transferred to the MDL. On"
"4342","September 29, 2004, the plaintiffs in the MDL filed amended and"
"4343","consolidated complaints. One of these amended complaints is a putative"
"4344","class action that includes claims under the federal securities laws and"
"4345","state common law, and that names Nations Funds Trust, the Trustees, BAC"
"4346","and others as defendants. Another of the amended complaints is a"
"4347","derivative action purportedly on behalf of the Nations Funds Trust"
"4348","against BAC and others that asserts claims under federal securities laws"
"4349","and state common law. Nations Funds Trust is a nominal defendant in this"
"4350","action."
"4351","On February 25, 2005, BAC and other defendants filed motions to dismiss"
"4352","the claims in the pending cases. On December 15, 2005, BAC and others"
"4353","entered into a Stipulation of Settlement of the direct and derivative"
"4354","claims brought on behalf of the Nations Funds shareholders. The"
"4355","settlement is subject to court approval. If the settlement is approved,"
"4356","BAC would pay settlement administration costs and fees to plaintiffs'"
"4357","counsel as approved by the court. The stipulation has not yet been"
"4358","presented to the court for approval."
"4359","Separately, a putative class action - Mehta v AIG SunAmerica Life"
"4360","Assurance Company - involving the pricing of mutual funds was filed in"
"4361","Illinois State Court, subsequently removed to federal court and then"
"4362","transferred to the United States District Court for the District of"
"4363","Maryland for coordinated or consolidated handling in the MDL. AIG"
"4364","SunAmerica Life Assurance Company has made demand upon Nations Separate"
"4365","Account Trust (as successor to Nations Annuity Trust and now known as"
"4366","Columbia Funds Variable Insurance Trust I) and BACAP (as successor to"
"4367","Banc of America Advisors, Inc. and now known as Columbia Management"
"4368","Advisors, LLC) for indemnification pursuant to the terms of a Fund"
"4369","Participation Agreement.  On June 1, 2006, the court granted a motion"
"4370","to dismiss this case because it was preempted by the Securities"
"4371","Litigation Uniform Standards Act.  That dismissal has been appealed to"
"4372","the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit."
