"1562","                          INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT"
"1563","     This AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT is made as of this 6th day of August"
"1564","2003, and amended as of October 1, 2005 and March 27, 2009, between Wells Fargo"
"1565","Funds Trust (the Trust), a statutory trust organized under the laws of the"

"1571","     WHEREAS, the Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,"

"1573","authorized to issue interests (as defined in the Trust's Declaration of Trust,"
"1574","as amended and supplemented from time to time), in separate series; and"
"1575","     WHEREAS, the Trust desires that the Adviser provide investment advisory"
"1576","services to each series of the Trust listed on Schedule A hereto as such"
"1577","Schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to time by mutual agreement"
"1578","(each a Fund and collectively the Funds), and the Adviser is willing to"
"1579","provide those services on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;"
"1580","     NOW THEREFORE, the Trust and the Adviser agree as follows:"
"1581","     SECTION 1. APPOINTMENT OF THE ADVISER. The Trust is engaged in the business"
"1582","of investing and reinvesting its assets in securities of the type and in"
"1583","accordance with the limitations specified in its Declaration of Trust, as"
"1584","amended and supplemented from time to time, By-Laws (if any) and Registration"
"1585","Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission)"
"1586","under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act),"
"1587","including any representations made in the prospectus and statement of additional"
"1588","information relating to the Funds contained therein and as may be amended or"
"1589","supplemented from time to time, all in such manner and to such extent as may"
"1590","from time to time be authorized by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the Board)."
"1591","The Board is authorized to issue any unissued shares in any number of additional"
"1592","classes or series."
"1593","     The investment authority granted to the Adviser shall include the authority"
"1594","to exercise whatever powers the Trust may possess with respect to any of its"
"1595","assets held by the Funds, including, but not limited to, the power to exercise"
"1596","rights, options, warrants, conversion privileges, redemption privileges, and to"
"1597","tender securities pursuant to a tender offer, and participate in class actions"
"1598","and other legal proceedings on behalf of the Funds."
"1599","     The Trust hereby employs Adviser, subject to the direction and control of"
"1600","the Board, to manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets in the Funds"
"1601","and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to provide the other"
"1602","services specified in Section 2 hereof."
"1603","<PAGE>"
"1604","     SECTION 2. DUTIES OF THE ADVISER."
"1605","     (a) The Adviser shall make decisions with respect to all purchases and"
"1606","sales of securities and other investment assets for the Funds. Among other"
"1607","things, the Adviser shall make all decisions with respect to the allocation of"
"1608","the Funds' investments in various securities or other assets, in investment"
"1609","styles and, if applicable, in other investment companies or pooled vehicles in"
"1610","which a Fund may invest. To carry out such decisions, the Adviser is hereby"
"1611","authorized, as agent and attorney-in-fact for the Trust, for the account of, at"
"1612","the risk of and in the name of the Trust, to place orders and issue instructions"
"1613","with respect to those transactions of the Funds. In all purchases, sales and"
"1614","other transactions in securities for the Funds, the Adviser is authorized to"
"1615","exercise full discretion and act for the Trust in the same manner and with the"
"1616","same force and effect as the Trust might or could do with respect to such"
"1617","purchases, sales or other transactions, as well as with respect to all other"
"1618","things necessary or incidental to the furtherance or conduct of such purchases,"
"1619","sales or other transactions."
"1620","     (b) The Adviser will report to the Board at each regular meeting thereof"
"1621","regarding the investment performance of the Funds since the prior report, and"
"1622","will also keep the Board informed of important developments affecting the Trust,"
"1623","each Fund and the Adviser, and on its own initiative will furnish the Board from"
"1624","time to time with such information as the Adviser may believe appropriate,"
"1625","whether concerning the individual companies whose securities are held by a Fund,"
"1626","the industries in which they engage, or the economic, social or political"
"1627","conditions prevailing in each country in which a Fund maintains investments. The"
"1628","Adviser will also furnish the Board with such statistical and analytical"
"1629","information with respect to securities in the Funds as the Adviser may believe"
"1630","appropriate or as the Board reasonably may request."
"1631","          The Adviser shall promptly notify the Trust of (i) any changes"
"1632","regarding the Adviser that would impact disclosure in the Trust's Registration"
"1633","Statement, or (ii) any violation of any requirement, provision, policy or"
"1634","restriction that the Adviser is required to comply with under Section 6 of this"
"1635","Agreement. The Adviser shall immediately notify the Trust of any legal process"
"1636","served upon it in connection with its activities hereunder, including any legal"
"1637","process served upon it on behalf of the Funds or the Trust."
"1638","     (c) The Adviser will from time to time employ or sub-contract the services"
"1639","to certain persons as the Adviser believes to be appropriate or necessary to"
"1640","assist in the execution of the Adviser's duties hereunder; provided, however,"
"1641","that the employment or sub-contracting with any such person shall not relieve"
"1642","the Adviser of its responsibilities or liabilities hereunder and provided"
"1643","further that the Adviser shall not have the authority to sub-contract advisory"
"1644","responsibilities without the consent of the Trust. The cost of performance of"
"1645","such duties will be borne and paid by the Adviser. No obligation may be imposed"
"1646","on the Trust in any such respect."
"1647","          The Adviser shall supervise and monitor the activities of its"
"1648","representatives, personnel, sub-contractors, and agents in connection with the"
"1649","execution of its duties and obligations hereunder. The appropriate personnel of"
"1650","the Adviser will be made available to consult with the Board at reasonable times"
"1651","and upon reasonable notice concerning the business of the Trust."

"1653","<PAGE>"
"1654","     (d) The Adviser shall maintain records relating to portfolio transactions"
"1655","and the placing and allocation of brokerage orders as are required to be"
"1656","maintained by the Trust under the 1940 Act. The Adviser shall prepare and"
"1657","maintain, or cause to be prepared and maintained, in such form, for such periods"
"1658","and in such locations as may be required by applicable law, all documents and"
"1659","records relating to the services provided by the Adviser pursuant to this"
"1660","Agreement required to be prepared and maintained by the Trust pursuant to the"
"1661","rules and regulations of any national, state, or local government entity with"
"1662","jurisdiction over the Trust, including the Commission and the Internal Revenue"
"1663","Service. The books and records pertaining to the Trust which are in possession"
"1664","of the Adviser shall be the property of the Trust. The Trust, or the Trust's"
"1665","authorized representatives, shall have access to such books and records at all"
"1666","times during the Adviser's normal business hours. Upon the reasonable request of"
"1667","the Trust, copies of any such books and records shall be provided promptly by"
"1668","the Adviser to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives."
"1669","     (e) With respect to a Fund, the Adviser shall have no duties or obligations"
"1670","pursuant to this Agreement, during any period during which the Fund invests all"
"1671","(or substantially all) of its investment assets in a registered, open-end"
"1672","management investment company, or separate series thereof, in accordance with"
"1673","Section 12(d)(1)(E) under the 1940 Act."
"1674","     SECTION 3. DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO THE ADVISER. The Trust has furnished"
"1675","the Adviser with true, correct and complete copies of the following documents:"
"1676","          (a)  The Declaration of Trust, as in effect on the date hereof;"
"1677","          (b)  The Registration Statement filed with the Commission under the"
"1678","               1940 Act and the Securities Act; and"
"1679","          (c)  Written guidelines, policies and procedures adopted by the Trust."
"1680","     The Trust will furnish the Adviser with all future amendments and"
"1681","supplements to the foregoing as soon as practicable after such documents become"
"1682","available. The Trust shall furnish the Adviser with any further documents,"
"1683","materials or information that the Adviser may reasonably request in connection"
"1684","with the performance of its duties hereunder."
"1685","     SECTION 4. DELEGATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES. The Adviser may carry out any of"
"1686","its obligations under this Agreement by employing, subject to supervision by the"
"1687","Adviser, one or more Sub-Adviser(s) who are registered as investment advisers"
"1688","pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Sub-Advisers). Each"
"1689","Sub-Adviser's employment will be evidenced by a separate written agreement"
"1690","approved by the Board and, if required under the 1940 Act, by the shareholders"
"1691","of the Fund (unless the Commission or its staff has given authorization or"
"1692","issued an interpretation dispensing with the requirement of shareholder"
"1693","approval). The Adviser shall not be liable hereunder for any act or omission of"
"1694","any Sub-Adviser, except for failure to exercise good faith in the employment of"
"1695","the Sub-Adviser and for failure to exercise appropriate supervision of such"
"1696","Sub-Adviser, and as may otherwise be agreed in writing. The Adviser shall be"
"1697","solely responsible for compensating any Sub-Adviser for services rendered under"
"1698","any Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Adviser may, from time to time and at any time,"
"1699","terminate any Sub-Adviser and reassume the responsibilities assigned to such"
"1700","Sub-Adviser with respect to any Fund without obtaining the approval of the"
"1701","shareholders of the Fund."
"1702","                                       3"
"1703","<PAGE>"
"1704","     SECTION 5. CONTROL BY BOARD. Any investment activities undertaken by the"
"1705","Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any other activities undertaken"
"1706","by the Adviser on behalf of the Funds, shall at all times be subject to the"
"1707","direction and control of the Board."
"1708","     SECTION 6. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS. In carrying out its"
"1709","obligations under this Agreement, the Adviser shall at all times comply with:"
"1710","     (a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"1711","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"1712","     (b) the Registration Statement of the Trust, as it may be amended from time"
"1713","to time, filed with the Commission under the Securities Act and the 1940 Act;"
"1714","     (c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it may be"
"1715","amended from time to time;"
"1716","     (d) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,"
"1717","applicable to the Trust or the Funds, and any rules and regulations adopted"
"1718","thereunder; and"
"1719","     (e)any other applicable provisions of state or federal law, and any rules"
"1720","and regulations adopted thereunder."
"1721","     SECTION 7. PROXIES. The Adviser shall have responsibility to vote proxies"
"1722","solicited with respect to issuers of securities in which assets of the Funds are"
"1723","invested in accordance with the Trust's policies on proxy voting."
"1724","     SECTION 8. BROKER-DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. In connection with the purchase and"
"1725","sale of securities for the Funds, the Adviser is responsible for broker-dealer"
"1726","selection and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Adviser's primary"
"1727","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain the best"
"1728","price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular"
"1729","transaction for a Fund, the Adviser will consider among other things: the best"
"1730","net price available, the reliability, integrity and financial condition of the"
"1731","broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value"
"1732","of the expected contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing"
"1733","basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any transaction may be less"
"1734","favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the difference is"
"1735","reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio execution services"
"1736","offered. Subject to such policies as the Board may from time to time determine,"
"1737","the Adviser shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any"
"1738","duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a"
"1739","Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and research services to"
"1740","the Adviser an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"1741","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would"
"1742","have charged for effecting that transaction, if the Adviser determines in good"
"1743","faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of"
"1744","the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in"
"1745","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of"
"1746","the Adviser with respect to the Fund and to other clients of the"
"1747","                                       4"
"1748","<PAGE>"
"1749","Adviser. The Adviser is further authorized to allocate the orders placed by it"
"1750","on behalf of the Funds to brokers and dealers who also provide brokerage and"
"1751","research services within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange"
"1752","Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith. Such allocation shall be in such"
"1753","amounts and proportions as the Adviser shall determine and the Adviser will"
"1754","report on said allocations regularly to the Board, indicating the brokers to"
"1755","whom such allocations have been made and the basis therefore."
"1756","     SECTION 9. EXPENSES. All of the ordinary business expenses incurred in the"
"1757","operations of the Funds and the offering of their shares shall be borne by the"
"1758","Funds unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement. The expenses"
"1759","borne by the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage commissions,"
"1760","taxes, legal, auditing or governmental fees, the cost of preparing share"
"1761","certificates, custodian, transfer agent and shareholder service agent costs,"
"1762","expense of issue, sale, redemption and repurchase of shares, expenses of"
"1763","registering and qualifying shares for sale, expenses relating to trustees and"
"1764","shareholder meetings, the cost of preparing and distributing reports and notices"
"1765","to shareholders, the fees and other expenses incurred by the Funds in connection"
"1766","with membership in investment company organizations and the cost of printing"
"1767","copies of prospectuses and statements of additional information distributed to"
"1768","the Funds' shareholders."
"1769","     The Adviser shall pay its own expenses in connection with the services to"
"1770","be provided by it pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, the Adviser shall be"
"1771","responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the"
"1772","Trust: (a) to amend the Trust's registration statement or supplement the Fund's"
"1773","prospectus, and circulate the same, to reflect a change in the personnel of the"
"1774","Adviser responsible for making investment decisions in relation to a Fund; (b)"
"1775","to obtain shareholder approval of a new sub-advisory agreement as a result of a"
"1776","change in control (as such term in defined in Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act)"
"1777","of the Adviser, or to otherwise comply with the 1940 Act, the Securities Act, or"

"1924","by the Adviser, promptly take such action as may be necessary to change its"
"1925","corporate name to one not containing the words Wells Fargo and following such"
"1926","change, shall not use the words Wells Fargo, or any combination thereof, as a"
"1927","part of its corporate name or for any other commercial purpose, and shall use"
"1928","its best efforts to cause its trustees, officers and shareholders to take any"

"1932","performance of the Funds or any specific level of performance, the success of"
"1933","any investment decision or strategy that the Adviser may use, or the success of"
"1934","the Adviser's overall management of the Funds. The Trust understands that"
"1935","investment decisions made for the Funds by the Adviser are subject to various"
"1936","market, currency, economic and business risks, and that those investment"
"1937","decisions will not always be profitable. The Adviser will manage only the"
"1938","securities, cash and other investments for which management responsibility is"
"1939","delegated to it and which are held in the Funds' account(s) and, in making"
"1940","investment decisions for the Funds, the Adviser will not consider any other"
"1941","securities, cash or other investments owned by the Trust."

"2571","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2572","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"2573","Wells Fargo Funds Trust:"
"2574","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"

"2585","Fargo Advantage Wisconsin Tax-Free Fund, (collectively the"
"2586","Funds), thirteen of the funds comprising the Wells Fargo Funds"
"2587","Trust, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2013, in accordance"
"2588","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"2589","Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal control"
"2590","over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"2591","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"2592","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"2593","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"2594","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"2595","Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"2596","we express no such opinion."
"2597","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"2598","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"2599","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"2600","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"2601","related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"2602","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"2603","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"2604","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"2605","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"2606","A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"2607","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2608","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"2609","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"2610","assets of the Fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"2611","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"2612","of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"2613","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"2614","the Fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"2615","of management and directors of the Fund; and (3) provide"
"2616","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"2617","of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the fund's"
"2618","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2619","statements."
"2620","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2621","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2622","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"2623","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2624","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"2625","of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2626","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"2627","exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"2628","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"2629","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"2630","on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2631","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"2632","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"2633","material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial"
"2634","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2635","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2636","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2637","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"2638","in internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"2639","standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"2640","Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"2641","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2642","reporting and its operations, including controls over"
"2643","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material"
"2644","weakness as defined above as of June 30, 2013."
"2645","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"2646","management and the Board of Trustees of Wells Fargo Funds Trust"

"2755","the discrete portion of the Fund's portfolio as may be determined from"
"2756","time-to-time by the Board or the Adviser, and shall not consult with the"
"2757","any Sub-adviser that is not an affiliated person of Wells Fargo as to any"

"2780","economic, social or political conditions prevailing in each country in which"

"2807","in possession of the Sub-Adviser shall be the property of the Trust. The"
"2808","Trust, or the Trust's authorized representatives (including the Adviser), shall"

"2810","normal business hours. Upon the reasonable request of the Trust, copies of"
"2811","any such books and records shall be provided promptly by the Sub-Adviser"
"2812","to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives."
"2813","Section 4. Control by Board. As is the case with respect to the"
"2814","Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, any investment"
"2815","activities undertaken by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, as"
"2816","well as any other activities undertaken by the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the"
"2817","Funds, shall at all times be subject to the direction and control the Trust's"
"2818","Board."
"2819","Section 5. Compliance with Applicable Requirements. In"
"2820","carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall at"
"2821","all times comply with:"
"2822","(a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"2823","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"2824","(b) the provisions of the registration statement of the Trust, as"
"2825","it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, under the"
"2826","Securities Act and the 1940 Act;"
"2827","(c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it"
"2828","may be amended or supplemented from time to time;"
"2829","(d) the provisions of any By-laws of the Trust, if adopted and"
"2830","as it may be amended from time to time, or resolutions of the Board as"
"2831","may be adopted from time to time;"
"2832","(e) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"
"2833","amended, applicable to the Trust or the Funds;"
"2834","(f) any other applicable provisions of state or federal law; and"
"2835","In addition, any code of ethics adopted by the Sub-Adviser must"
"2836","comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act, as it may be amended from"
"2837","time to time, and any broadly accepted industry practices, if requested by"
"2838","the Trust or the Adviser."
"2839","Section 6. Broker-Dealer Relationships. The Sub-Adviser is"
"2840","responsible for the purchase and sale of securities for the Funds, brokerdealer"
"2841","selection, and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Sub-"
"2842","Adviser's primary consideration in effecting a security transaction will be"
"2843","to obtain the best price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to"
"2844","execute each particular transaction for a Fund, the Sub-Adviser will take"
"2845","the following into consideration: the best net price available, the"
"2846","reliability, integrity and financial condition of the broker-dealer; the size"
"2847","of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value of the expected"
"2848","contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing basis."
"2849","Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any transaction may be less"
"2850","favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the difference is"
"2851","reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio execution services"
"2852","offered. Subject to such policies as the Trust's Board of Trustees may"
"2853","from time to time determine, the Sub-Adviser shall not be deemed to have"
"2854","acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this Agreement"
"2855","or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a Fund to pay a broker or"
"2856","dealer that provides brokerage and research services to the Sub-Adviser an"
"2857","amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in"
"2858","excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have"
"2859","charged for effecting that transaction, if the Sub-Adviser determines in"
"2860","good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to"
"2861","the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker"
"2862","or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the"
"2863","overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund and to"
"2864","other clients of the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser is further authorized to"
"2865","allocate the orders placed by it on behalf of the Funds to brokers and"
"2866","dealers who also provide research or statistical material, or other services"
"2867","to the Funds or to the Sub-Adviser. Such allocation shall be in such"
"2868","amounts and proportions as the Sub-Adviser shall determine and the Sub-"
"2869","Adviser will report on said allocations regularly to the Board of Trustees"
"2870","of the Trust indicating the brokers to whom such allocations have been"
"2871","made and the basis therefor."
"2872","Section 7. Expenses of the Fund. All of the ordinary business"
"2873","expenses incurred in the operations of the Funds and the offering of their"
"2874","shares shall be borne by the Funds unless specifically provided otherwise"
"2875","in this Agreement. These expenses borne by the Trust include, but are not"
"2876","limited to, brokerage commissions, taxes, legal, auditing or governmental"
"2877","fees, the cost of preparing share certificates, custodian, transfer agent and"
"2878","shareholder service agent costs, expense of issue, sale, redemption and"
"2879","repurchase of shares, expenses of registering and qualifying shares for"
"2880","sale, expenses relating to trustees and shareholder meetings, the cost of"
"2881","preparing and distributing reports and notices to shareholders, the fees and"
"2882","other expenses incurred by the Funds in connection with membership in"
"2883","investment company organizations and the cost of printing copies of"
"2884","prospectuses and statements of additional information distributed to the"
"2885","Funds' shareholders."
"2886","Section 8. Compensation. As compensation for the sub-advisory"
"2887","services provided under this Agreement, the Adviser shall pay the Sub-"
"2888","Adviser fees, payable monthly, the annual rates indicated on Schedule A"
"2889","hereto, as such Schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to"
"2890","time. It is understood that the Adviser shall be responsible for the Sub-"
"2891","Adviser's fee for its services hereunder, and the Sub-Adviser agrees that it"
