"975","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"976","To the Board of Trustees of"
"977","BlackRock Funds and the Shareholders of BlackRock Developed Real Estate Index"
"978","Fund:"
"979","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of BlackRock"
"980","Developed Real Estate Index Fund (a series of BlackRock Funds, hereafter"
"981","referred to as the Fund) as of and for the year ended January 31, 2017, in"
"982","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"983","(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"984","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"985","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"986","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"987","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"988","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an"
"989","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"990","reporting."
"991","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"992","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"993","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"994","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"995","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"996","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"997","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"998","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"999","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1000","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1001","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"1002","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1003","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1004","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"1005","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1006","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1007","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"1008","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1009","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1010","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1011","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1012","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1013","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1014","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1015","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"1016","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1017","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1018","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1019","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1020","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"1021","on a timely basis."
"1022","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"1023","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1024","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"1025","<PAGE>"
"1026","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"1027","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1028","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1029","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"1030","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of January 31,"
"1031","2017."

"1065","Committee of the Registrant's Board of Trustees (the Board of Trustees)"

"1069","contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion nor were they qualified"

"1071","Fund's fiscal periods ended January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016 and the"
"1072","subsequent interim period through February 24, 2017, (i) there were no"
"1073","disagreements with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices,"
"1074","financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which"
"1075","disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC, would have caused"
"1076","them to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection"

"1078","(ii) there were no reportable events of the kind described in Item"
"1079","304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as"
"1080","amended."
"1081","The Audit Committee of the Board of Trustees approved the engagement of"

"1128","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1129","To the Board of Trustees of BlackRock FundsSM and Shareholders of"
"1130","BlackRock Real Estate Securities Fund:"
"1131","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"1132","of BlackRock Real Estate Securities Fund (the Fund), a series"
"1133","of BlackRock FundsSM, as of and for the year ended January 31,"
"1134","2017, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1135","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1136","Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1137","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"1138","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1139","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1140","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1141","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"1142","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"1143","express no such opinion."
"1144","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1145","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1146","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1147","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1148","related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"1149","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1150","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1151","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1152","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"1153","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1154","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1155","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1156","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"1157","fund? (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1158","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1159","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1160","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"1161","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1162","and the Board of Trustees? and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1163","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1164","acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets that could"
"1165","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1166","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1167","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1168","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1169","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1170","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"1171","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1172","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1173","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1174","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1175","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"1176","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1177","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1178","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1179","material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial"
"1180","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1181","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1182","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1183","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1184","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1185","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1186","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"1187","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1188","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, that"
"1189","we consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as of"
"1190","January 31, 2017."
"1191","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1192","management of BlackRock Real Estate Securities Fund and the Board"
"1193","of Trustees of BlackRock FundsSM, and the Securities and Exchange"
"1194","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"1195","anyone other than these specified parties."
