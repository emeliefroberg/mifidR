"745","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"746","Accounting Firm"
"747","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors"
"748","of"
"749","Federated Total Return Series, Inc.:"
"750","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"751","financial statements of Federated Total"
"752","Return Bond Fund (one of the portfolios"
"753","constituting Federated Total Return Series,"
"754","Inc.) (the Fund) as of and for the year"
"755","ended November 30, 2017, in accordance"
"756","with the standards of the Public Company"
"757","Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"758","States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"759","control over financial reporting, including"
"760","controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"761","basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"762","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"763","the financial statements and to comply with"
"764","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"765","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"766","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"767","control over financial reporting."
"768","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"769","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"770","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"771","internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"772","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"773","judgments by management are required to"
"774","assess the expected benefits and related"
"775","costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"776","control over financial reporting is a process"
"777","designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"778","regarding the reliability of financial"
"779","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"780","statements for external purposes in"
"781","accordance with generally accepted"
"782","accounting principles.  A company's internal"
"783","control over financial reporting includes"
"784","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"785","to the maintenance of records that, in"
"786","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"787","reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"788","the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"789","reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"790","recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"791","of financial statements in accordance with"
"792","generally accepted accounting principles,"
"793","and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"794","company are being made only in accordance"
"795","with authorizations of management and"
"796","directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"797","reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"798","or timely detection of unauthorized"
"799","acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"800","company's assets that could have a material"
"801","effect on the financial statements."
"802","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"803","control over financial reporting may not"
"804","prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"805","projections of any evaluation of"
"806","effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"807","the risk that controls may become"
"808","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"809","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"810","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"811","A deficiency in internal control over"
"812","financial reporting exists when the design or"
"813","operation of a control does not allow"
"814","management or employees, in the normal"
"815","course of performing their assigned"
"816","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"817","on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"818","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"819","in internal control over financial reporting,"
"820","such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"821","that a material misstatement of the"
"822","company's annual or interim financial"
"823","statements will not be prevented or detected"
"824","on a timely basis."
"825","Our consideration of the Fund's internal"
"826","control over financial reporting was for the"
"827","limited purpose described in the first"
"828","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"829","disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"830","that might be material weaknesses under"
"831","standards established by the Public"
"832","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"833","(United States).  However, we noted no"
"834","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control"
"835","over financial reporting and its operation,"
"836","including controls over safeguarding"
"837","securities, that we consider to be a material"
"838","weakness as defined above as of November"
"839","30, 2017."
"840","This report is intended solely for the"
"841","information and use of management and the"
"842","Board of Directors of the Fund and the"
"843","Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"844","not intended to be and should not be used by"
"845","anyone other than these specified parties."

"1207","	The Corporation hereby agrees that no person,"
"1208","partnership, Corporation or other legal entity dealing"
"1209","with the Adviser shall be bound to inquire into the"
"1210","Adviser's power and authority hereunder and any such"
"1211","person, partnership, Corporation or other legal entity"
"1212","shall be fully protected in relying on such power or"

"1235","	This Limited Power of Attorney shall be"
"1236","governed and construed in accordance with the laws of"

"1239","other authority expressly granted hereunder, for"
"1240","purposes of Pennsylvania law, this Limited Power of"
"1241","Attorney shall be deemed to constitute a power used in"
"1242","a commercial transaction which authorizes an agency"

"1254","provision hereof, or any power or authority conferred"
"1255","upon the Adviser herein, would be invalid or"
"1256","unexercisable under applicable law, then such provision,"
"1257","power or authority shall be deemed modified to the"
"1258","extent necessary to render it valid or exercisable while"
"1259","most nearly preserving its original intent, and no"
"1260","provision hereof, or power or authority conferred upon"
"1261","the Adviser herein, shall be affected by the invalidity or"
"1262","the non-exercisability of another provision hereof, or of"
"1263","another power or authority conferred herein."
"1264","	This Limited Power of Attorney may be"
"1265","executed in as many identical counterparts as may be"
"1266","convenient and by the different parties hereto on"
"1267","separate counterparts.  This Limited Power of Attorney"
"1268","shall become binding on the Corporation when the"
"1269","Corporation shall have executed at least one counterpart"
"1270","and the Adviser shall have accepted its appointment by"
"1271","executing this Limited Power of Attorney.  Immediately"
"1272","after the execution of a counterpart original of this"
"1273","Limited Power of Attorney and solely for the"
"1274","convenience of the parties hereto, the Corporation and"
"1275","the Adviser will execute sufficient counterparts so that"
"1276","the Adviser shall have a counterpart executed by it and"
