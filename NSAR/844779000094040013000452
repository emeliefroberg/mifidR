"6488","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"6489","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"6490","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"6491","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"6492","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"6493","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"6494","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"6495","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"6496","Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"6497","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"6498","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"

"6508","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"

"6514","the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"

"6524","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"

"6526","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"

"6530","deteriorate."
"6531","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"

"6533","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"6534","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
