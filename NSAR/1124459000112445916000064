"3044","<TEXT>"
"3045","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"3046","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Franklin Global Trust"
"3047","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"3048","Franklin Global Real Estate Fund, Franklin International Growth Fund,"
"3049","Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund, Franklin Emerging Market"
"3050","Debt Opportunities Fund, and Franklin Global Listed Infrastructure Fund"
"3051","(the Funds) as of and for the year ended July 31, 2016, in accordance"
"3052","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"3053","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3054","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"3055","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"3056","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"3057","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"3058","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"3059","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"3060","Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"3061","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"3062","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"3063","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"3064","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal"
"3065","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"3066","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"3067","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"3068","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over"
"3069","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"3070","to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"3071","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"3072","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"3073","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"3074","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures"
"3075","of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"3076","management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"3077","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"3078","or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on"
"3079","the financial statements."
"3080","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"3081","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"3082","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"3083","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"3084","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"3085","procedures may deteriorate."
"3086","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"3087","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"3088","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"3089","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"3090","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"3091","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"3092","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds'"
"3093","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"3094","detected on a timely basis."
"3095","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3096","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"3097","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"3098","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"3099","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"3100","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"3101","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"3102","and their operation, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"3103","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as"
"3104","of July 31, 2016."
"3105","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"3106","and the Board of Trustees of Franklin Global Trust and the Securities"
"3107","and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be"
"3108","used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"3220","of outstanding Class A, Class C, Class R and Advisor Class shares,"
"3221","respectively, of the Target Fund as of 1:00 p.m., Pacific time, on the"
"3222","Closing Date.  The Acquiring Fund Shares delivered to FGT, on behalf of"
"3223","the Target Fund, at the Closing shall have an aggregate net asset value"
"3224","equal to the value of the Target Fund's Net Assets, all determined as"

"3242","number of Acquiring Fund Shares of the same class into which the Target"
"3243","Fund Shares theretofore represented by the certificate or certificates so"
"3244","surrendered shall have been converted.  Until so surrendered, each"
"3245","outstanding certificate, if any, which, prior to the Closing, represented"
"3246","Target Fund Shares shall be deemed for all Acquiring Fund purposes to"
"3247","evidence ownership of the number of Acquiring Fund Shares into which the"

"3282","been fully resumed and reporting shall have been restored and other trading"
"3283","markets are otherwise stabilized."

"3317","(b)	FCF is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares of beneficial"
"3318","interest, without par value, of the Acquiring Fund.  Each outstanding share of"
"3319","the Acquiring Fund is fully paid, non-assessable, and has full voting"
