"4876","OFFICES"
"4877","Section 1.  The registered office shall be in the City of Baltimore, State"
"4878","of Maryland."
"4879","Section 2.  The Corporation may also have offices at such other places"
"4880","both within and without the State of Maryland as the Board of Directors"
"4881","may from time to time determine or the business of the Corporation may"
"4882","require."
"4883","MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS"
"4884","Section 3.  Meetings of the stockholders shall be held at the office of"
"4885","the Corporation in Kansas City, Missouri or at any other place within the"
"4886","United States as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of"
"4887","Directors and stated in the notice of meeting."
"4888","Section 4.  The Corporation shall not be required to hold an annual"
"4889","meeting of its stockholders in any year in which the election of"
"4890","Directors is not required by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as"
"4891","amended (the &#147;Investment Company Act&#148;), to be acted upon by the"
"4892","holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation.  The use"
"4893","of the term &#147;annual meeting,&#148; wherever found in these By-laws, shall"
"4894","not be construed to imply a requirement that a stockholder meeting be"
"4895","held annually.  In the event that the Corporation shall be required"
"4896","by the Investment Company Act to hold an annual meeting of stockholders"
"4897","to elect Directors, such meeting shall be held at a date and time set"
"4898","by the Board of Directors in accordance with the Investment Company"
"4899","Act (but in no event later than 120 days after the occurrence of the"
"4900","event requiring the election of Directors).  Any annual meeting that"
"4901","is not required by the Investment Company Act shall be held on a date"
"4902","and time during the month of July set by the Board of Directors.  At"
"4903","any annual meeting, the stockholders shall elect a Board of Directors"
"4904","and may transact any business within the powers of the Corporation."
"4905","Any business of the Corporation may be transacted at an annual meeting"
"4906","without being specially designated in the notice, except such business"
"4907","as is specifically required by statute to be stated in the notice."
"4908","Section 5.  The presence at any stockholders meeting, in person or by"
"4909","proxy, of stockholders entitled to cast one-third of the votes entitled"
"4910","to vote thereat shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business,"
"4911","except as otherwise provided by law, by the Articles of Incorporation, or"
"4912","by these By-Laws.  Where the approval of any particular item of business"
"4913","to come before a meeting requires the approval of one or more than one"
"4914","class or series of stock, voting separately, the holders of one-third"
"4915","of the votes of each of such classes or series entitled to be voted must"
"4916","be present to constitute a quorum for the transaction of such item of"
"4917","business.  If, however, a quorum shall not be present or represented at"
"4918","any meeting of the stockholders, a majority of the voting stock"
"4919","represented in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time"
"4920","to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until"
"4921","a quorum shall be present or represented.  At such adjourned meeting"
"4922","at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may"
"4923","be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as"
"4924","originally notified.  If the adjournment is for more than 90 days,"
"4925","or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned"
"4926","meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each"
"4927","stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat."
"4928","Section 6.  When a quorum is present at any meeting, a majority of all"
"4929","the votes cast is sufficient to approve any matter which properly comes"
"4930","before the meeting, unless a different vote for such matter is specified"
"4931","by law, by the Articles of Incorporation or by these By-laws, in which"
"4932","case such different specified vote shall be required to approve such"
"4933","matter."
"4934","Section 7.  Special meetings of the stockholders may be called at any"
"4935","time by the Board of Directors, or by the Chairman of the Board, the"
"4936","President, a Vice President, the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary."
"4937","Section 8.  Special meetings of the stockholders shall be called by the"
"4938","Secretary upon written request of stockholders entitled to cast at"
"4939","least 25 percent of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting."
"4940","Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of such meeting and"
"4941","the matters proposed to be acted on thereat.  After verification of"
"4942","the sufficiency of such request, the Secretary shall then inform the"
"4943","requesting stockholders of the reasonably estimated cost of preparing"
"4944","and mailing such notice of the meeting.  Upon payment to the Corporation"
"4945","of such costs the Secretary shall give notice stating the purpose or"
"4946","purposes of the meeting to all stockholders entitled to notice of such"
"4947","meeting; provided, however, unless requested by stockholders entitled"
"4948","to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting,"
"4949","no special meeting need be called to consider any matter which is"
"4950","substantially the same as a matter voted upon at any special meeting"
"4951","of the stockholders held during the preceding 12 months."
"4952","Section 9.  Not less than ten nor more than 90 days before the date of"
"4953","every stockholders&#146; meeting, the Secretary shall give to each stockholder"
"4954","entitled to vote at such meeting, and to each stockholder not entitled to"
"4955","vote who is entitled by statute to notice, written or printed notice stating"
"4956","(i)&#160;the time and place of the meeting and, (ii)&#160;the purpose or purposes for"
"4957","which the meeting is called if the meeting is a special meeting, or if"
"4958","notice of the purpose of the meeting is required by statute to be given."
"4959","Such notice shall be given either by mail or by presenting it to the"
"4960","stockholder personally or by leaving it at his residence or usual place"
"4961","of business.  If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when"
"4962","deposited in the United States mail addressed to the stockholder at his"
"4963","address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, with postage"
"4964","thereon prepaid."
"4965","Section 10.  Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders"
"4966","shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice of the meeting."
"4967","Section 11.  At all meetings of stockholders, a stockholder may vote the"
"4968","shares owned of record by him on the record date (determined in accordance"
"4969","with Section 42 hereof) for each such stockholders&#146; meeting either in person"
"4970","or by written proxy signed by the stockholder or by his duly authorized"
"4971","attorney-in-fact.  No proxy shall be valid after 11 months from its date,"
"4972","unless otherwise provided in the proxy.  At all meetings of stockholders,"
"4973","unless the voting is conducted by inspectors, all questions relating to the"
"4974","qualifications of voters and the validity of proxies and the acceptance or"
"4975","rejection of votes shall be decided by the chairman of the meeting."
"4976","DIRECTORS"
"4977","Section 12.  The number of Directors of the Corporation shall be seven."
"4978","By vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors, the number of"
"4979","Directors fixed by the Articles of Incorporation or by these By-laws may"
"4980","be increased or decreased from time to time to a number not exceeding 15"
"4981","nor less than three, but the tenure of office of a Director shall not be"
"4982","affected by any decrease in the number of Directors so made by the Board."
"4983","Until the first annual meeting of stockholders or until successors are"
"4984","duly elected and qualify, the Board shall consist of the persons named"
"4985","as such in the Articles of Incorporation.  At the first annual meeting"
"4986","of stockholders and at each annual meeting thereafter, the stockholders"
"4987","shall elect Directors to hold office until the next annual meeting or"

"5587","Directors, including a majority of the Independent Directors, may"
"5588","from time to time authorize the imposition of a fee as a direct"
"5589","charge against shareholder accounts of any class of one or more"

"5608","investment objective managed by an Investment Team."
"5609","(3)	A &#147;Primary Strategy Portfolio&#148; is each Fund, as well"
"5610","as any other series of any other registered investment company"
"5611","for which the Investment Manager, or an affiliated investment"

"5619","calculated by dividing the net assets of the Fund by the sum"

"5621","a common Investment Strategy."
"5622","(6)	The &#147;Secondary Strategy Assets&#148; of a Fund is the sum"

"5633","Dollar Amount for the class of a Fund by the Investment"
"5634","Strategy Assets of the Fund."

"5636","day, each class of each Fund shall accrue a fee calculated by"
"5637","multiplying the Per Annum Fee Rate for that class by the net"
"5638","assets of the class on that day, and further dividing that"
"5639","product by 365 (366 in leap years)."
"5640","(d)	Monthly Management Fee Payment. On the first business"
"5641","day of each month, each class of each Fund shall pay the management"
"5642","fee to the Investment Manager for the previous month.  The fee for"
"5643","the previous month shall be the sum of the Daily Management Fee"
"5644","Calculations for each calendar day in the previous month."
"5645","(e)	Additional Series or Classes. In the event that the Board"

"5659","and may contract with such persons or entities to obtain information,"
"5660","investment advisory and management services, or such other services"
"5661","as the Investment Manager deems appropriate.  Any fees, compensation"
"5662","or expenses to be paid to any such person or entity shall be paid by"

"7355","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"7356","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of"
"7357","American Century Mutual Funds, Inc.:"
"7358","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of American"
"7359","Century Mutual Funds, Inc. (the &#147;Corporation&#148;), including Balanced Fund,"
"7360","Capital Value Fund, Focused Growth Fund, Fundamental Equity Fund, Giftrust"
"7361","Fund, Growth Fund, Heritage Fund, New Opportunities Fund, NT Growth Fund,"
"7362","NT Vista Fund, Select Fund, Small Cap Growth Fund, Ultra Fund, Vista Fund,"
"7363","and Veedot Fund, as of and for the year ended October 31, 2010, in accordance"
"7364","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"7365","(United States), we considered the Corporation&#146;s internal control over"
"7366","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"7367","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"7368","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"7369","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"7370","effectiveness of the Corporation&#146;s internal control over financial reporting."
"7371","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"7372","The management of the Corporation is responsible for establishing and"
"7373","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"7374","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"7375","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"7376","A corporation&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"7377","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"7378","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"7379","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"7380","principles.  A corporation&#146;s internal control over financial reporting"
"7381","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"7382","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"7383","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation; (2) provide"
"7384","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"7385","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"7386","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the corporation"
"7387","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"7388","directors of the corporation; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"7389","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"7390","disposition of a corporation&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on"
"7391","the financial statements."
"7392","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"7393","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"7394","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"7395","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"7396","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"7397","deteriorate."
"7398","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"7399","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"7400","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"7401","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"7402","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"7403","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"7404","the corporation&#146;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented"
"7405","or detected on a timely basis."
"7406","Our consideration of the Corporation&#146;s internal control over financial"
"7407","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"7408","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"7409","that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"7410","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"7411","deficiencies in the Corporation&#146;s internal control over financial reporting"
"7412","and its operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, that we"
"7413","consider to be a material weakness as defined above, as of October 31, 2010."
"7414","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"7415","the Board of Directors of American Century Mutual Funds, Inc., and the"
"7416","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should"
"7417","not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."
