"1100","Change in Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"1101","Firm"
"1102","Prior to July 3, 2017 Pioneer Investment Management,"
"1103","Inc. (the Adviser), the Fund's investment adviser, was"
"1104","an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A."
"1105","(UniCredit). On that date, UniCredit completed the"
"1106","sale of its Pioneer Investments business, which includes"
"1107","the Adviser, to Amundi (the Transaction). As a result"
"1108","of the Transaction, the Adviser became an indirect,"
"1109","wholly-owned subsidiary of Amundi. Amundi is"
"1110","controlled by Credit Agricole S.A. Amundi is"
"1111","headquartered in Paris, France, and, as of September 30,"
"1112","2016, had more than $1.1 trillion in assets under"
"1113","management worldwide."
"1114","Deloitte & Touche LLP (D&T), the Fund's previous"
"1115","independent registered public accounting firm,"
"1116","informed the Audit Committee and the Board that it"
"1117","would no longer be independent with respect to the"
"1118","Fund upon the completion of the Transaction as a result"
"1119","of certain services being provided to Amundi and Credit"
"1120","Agricole, and, accordingly, that it intended to resign as"
"1121","the Fund's independent registered public accounting"
"1122","firm upon the completion of the Transaction. D&T's"
"1123","resignation was effective on July 3, 2017, when the"
"1124","Transaction was completed."
"1125","During the periods as to which D&T has served as the"
"1126","Fund's independent registered public accounting firm,"
"1127","including the Fund's two most recent fiscal years"
"1128","preceding the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, D&T's"
"1129","reports on the Fund's financial statements have not"
"1130","contained an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion"
"1131","and have not been qualified or modified as to"
"1132","uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles."
"1133","Further, there have been no disagreements with D&T"
"1134","on any matter of accounting principles or practices,"
"1135","financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or"
"1136","procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of"
"1137","D&T, would have caused D&T to make reference to the"
"1138","subject matter of the disagreement in connection with"
"1139","its report on the financial statements. In addition, there"
"1140","have been no reportable events of the kind described in"
"1141","Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K under the Securities"
"1142","Exchange Act of 1934."
"1143","Effective immediately following the completion of the"
"1144","Transaction on July 3, 2017, the Board, acting upon the"
"1145","recommendation of the Audit Committee, engaged a"
"1146","new independent registered public accounting firm,"
"1147","Ernst & Young LLP (EY), for the Fund's fiscal year"
"1148","ended July 31, 2017."
"1149","Prior to its engagement, EY had advised the Fund's"
"1150","Audit Committee that EY had identified the following"
"1151","matters, in each case relating to services rendered by"
"1152","other member firms of Ernst & Young Global Limited, all"
"1153","of which are located outside the United States, to"
"1154","UniCredit and certain of its subsidiaries during the"
"1155","period commencing July 1, 2016, that it determined to"
"1156","be inconsistent with the auditor independence rules set"
"1157","forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"1158","(SEC): (a) project management support services to"
"1159","UniCredit in the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Serbia"
"1160","and Slovenia in relation to twenty-two projects, that"
"1161","were determined to be inconsistent with Rule 2-"
"1162","01(c)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X (management functions);"
"1163","(b) two engagements for UniCredit in Italy where fees"
"1164","were contingent/success based and that were"
"1165","determined to be inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(5) of"
"1166","Regulation S-X (contingent fees); (c) four engagements"
"1167","where legal and expert services were provided to"
"1168","UniCredit in the Czech Republic and Germany, and"
"1169","twenty engagements where the legal advisory services"
"1170","were provided to UniCredit in Austria, Czech Republic,"
"1171","Italy and Poland, that were determined to be"
"1172","inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(4)(ix) and (x) of"
"1173","Regulation S-X (legal and expert services); and (d) two"
"1174","engagements for UniCredit in Italy involving assistance"
"1175","in the sale of certain assets, that were determined to be"
"1176","inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(4)(viii) of Regulation S-X"
"1177","(broker-dealer, investment advisor or investment"
"1178","banking services). None of the foregoing services"
"1179","involved the Fund, any of the other funds in the Pioneer"
"1180","Family of Funds or any other Pioneer entity sold by"
"1181","UniCredit in the Transaction."
"1182","EY advised the Audit Committee that it had considered"
"1183","the matters described above and had concluded that"
"1184","such matters would not impair EY's ability to exercise"
"1185","objective and impartial judgment in connection with the"
"1186","audits of the financial statements of the Fund under the"
"1187","SEC and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1188","independence rules, and that a reasonable investor"
"1189","with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances"
"1190","would reach the same conclusion. Management and the"
"1191","Audit Committee considered these matters and"
"1192","discussed the matters with EY and, based upon EY's"
"1193","description of the matters and statements made by EY,"
"1194","Management and the Audit Committee believe that EY"
"1195","will be capable of exercising objective and impartial"
"1196","judgment in connection with the audits of the financial"
"1197","statements of the Fund, and Management further"
"1198","believes that a reasonable investor with knowledge of"
"1199","all relevant facts and circumstances would reach the"
"1200","same conclusion."

"1208","Report of Independent"
"1209","Registered Public Accounting"
"1210","Firm"
"1211","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1212","Pioneer Series Trust IV"
"1213","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1214","statements of Pioneer Multi-Asset Income Fund, and"
"1215","Pioneer Classic Balanced Fund (the Portfolios) (two"
"1216","portfolios constituting Pioneer Series Trust IV) as of and"
"1217","for the year ended July 31, 2017, in accordance with the"
"1218","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1219","Board (United States), we considered the Portfolios'"
"1220","internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1221","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1222","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1223","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"1224","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"1225","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1226","effectiveness of the Portfolios' internal control over"
"1227","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such"
"1228","opinion."
"1229","The management of the Portfolios is responsible for"
"1230","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1231","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1232","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"1233","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"1234","A company's internal control over financial reporting is"
"1235","a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1236","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1237","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1238","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1239","principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"1240","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1241","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1242","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1243","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"1244","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1245","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1246","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1247","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1248","company are being made only in accordance with"
"1249","authorizations of management and directors of the"
"1250","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1251","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1252","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"1253","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1254","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1255","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1256","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1257","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1258","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1259","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1260","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1261","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1262","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1263","allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"1264","of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1265","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"1266","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1267","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1268","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1269","misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"1270","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on"
"1271","a timely basis."
"1272","Our consideration of the Portfolios' internal control over"
"1273","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"1274","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1275","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1276","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"1277","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1278","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Portfolios'"
"1279","internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1280","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1281","securities that we consider to be a material weakness as"
"1282","defined above as of July 31, 2017."
"1283","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"1284","of management and the Board of Trustees of Pioneer"
"1285","Series Trust IV, and the Securities and Exchange"
"1286","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be"
"1287","used by anyone other than these specified parties."
