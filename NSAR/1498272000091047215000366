"450","Report of Independent"
"451","Registered Public"
"452","Accounting Firm"
"453","To the Board of Trustees of"
"454","Equinox Funds Trust"
"455","and the Shareholders of"
"456","Equinox Bluecrest Systematic"
"457","Macro Fund"
"458","In planning and performing our"
"459","audit of the consolidated"
"460","financial statements of"
"461","Equinox BlueCrest Systematic"
"462","Macro Fund (the Fund), a"
"463","series of the Equinox Funds"
"464","Trust, as of and for the period"
"465","ended March 31, 2015, in"
"466","accordance with the standards"
"467","of the Public Company"
"468","Accounting Oversight Board"
"469","(United States), we considered"
"470","the Fund's internal control"
"471","over financial reporting,"
"472","including controls over"
"473","safeguarding securities, as a"
"474","basis for designing our"
"475","auditing procedures for the"
"476","purpose of expressing our"
"477","opinion on the consolidated"
"478","financial statements and to"
"479","comply with the requirements"
"480","of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"481","purpose of expressing an"
"482","opinion on the effectiveness of"
"483","the Fund's internal control"
"484","over financial reporting."
"485","Accordingly, we express no"
"486","such opinion."
"487","The management of the Fund"
"488","is responsible for establishing"
"489","and maintaining effective"
"490","internal control over financial"
"491","reporting. In fulfilling this"
"492","responsibility, estimates and"
"493","judgments by management"
"494","are required to assess the"
"495","expected benefits and related"
"496","costs of controls. A fund's"
"497","internal control over financial"
"498","reporting is a process"
"499","designed to provide"
"500","reasonable assurance"
"501","regarding the reliability of"
"502","financial reporting and the"
"503","preparation of financial"
"504","statements for external"
"505","purposes in accordance with"
"506","generally accepted accounting"
"507","principles (GAAP). A fund's"
"508","internal control over financial"
"509","reporting includes those"
"510","policies and procedures that"
"511","(a) pertain to the maintenance"
"512","of records that, in reasonable"
"513","detail, accurately and fairly"
"514","reflect the transactions and"
"515","dispositions of the assets of"
"516","the fund; (b) provide"
"517","reasonable assurance that"
"518","transactions are recorded as"
"519","necessary to permit"
"520","preparation of financial"
"521","statements in accordance with"
"522","GAAP, and that receipts and"
"523","expenditures of the fund are"
"524","being made only in"
"525","accordance with"
"526","authorizations of management"
"527","and directors of the fund; and"
"528","(c) provide reasonable"
"529","assurance regarding"
"530","prevention or timely detection"
"531","of unauthorized acquisition,"
"532","use or disposition of a fund's"
"533","assets that could have a"
"534","material effect on the financial"
"535","statements."
"536","Because of inherent"
"537","limitations, internal control"
"538","over financial reporting may"
"539","not prevent or detect"
"540","misstatements. Also,"
"541","projections of effectiveness to"
"542","future periods are subject to"
"543","the risk that controls may"
"544","become inadequate because"
"545","of changes in conditions, or"
"546","that the degree of compliance"
"547","with the policies or procedures"
"548","may deteriorate."
"549","A deficiency in internal control"
"550","over financial reporting exists"
"551","when the design or operation"
"552","of a control does not allow"
"553","management or employees, in"
"554","the normal course of"
"555","performing their assigned"
"556","functions, to prevent or detect"
"557","misstatements on a timely"
"558","basis. A material weakness is"
"559","a deficiency, or combination of"
"560","deficiencies, in internal control"
"561","over financial reporting, such"
"562","that there is a reasonable"
"563","possibility that a material"
"564","misstatement of the Fund's"
"565","annual or interim financial"
"566","statements will not be"
"567","prevented or detected on a"
"568","timely basis."
"569","Our consideration of the"
"570","Fund's internal control over"
"571","financial reporting was for the"
"572","limited purpose described in"
"573","the first paragraph and would"
"574","not necessarily identify all"
"575","deficiencies in internal control"
"576","that might be material"
"577","weaknesses under standards"
"578","established by the Public"
"579","Company Accounting"
"580","Oversight Board (United"
"581","States). However, we noted no"
"582","deficiencies in the Fund's"
"583","internal control over financial"
"584","reporting and its operation,"
"585","including controls over"
"586","safeguarding of securities that"
"587","we consider to be a material"
"588","weakness as defined above as"
"589","of March 31, 2015."
"590","This report is intended solely"
"591","for the information and use of"
"592","management and the Board of"
"593","Trustees of the Fund and the"
"594","Securities and Exchange"
"595","Commission and is not"
"596","intended to be and should not"
"597","be used by anyone other than"
"598","these specified parties."
