"683","EATON VANCE GROWTH TRUST"
"684","AMENDMENT TO DECLARATION OF TRUST"
"685","AMENDMENT effective November 14, 2011, made to the"
"686","Declaration of Trust dated May 25, 1989, as amended,"
"687","(hereinafter called the Declaration) of Eaton Vance Growth"
"688","Trust, a Massachusetts business trust (hereinafter called the"
"689","Trust), by at least a majority of the Trustees of the Trust in"
"690","office on November 14, 2011."
"691","WHEREAS, Section 7 of Article XIV of the Declaration"
"692","empowers a majority of the Trustees of the Trust to amend the"
"693","Declaration without the vote or consent of Shareholders to make"
"694","such changes as do not have a materially adverse effect on the"
"695","rights or interests of Shareholders;"
"696","NOW, THEREFORE, at least a majority of the duly elected and"
"697","qualified Trustees do hereby amend the Declaration in the"
"698","following manner:"
"699","1.	Section 4 of Article XIV of the Declaration is hereby"
"700","amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:"
"701","Section 4.  Termination of the Trust or a Series or a Class.  (a)"
"702","The Trust or any Series or Class thereof may be terminated by:"
"703","(1) the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds"
"704","of the Shares outstanding and entitled to vote at any meeting of"
"705","Shareholders of the Trust or the appropriate Series or Class"
"706","thereof, or by an instrument or instruments in writing without a"
"707","meeting, consented to by the holder of two-thirds of the Shares"
"708","of the Trust or a Series or Class thereof, provided, however, that,"
"709","if such termination is recommended by the Trustees, the vote of"
"710","a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Trust or a"
"711","Series or Class thereof entitled to vote thereon shall be sufficient"
"712","authorization; or (2) by the approval of a majority of the"
"713","Trustees then in office to be followed by a written notice to"
"714","Shareholders.  Such Trustee approval may (but need not) be"
"715","based on factors or events adversely affecting the ability of the"
"716","Trust, such Series or Class to conduct its business and operations"
"717","in an economically viable manner.  Such factors and events may"
"718","include (but are not limited to) the inability of a Series or Class"
"719","or the Trust to maintain its assets at an appropriate size, changes"
"720","in laws or regulations governing the Series or Class or the Trust"
"721","or affecting assets of the type in which such Series or Class or"
"722","the Trust invests, or political social, legal, or economic"
"723","developments or trends having an adverse impact on the"
"724","business or operations of such Series or Class or the Trust.  Upon"
"725","the termination of the Trust or the Series or Class,"
"726","(i)	The Trust, Series or Class shall carry on no business"
"727","except for the purpose of winding up its affairs."

"771","AMENDMENT TO THE BY-LAWS OF"
"772","EATON VANCE GROWTH TRUST"
"773","October 17, 2011"
"774","Pursuant to Article XV of the By-Laws of Eaton Vance Growth"

"804","To the Trustees of Eaton Vance Growth Trust and"

"806","Fund:"
"807","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"808","statements of Eaton Vance Focused Growth Opportunities"
"809","Fund (the Fund) (one of the funds constituting Eaton Vance"
"810","Growth Trust) as of and for the period ended February 29,"
"811","2012 , in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"812","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"813","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including"
"814","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"815","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"816","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"817","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"818","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"819","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"820","express no such opinion."
"821","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"822","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"823","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"824","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"825","related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"826","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"827","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"828","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"829","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"830","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"831","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"832","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"833","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"834","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"835","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"836","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"837","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"838","in accordance with authorizations of management of the fund"
"839","and trustees of the trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"840","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"841","acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets that could"
"842","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"843","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"844","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"845","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"846","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"847","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"848","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"849","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"850","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"851","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"852","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"853","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"854","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"855","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"856","material misstatement of a fund's annual or interim financial"
"857","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"858","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"859","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"860","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"861","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"862","standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"863","Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"864","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"865","reporting and its operation, including controls for safeguarding"
"866","securities that we consider to be a material weakness, as"
"867","defined above, as of February 29, 2012."
