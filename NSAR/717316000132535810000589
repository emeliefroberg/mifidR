"1287","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1288","To the Trustees of the American Century California Tax-Free and Municipal Funds"
"1289","and Shareholders of the California High-Yield Municipal Fund, the California"
"1290","Long-Term Tax-Free Fund, the California Tax-Free Money Market Fund, and the"
"1291","California Tax-Free Bond Fund:"
"1292","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of the"
"1293","American Century California Tax-Free and Municipal Funds (the &#147;Funds&#148;)"
"1294","as of and for the year ended August 31, 2010, in accordance with the standards"
"1295","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"1296","the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1297","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"1298","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"1299","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1300","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal control"
"1301","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"1302","the effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting."
"1303","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1304","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1305","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1306","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund&#146;s internal"
"1307","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1308","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1309","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"1310","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund&#146;s internal control"
"1311","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"1312","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1313","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1314","assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"1315","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"1316","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"1317","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance"
"1318","with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and"
"1319","(3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"1320","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund&#146;s assets that"
"1321","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1322","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1323","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"1324","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1325","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"1326","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1327","deteriorate."
"1328","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1329","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"1330","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"1331","or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is"
"1332","a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"1333","over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"1334","that a material misstatement of the Funds&#146; annual or interim financial"
"1335","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1336","Our consideration of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial"
"1337","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"1338","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"1339","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"1340","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1341","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"1342","Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1343","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider"
"1344","to be material weaknesses as defined above as of August 31, 2010."
"1345","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"1346","and the Board of Trustees of the American Century California Tax-Free and"
"1347","Municipal Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"1348","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"1349","specified parties."

"1425","Terms of new or amended securities"
"1426","(b)(1) California Long-Term Tax-Free and California High-Yield Municipal,"
"1427","each a series of the Registrant (the trust), began offering Institutional"
"1428","Class shares during the period, effective 03/01/10."
"1429","(2) California Tax-Free Bond, a series of the trust, began offering"
"1430","Institutional, A and C Class shares during the period, effective 03/01/10."
"1431","Each fund is a series of shares issued by the trust, and shares of each"
"1432","fund have equal voting rights. In addition, each series (or fund) may be"
"1433","divided into separate classes. Additional funds and classes may be added"
"1434","without a shareholder vote. Each fund votes separately on matters affecting"
"1435","that fund exclusively. Voting rights are not cumulative, so that investors"
"1436","holding more than 50% of the trust&#146;s (i.e.., all funds&#146;) outstanding shares"
"1437","may be able to elect a Board of Trustees. The trust undertakes dollar-based"
"1438","voting, meaning that the number of votes a shareholder is entitled to is"
"1439","based upon the dollar amount of the shareholder&#146;s investment. The election"
"1440","of trustees is determined by the votes received from all trust shareholders"
"1441","without regard to whether a majority of shares of any one fund voted in favor"
"1442","of a particular nominee or all nominees as a group."
"1443","Each shareholder has rights to dividends and distributions declared by the"
"1444","fund he or she owns and to the net assets of such fund upon its liquidation"
"1445","or dissolution proportionate to his or her share ownership interest in the"
"1446","fund. Shares of each fund have equal voting rights, although each fund votes"
"1447","separately on matters affecting that fund exclusively."
"1448","The assets belonging to each series are held separately by the custodian"
"1449","and the shares of each series represent a beneficial interest in the"
"1450","principal, earnings and profit (or losses) of investments and other assets"
"1451","held for each series. Shareholder rights are the same for all series of"
"1452","securities unless otherwise stated. Within their respective series, all"
"1453","shares have equal redemption rights. Each share, when issued, is fully"
"1454","paid and non-assessable."
"1455","The A and C Class shares of the funds are made available to participants"
"1456","in employer-sponsored retirement plans and to persons purchasing through"
"1457","broker-dealers, banks, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries"
"1458","that provide various administrative, shareholder and distribution services."
"1459","The funds&#146; distributor enters into contracts with various banks,"
"1460","broker-dealers, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries,"
"1461","with respect to the sale of the funds&#146; shares and/or the use of the funds&#146;"
"1462","shares in various investment products or in connection with various financial"
"1463","services."
"1464","Certain recordkeeping and administrative services that would otherwise be"
"1465","performed by the funds&#146; transfer agent may be performed by a plan sponsor"
"1466","(or its agents) or by a financial intermediary for A Class and C Class"
"1467","investors. In addition to such services, the financial intermediaries"
"1468","provide various individual shareholder and distribution services."
"1469","To enable the funds&#146; shares to be made available through such plans and"
"1470","financial intermediaries, and to compensate them for such services, the"
"1471","funds&#146; Board of Trustees has adopted the A and C Class Plans."
"1472","Pursuant to the A Class Plan, the A Class pays the funds&#146; distributor"
"1473","0.25% annually of the average daily net asset value of the funds&#146; A Class"
"1474","shares. The distributor may use these fees to pay for certain ongoing"
"1475","shareholder and administrative services and for distribution services,"
"1476","including past distribution services. This payment is fixed at 0.25% and"
"1477","is not based on expenses incurred by the distributor."
"1478","Pursuant to the C Class Plan, the C Class pays the funds&#146; distributor 1.00%"
"1479","annually of the average daily net asset value of the funds&#146; C Class shares,"
"1480","0.25% of which is paid for certain ongoing individual shareholder and"
"1481","administrative services and 0.75% of which is paid for distribution services,"
"1482","including past distribution services. This payment is fixed at 1.00% and"
"1483","is not based on expenses incurred by the distributor."
"1484","The distributor then makes these payments to the financial intermediaries"
"1485","(including underwriters and broker-dealers, who may use some of the proceeds"
"1486","to compensate sales personnel) who offer the A Class for the services"
"1487","described below. No portion of these payments is used by the distributor"
"1488","to pay for advertising, printing costs or interest expenses."
"1489","    Payments may be made for a variety of individual shareholder services,"
"1490","including, but not limited to:"
"1491","    (a)  providing individualized and customized investment advisory services,"
"1492","including the consideration of shareholder profiles and specific goals;"
"1493","    (b)  creating investment models and asset allocation models for use"
"1494","by shareholders in selecting appropriate funds;"
"1495","    (c)  conducting proprietary research about investment choices and"
"1496","the market in general;"
"1497","    (d)  periodic rebalancing of shareholder accounts to ensure"
"1498","compliance with the selected asset allocation;"
"1499","    (e)  consolidating shareholder accounts in one place; and"
"1500","    (f)  other individual services."
"1501","    Individual shareholder services do not include those activities"
"1502","and expenses that are primarily intended to result in the sale of"
"1503","additional shares of the funds."
"1504","    Distribution services include any activity undertaken or expense"
"1505","incurred that is primarily intended to result in the sale of A Class"
"1506","or C Class shares, which services may include but are not limited to:"
"1507","    (a)  paying sales commissions, on-going commissions and other"
"1508","payments to brokers, dealers, financial institutions or others who"
"1509","sell A Class or C Class shares pursuant to selling agreements;"
"1510","    (b)  compensating registered representatives or other employees"
"1511","of the distributor who engage in or support distribution of the funds&#146;"
"1512","A Class or C Class shares;"
"1513","    (c)  paying and compensating expenses (including overhead and"
"1514","telephone expenses) of the distributor;"
"1515","    (d)  printing prospectuses, statements of additional information"
"1516","and reports for other-than-existing shareholders;"
"1517","    (e)  preparing, printing and distributing sales literature and"
"1518","advertising materials provided to the funds&#146; shareholders and"
"1519","prospective shareholders;"
"1520","    (f)  receiving and answering correspondence from prospective"
"1521","shareholders, including distributing prospectuses, statements of"
"1522","additional information,"
"1523","    and shareholder reports;"
"1524","    (g)  providing facilities to answer questions from prospective"
"1525","shareholders about fund shares;"
"1526","    (h)  complying with federal and state securities laws pertaining"
"1527","to the sale of fund shares;"
"1528","    (i)  assisting shareholders in completing application forms and"
"1529","selecting dividend and other account options;"
"1530","    (j)  providing other reasonable assistance in connection with"
"1531","the distribution of fund shares;"
"1532","     (k)  organizing and conducting of sales seminars and payments"
"1533","in the form of transactional and compensation or promotional incentives;"
"1534","    (l)  profit on the foregoing;"
"1535","    (m)  paying service fees for providing personal, continuing"
"1536","services to investors, as contemplated by the Conduct Rules of the"
"1537","FINRA; and"
"1538","    (n)  such other distribution and services activities as the"
"1539","advisor determines may be paid for by the funds pursuant to the"
"1540","terms of the agreement between the corporation and the funds&#146; distributor"
"1541","and in accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act."
"1542","    Each shareholder&#146;s ability to purchase, exchange, redeem and transfer"
"1543","shares will be affected by the policies of the financial intermediary"
"1544","through which he/she does business. Some policy differences may include"
"1545","    &#149;	minimum investment requirements"
"1546","    &#149;	exchange policies"
"1547","    &#149;	fund choices"
"1548","    &#149;	cutoff time for investments"
"1549","    &#149;	trading restrictions"
"1550","    In addition, a financial intermediary may charge a transaction fee"
"1551","for the purchase or sale of fund shares. Those charges are retained by"
"1552","the financial intermediary and are not shared with American Century"
"1553","Investments or the funds."
"1554","    The funds have authorized certain financial intermediaries to"
"1555","accept orders on the funds&#146; behalf. American Century has selling"
"1556","agreements with these financial intermediaries requiring them to track"
"1557","the time investment orders are received and to comply with procedures"
"1558","relating to the transmission of orders. Orders must be received by the"
"1559","financial intermediary on the funds&#146; behalf before the time the net asset"
"1560","value is determined in order to receive that day&#146;s share price. If those"
"1561","orders are transmitted to American Century and paid for in accordance with"
"1562","the selling agreement, they will be priced at the net asset value next"
"1563","determined after your request is received in the form required by the"
"1564","intermediary."
"1565","    Unless otherwise specified below, the minimum initial investment"
"1566","amount to open an account is $2,500. Financial intermediaries may open"
"1567","an account with $250, but may require their clients to meet different"
"1568","investment minimums.  There is a $50 minimum for subsequent purchases."
"1569","However, there is no subsequent purchase minimum for financial"
"1570","intermediaries or employer-sponsored retirement plans, but financial"
"1571","intermediaries may require their clients to meet different subsequent"
"1572","purchase requirements."
"1573","    The Institutional Class shares are made available for purchase by"
"1574","individuals and large institutional shareholders such as bank trust"
"1575","departments, corporations, retirement plans, endowments, foundations"
"1576","and financial advisors that meet the fund&#146;s minimum investment"
"1577","requirements. Institutional Class shares are not available for purchase"
"1578","by insurance companies for variable annuity and variable life products."
"1579","    The minimum initial investment amount for Institutional Class shares"
"1580","is $5 million ($3 million for endowments and foundations) per fund."
"1581","If you invest with us through a financial intermediary, this requirement"
"1582","may be met if your financial intermediary aggregates your investments"
"1583","with those of other clients into a single group, or omnibus, account"
"1584","that meets the minimum. The minimum investment requirement may be waived"
"1585","if you, or your financial intermediary if you invest through an omnibus"
"1586","account, have an aggregate investment in our family of funds of $10 million"
"1587","or more ($5 million for endowments and foundations), or in other situations"
"1588","as determined by American Century Investments. In addition, financial"
"1589","intermediaries or plan recordkeepers may require retirement plans"
"1590","to meet certain other conditions, such as plan size or a minimum level"
"1591","of assets per participant, in order to be eligible to purchase Institutional"
"1592","Class shares."
"1593","    If you sell C, or in certain cases, A Class shares, you may pay a sales"
"1594","charge, depending on how long you have held your shares.  Redemption proceeds"
"1595","will be calculated using the net asset value (NAV) next determined after we"
"1596","receive a transaction request in good order."
"1597","   A fund&#146;s net asset value, or NAV, is the price of the fund&#146;s shares."
"1598","   However, we reserve the right to delay delivery of redemption proceeds"
"1599","up to seven days. For example, each time a shareholder makes an investment"
"1600","with American Century, there is a seven-day holding period before we will"
"1601","release redemption proceeds from those shares, unless a shareholder"
"1602","provides us with satisfactory proof that the purchase funds have cleared."
"1603","For funds with CheckWriting privileges, we will not honor checks written"
"1604","against shares subject to this seven-day holding period. Investments by"
"1605","wire generally require only a one-day holding period. If you change your"
"1606","address, we may require that any redemption request made within 15 days"
"1607","be submitted in writing and be signed by all authorized signers with"
"1608","their signatures guaranteed. If you change your bank information, we may"
"1609","impose a 15-day holding period before we will transfer or wire redemption"
"1610","proceeds to your bank. Please remember, if you request redemptions by wire,"
"1611","$10 will be deducted from the amount redeemed. Your bank also may charge"
"1612","a fee.  In addition, we reserve the right to honor certain redemptions with"
"1613","securities, rather than cash."
"1614","    If, during any 90-day period, a shareholder redeems fund shares worth"
"1615","more than $250,000 (or 1% of the value of a fund&#146;s assets if that amount is"
"1616","less than $250,000), we reserve the right to pay part or all of the redemption"
"1617","proceeds in excess of this amount in readily marketable securities instead of"
"1618","in cash. The portfolio managers would select these securities from the fund&#146;s"
"1619","portfolio."
"1620","    We will value these securities in the same manner as we do in computing"
"1621","the fund&#146;s net asset value. We may provide these securities in lieu of cash"
"1622","without prior notice. Also, if payment is made in securities, the shareholder"
"1623","may have to pay brokerage or other transaction costs to convert the securities"
"1624","to cash."
"1625","    If the redemption would exceed this limit and the shareholder would like"
"1626","to avoid being paid in securities, please provide us with an unconditional"
"1627","instruction to redeem at least 15 days prior to the date on which the"
"1628","redemption transaction is to occur. The instruction must specify the dollar"
"1629","amount or number of shares to be redeemed and the date of the transaction."
"1630","This minimizes the effect of the redemption on a fund and its remaining"
"1631","investors."
"1632","    If the shareholder&#146;s account balance falls below the minimum initial"
"1633","investment amount for any reason, American Century Investments reserves"
"1634","the right to redeem the shares in the account and send the proceeds to"
"1635","your address of record. Prior to doing so, we will notify the shareholder"
"1636","and give him/her 60 days to meet the minimum. Please note that shares"
"1637","redeemed in this manner may be subject to a sales charge if held less"
"1638","than the applicable time period.  The shareholder also may incur tax"
"1639","liability as a result of the redemption.  For Institutional Class shares,"
"1640","we reserve the right to convert the shareholder&#146;s shares to Investor Class"
"1641","shares of the same fund. The Investor Class shares have a unified management"
"1642","fee that is 0.20% higher than the Institutional Class."
"1643","    Within 90 days of a redemption of any A Class shares, you may reinvest"
"1644","all of the redemption proceeds in A Class shares of any American Century"
"1645","Investments fund at the then-current net asset value without paying an"
"1646","initial sales charge. At your request, any CDSC you paid on an A Class"
"1647","redemption that you are reinvesting will be credited to your account."
"1648","You or your financial professional must notify the fund&#146;s transfer agent"
"1649","in writing at the time of the reinvestment to take advantage of this"
"1650","privilege, and you may use it only once per account. This privilege applies"
"1651","only if the new account is owned by the original account owner."
"1652","    You may exchange shares of the fund for shares of the same class of"
"1653","another American Century fund without a sales charge if you meet the"
"1654","following criteria:"
"1655","* The exchange is for a minimum of $100"
"1656","* For an exchange that opens a new account, the amount of the exchange must"
"1657","meet or exceed the minimum account size requirement for the fund receiving"
"1658","the exchange"
"1659","    For purposes of computing any applicable CDSC on shares that have been"
"1660","exchanged, the holding period will begin as of the date of purchase of the"
"1661","original fund owned. Exchanges from a money market fund are subject to"
"1662","a sales charge on the fund being purchased, unless the money market fund"
"1663","shares were acquired by exchange from a fund with a sales charge or by"
"1664","reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions."
"1665","    A signature guarantee - which is different from a notarized"
"1666","signature - is a warranty that the signature presented is genuine."
"1667","We may require a signature guarantee for the following transactions."
"1668","* You have chosen to conduct business in writing only and would like"
"1669","to redeem over $100,000."
"1670","* Your redemption or distribution check or automatic redemption is"
"1671","made payable to someone other than the account owners."
"1672","* Your redemption proceeds or distribution amount is sent by EFT"
"1673","(ACH or wire) to a destination other than your personal bank"
"1674","account."
"1675","* You are transferring ownership of an account over $100,000."
"1676","* You change your address and request a redemption over $100,000"
"1677","within 15 days."
"1678","* You change your bank information and request a redemption within"
"1679","15 days."
"1680","    We reserve the right to require a signature guarantee for other"
"1681","transactions, at our discretion."
"1682","    Investment instructions are irrevocable. That means that once you"
"1683","have mailed or otherwise transmitted your investment instruction, you"
"1684","may not modify or cancel it. Each fund reserves the right to suspend"
"1685","the offering of shares for a period of time and to reject any specific"
"1686","investment (including a purchase by exchange). Additionally, we may"
"1687","refuse a purchase if, in our judgment, it is of a size that would"
"1688","disrupt the management of a fund."
"1689","    We reserve the right to change any stated investment requirement,"
"1690","including those that relate to purchases, exchanges and redemptions. We"
"1691","also may alter, add or discontinue any service or privilege. Changes may"
"1692","affect all investors or only those in certain classes or groups."
"1693","In addition, from time to time we may waive a policy on a case-by-case"
"1694","basis, as the advisor deems appropriate."

"1745","MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT"
"1746","This MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (&#147;Agreement&#148;) is effective as of the 16th day"
"1747","of July, 2010 by and between AMERICAN CENTURY CALIFORNIA TAX-FREE AND"
"1748","MUNICIPAL FUNDS, a Massachusetts business trust and registered investment"
"1749","company (the &#147;Company&#148;), and AMERICAN CENTURY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, INC.,"
"1750","a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Investment Manager&#148;)."
"1751","WHEREAS, a majority of those members of the Board of Trustees of the Company"
"1752","(collectively, the &#147;Board of Directors&#148;, and each Trustee individually a"
"1753","&#147;Director&#148;) who are not &#147;interested persons&#148; as defined in the Investment"
"1754","Company Act of 1940 (the &#147;Investment Company Act&#148;) (hereinafter referred to"
"1755","as the &#147;Independent Directors&#148;), has approved this Agreement as it relates"
"1756","to each series of shares of the Company set forth on Schedule B attached"
"1757","hereto (the &#147;Funds&#148;)."
"1758","NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION of the mutual promises and agreements herein"
"1759","contained, the parties agree as follows:"
"1760","1.	Investment Management Services. The Investment Manager shall supervise"
"1761","the investments of each class of each Fund. In such capacity, the Investment"
"1762","Manager shall maintain a continuous investment program for each such Fund,"
"1763","determine what securities shall be purchased or sold by each Fund, secure"
"1764","and evaluate such information as it deems proper and take whatever action"
"1765","is necessary or convenient to perform its functions, including the placing"
"1766","of purchase and sale orders.  In performing its duties hereunder, the Investment"
"1767","Manager will manage the portfolios of all classes of shares of a particular"
"1768","Fund as a single portfolio."
"1769","2.	Compliance with Laws. All functions undertaken by the Investment Manager"
"1770","hereunder shall at all times conform to, and be in accordance with, any"
"1771","requirements imposed by:"
"1772","(a)	the Investment Company Act and any rules and regulations promulgated"

"1812","Manager has designated to manage a given portfolio."
"1813","(2)	An &#147;Investment Strategy&#148; is the processes and policies implemented"

"1817","series of any other registered investment company for which the Investment"
"1818","Manager serves as the investment manager and for which American Century"
"1819","Investment Services, Inc. serves as the distributor; provided, however,"
"1820","that a registered investment company that invests its assets exclusively"
"1821","in the shares of other registered investment companies shall not be a Primary"
"1822","Strategy Portfolio. Any exceptions to the above requirements shall be approved"
"1823","by the Board of Directors."
"1824","(4)	A &#147;Secondary Strategy Portfolio&#148; is another account managed by the"
"1825","Investment Manager that is managed by the same Investment Team as that"
"1826","assigned to manage any Primary Strategy Portfolio that shares the same"

"1830","Fund is assigned for determining the first component of its management fee."
"1831","Each Primary Strategy Portfolio is assigned to one of the three Investment"

"1833","Funds appear in Schedule B to this Agreement. The amount of assets in each"
"1834","of the Investment Categories (&#147;Investment Category Assets&#148;) is determined"
"1835","as follows:"
"1836","a)	Money Market Fund Category Assets.  The assets which are used to"
"1837","determine the fee for this Investment Category is the sum of the assets"
"1838","of all of the Primary Strategy Portfolios and Secondary Strategy Portfolios"
"1839","that invest primarily in debt securities and are subject to Rule 2a-7 under"
"1840","the Investment Company Act."
"1841","b)	Bond Fund Category Assets. The assets which are used to determine"
"1842","the fee for this Investment Category is the sum the assets of all of the"
"1843","Primary Strategy Portfolios and Secondary Strategy Portfolios that invest"
"1844","primarily in debt securities and are not subject to Rule 2a-7 under the"
"1845","Investment Company Act."
"1846","c)	Equity Fund Category Assets.  The assets which are used to"
"1847","determine the fee for this Investment Category is the sum the assets of"
"1848","all of the Primary Strategy Portfolios and Secondary Strategy Portfolios"
"1849","that invest primarily in equity securities."

"1851","is the dollar amount resulting from applying the applicable Investment"
"1852","Category Fee Schedule for the Fund (as shown on Schedule A) using the"

"1861","be the dollar amount resulting from application of the Complex Assets to the"
"1862","Complex Fee Schedule for the class as shown in Schedule C."
"1863","(10)	The &#147;Per Annum Complex Fee Rate&#148; for a class of a Fund is the"
"1864","percentage rate that results from dividing the Per Annum Complex Fee Dollar"
"1865","Amount for the class of a Fund by the Complex Assets."
"1866","(11)	The &#147;Per Annum Management Fee Rate&#148; for a class of a Fund is the sum"
"1867","of the Per Annum Investment Category Fee Rate applicable to the Fund and the"

"1870","of each Fund shall accrue a fee calculated by multiplying the Per Annum"
"1871","Management Fee Rate for that class times the net assets of the class on"
"1872","that day, and further dividing that product by 365 (366 in leap years)."
"1873","(d)	Monthly Management Fee Payment. On the first business day of each"
"1874","month, each class of each series Fund shall pay the management fee to the"
"1875","Investment Manager for the previous month. The fee for the previous month"
"1876","shall be the sum of the Daily Management Fee Calculations for each calendar"
"1877","day in the previous month."
"1878","(e)	Additional Series or Classes. In the event that the Board of Directors"
"1879","shall determine to issue any additional series or classes of shares for which"
"1880","it is proposed that the Investment Manager serve as investment manager, the"
"1881","Company and the Investment Manager shall enter into an Addendum to this"
"1882","Agreement setting forth the name of the series and/or classes, as appropriate,"
"1883","the fee schedule for each and such other terms and conditions as are applicable"
"1884","to the management of such series and/or classes, or, in the alternative, enter"
"1885","into a separate management agreement that relates specifically to such series"
"1886","and/or classes of shares."
"1887","7.	Continuation of Agreement.  This Agreement shall become effective for"
"1888","each Fund as of the date first set forth above (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;) and shall"
"1889","continue in effect for each Fund for a period of two years from the Effective"

"1891","in effect from year to year thereafter for each Fund only as long as such"
"1892","continuance is specifically approved at least annually (i) by either the"
"1893","Board of Directors or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting"
"1894","securities of such Fund, and (ii) by the vote of a majority of the"
"1895","Directors who are not parties to the Agreement or interested persons of"
"1896","any such party, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of"
"1897","voting on such approval.  The annual approvals provided for herein shall"
"1898","be effective to continue this Agreement from year to year if given within"
"1899","a period beginning not more than 90 days prior to the date on which it"
"1900","would otherwise terminate in each applicable year, notwithstanding the"
"1901","fact that more than 365 days may have elapsed since the date on which"
"1902","such approval was last given."
"1903","8.	Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated, with respect to"
"1904","any Fund, by the Investment Manager at any time without penalty upon"
"1905","giving the Company 60 days&#146; written notice, and may be terminated, with"
"1906","respect to any Fund, at any time without penalty by the Board of Directors"
"1907","or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of each class"
"1908","of such Fund on 60 days&#146; written notice to the Investment Manager."
"1909","9.	Effect of Assignment.  This Agreement shall automatically terminate"
"1910","with respect to any Fund in the event of its assignment by the Investment"
"1911","Manager.  The term &#147;assignment&#148; for this purpose has the meaning defined in"
"1912","Section 2(a)(4) of the Investment Company Act."
"1913","10.	Other Activities.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit or restrict"
"1914","the right of the Investment Manager, or the right of any of its officers,"
"1915","directors or employees (who may also be a Director, officer or employee of"
"1916","the Company), to engage in any other business or to devote time and attention"
"1917","to the management or other aspects of any other business, whether of a similar"
"1918","or dissimilar nature, or to render services of any kind to any other"
"1919","corporation, firm, individual or association."
"1920","11.	Standard of Care.  In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith,"
"1921","gross negligence, or reckless disregard of its obligations or duties hereunder"
"1922","on the part of the Investment Manager, it, as an inducement to it to enter"
"1923","into this Agreement, shall not be subject to liability to the Company or to"

"1925","connected with, rendering services hereunder or for any losses that may be"
"1926","sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security."
"1927","12.	Separate Agreement.  The parties hereto acknowledge that certain"
"1928","provisions of the Investment Company Act, in effect, treat each series of"
