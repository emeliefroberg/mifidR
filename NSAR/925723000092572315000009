"516","Registered Public Accounting"
"517","Firm"
"518","To the Shareholders and"
"519","Board of Trustees of"
"520","Federated Institutional Trust:"
"521","In planning and performing"
"522","our audit of the financial"
"523","statements of Federated"
"524","Institutional High Yield Bond"
"525","Fund (one of the portfolios"
"526","constituting Federated"
"527","Institutional Trust) (the"
"528","?Fund?) as of and for the year"
"529","ended October 31, 2015, in"
"530","accordance with the"
"531","standards of the Public"
"532","Company Accounting"
"533","Oversight Board (United"
"534","States), we considered the"
"535","Fund?s internal control over"
"536","financial reporting, including"
"537","controls over safeguarding"
"538","securities, as a basis for"
"539","designing our auditing"
"540","procedures for the purpose of"
"541","expressing our opinion on the"
"542","financial statements and to"
"543","comply with the requirements"
"544","of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"545","the purpose of expressing an"
"546","opinion on the effectiveness"
"547","of the Fund?s internal control"
"548","over financial reporting."
"549","Accordingly, we express no"
"550","such opinion."
"551","The management of the Fund"
"552","is responsible for establishing"
"553","and maintaining effective"
"554","internal control over financial"
"555","reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"556","responsibility, estimates and"
"557","judgments by management"
"558","are required to assess the"
"559","expected benefits and related"
"560","costs of controls.  A"
"561","company?s internal control"
"562","over financial reporting is a"
"563","process designed to provide"
"564","reasonable assurance"
"565","regarding the reliability of"
"566","financial reporting and the"
"567","preparation of financial"
"568","statements for external"
"569","purposes in accordance with"
"570","generally accepted"
"571","accounting principles.  A"
"572","company?s internal control"
"573","over financial reporting"
"574","includes those policies and"
"575","procedures that (1) pertain to"
"576","the maintenance of records"
"577","that,  in reasonable detail,"
"578","accurately and fairly reflect"
"579","the transactions and"
"580","dispositions of the assets of"
"581","the company; (2) provide"
"582","reasonable assurance that"
"583","transactions are recorded as"
"584","necessary to permit"
"585","preparation of financial"
"586","statements in accordance"
"587","with generally accepted"
"588","accounting principles, and"
"589","that receipts and expenditures"
"590","of the company are being"
"591","made only in accordance with"
"592","authorizations of"
"593","management and directors of"
"594","the company; and (3) provide"
"595","reasonable assurance"
"596","regarding prevention or"
"597","timely detection of"
"598","unauthorized acquisition, use"
"599","or disposition of a company?s"
"600","assets that could have a"
"601","material effect on the"
"602","financial statements."
"603","Because of its inherent"
"604","limitations, internal control"
"605","over financial reporting may"
"606","not prevent or detect"
"607","misstatements.  Also,"
"608","projections of any evaluation"
"609","of effectiveness to future"
"610","periods are subject to the risk"
"611","that controls may become"
"612","inadequate because of"
"613","changes in conditions, or that"
"614","the degree of compliance"
"615","with the policies or"
"616","procedures may deteriorate."
"617","A deficiency in internal"
"618","control over financial"
"619","reporting exists when the"
"620","design or operation of a"
"621","control does not allow"
"622","management or employees, in"
"623","the normal course of"
"624","performing their assigned"
"625","functions, to prevent or detect"
"626","misstatements on a timely"
"627","basis.   A material weakness"
"628","is a deficiency, or a"
"629","combination of deficiencies,"
"630","in internal control over"
"631","financial reporting, such that"
"632","there is a reasonable"
"633","possibility that a material"
"634","misstatement of the"
"635","company?s annual or interim"
"636","financial statements will not"
"637","be prevented or detected on a"
"638","timely basis."
"639","Our consideration of the"
"640","Fund?s internal control over"
"641","financial reporting was for"
"642","the limited purpose described"
"643","in the first paragraph and"
"644","would not necessarily"
"645","disclose all deficiencies in"
"646","internal control that might be"
"647","material weaknesses under"
"648","standards established by the"
"649","Public Company Accounting"
"650","Oversight Board (United"
"651","States).  However, we noted"
"652","no deficiencies in the Fund?s"
"653","internal control over financial"
"654","reporting and its operation,"
"655","including controls over"
"656","safeguarding securities, that"
"657","we consider to be a material"
"658","weakness as defined above as"
"659","of October 31, 2015."
"660","This report is intended solely f"
"661","or the information and use of man"
"662","agement and the Board"
"663","of Trustees of the Fund and the S"
"664","ecurities and Exchange Commission"
