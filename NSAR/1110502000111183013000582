In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A Trust&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Trust&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of&#160;&#160;the Trust; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Trust are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a Trust&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</font></font></div>"

Kirschner, the Litigation Trustee for the Tribune Litigation Trust, became successor plaintiff to the Creditors Committee on December 31, 2012, the effective date of Tribune Company&#8217;s plan of reorganization.&#160;&#160;On June 3, 2011, the registrant and HSGFX were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed by the indenture trustees of certain noteholders of Tribune Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.&#160;&#160;On September 28, 2011, HSGFX was named as a defendant in a similar action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.&#160;&#160;Both of those actions have also been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for coordinated proceedings with many other similar lawsuits against former Tribune Company shareholders.&#160;&#160;The registrant and HSGFX may also be putative defendant class members in some of these actions.&#160;&#160;The plaintiffs in all these lawsuits seek to recover amounts paid to shareholders of Tribune Company in connection with the leveraged buyout, plus interest and attorneys&#8217; fees and expenses.&#160;&#160;Oral argument on a motion to dismiss certain of the actions was held on May 23, 2013.&#160;&#160;The Court has not yet decided that motion.&#160;&#160;On June 4, 2013, the Litigation Trustee in another related action moved to amend the operative compliant filed in that action.&#160;&#160;The proposed amended complaint names HSGFX as one of the class representatives for certain of the shareholder defendants.&#160;&#160;The Court granted the motion on July 22, 2013, but the Litigation Trustee has not yet filed the new complaint.</font></div>"
