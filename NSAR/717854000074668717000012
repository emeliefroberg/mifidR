"1068","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1069","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Elfun"
"1070","International Equity Fund, Elfun Trusts, Elfun Diversified"
"1071","Fund, Elfun Tax-Exempt Income Fund, Elfun Income Fund, and"
"1072","Elfun Government Money Market Fund:"
"1073","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1074","statements of Elfun International Equity Fund, Elfun Trusts,"
"1075","Elfun Diversified Fund, Elfun Tax-Exempt Income Fund, Elfun"
"1076","Income Fund, and Elfun Government Money Market Fund"
"1077","(collectively, the Funds), as of and for the year ended"
"1078","December 31, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the"
"1079","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1080","considered the Funds internal control over financial"
"1081","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"1082","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"1083","of expressing our opinions on the financial statements and to"
"1084","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1085","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1086","Funds internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"1087","we express no such opinion."
"1088","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"1089","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1090","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1091","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"1092","benefits and related costs of controls.  A companys internal"
"1093","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1094","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1095","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1096","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1097","accepted accounting principles.  A companys internal control"
"1098","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1099","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"1100","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1101","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"1102","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1103","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1104","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1105","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"1106","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1107","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"1108","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"1109","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a companys"
"1110","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1111","statements."
"1112","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1113","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1114","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1115","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1116","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"1117","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1118","deteriorate."
"1119","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1120","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1121","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"

"1396","   be twelve, it being understood that such number may hereafter be changed at"
"1397","   any time and from time to time; provided, however, that there shall always"
"1398","   be at least one Trustee. When a quorum is present at a meeting, a majority"
"1399","   of the Units voted shall decide any question and a plurality shall elect a"
"1400","   Trustee, except when a different vote is specifically required by any"
"1401","   provision herein or the Bylaws, if any, or any applicable law. From time to"
"1402","   time, the Trustees may fill vacancies in the Trustees."

"1404","<PAGE>"
"1405","      Any Trustee may at any time resign as a trustee of the Fund by giving"
"1406","   written notice thereof to the other Trustees. Any Trustee may be removed at"
"1407","   any time as a trustee of the Fund by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of"
"1408","   the Trustees then in office. The Trustees shall hold office until their"
"1409","   resignation, removal, death or the appointment of their successor."
"1410","      The Trustees may appoint from among them a Chairman and one or more Vice"
"1411","   Chairmen. The Chairman and Vice Chairmen shall have such powers and duties"
"1412","   with respect to the calling and conducting of meetings of Trustees as the"
"1413","   Trustees may direct. The Trustees may appoint from time to time a Chief"
"1414","   Executive Officer or President, a Secretary, and Assistant Secretary and"
"1415","   such other Fund officers as they may deem necessary or advisable, and the"
"1416","   Trustees may delegate to these persons, subject to the mandatory"
"1417","   requirements of applicable law, such powers and duties as they deem"
"1418","   appropriate. The Trustees may also adopt from time to time such rules and"
"1419","   regulations for the organization and transaction of the Fund's business as"
"1420","   they deem necessary or advisable."
"1421","      The Trustees may act either by meetings or by written consent. In the"
"1422","   case of meetings, a majority of the Trustees shall constitute a quorum for"
"1423","   the conduct of business, and the vote of a majority of the Trustees present"
"1424","   at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act and deed of the"
"1425","   Trustees. In the case of action by written consent, it shall be sufficient"
"1426","   to bind all the Trustees, and shall be deemed their act and deed, if written"
"1427","   consents are obtained from a majority of the Trustees, provided, however,"
"1428","   that the written consents are filed with the minutes of the Trustees'"
"1429","   meetings and reported at the next meeting of the Trustees. Meetings of the"
"1430","   Trustees may be held either in person or by telephone or other means which"
"1431","   permit the Trustees to confer with one another. The manner, time and place"
"1432","   of holding meetings, the notices thereof, and the length of time required"
"1433","   for such notices shall be determined by the Trustees. Waivers of notice,"
"1434","   either before, at or after a meeting, shall be permitted."
"1435","   9. Compensation and Expenses of Trustees. The Trustees may receive"
"1436","   compensation for the services they perform for the Fund in an amount to be"
"1437","   determined by the Trustees; provided, however, that any change in"
"1438","   compensation previously reported to Unitholders as being paid to the"
"1439","   Trustees shall be reported in the shareholder report next published and"
"1440","   distributed to Unitholders after this change. Compensation of the Trustees"
"1441","   as provided herein, as well as the compensation of any agent, employee or"
"1442","   counsel of the Trustees and the expenses of administering the Fund shall be"
"1443","   paid from the assets of the Fund."
"1444","   10. Fiduciary Duties. Each Trustee shall discharge his duties with respect"
"1445","   to the Fund solely in the interest of the Unitholders and with the care,"
"1446","   skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a"
"1447","   prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters"
"1448","   would use in the conduct of an enterprise of like character and with similar"
"1449","   aims."
"1450","   11. Statements of Account. The Agent will deliver to each Unitholder a"
"1451","   statement of account (the Statement of Account) showing the number of"
"1452","   Units to which they are"
"1453","                                      5"
"1454","<PAGE>"
"1455","   entitled by reason of payments made by them or for their account, including"
"1456","   the reinvestment of income and gains, if any."
"1457","      Units shall be issued to Unitholders in consideration of investments made"
"1458","   in the Fund on the basis of the Units' Net Asset Value, as determined in the"
"1459","   manner provided below in Paragraph 13."
"1460","      Each Unit shall be equal to every other Unit, without preference or"
"1461","   priority of any one Unit over another. Unitholders shall have no voting"
"1462","   rights hereunder except with respect to amendments to this Agreement, as"
"1463","   described in Paragraph 20 below, and as required by applicable law. Each"
"1464","   Unit entitles the holder to one vote. The Units do not confer preemptive,"
"1465","   subscription or conversion rights to Unitholders."
"1466","      The Trustees are authorized and empowered in their discretion, at any"
"1467","   time and from time to time, to authorize Unit splits or reverse splits,"
"1468","   provided, however, that the proportionate interest of each Unitholder shall"
"1469","   not in any way be adversely affected thereby. In the event the number of"
"1470","   Units is increased, the Trustees shall issue to each Unitholder, without"
"1471","   further payment, a Statement of Account showing the additional Units to"
"1472","   which the Unitholder shall be entitled, such additional Units to be in the"
"1473","   same proportion to the number of Units held by the Unitholder prior to such"
"1474","   issuance as the total number of additional Units to be issued is to the"
"1475","   total number of Units outstanding prior to such issuance. In the event that"
"1476","   the number of Units shall be reduced, the Trustees shall issue a Statement"
"1477","   of Account showing such reduction, and the Trustees may do all things"
"1478","   necessary or expedient to make such reduction effective."
"1479","   12. Death of a Unitholder. The death of a Unitholder during the continuance"
"1480","   of the Fund shall not operate to terminate the Fund, nor shall it entitle"
"1481","   the personal representative of any such deceased Unitholder to an accounting"
"1482","   or to take any action in the courts or otherwise against the Fund or the"
"1483","   Trustees; provided, however, the right of redemption provided for in"
"1484","   Paragraph 14 below shall not expire with the death of the Unitholder, but"
"1485","   such right may be exercised by the personal representatives, legatees,"
"1486","   distributees, or beneficiaries in the manner provided in Paragraph 14."
"1487","   13. Valuation of Units. The net asset value (the Net Asset Value) of the"
"1488","   Units shall be determined by the Trustees or their designees each day that"
"1489","   the New York Stock Exchange is open, as of the close of trading on the"
"1490","   Exchange, New York City time, under policies and procedures as may be"
"1491","   approved from time to time by the Trustees. Such value when so determined"
"1492","   shall be taken as the value thereof for all purposes of this Agreement and"
"1493","   shall be binding and final upon the Unitholders, their personal"
"1494","   representatives, heirs, legatees, distributees, and beneficiaries."
"1495","   14. Redemption of Units. Unitholders may redeem Units either in whole or in"
"1496","   part by delivering a redemption form, duly executed and in form satisfactory"
"1497","   to the Trustees, to the Agent or as the Trustees may otherwise direct, or in"
"1498","   such other manner as the Trustees may provide that is consistent with"
"1499","   applicable law. Redemptions shall be made at the Net Asset Value next"
"1500","   computed after such delivery (or other acceptable tender) less"
"1501","                                      6"
"1502","<PAGE>"
"1503","   such redemption fee (not, however, to exceed one percent) as the Trustees"
"1504","   may from time to time prescribe."
"1505","      The Trustees may suspend a Unitholder's right of redemption or postpone"
"1506","   the date of payment when (a) trading in the markets the Fund normally"
"1507","   utilizes is restricted or an emergency exists as determined by the"
"1508","   Commission so that disposal of the Fund's investments or determination of"
"1509","   its Net Asset Value is not reasonably practicable, or (b) the Commission, by"
"1510","   order, has otherwise provided for or permitted such suspension or"
"1511","   postponement."
"1512","   15. Payment in Cash. Any payment made to Unitholders pursuant to the"
"1513","   provisions of this Agreement shall be made in cash."
"1514","   16. Distributions. The Trustees may in their discretion, to the extent"
"1515","   consistent with applicable tax or other law and the stated objective and"
"1516","   policies of the Fund, at any time or times distribute income, capital gains"
"1517","   or principal to the Unitholders in such amounts as the Trustees may"
"1518","   determine. Each such distribution shall be made in the proportion which the"
"1519","   number of Units held by each Unitholder bears to the total number of Units"
"1520","   issued and outstanding at the time of such distribution."
"1521","   17. Audit. As soon as practicable after the end of each calendar year, the"
"1522","   Trustees shall cause an audit to be made of the accounts, transactions,"
"1523","   securities and property of the Fund, such audit to be made by a firm of"
"1524","   certified or chartered accountants of recognized standing selected by the"
"1525","   Trustees. A certified copy of each such audit report shall be filed with the"
"1526","   Trustees. Such audit report shall show the Net Asset Value of Units"
"1527","   outstanding as of the 31st day of December of such calendar year and shall"
"1528","   show other matters as the Trustee may require and to the extent consistent"
"1529","   with applicable law."
"1530","   18. Taxes. All taxes that may be required to be paid in respect of the issue"
"1531","   and/or transfer of Units shall be paid by the Unitholders to whom the Units"
"1532","   are issued."
"1533","   19. Termination by Trustees. The Trustees may, in their discretion,"
"1534","   determine to terminate the Fund in whole or in part. In any such case, the"
"1535","   Trustees shall redeem outstanding Units at Net Asset Value, which shall be"
"1536","   determined as of a date fixed by the Trustees and specified in the notice of"
"1537","   termination delivered to Unitholders."
"1538","   20. Amendments. The Trustees shall have the power to amend this Agreement,"
"1539","   but no amendment shall be made which shall affect the Unitholders' right of"
"1540","   redemption or other substantial rights of the Unitholders unless and until a"
"1541","   copy of such proposed amendment shall have been submitted by mail to the"
"1542","   Unitholders and the same shall have been approved by the favorable vote of"
"1543","   at least a majority of the outstanding Units which were voted."
"1544","   21. Situs and Choice of Law. The situs of the Fund and the place of its"
"1545","   administration shall be in the State of Connecticut and, after July 1, 2016,"
"1546","   in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. All questions concerning the validity,"

"1791","3. Selection of Investments on Behalf of the Fund"
"1792","   Unless otherwise set forth in the Registration Statement or directed by a"
"1793","   Fund, SSGA FM will, in selecting brokers or dealers to effect transactions"
"1794","   on behalf of a Fund, seek the best overall terms available. In so doing,"
"1795","   SSGA FM may consider the breadth of the market for the investment, the price"
"1796","   of the security, the size and difficulty of the order, the willingness of"
"1797","   the broker or dealer to position, the reliability, financial condition and"
"1798","   execution and operational capabilities of the broker or dealer, and the"
"1799","   reasonableness of the commission or size of the dealer's spread, if any,"
"1800","   for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. SSGA FM may also"
"1801","   consider brokerage and research services provided to the Fund and/or other"
"1802","   accounts over which SSGA FM or its affiliates exercise investment"
"1803","   discretion. The Funds recognize the desirability of SSGA FM's having access"
"1804","   to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic"
"1805","   analyses provided by brokers and that those brokers may execute brokerage"
"1806","   transactions at a higher cost to a Fund than would be the case if the"
"1807","   transactions were executed on the basis of the most favorable price and"
"1808","   efficient execution. To the extent permitted by applicable law and"
"1809","   regulations, SSGA FM shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have"
"1810","   breached any duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of"
"1811","   its having caused a Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage"
"1812","   and research services to SSGA FM an amount of commission for effecting a"
"1813","   portfolio investment transaction in excess of the amount of commission that"
"1814","   another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction,"
"1815","   if SSGA FM determines in good faith that such amount of commission was"
"1816","   reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services"
"1817","   provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular"
"1818","   transaction or SSGA FM's overall responsibilities with respect to the Fund"
"1819","   and to other clients of SSGA FM as to which SSGA FM exercises investment"
"1820","   discretion. Each Fund hereby agrees that any entity or person associated"
"1821","   with SSGA FM which is a member of a national securities exchange is"
"1822","   authorized to effect any transaction on such exchange for the account of the"
"1823","   Fund which is permitted by Section 11(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of"
"1824","   1934, as amended."
"1825","4. Services to Other Companies or Accounts"
"1826","   a. Each Fund understands and acknowledges that SSGA FM now acts and will"
"1827","      continue to act as investment manager or adviser to various fiduciary or"
"1828","      other managed accounts and no Fund has any objection to SSGA FM's so"
"1829","      acting, so long as when a Fund and any account served by SSGA FM are"
"1830","      prepared to invest in, or desire to dispose of, the same security,"
"1831","      available investments or opportunities for sales, as well as the expenses"
"1832","      incurred in such transactions, will be allocated in a manner believed by"
"1833","      SSGA FM to be equitable to the Fund and the account. Each Fund recognizes"
"1834","      that, in some cases, this procedure may adversely affect the price paid"
"1835","      or received by a Fund or the size of the position obtained or disposed of"
"1836","      by a Fund."
"1837","   b. Each Fund understands and acknowledges that the persons employed by SSGA"
"1838","      FM to assist in the performance of its duties under this Agreement will"
"1839","      not devote their full time to that service and agrees that nothing"
"1840","      contained in this Agreement will be deemed to limit or restrict the right"
"1841","      of SSGA FM or any affiliate of SSGA"
"1842","                                      4"

"1887","   a.   SSGA FM will exercise its best judgment in rendering the services"
"1888","        described in this Agreement, except that SSGA FM shall not be liable,"
"1889","        subject to any contrary mandatory requirements of applicable law, for"
"1890","        any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by any"
"1891","        Fund in connection with the matters to"

"1894","          which this Agreement relates, other than a loss resulting from"
"1895","          willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of"
"1896","          SSGA FM in the performance of its duties under this Agreement or from"

"1905","          of the Funds, and signed by an authorized officer of the Funds,"
"1906","          acting as such, and neither the authorization by the Trustees nor the"
"1907","          execution and delivery by the officer will be deemed to have been"
"1908","          made by any of them individually or to impose any liability on any of"
