"3297","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"3298","To the Directors of the American Century Quantitative Equity Funds, Inc. and"
"3299","Shareholders of the Equity Growth Fund, NT Equity Growth Fund, Income & Growth"
"3300","Fund, Small Company Fund, NT Small Company Fund, Utilities Fund, Global Gold"
"3301","Fund, Disciplined Growth Fund, International Core Equity Fund, Long-Short"
"3302","Market Neutral Fund and Strategic Inflation Opportunities Fund:"
"3303","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of the"
"3304","American Century Quantitative Equity Funds, Inc. (the &#147;Funds&#148;)  as of and"
"3305","for the year ended June 30, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the"
"3306","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"3307","the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"3308","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"3309","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"3310","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"3311","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"3312","Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"3313","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal"
"3314","control over financial reporting."
"3315","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"3316","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"3317","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"3318","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"3319","costs of controls.  A fund&#146;s internal control over financial reporting"
"3320","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"3321","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"3322","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"3323","accounting principles.  A fund&#146;s internal control over financial"
"3324","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"3325","to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"3326","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"3327","of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"3328","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"3329","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"3330","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"3331","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the fund;"
"3332","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"3333","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund&#146;s"
"3334","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3335","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"3336","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"3337","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"3338","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"3339","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"3340","deteriorate."
"3341","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"3342","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"3343","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"3344","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"3345","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"3346","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"3347","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds&#146; annual or"
"3348","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on"
"3349","a timely basis."
"3350","Our consideration of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial"
"3351","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"3352","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"3353","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"3354","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"3355","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"3356","Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"3357","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider"
"3358","to be material weaknesses as defined above as of June 30, 2010."
"3359","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"3360","management and the Board of Directors of the American Century"
"3361","Quantitative Equity Funds, Inc. and the Securities and Exchange"

"3465","Terms of new or amended securities"
"3466","(a) Small Company renamed its Advisor Class &#147;A Class&#148;,"
"3467","effective 03/01/10."
"3468","The Advisor Class shares of the fund were renamed A Class shares."
"3469","A Class shares have a front end sales charge (load).  However,"
"3470","the sales charge on A Class shares will be waived for purchases"
"3471","of additional shares in accounts that held shares of an Advisor"
"3472","Class fund prior to March 1, 2010."
"3473","(b) (1) Small Company, a series of the Registrant (the corporation),"
"3474","began offering C Class during the period, effective 03/01/10."
"3475","(2) Strategic Inflation Opportunities, a new series of the Registrant),"
"3476","began offering Investor, Institutional, A, C and R Classes during the"
"3477","period, effective 04/01/10."
"3478","Each fund is a series of shares issued by the corporation, and shares of"
"3479","each fund have equal voting rights. In addition, each series (or fund)"
"3480","may be divided into separate classes. Additional funds and classes may be"
"3481","added without a shareholder vote. Each fund votes separately on matters"
"3482","affecting that fund exclusively. Voting rights are not cumulative, so that"
"3483","investors holding more than 50% of the corporation&#146;s (i.e.., all funds&#146;)"
"3484","outstanding shares may be able to elect a Board of Directors. The corporation"
"3485","undertakes dollar-based voting, meaning that the number of votes a shareholder"
"3486","is entitled to is based upon the dollar amount of the shareholder&#146;s investment."
"3487","The election of directors is determined by the votes received from all"
"3488","corporation shareholders without regard to whether a majority of shares"
"3489","of any one fund voted in favor of a particular nominee or all nominees"
"3490","as a group."
"3491","Each shareholder has rights to dividends and distributions declared by the"
"3492","fund he or she owns and to the net assets of such fund upon its liquidation"
"3493","or dissolution proportionate to his or her share ownership interest in the"
"3494","fund. Shares of each fund have equal voting rights, although each fund votes"
"3495","separately on matters affecting that fund exclusively."
"3496","The assets belonging to each series are held separately by the custodian"
"3497","and the shares of each series represent a beneficial interest in the"
"3498","principal, earnings and profit (or losses) of investments and other"
"3499","assets held for each series. Shareholder rights are the same for all"
"3500","series of securities unless otherwise stated. Within their respective"
"3501","series, all shares have equal redemption rights. Each share, when issued,"
"3502","is fully paid and non-assessable."
"3503","The A, C, and R Class shares of the funds are made available to"
"3504","participants in employer-sponsored retirement plans and to persons"
"3505","purchasing through broker-dealers, banks, insurance companies and other"
"3506","financial intermediaries that provide various administrative, shareholder"
"3507","and distribution services. The funds&#146; distributor enters into contracts"
"3508","with various banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies and other financial"
"3509","intermediaries, with respect to the sale of the funds&#146; shares and/or the"
"3510","use of the funds&#146; shares in various investment products or in connection"
"3511","with various financial services."
"3512","Certain recordkeeping and administrative services that would otherwise be"
"3513","performed by the funds&#146; transfer agent may be performed by a plan sponsor"
"3514","(or its agents) or by a financial intermediary for A Class, C Class and"
"3515","R Class investors. In addition to such services, the financial"
"3516","intermediaries provide various individual shareholder and distribution"
"3517","services."
"3518","To enable the funds&#146; shares to be made available through such plans and"
"3519","financial intermediaries, and to compensate them for such services, the"
"3520","funds&#146; Board of Directors has adopted the A, C and R Class Plans."
"3521","Pursuant to the A Class Plan, the A Class pays the funds&#146; distributor 0.25%"
"3522","annually of the average daily net asset value of the funds&#146; A Class shares."
"3523","The distributor may use these fees to pay for certain ongoing shareholder"
"3524","and administrative services and for distribution services, including past"
"3525","distribution services. This payment is fixed at 0.25% and is not based on"
"3526","expenses incurred by the distributor."
"3527","Pursuant to the C Class Plan, the C Class pays the funds&#146; distributor 1.00%"
"3528","annually of the average daily net asset value of the funds&#146; C Class shares,"
"3529","0.25% of which is paid for certain ongoing individual shareholder and"
"3530","administrative services and 0.75% of which is paid for distribution services,"
"3531","including past distribution services. This payment is fixed at 1.00% and is"
"3532","not based on expenses incurred by the distributor."
"3533","Pursuant to the R Class Plan, the R Class pays the funds&#146; distributor 0.50%"
"3534","annually of the average daily net asset value of the R Class shares.  The"
"3535","distributor may use these fees to pay for certain ongoing shareholder and"
"3536","administrative services and for distribution services, including past"
"3537","distribution services. This payment is fixed at 0.50% and is not based"
"3538","on expenses incurred by the distributor."
"3539","The distributor then makes these payments to the financial intermediaries"
"3540","(including underwriters and broker-dealers, who may use some of the proceeds"
"3541","to compensate sales personnel) who offer the A Class for the services"
"3542","described below. No portion of these payments is used by the distributor"
"3543","to pay for advertising, printing costs or interest expenses."
"3544","    Payments may be made for a variety of individual shareholder services,"
"3545","including, but not limited to:"
"3546","    (a)  providing individualized and customized investment advisory services,"
"3547","including the consideration of shareholder profiles and specific goals;"
"3548","    (b)  creating investment models and asset allocation models for use by"
"3549","shareholders in selecting appropriate funds;"
"3550","    (c)  conducting proprietary research about investment choices and the"
"3551","market in general;"
"3552","    (d)  periodic rebalancing of shareholder accounts to ensure compliance"
"3553","with the selected asset allocation;"
"3554","    (e)  consolidating shareholder accounts in one place; and"
"3555","    (f)  other individual services."
"3556","    Individual shareholder services do not include those activities and"
"3557","expenses that are primarily intended to result in the sale of additional"
"3558","shares of the funds."
"3559","    Distribution services include any activity undertaken or expense incurred"
"3560","that is primarily intended to result in the sale of A Class, C Class or"
"3561","R Class shares, which services may include but are not limited to:"
"3562","    (a)  paying sales commissions, on-going commissions and other payments"
"3563","to brokers, dealers, financial institutions or others who sell A Class,"
"3564","C Class or R Class shares pursuant to selling agreements;"
"3565","    (b)  compensating registered representatives or other employees of"
"3566","the distributor who engage in or support distribution of the funds&#146; A Class,"
"3567","C Class or R Class shares;"
"3568","    (c)  paying and compensating expenses (including overhead and telephone"
"3569","expenses) of the distributor;"
"3570","    (d)  printing prospectuses, statements of additional information and"
"3571","reports for other-than-existing shareholders;"
"3572","    (e)  preparing, printing and distributing sales literature and advertising"
"3573","materials provided to the funds&#146; shareholders and prospective shareholders;"
"3574","    (f)  receiving and answering correspondence from prospective shareholders,"
"3575","including distributing prospectuses, statements of additional information,"
"3576","    and shareholder reports;"
"3577","    (g)  providing facilities to answer questions from prospective shareholders"
"3578","about fund shares;"
"3579","    (h)  complying with federal and state securities laws pertaining to the sale"
"3580","of fund shares;"
"3581","    (i)  assisting shareholders in completing application forms and selecting"
"3582","dividend and other account options;"
"3583","    (j)  providing other reasonable assistance in connection with the"
"3584","distribution of fund shares;"
"3585","     (k)  organizing and conducting of sales seminars and payments in the"
"3586","form of transactional and compensation or promotional incentives;"
"3587","    (l)  profit on the foregoing;"
"3588","    (m)  paying service fees for providing personal, continuing services to"
"3589","investors, as contemplated by the Conduct Rules of the FINRA; and"
"3590","    (n)  such other distribution and services activities as the advisor"
"3591","determines may be paid for by the funds pursuant to the terms of the agreement"
"3592","between the corporation and the funds&#146; distributor and in accordance with"
"3593","Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act."
"3594","Each shareholder&#146;s ability to purchase, exchange, redeem and transfer"
"3595","shares will be affected by the policies of the financial intermediary"
"3596","through which he/she does business. Some policy differences may include"
"3597","    &#149;	minimum investment requirements"
"3598","    &#149;	exchange policies"
"3599","    &#149;	fund choices"
"3600","    &#149;	cutoff time for investments"
"3601","    &#149;	trading restrictions"
"3602","    In addition, a financial intermediary may charge a transaction fee for"
"3603","the purchase or sale of fund shares. Those charges are retained by the"
"3604","financial intermediary and are not shared with American Century Investments"
"3605","or the funds."
"3606","The funds have authorized certain financial intermediaries to accept orders"
"3607","on the funds&#146; behalf. American Century has selling agreements with these"
"3608","financial intermediaries requiring them to track the time investment orders"
"3609","are received and to comply with procedures relating to the transmission of"
"3610","orders. Orders must be received by the financial intermediary on the funds&#146;"
"3611","behalf before the time the net asset value is determined in order to"
"3612","receive that day&#146;s share price. If those orders are transmitted to"
"3613","American Century and paid for in accordance with the selling agreement,"
"3614","they will be priced at the net asset value next determined after your"
"3615","request is received in the form required by the intermediary."
"3616","Unless otherwise specified below, the minimum initial investment amount to"
"3617","open an account is $2,500. Financial intermediaries may open an account"
"3618","with $250, but may require their clients to meet different investment minimums."
"3619","There is a $50 minimum for subsequent purchases. However, there is no subsequent"
"3620","purchase minimum for financial intermediaries or employer-sponsored retirement"
"3621","plans, but financial intermediaries may require their clients to meet different"
"3622","subsequent purchase requirements."
"3623","The Institutional Class shares are made available for purchase by individuals"
"3624","and large institutional shareholders such as bank trust departments,"
"3625","corporations, retirement plans, endowments, foundations and financial advisors"
"3626","that meet the fund&#146;s minimum investment requirements. Institutional Class"
"3627","shares are not available for purchase by insurance companies for variable"
"3628","annuity and variable life products."
"3629","The minimum initial investment amount for Institutional Class shares is"
"3630","$5 million ($3 million for endowments and foundations) per fund. If you"
"3631","invest with us through a financial intermediary, this requirement may be met"
"3632","if your financial intermediary aggregates your investments with those of other"
"3633","clients into a single group, or omnibus, account that meets the minimum."
"3634","The minimum investment requirement may be waived if you, or your financial"
"3635","intermediary if you invest through an omnibus account, have an aggregate"
"3636","investment in our family of funds of $10 million or more ($5 million for"
"3637","endowments and foundations), or in other situations as determined by"
"3638","American Century Investments. In addition, financial intermediaries or"
"3639","plan recordkeepers may require retirement plans to meet certain other"
"3640","conditions, such as plan size or a minimum level of assets per participant,"
"3641","in order to be eligible to purchase Institutional Class shares."
"3642","If you sell C, or in certain cases, A Class shares, you may pay a sales"
"3643","charge, depending on how long you have held your shares.  Redemption"
"3644","proceeds will be calculated using the net asset value (NAV) next"
"3645","determined after we receive a transaction request in good order."
"3646","However, we reserve the right to delay delivery of redemption proceeds"
"3647","up to seven days. For example, each time a shareholder makes an"
"3648","investment with American Century, there is a seven-day holding period"
"3649","before we will release redemption proceeds from those shares,"
"3650","unless a shareholder provides us with satisfactory proof that the"
"3651","purchase funds have cleared.  For funds with CheckWriting privileges,"
"3652","we will not honor checks written against shares subject to this"
"3653","seven-day holding period. Investments by wire generally require"
"3654","only a one-day holding period. If you change your address, we"
"3655","may require that any redemption request made within 15 days be"
"3656","submitted in writing and be signed by all authorized signers"
"3657","with their signatures guaranteed. If you change your bank"
"3658","information, we may impose a 15-day holding period before"
"3659","we will transfer or wire redemption proceeds to your bank."
"3660","Please remember, if you request redemptions by wire, $10 will"
"3661","be deducted from the amount redeemed. Your bank also may charge"
"3662","a fee.  In addition, we reserve the right to honor certain"
"3663","redemptions with securities, rather than cash."
"3664","If, during any 90-day period, a shareholder redeems fund shares"
"3665","worth more than $250,000 (or 1% of the value of a fund&#146;s assets"
"3666","if that amount is less than $250,000), we reserve the right to"
"3667","pay part or all of the redemption proceeds in excess of this"
"3668","amount in readily marketable securities instead of in cash. The"
"3669","portfolio managers would select these securities from the fund&#146;s"
"3670","portfolio."
"3671","We will value these securities in the same manner as we do in"
"3672","computing the fund&#146;s net asset value. We may provide these"
"3673","securities in lieu of cash without prior notice. Also, if payment"
"3674","is made in securities, the shareholder may have to pay brokerage"
"3675","or other transaction costs to convert the securities to cash."
"3676","If the redemption would exceed this limit and the shareholder"
"3677","would like to avoid being paid in securities, please provide us"
"3678","with an unconditional instruction to redeem at least 15 days"
"3679","prior to the date on which the redemption transaction is to occur."
"3680","The instruction must specify the dollar amount or number of shares"
"3681","to be redeemed and the date of the transaction. This minimizes"
"3682","the effect of the redemption on a fund and its remaining investors."
"3683","If the shareholder&#146;s account balance falls below the minimum initial"
"3684","investment amount for any reason, American Century Investments"
"3685","reserves the right to redeem the shares in the account and send"
"3686","the proceeds to your address of record. Prior to doing so, we will"
"3687","notify the shareholder and give him/her 60 days to meet the minimum."
"3688","Please note that shares redeemed in this manner may be subject to"
"3689","a sales charge if held less than the applicable time period.  The"
"3690","shareholder also may incur tax liability as a result of the redemption."
"3691","For Institutional Class shares, we reserve the right to convert the"
"3692","shareholder&#146;s shares to Investor Class shares of the same fund. The"
"3693","Investor Class shares have a unified management fee that is 0.20%"
"3694","higher than the Institutional Class."
"3695","Within 90 days of a redemption of any A Class shares, you may reinvest"
"3696","all of the redemption proceeds in A Class shares of any American Century"
"3697","Investments fund at the then-current net asset value without paying an"
"3698","initial sales charge. At your request, any CDSC you paid on an A Class"
"3699","redemption that you are reinvesting will be credited to your account."
"3700","You or your financial professional must notify the fund&#146;s transfer"
"3701","agent in writing at the time of the reinvestment to take advantage"
"3702","of this privilege, and you may use it only once per account. This"
"3703","privilege applies only if the new account is owned by the original"
"3704","account owner."
"3705","You may exchange shares of the fund for shares of the same class of"
"3706","another American Century fund without a sales charge if you meet the"
"3707","following criteria:"
"3708","* The exchange is for a minimum of $100"
"3709","* For an exchange that opens a new account, the amount of the"
"3710","exchange must meet or exceed the minimum account size requirement"
"3711","for the fund receiving the exchange"
"3712","For purposes of computing any applicable CDSC on shares that have been"
"3713","exchanged, the holding period will begin as of the date of purchase of"
"3714","the original fund owned. Exchanges from a money market fund are subject"
"3715","to a sales charge on the fund being purchased, unless the money market"
"3716","fund shares were acquired by exchange from a fund with a sales charge"
"3717","or by reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions."
"3718","A signature guarantee - which is different from a notarized signature -"
"3719","is a warranty that the signature presented is genuine. We may require a"
"3720","signature guarantee for the following transactions."
"3721","* You have chosen to conduct business in writing only and would like to"
"3722","redeem over $100,000."
"3723","* Your redemption or distribution check or automatic redemption is made"
"3724","payable to someone other than the account owners."
"3725","* Your redemption proceeds or distribution amount is sent by EFT (ACH"
"3726","or wire) to a destination other than your personal bank account."
"3727","* You are transferring ownership of an account over $100,000."
"3728","* You change your address and request a redemption over $100,000"
"3729","within 15 days."
"3730","* You change your bank information and request a redemption within"
"3731","15 days."
"3732","We reserve the right to require a signature guarantee for other"
"3733","transactions, at our discretion."
"3734","Investment instructions are irrevocable. That means that once you have"
"3735","mailed or otherwise transmitted your investment instruction, you may not"
"3736","modify or cancel it. Each fund reserves the right to suspend the offering"
"3737","of shares for a period of time and to reject any specific investment"
"3738","(including a purchase by exchange). Additionally, we may refuse"
"3739","a purchase if, in our judgment, it is of a size that would disrupt"
"3740","the management of a fund."
"3741","We reserve the right to change any stated investment requirement,"
"3742","including those that relate to purchases, exchanges and redemptions."
"3743","We also may alter, add or discontinue any service or privilege."
"3744","Changes may affect all investors or only those in certain classes"
"3745","or groups. In addition, from time to time we may waive a policy"
"3746","on a case-by-case basis, as the advisor deems appropriate."
