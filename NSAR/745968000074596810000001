"1196","Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1197","To the Shareholders and"
"1198","Board of Trustees of"
"1199","Federated Equity Funds"
"1200","In planning and performing our"

"1204","Fund and Federated International"
"1205"," Strategic Value Fund"

"1207","portfolio of Federated Equity"
"1208"," Funds, as of and for the year"
"1209"," ended November 30, 2009, in"
"1210","accordance with the standards"
"1211","of the Public Company Accounting"
"1212"," Oversight Board (United"
"1213","States), we considered the"
"1214","Funds' internal control over"
"1215"," financial reporting, including"
"1216","controls"
"1217","over safeguarding securities,"
"1218","as a basis for designing our"
"1219","auditing procedures for the"
"1220"," purpose of"
"1221","expressing our opinion on the"
"1222","financial statements and to"
"1223","comply with the requirements"
"1224","of Form"
"1225","N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"1226","of expressing an opinion on"
"1227","the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"1228","internal control over financial"
"1229"," reporting. Accordingly, we"
"1230"," express no such opinion."
"1231","Management of the Funds is"
"1232","responsible for establishing"
"1233","and maintaining effective internal"
"1234","control over financial reporting."
"1235"," In fulfilling this"
"1236","responsibility, estimates"
"1237","and judgments by"
"1238","management are required to"
"1239"," assess the expected benefits"
"1240"," and related costs of controls. A"
"1241","company's internal control over"
"1242"," financial reporting is a"
"1243","process designed to provide"
"1244","reasonable"
"1245","assurance regarding the"
"1246","reliability of financial"
"1247"," reporting and the preparation"
"1248","of financial"
"1249","statements for external"
"1250","purposes in accordance with"
"1251"," generally accepted accounting"
"1252","principles. A"
"1253","company's internal control"
"1254","over financial reporting includes"
"1255"," those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1256","pertain to the maintenance of"
"1257","records that, in reasonable"
"1258"," detail, accurately and fairly"
"1259","reflect the"
"1260","transactions and dispositions"
"1261"," of the assets of the company;"
"1262"," (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1263","transactions are recorded as"
"1264"," necessary to permit preparation"
"1265","of financial statements in accordance"
"1266","with generally accepted accounting"
"1267"," principles, and that receipts"
"1268"," and expenditures of the company"
"1269","are being made in accordance with"
"1270"," authorizations of management"
"1271","and directors of the company;"
"1272","and (3) provide reasonable"
"1273"," assurance regarding prevention"
"1274","or timely detection of the unauthorized"
"1275","acquisition, use, or disposition"
"1276"," of the company's assets that"
"1277","could have a material affect on the"
"1278","financial statements."
"1279","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"1280"," internal control over financial"
"1281","reporting may not prevent or"
"1282","detect misstatements. Also,"
"1283","projections of any evaluation"
"1284"," of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1285","subject to the risk that"
"1286","controls may become inadequate"
"1287"," because of changes in conditions,"
"1288"," or that"
"1289","the degree of compliance with"
"1290"," the policies or procedures may"
"1291","deteriorate."
"1292","A deficiency in internal control"
"1293","over financial reporting exists"
"1294","when the design or operation of a"
"1295","control does not allow management"
"1296"," or employees, in the normal"
"1297","course of performing their"
"1298","assigned functions, to prevent"
"1299"," or detect misstatements on a"
"1300"," timely basis. A material weakness"
"1301"," is a"
"1302","deficiency, or a combination of"
"1303","deficiencies, in internal control"
"1304","over financial reporting, such that"
"1305","there is a reasonable possibility"
"1306"," that a material misstatement of"
"1307"," the Funds' annual or interim"
"1308","financial statements will not be"
"1309"," prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1310","Our consideration of the Funds'"
"1311"," internal control over financial"
"1312","reporting was for the limited"
"1313","purpose described in the first"
"1314","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"1315"," disclose all deficiencies in"
"1316","internal control that might be"
"1317","material weaknesses under standards"
"1318"," established by the Public"
"1319","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1320","(United States). However, we noted"
"1321","no deficiencies in the"
"1322","Funds' internal control over"
"1323"," financial reporting and its"
"1324","operation, including controls over"
"1325","safeguarding securities that we"
"1326","consider to be a material weakness"
"1327","as defined above as of"
"1328","November 30, 2009."

"1348","Sub-Item 77E: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"1349","Since October 2003,"
"1350"," Federated and related"
"1351"," entities (collectively,"
"1352"," Federated), and various"
"1353","Federated funds (Funds),"
"1354"," have been named as"
"1355","defendants in several class"
"1356"," action lawsuits now pending"
"1357","in the United States District"
"1358"," Court for the District of"
"1359"," Maryland. The lawsuits were"
"1360","purportedly filed on behalf"
"1361","of people who purchased,"
"1362","owned and/or redeemed shares"
"1363","of Federated-sponsored mutual"
"1364","funds during specified periods"
"1365","beginning November 1, 1998."
"1366","The suits are generally similar"
"1367"," in alleging that Federated"
"1368","engaged in illegal and improper"
"1369","trading practices including"
"1370","market timing and late trading"
"1371"," in concert with certain"
"1372","institutional traders, which"
"1373","allegedly caused financial"
"1374"," injury to the mutual fund"
"1375","shareholders."
"1376","These lawsuits began to be"
"1377","filed shortly after Federated's"
"1378"," first public announcement that"
"1379"," it had received requests for"
"1380","information on shareholder"
"1381","trading activities in the Funds"
"1382"," from the SEC, the Office of"
"1383"," the New York State Attorney"
"1384","General (NYAG), and other"
"1385","authorities. In that regard,"
"1386","on November 28, 2005, Federated"
"1387","announced that it had reached"
"1388","final settlements with the SEC"
"1389"," and the NYAG with respect to"
"1390","those matters."
"1391","Specifically, the SEC and NYAG"
"1392"," settled proceedings against"
"1393"," three Federated subsidiaries"
"1394"," involving undisclosed market"
"1395"," timing arrangements and late"
"1396","trading. The SEC made findings:"
"1397"," that Federated Investment"
"1398","Management Company (FIMC),"
"1399","an SEC-registered investment"
"1400","adviser to various Funds,"
"1401","and Federated Securities Corp.,"
"1402"," an SEC-registered broker-dealer"
"1403"," and distributor for the Funds,"
"1404","violated provisions of the"
"1405","Investment Advisers Act"
"1406","and Investment Company Act by"
"1407"," approving, but not disclosing,"
"1408"," three market timing arrangements,"
"1409"," or the associated conflict of"
"1410"," interest between"
"1411","FIMC and the funds involved in"
"1412","the arrangements, either to other"
"1413"," fund shareholders or to the"
"1414","funds' board; and that Federated"
"1415","Shareholder"
"1416","Services Company, formerly"
"1417","an SEC-registered transfer"
"1418","agent, failed to prevent a"
"1419","customer and a Federated"
"1420","employee from late trading"
"1421","in violation"
"1422","of provisions of the Investment"
"1423"," Company Act. The NYAG found"
"1424"," that such conduct violated"
"1425"," provisions of New York State"
"1426","law. Federated entered"
"1427","into the settlements without"
"1428"," admitting or denying the regulators'"
"1429"," findings. As Federated previously"
"1430","reported in 2004, it has already paid"
"1431","approximately $8.0 million to"
"1432","certain funds as determined by"
"1433","an independent consultant. As"
"1434","part of these settlements,"
"1435","Federated agreed to pay"
"1436","disgorgement and a civil money"
"1437"," penalty in the aggregate amount"
"1438"," of an additional $72 million"
"1439","and, among other things, agreed"
"1440","that it would not"
"1441","serve as investment adviser to"
"1442","any registered investment"
"1443","company unless (i) at least"
"1444","75% of the fund's directors"
"1445","are independent of Federated,"
"1446","(ii) the chairman of each such"
"1447"," fund is independent of Federated,"
"1448"," (iii) no action may be taken by"
"1449"," the fund's board or any"
"1450","committee thereof"
"1451","unless approved by a majority"
"1452","of the independent trustees of"
"1453"," the fund or committee,"
"1454","respectively, and (iv) the"
"1455","fund appoints a senior officer who"
"1456","reports to the independent"
"1457","trustees and is responsible"
"1458"," for monitoring compliance by"
"1459","the fund with applicable laws"
"1460"," and fiduciary duties and for"
"1461","managing the process by which"
"1462","management fees charged to a"
"1463","fund are approved. The settlements"
"1464","are described in Federated's"
"1465","announcement"
"1466","which, along with previous press"
"1467"," releases and related communications"
"1468"," on those matters, is available in"
"1469"," the About Us section of Federated's"
"1470","website at FederatedInvestors.com."
"1471","Federated entities have also been"
"1472"," named as defendants in several"
"1473"," additional lawsuits that are now"
"1474"," pending in the United States"
"1475","District Court for"
"1476","the Western District of Pennsylvania,"
"1477"," alleging, among other things,"
"1478","excessive advisory and Rule 12b-1 fees."
"1479","The Board of the Funds retained the"
"1480","law firm of Dickstein Shapiro LLP"
"1481"," to represent the Funds in each"
"1482","of the lawsuits described in the"
"1483","preceding two paragraphs. Federated"
"1484"," and the Funds, and their respective"
"1485"," counsel, have been defending this"
"1486"," litigation, and none of the Funds"
"1487","remains a defendant in any of the"
"1488"," lawsuits (though some could"
"1489","potentially receive any recoveries"
"1490"," as nominal defendants). Additional"
"1491","lawsuits based"
"1492","upon similar allegations may be"
"1493"," filed in the future. The potential"
"1494"," impact of these lawsuits, all of"
"1495","which seek unquantified damages,"
"1496","attorneys' fees,"
"1497","and expenses, and future potential"
"1498","similar suits is uncertain. Although"
"1499"," we do not believe that these"
"1500","lawsuits will have a material"
"1501","adverse effect on"
"1502","the Funds, there can be no assurance"
"1503","that these suits, ongoing adverse"
"1504"," publicity and/or other developments"
"1505","resulting from the regulatory"
"1506","investigations will not result in"
"1507","increased Fund redemptions,"
"1508","reduced sales of Fund shares, or"
"1509"," other adverse consequences for the Funds."
