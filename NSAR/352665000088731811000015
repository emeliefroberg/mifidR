"1750","November 30, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the"

"1774","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"1775","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"

assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in

       Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Prudential Sector Funds, Inc.:

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of
Prudential Jennison Utility Fund (formerly Jennison Utility Fund),
a series of Prudential Sector Funds, Inc.
(formerly JennisonDryden Sector Funds, Inc.)
(hereafter referred to as the Fund),
as of and for the year ended November 30, 2010,
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we
considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,
including controls over safeguarding
securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for
the purpose of expressing our opinion on
the financial statements and to comply with the requirements
of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal
control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and
maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and
judgments by management are required
to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.
A company's internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists
when the design or operation of a control
does not allow management or employees, in the normal
course of performing their assigned functions, to
prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis.

Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting was for the limited purpose
described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily
disclose all deficiencies in internal control that
might be material weaknesses under standards established by the
Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the
Fund's internal control over financial
reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding
securities, that we consider to be a
material weakness as defined above as of November 30, 2010.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of
management and the Board of Directors of
the Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and
is not intended to be and should not be used
by anyone other than these specified parties.
