"801","SUPPLEMENT DATED JUNE 1, 2011"
"802","TO THE PROSPECTUSES DATED FEBRUARY 28, 2011"
"803","OF THE FUNDS LISTED IN SCHEDULE A"
"804","The following is added as the last line item to the Shareholder fees table"
"805","for each applicable share class in the Fees and expenses of the fund section"
"806","of the fund's Prospectus:"
"807","Small Account Fee* $15.00 * Effective September 30, 2011 (or as soon as"
"808","possible thereafter in the fund's discretion), if your shares are held in a"
"809","direct account and the value of your account is below $1,000 ($250 for"
"810","retirement plans that are not employer-sponsored), the fund may charge you a"
"811","fee of $3.75 per account that is determined and assessed quarterly (with an"
"812","annual maximum of $15.00 per account). Direct accounts generally include"
"813","accounts held in the name of the individual investor on the fund's books and"
"814","records."
"815","The following language replaces the section of the fund's Prospectus titled"
"816","Other things to know about
transactions: Small account balances/Mandatory redemptions:"
"817","Small account fees/Mandatory redemptions"
"818","Small accounts may be subject to a small account fee or to mandatory"
"819","redemption, as described below, depending on whether the account is held"
"820","directly with the fund or through a Service Agent."
"821","Direct Accounts"
"822","Direct accounts generally include accounts held in the name of the individual"
"823","investor on the fund's books and records. To offset the relatively higher"
"824","impact on fund expenses of servicing smaller direct accounts, if your shares"
"825","are held in a direct account and the value of your account is below $1,000"
"826","($250 for retirement plans that are not employer-sponsored) for any reason"
"827","(including declines in net asset value), the fund may charge you a fee of"
"828","$3.75 per account that is determined and assessed quarterly on the last"
"829","business day of the quarter (with an annual maximum of $15.00 per account)."
"830","The small account fee will be charged effective September 30, 2011 (or as soon"
"831","as possible thereafter in the fund's discretion) by redeeming shares in your"
"832","account. If the value of your account is $3.75 or less, the amount in the"
"833","account may be exhausted to pay the small account fee. The small account fee"
"834","will not be assessed on systematic investment plans until the end of the first"
"835","quarter after the account has been established for 15 months. The small"
"836","account fee, including a share redemption, also may result in tax consequences"
"837","to you (see Taxes for more information). The small account fee will not be"
"838","charged on: (i) Retirement Plans (but will be charged on other plans that are"
"839","not employer-sponsored such as traditional and Roth individual retirement"
"840","accounts, Coverdell education savings accounts, individual 403(b)(7) custodial"
"841","accounts, Keogh plans, SEPs, SARSEPs, SIMPLE IRAs or similar accounts); (ii)"
"842","Legg Mason funds that have been closed to subsequent purchases for all"
"843","classes; (iii) accounts that do not have a valid address as evidenced by mail"
"844","being returned to the fund or its agents; and (iv) Class FI, Class R, Class"
"845","R1, Class I and Class IS shares. Please see Retirement and Institutional
Investors - eligible investors for a further description of Retirement Plans."
"846","If your share class is no longer offered, you may not be able to bring your"
"847","account up to the minimum investment amount (although you may exchange into"
"848","existing accounts at other Legg Mason funds in which you hold the same share"
"849","class, to the extent otherwise permitted by those funds and subject to any"
"850","applicable sales charges). Some shareholders who hold accounts in Classes A"
"851","and B of the same fund may have those accounts aggregated for the purposes of"
"852","these calculations. Please contact the fund or your Service Agent for more"
"853","information."
"854","Non-Direct Accounts"
"855","Non-direct accounts include omnibus accounts and accounts jointly maintained"
"856","by the Service Agent and the fund. Such accounts are not subject to the small"
"857","account fee that may be charged to direct accounts. The fund reserves the"
"858","right to ask you to bring your non-direct account up to a minimum investment"
"859","amount determined by your Service Agent if the aggregate value of the fund"
"860","shares in your account is less than $500 for any reason (including solely due"
"861","to declines in net asset value and/or failure to invest at least $500 within a"
"862","reasonable period). You will be notified in writing and will have 60 days to"
"863","make an additional investment to bring your account value up to the required"
"864","level. If you choose not to do so within this 60-day period, the fund may"
"865","close your account and send you the redemption proceeds. If your share class"
"866","is no longer offered, you may not be able to bring your account up to the"
"867","minimum investment amount. Some shareholders who hold accounts in multiple"
"868","classes of the same fund may have those accounts aggregated for the purposes"
"869","of these calculations. If your account is closed, you will not be eligible to"
"870","have your account reinstated without imposition of any sales charges that may"
"871","apply to your new purchase. Please contact your Service Agent for more"
"872","information. Any redemption of fund shares may result in tax consequences to"
"873","you (see Taxes for more information)."
"874","All Accounts"
"875","The fund may, with prior notice, change the minimum size of accounts subject"
"876","to mandatory redemption,"
"877","which may vary by class, implement fees for small non-direct accounts or"
"878","change the amount of the fee for small direct accounts. Subject to applicable"
"879","law, the fund may, with prior notice, adopt other policies from time to time"
"880","requiring mandatory redemption of shares in certain circumstances."
"881","For more information, please contact your Service Agent or the fund"
"882","or consult the SAI."
"883","This supplement should be retained with your Prospectus for future"
"884","reference."

"895","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"896","The Board of Trustees"
"897","Legg Mason Partners Income Trust:"
"898","In planning and performing our audits of the Legg Mason Western"
"899","Asset Global Inflation Management Fund and Legg Mason Western"
"900","Asset Short Duration Municipal Income Fund (collectively, the"
"901","Funds), each a series of Legg Mason Partners Income Trust, as"
"902","of and for the year ended October 31, 2011, in accordance with"
"903","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"904","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"905","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"906","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"907","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"908","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"909","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"910","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"911","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"912","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"913","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"914","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"915","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"916","related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"917","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"918","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"919","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"920","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"921","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"922","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"923","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"924","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"925","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"926","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"927","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"928","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"929","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"930","and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"931","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"932","acquisition, use, or disposition of the fund's assets that could"
"933","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"934","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"935","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"936","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"937","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"938","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"939","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"940","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"941","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"942","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"943","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"944","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"945","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"946","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"947","material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial"
"948","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"949","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"950","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"951","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"952","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"953","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"954","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"955","Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"956","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that"
"957","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"958","October 31, 2011."
"959","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"960","management and the Board of Trustees of Legg Mason Partners"
"961","Income Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"962","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"963","these specified parties."
