"587","<P style=margin:0px align=center><BR></P>"
"588","<P style=margin-top:7.867px; margin-bottom:0px; padding-right:-48px align=justify>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Cognios Market Neutral Large Cap Fund and GKE Asian Opportunities Fund (collectively the &#147;Funds&#148;), each a series of ALPS Series Trust (the &#147;Trust&#148;), as of September 30, 2013 and for the periods January 2, 2013 (Commencement of Operations) through September &nbsp;30, 2013 and August 5, 2013 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2013, respectively, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the &#147;PCAOB&#148;), we considered the Funds<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font> internal control over financial reporting, including control over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font> internal control over financial reporting. &nbsp;Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</P>"
"589","<P style=margin-top:7.867px; margin-bottom:0px; padding-right:-48px align=justify>The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. &nbsp;In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. &nbsp;A company<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;). &nbsp;A company<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the company, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. &nbsp;</P>"
"590","<P style=margin-top:7.867px; margin-bottom:0px; padding-right:-48px align=justify>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. &nbsp;Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"
"591","<P style=margin-top:7.867px; margin-bottom:0px; padding-right:-48px align=justify>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. &nbsp;A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font> annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. </P>"
"592","<P style=margin-top:7.867px; margin-bottom:0px; padding-right:-48px align=justify>Our consideration of the Funds<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font> internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB. &nbsp;However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font> internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of September 30, 2013.</P>"
