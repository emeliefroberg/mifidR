"707","year ended June 30, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"708","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"709","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"710","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"711","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"712","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"713","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"714","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"715","internal control over financial reporting."
"716","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"717","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"718","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"719","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"720","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"721","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"722","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"723","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"724","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"725","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"726","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"727","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"728","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"729","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"730","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of"
"731","the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"732","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"733","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"734","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"735","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"736","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"737","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"738","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"739","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"740","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"741","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"742","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"743","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"744","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"745","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"746","on a timely basis."
"747","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"748","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"749","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"750","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"751","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"752","deficiencies in the"
"753","<PAGE>"
"754","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"755","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be material weaknesses"
"756","as defined above as of June 30, 2010."

"800","SETTLED ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO MARKET TIMING"
"801","          On October 8, 2004, Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco), successor by"
"802","merger to Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc. and INVESCO Funds Group, Inc. (IFG), both"
"803","former investment advisers, along with Invesco Aim Distributors, n/k/a Invesco"
"804","Distributors, Inc. (Invesco Distributors) reached final settlements with certain"
"805","regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York"
"806","Attorney General and the Colorado Attorney General, to resolve civil enforcement"
"807","actions and/or investigations related to market timing and related activity in"
"808","the AIM Funds (n/k/a the Invesco Funds), including those formerly advised by"
"809","IFG. As part of the settlements, a $325 million fair fund ($110 million of which"
"810","is civil penalties) was created to compensate shareholders harmed by market"
"811","timing and related activity in funds formerly advised by IFG. Additionally,"
"812","Invesco and Invesco Distributors created a $50 million fair fund ($30 million of"
"813","which is civil penalties) to compensate shareholders harmed by market timing and"
"814","related activity in funds advised by Invesco, which was done pursuant to the"
"815","terms of the settlement. The methodology of the fair funds distributions was"
"816","determined by Invesco's independent distribution consultant (IDC Plan), in"
"817","consultation with Invesco and the independent trustees of the Invesco Funds, and"
"818","approved by the SEC on May 23, 2008."
"819","          The IDC Plan provides for distribution to all eligible investors, for"
"820","the periods spanning January 1, 2000 through July 31, 2003 (for the IFG Fair"
"821","Fund) and January 1, 2001 through September 30, 2003 (for the AIM Fair Fund),"
"822","their proportionate share of the applicable Fair Fund to compensate such"
"823","investors for injury they may have suffered as a result of market timing in the"
"824","affected funds. The IDC Plan includes a provision for any residual amounts in"
"825","the Fair Funds to be distributed in the future to the affected funds. Further"
"826","details regarding the IDC Plan and distributions thereunder are available on"
"827","Invesco's Web site, available at http://www.invesco.com/us."
"828","At the present time, management of Invesco and the Invesco Funds are unable to"
"829","estimate the impact, if any, that the outcome of the Pending Litigation and"
"830","Regulatory Inquiries described herein may have on Invesco, Invesco Distributors"
"831","or the Invesco Funds."
"832","Pending Regulatory Action Alleging Market Timing"
"833","          On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Office of the State Auditor -"
"834","Securities Commission (WVASC) issued a Summary Order to Cease and Desist and"
"835","Notice of Right to Hearing to Invesco and Invesco Distributors (Order No."
"836","05-1318). The WVASC makes findings of fact that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"837","entered into certain arrangements permitting market timing of the Invesco Funds"
"838","and failed to disclose these arrangements in the prospectuses for such Funds,"
"839","and conclusions of law to the effect that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"840","violated the West Virginia securities laws. The WVASC orders Invesco and Invesco"
"841","Distributors to cease any further violations and seeks to impose monetary"
"842","sanctions, including restitution to affected investors, disgorgement of fees,"
"843","reimbursement of investigatory, administrative and legal costs and an"
"844","administrative assessment, to be determined by the Commissioner. Initial"
"845","research indicates that these damages could be limited or capped by statute. By"
"846","agreement with the Commissioner of Securities, Invesco's time to respond to that"
"847","Order has been indefinitely suspended."
"848","Private Civil Actions Alleging Market Timing"
"849","          Multiple civil lawsuits, including purported class action and"
"850","shareholder derivative suits, have been filed against various parties"
"851","(including, depending on the lawsuit, certain Invesco Funds, IFG, Invesco,"
"852","Invesco Aim Management Group, Inc., n/k/a Invesco Management Group, Inc. and"
"853","certain related entities, certain of their current and former officers and/or"

"858","allegations of improper market timing and related activity in the Invesco Funds."
"859","These lawsuits allege a variety of theories of recovery, including but not"
"860","limited to: (i) violation of various provisions of the Federal and state"
"861","securities laws; (ii) violation of various provisions of Employee Retirement"
"862","Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA); (iii) breach of fiduciary duty;"
"863","and/or (iv) breach of contract. These lawsuits were initiated in both Federal"
"864","and state courts and seek such remedies as compensatory damages; restitution;"
"865","injunctive relief; disgorgement of management fees; imposition of a constructive"
"866","trust; removal of certain directors and/or employees; various corrective"
"867","measures under ERISA; rescission of certain Funds' advisory agreements;"
"868","interest; and attorneys' and experts' fees. All lawsuits based on allegations of"
"869","market timing, late trading, and related issues have been transferred to the"
"870","United States District Court for the District of Maryland (the MDL Court) for"
"871","consolidated or coordinated pre-trial proceedings."
"872","          Pursuant to an Order of the MDL Court, plaintiffs in these lawsuits"
"873","consolidated their claims for pre-trial purposes into three amended complaints"
"874","against various Invesco - and IFG-related parties. The parties in the amended"
"875","complaints have agreed in principle to settle the actions. A list identifying"

"891","          On March 1, 2006, the MDL Court dismissed all derivative causes of"
"892","action in the Essenmacher lawsuit but two: (i) the excessive fee claim under"
"893","Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act); and (ii) the"
"894","control person liability claim under Section 48 of the 1940 Act, and all"
"895","claims asserted in the Lepera class action lawsuit but three: (i) the securities"
"896","fraud claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (ii)"
"897","the excessive fee claim under Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act (which survived only"
"898","insofar as plaintiffs seek recovery of fees associated with the assets involved"
"899","in market timing); and (iii) the control person liability claim under Section"
"900","48 of the 1940 Act. On June 14, 2006, the MDL Court entered an order dismissing"
"901","the Section 48 claim in the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuit. Based on the MDL"
"902","Court's March 1, 2006 and June 14, 2006 orders, all claims asserted against the"
"903","Funds that were transferred to the MDL Court were dismissed, although certain"
"904","Funds remain nominal defendants in the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuit. On"
"905","January 5, 2008, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle both"
"906","the class action (Lepera) and the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuits, subject to"
"907","the MDL Court approval. Individual class members have the right to object."
"908","          On September 15, 2006, Judge Motz for the MDL Court granted the"
"909","Defendants' motion to dismiss the ERISA (Calderon) lawsuit and dismissed such"
"910","lawsuit. The Plaintiff appealed this decision. On June 16, 2008, the Fourth"
"911","Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal and remanded this lawsuit back"
"912","to the MDL Court for further proceedings. On December 15, 2008, the parties"
"913","reached an agreement in principle to settle this lawsuit, subject to the MDL"
"914","Court approval. Individual class members have the right to object. No payments"
"915","are required under the settlement; however, the parties agreed that certain"
"916","limited changes to benefit plans and participants' accounts would be made."

"1179","          (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.6, Class B"
"1180","               Shares shall not convert to Class A Shares, if at the time of"

"1452","1.   DESCRIPTION OF THE REORGANIZATIONS"
"1453","     1.1. It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Reorganization"
"1454","described herein shall be conducted separately of the others, and a party that"
"1455","is not a party to a Reorganization shall incur no obligations, duties or"
"1456","liabilities with respect to such Reorganization by reason of being a party to"
"1457","this Agreement. If any one or more Reorganizations should fail to be"
"1458","consummated, such failure shall not affect the other Reorganizations in any way."
"1459","<PAGE>"
"1460","     1.2. Provided that all conditions precedent to a Reorganization set forth"
"1461","herein have been satisfied as of the Closing Date (defined in Section 3.1), and"
"1462","based on the representations and warranties each party provides to the others,"
"1463","each Target Entity and its corresponding Acquiring Entity agree to take the"
"1464","following steps with respect to their Reorganization(s), the parties to which"
"1465","and classes of shares to be issued in connection with which are set forth in"
"1466","Exhibit A:"
"1467","          (a) The Target Fund shall transfer all of its Assets, as defined and"
"1468","     set forth in Section 1.2(b), to the Acquiring Fund, and the Acquiring Fund"
"1469","     in exchange therefor shall assume the Liabilities, as defined and set forth"
"1470","     in Section 1.2(c), and deliver to the Target Fund the number of full and"
"1471","     fractional Acquiring Fund shares determined in the manner set forth in"
"1472","     Section 2."
"1473","          (b) The assets of the Target Fund to be transferred to the Acquiring"
"1474","     Fund shall consist of all assets and property, including, without"
"1475","     limitation, all cash, securities, commodities and futures interests, claims"
"1476","     (whether absolute or contingent, known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued and"
"1477","     including, without limitation, any interest in pending or future legal"
"1478","     claims in connection with past or present portfolio holdings, whether in"
"1479","     the form of class action claims, opt-out or other direct litigation claims,"
"1480","     or regulator or government-established investor recovery fund claims, and"
"1481","     any and all resulting recoveries) and dividends or interest receivable that"
"1482","     are owned by the Target Fund and any deferred or prepaid expenses shown as"
"1483","     an asset on the books of the Target Fund on the Closing Date, except for"
"1484","     cash, bank deposits or cash equivalent securities in an amount necessary to"
"1485","     pay the estimated costs of extinguishing any Excluded Liabilities (as"
"1486","     defined in Section 1.2(c)) and cash in an amount necessary to pay any"
"1487","     distributions pursuant to Section 7.1(g) (collectively, Assets)."
"1488","          (c) The Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the liabilities of the"
"1489","     Target Fund, whether accrued or contingent, known or unknown, existing at"
"1490","     the Closing Date, except for the Target Fund's Excluded Liabilities (as"
"1491","     defined below), if any, pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, with"
"1492","     respect to each Target Fund separately, Liabilities). Each Target Fund"
"1493","     will use its best efforts to discharge all known Liabilities prior to or at"
"1494","     the Valuation Date (as defined in Section 2.1(a)) to the extent possible"
"1495","     and consistent with its own investment objectives and policies and normal"
"1496","     business operations. If prior to the Closing Date the Acquiring Entity"
"1497","     identifies a liability that the Acquiring Entity and the Target Entity"
"1498","     mutually agree should not be assumed by the Acquiring Fund, such liability"
"1499","     shall be excluded from the definition of Liabilities hereunder and shall be"
"1500","     listed on a Schedule of Excluded Liabilities to be signed by the Acquiring"
"1501","     Entity and the Target Entity at Closing and attached to this Agreement as"
"1502","     Schedule 1.2(c) (the Excluded Liabilities). The Assets minus the"
"1503","     Liabilities of a Target Fund shall be referred to herein as the Target"
"1504","     Fund's Net Assets."
"1505","          (d) As soon as is reasonably practicable after the Closing, the Target"
"1506","     Fund will distribute to its shareholders of record (Target Fund
     Shareholders) the shares of the Acquiring Fund of the corresponding class"
"1507","     received by the Target Fund pursuant to Section 1.2(a), as set forth in"
"1508","     Exhibit A, on a pro rata basis within that class, and without further"
"1509","     notice the outstanding shares of the Target Fund will be redeemed and"
"1510","     cancelled as permitted by its charter and applicable law, and the Target"
"1511","     Fund will as promptly as practicable completely liquidate and dissolve."
"1512","     Such distribution and liquidation will be accomplished, with respect to"
"1513","     each class of the Target Fund's shares, by the transfer of the Acquiring"
"1514","     Fund shares of the corresponding class then credited to"

"1517","     the account of the Target Fund on the books of the Acquiring Fund to open"
"1518","     accounts on the share records of the Acquiring Fund in the names of the"
"1519","     Target Fund Shareholders of the class. The aggregate net asset value of the"
"1520","     Acquiring Fund shares to be so credited to the corresponding Target Fund"
"1521","     Shareholders shall be equal to the aggregate net asset value of the"
"1522","     corresponding Target Fund's shares owned by the Target Fund Shareholders on"
"1523","     the Valuation Date. The Acquiring Fund shall not issue certificates"
"1524","     representing shares in connection with such exchange."
"1525","          (e) Ownership of Acquiring Fund shares will be shown on its books, as"
"1526","     such are maintained by the Acquiring Fund's transfer agent."
"1527","2.   VALUATION"
"1528","     2.1. With respect to each Reorganization:"
"1529","          (a) The value of the Target Fund's Assets shall be the value of such"
"1530","     Assets computed as of immediately after the close of regular trading on the"
"1531","     New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which shall reflect the declaration of"
"1532","     any dividends, on the business day next preceding the Closing Date (the"
"1533","     Valuation Date), using the Target Fund's valuation procedures established"
"1534","     by the Target Entity's Board of Trustees, which shall be provided to the"
"1535","     Acquiring Fund prior to the Valuation Date."
"1536","          (b) The net asset value per share of each class of the Acquiring Fund"
"1537","     shares issued in connection with the Reorganization shall be the net asset"
"1538","     value per share of the corresponding class of the Target Fund as of the"
"1539","     close of business on the Valuation Date, provided that, if more than one"
"1540","     class of shares of the Target Fund is being exchanged for a single class of"
"1541","     shares of the Acquiring Fund, then the net asset value per share of such"
"1542","     class of shares of the Acquiring Fund issued in connection with the"
"1543","     Reorganization shall be the net asset value per share of the corresponding"
"1544","     class of the Target Fund having attributes most consistent with the"
"1545","     Acquiring Fund share class, as determined by the Acquiring Fund (the"
"1546","     Primary Share Class), or the net asset value of such other class of"
"1547","     shares of the Target Fund as the parties may mutually agree."
"1548","          (c) The number of shares issued of each class of the Acquiring Fund"
"1549","     (including fractional shares, if any, rounded to the nearest thousandth) in"
"1550","     exchange for the Target Fund's Net Assets shall equal the number of shares"
"1551","     of the corresponding class of the Target Fund outstanding as of the"
"1552","     Valuation Time, provided that if two or more classes of shares of the"
"1553","     Target Fund are exchanged for a single class of shares of the Acquiring"
"1554","     Fund, then the number of Acquiring Fund shares issued with respect to each"
"1555","     such Target Fund class, other than the Primary Share Class, shall equal the"
"1556","     quotient of the net asset value of such class divided by the net asset"
"1557","     value per share of the Primary Share Class, all as of the Valuation Time."
"1558","          (d) All computations of value shall be made by the Target Fund's"
"1559","     designated recordkeeping agent using the valuation procedures described in"
"1560","     this Section 2 and shall be subject to review by the Acquiring Fund's"
"1561","     recordkeeping agent and, if requested by either the Target Entity or the"
"1562","     Acquiring Entity, by the independent registered public accountant of the"
"1563","     requesting party."

"1566","3.   CLOSING AND CLOSING DATE"
"1567","     3.1. Each Reorganization shall close on June 1, 2010 or such other date as"
"1568","the parties may agree with respect to any or all Reorganizations (the Closing
Date). All acts taking place at the closing of a Reorganization (Closing)"
"1569","shall be deemed to take place simultaneously as of immediately prior to the"

"1571","Reorganization unless otherwise agreed to by the parties (the Closing Time)."
"1572","The Closing of each Reorganization shall be held in person, by facsimile, email"
"1573","or such other communication means as the parties may reasonably agree."

"1575","          (a) The Target Fund's portfolio securities, investments or other"

"1744","     prospectus or statement of additional information included in the Target"

"1746","     semi-annual financial statements for the semi-annual period next succeeding"
"1747","     the Target Fund's most recently completed fiscal year, if any, were"
"1748","     prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the"
"1749","     United States of America (GAAP) consistently applied, and such statements"
"1750","     (copies of which have been furnished or made available to the Acquiring"
"1751","     Fund) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition of"
"1752","     the Target Fund as of such date in accordance with GAAP, and there are no"
"1753","     known contingent liabilities of the Target Fund required to be reflected on"
"1754","     a balance sheet (including the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP as of"

"1759","     changes occurring in the ordinary course of business, except as otherwise"
"1760","     disclosed to and accepted by the Acquiring Fund in writing. For the"
"1761","     purposes of this subparagraph, a decline in net asset value due to declines"
"1762","     in market values of securities held by the Target Fund, the redemption of"
"1763","     the Target Fund's shares by shareholders of the Target Fund or the"
"1764","     discharge of the Target Fund's ordinary course liabilities shall not"
"1765","     constitute a material adverse change;"
"1766","          (l) On the Closing Date, all material Returns (as defined below) of"
"1767","     the Target Fund required by law to have been filed by such date (including"
"1768","     any extensions) shall have been filed and are or will be true, correct and"
"1769","     complete in all material respects, and all Taxes (as defined below) shown"
"1770","     as due or claimed to be due by any government entity shall have been paid"
"1771","     or provision has been made for the payment thereof. To the Target Fund's"
"1772","     knowledge, no such Return is currently under audit by any Federal, state,"
"1773","     local or foreign Tax authority; no assessment has been asserted with"
"1774","     respect to such Returns; there are no levies, liens or other encumbrances"
"1775","     on the Target Fund or its assets resulting from the non-payment of any"
"1776","     Taxes; no waivers of the"

"1779","     time to assess any such Taxes are outstanding nor are any written requests"
"1780","     for such waivers pending; and adequate provision has been made in the"
"1781","     Target Fund financial statements for all Taxes in respect of all periods"
"1782","     ended on or before the date of such financial statements. As used in this"
"1783","     Agreement, Tax or Taxes means (i) any tax, governmental fee or other"
"1784","     like assessment or charge of any kind whatsoever (including, but not"
"1785","     limited to, withholding on amounts paid to or by any person), together with"
"1786","     any interest, penalty, addition to tax or additional amount imposed by any"
"1787","     governmental authority (domestic or foreign) responsible for the imposition"
"1788","     of any such tax. Return means reports, returns, information returns,"
"1789","     elections, agreements, declarations, or other documents of any nature or"
"1790","     kind (including any attached schedules, supplements and additional or"
"1791","     supporting material) filed or required to be filed with respect to Taxes,"
"1792","     including any claim for refund, amended return or declaration of estimated"
"1793","     Taxes (and including any amendments with respect thereto);"
"1794","          (m) The Target Fund has elected to be a regulated investment company"
"1795","     under Subchapter M of the Code and is a fund that is treated as a separate"
"1796","     corporation under Section 851(g) of the Code. The Target Fund has qualified"
"1797","     for treatment as a regulated investment company for each taxable year since"
"1798","     inception that has ended prior to the Closing Date and will have satisfied"
"1799","     the requirements of Part I of Subchapter M of the Code to maintain such"
"1800","     qualification for the period beginning on the first day of its current"
"1801","     taxable year and ending on the Closing Date. If Target Fund serves as a"
"1802","     funding vehicle for variable contracts (life insurance or annuity), Target"
"1803","     Fund, with respect to each of its taxable years that has ended prior to the"
"1804","     Closing Date during which it has served as such a funding vehicle, has"
"1805","     satisfied the diversification requirements of Section 817(h) of the Code"
"1806","     and will continue to satisfy the requirements of Section 817(h) of the Code"
"1807","     for the period beginning on the first day of its current taxable year and"
"1808","     ending on the Closing Date. In order to (i) ensure continued qualification"
"1809","     of the Target Fund for treatment as a regulated investment company for"
"1810","     tax purposes and (ii) eliminate any tax liability of the Target Fund"
"1811","     arising by reason of undistributed investment company taxable income or net"
"1812","     capital gain, the Target Fund, unless the Target Fund has been advised by"
"1813","     the Acquiring Fund that the Acquiring Fund will deliver an opinion of"
"1814","     counsel that the Reorganization qualifies as a reorganization under Section"
"1815","     368(a)(1)(F) as provided by Section 8.6 below, before the Closing Date will"
"1816","     declare on or prior to the Valuation Date to the shareholders of Target"
"1817","     Fund a dividend or dividends that, together with all previous such"
"1818","     dividends, shall have the effect of distributing (A) all of Target Fund's"
"1819","     investment company taxable income (determined without regard to any"
"1820","     deductions for dividends paid) for the taxable year ended prior to the"
"1821","     Closing Date and substantially all of such investment company taxable"
"1822","     income for the short taxable year beginning on the first day of its current"
"1823","     taxable year and ending on the Closing Date and (B) all of Target Fund's"
"1824","     net capital gain recognized in its taxable year ended prior to the Closing"
"1825","     Date and substantially all of any such net capital gain recognized in such"
