"2281","31, 2011, in accordance with the"
"2282","standards of the Public Company"
"2283","Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"2284","States), we considered the Funds'"
"2285","internal control over financial"
"2286","reporting, including controls over"
"2287","safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"2288","for designing our auditing"
"2289","procedures for the purpose of"
"2290","expressing our opinion on the"
"2291","financial statements and to comply"
"2292","with the requirements of Form N-"
"2293","SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2294","expressing an opinion on the"
"2295","effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"2296","control over financial reporting."
"2297","Accordingly, we do not express an"
"2298","opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"2299","Funds' internal control over financial"
"2300","reporting."
"2301","The management of the Funds is"
"2302","responsible for establishing and"
"2303","maintaining effective internal control"
"2304","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"2305","this responsibility, estimates and"
"2306","judgments by management are"
"2307","required to assess the expected"
"2308","benefits and related costs of"
"2309","controls.  A fund's internal control"
"2310","over financial reporting is a process"
"2311","designed to provide reasonable"
"2312","assurance regarding the reliability of"
"2313","financial reporting and the"
"2314","preparation of financial statements"
"2315","for external purposes in accordance"

"2327","necessary to permit preparation of"
"2328","financial statements in accordance"
"2329","with generally accepted accounting"
"2330","principles, and that receipts and"

"2332","made only in accordance with"

"2334","trustees of the fund; and (3)"
"2335","provide reasonable assurance"
"2336","regarding prevention or timely"
"2337","detection of unauthorized"
"2338","acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"2339","fund's assets that could have a"
"2340","material effect on the financial"
"2341","statements."
"2342","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"2343","internal control over financial"
"2344","reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2345","misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"2346","any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"2347","future periods are subject to the risk"
"2348","that controls may become"
"2349","inadequate because of changes in"
"2350","conditions, or that the degree of"
"2351","compliance with the policies or"
"2352","procedures may deteriorate."
"2353","A deficiency in internal control over"
"2354","financial reporting exists when the"
"2355","design or operation of a control"
"2356","does not allow management or"
"2357","employees, in the normal course of"
"2358","performing their assigned functions,"
"2359","to prevent or detect misstatements"
"2360","on a timely basis.  A material"
"2361","weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2362","combination of deficiencies, in"
"2363","internal control over financial"
"2364","reporting, such that there is a"
"2365","reasonable possibility that a material"
"2366","misstatement of the Funds' annual"
"2367","or interim financial statements will"
"2368","not be prevented or detected on a"
"2369","timely basis."
"2370","Our consideration of the Funds'"
"2371","internal control over financial"
"2372","reporting was for the limited"
"2373","purpose described in the first"
"2374","paragraph and would not"
"2375","necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"2376","in internal control over financial"
"2377","reporting that might be material"
"2378","weaknesses under standards"
"2379","established by the Public Company"
"2380","Accounting Oversight Board (United"

"2382","deficiencies in the Funds' internal"
"2383","control over financial reporting and"
