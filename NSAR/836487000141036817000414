"8748","statements of Multi-Asset Portfolio (the Portfolios)"
"8749","(twenty-nine of the portfolios constituting Morgan"
"8750","Stanley Institutional Fund, Inc.) as of and for the periods"
"8751","ended December 31, 2016, in accordance with the"
"8752","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"8753","Board (United States), we considered their internal"
"8754","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"8755","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"8756","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"8757","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"
"8758","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"8759","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"8760","the Portfolios' internal control over financial reporting."
"8761","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"8762","The management of the Portfolios is responsible for"
"8763","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"8764","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"8765","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"8766","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"8767","A company's internal control over financial reporting is"
"8768","a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"8769","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"8770","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"8771","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"8772","principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"8773","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"8774","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"8775","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"8776","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"8777","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"8778","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"8779","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"8780","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"8781","company are being made only in accordance with"
"8782","authorizations of management and directors of the"
"8783","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"8784","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"8785","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"8786","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"8787","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"8788","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"8789","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"8790","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"8791","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"8792","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"8793","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"8794","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"8795","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"8796","allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"8797","of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"

"10558","       AGREEMENTS"
"10559","       Now, Therefore, the Fund and the Adviser agree"

"10565","(each a Portfolio and, collectively, the Portfolios),"
"10566","for the period and on such terms as set forth in this"
"10567","Agreement.  The Fund employs the Adviser to manage"
"10568","the investment and reinvestment of the assets of the"
"10569","Fund's Portfolios, to continuously review, supervise and"
"10570","administer the investment program of each of the"
"10571","Portfolios, to determine in its discretion the securities to"
"10572","be purchased or sold and the portion of each such"
"10573","Portfolio's assets to be held uninvested, to provide the"
"10574","Fund with records concerning the Adviser's activities"
"10575","which the Fund is required to maintain, and to render"
"10576","regular reports to the Fund's officers and Board of"
"10577","Directors concerning the Adviser's discharge of the"
"10578","foregoing responsibilities.  The Adviser shall discharge"
"10579","the foregoing responsibilities subject to the control of the"

"10582","set forth in the Fund's prospectus and applicable laws"
"10583","and regulations.  The Adviser accepts such employment"
"10584","and agrees to render the services and to provide, at its"

"10593","efforts to obtain the best available price and most"
"10594","favorable execution, except as prescribed herein.  Unless"
"10595","and until otherwise directed by the Board of Directors of"
"10596","the Fund, the Adviser may also be authorized to effect"
"10597","individual securities transactions at commission rates in"
"10598","excess of the minimum commission rates available, if"
"10599","the Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of"
"10600","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"10601","brokerage or research services provided by such broker"
"10602","or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular"
"10603","transaction or the Adviser's overall responsibilities with"
"10604","respect to the Fund.  The execution of such transactions"
"10605","shall not be deemed to represent an unlawful act or"
"10606","breach of any duty created by this Agreement or"
"10607","otherwise.  The Adviser will promptly communicate to"
"10608","the officers and Directors of the Fund such information"

"10626","of the total number of days in such quarter."
