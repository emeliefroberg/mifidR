"2086","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>		(c)	The Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's account with brokers or dealers selected by the Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the Adviser. The Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices which are advantageous to"
"2087","the Portfolio and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received. In selecting brokers or"
"2088","dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage"
"2089","and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the"
"2090","Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for"
"2091","executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess of the amount of commission another broker or"
"2092","dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of"
"2093","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or"
"2094","dealer. This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities"
"2095","which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion."

"2108","whether the Portfolio experienced better or worse performance than the Russell 3000 Utilities Index (the &quot;Index&quot;)."
"2109","The Performance Adjustment is not cumulative. An increased fee will result even though the performance of the"

"2111","period of time shorter than the performance period has been ahead of that of the Index. The Basic Fee and the Performance Adjustment will be computed as follows:"

"2118","the close of business on each business day throughout the month. The Group Fee Rate shall be determined on a cumulative basis pursuant to the following schedule:"

"2829","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	AGREEMENT made this 14th day of December, 2012, by and between FMR Co., Inc., a Massachusetts corporation with principal offices at 82 Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts (hereinafter called the &quot;Sub-Adviser&quot;) and Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, a Massachusetts corporation with principal offices at 82 Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts (hereinafter called the &quot;Adviser&quot;)."
"2830","</P>"
"2831","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Adviser has entered into a Management Contract with Fidelity Select Portfolios, a Massachusetts business trust which may issue one or more series of shares of beneficial interest (hereinafter called the"
"2832","&quot;Fund&quot;), on behalf of Fidelity Telecom and Utilities Fund (hereinafter called the &quot;Portfolio&quot;), pursuant to which the"
"2833","Adviser is to act as investment manager and adviser to the Portfolio, and"
"2834","</P>"
"2835","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	WHEREAS the Sub-Adviser was formed for the purpose of providing investment management of equity and"
"2836","high income funds and advising generally with respect to equity and high income instruments."
"2837","</P>"
"2838","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises hereinafter set forth, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser agree as follows:"
"2839","</P>"
"2840","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	1.	(a)  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to the supervision of the Adviser, direct the investments of all or"
"2841","such portion of the Portfolio's assets as the Adviser shall designate in accordance with the investment objective, policies and limitations as provided in the Portfolio's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as amended from time"
"2842","to time, the Investment Company Act of l940 and rules thereunder, as amended from time to time (the &quot;l940 Act&quot;),"
"2843","and such other limitations as the Portfolio may impose by notice in writing to the Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish for the use of the Portfolio office space and all necessary office facilities, equipment and"
"2844","personnel for servicing the investments of the Portfolio; and shall pay the salaries and fees of all personnel of the"
"2845","Sub-Adviser performing services for the Portfolio relating to research, statistical and investment activities.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with the Portfolio or the Adviser, to buy, sell,"
"2846","lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities and investment instruments on behalf of the Portfolio.  The investment policies and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times be subject to the control"
"2847","and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."
"2848","</P>"
"2849","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(b)  The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations, information or analyses to the Fund and the"
"2850","Adviser as the Fund's Board of Trustees or the Adviser may request from time to time or as the Sub-Adviser may"
"2851","deem to be desirable.  The Sub-Adviser shall make recommendations to the Fund's Board of Trustees with respect to"
"2852","Portfolio policies, and shall carry out such policies as are adopted by the Trustees.  The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to"
"2853","review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other services as the Sub-Adviser shall from time to time determine to"
"2854","be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under this Agreement and which are not otherwise furnished by the"
"2855","Adviser."
"2856","</P>"
"2857","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(c)  The Sub-Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's"
"2858","account with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the"
"2859","Adviser or Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio transactions at prices"
"2860","which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.  In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"2861","Exchange Act of l934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser, Adviser or their affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess"
"2862","of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either"
"2863","that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to"
"2864","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the"
"2865","commissions paid by the Portfolio to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were"
"2866","reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio."
"2867","</P>"
"2868","<P ID=C__\desktop\Network_Data\commocab._\legalcab._\cassica1\FMRFMron.doc.html.2 ALIGN=LEFT>	2.	As compensation for the services to be furnished by the Sub-Adviser hereunder, the Adviser agrees"
"2869","to pay the Sub-Adviser a monthly fee equal to 50% of the management fee (including performance adjustments, if"
"2870","any) that the Portfolio is obligated to pay the Adviser under the Portfolio's Management Contract with the Adviser in"
"2871","respect of that portion of the Portfolio's assets managed by the Sub-Adviser during such month.  Such fee shall not"
"2872","be reduced to reflect expense reimbursements or fee waivers by the Adviser, if any, in effect from time to time."
"2873","</P>"
"2874","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	3.	It is understood that Trustees, officers, and shareholders of the Fund are or may be or become interested in the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser as directors, officers or otherwise and that directors, officers and stockholders of the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser are or may be or become similarly interested in the Fund, and that the Adviser"
"2875","or the Sub-Adviser may be or become interested in the Fund as a shareholder or otherwise."
"2876","</P>"
"2877","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	4.	It is understood that the Portfolio will pay all its expenses other than those expressly stated to be"
"2878","payable by the Sub-Adviser hereunder or by the Adviser under the Management Contract with the Portfolio, which"
"2879","expenses payable by the Portfolio shall include, without limitation, (i) interest and taxes; (ii) brokerage commissions"
"2880","and other costs in connection with the purchase or sale of securities and other investment instruments; (iii) fees and"
"2881","expenses of the Fund's Trustees other than those who are &quot;interested persons&quot; of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser or the"
"2882","Adviser; (iv) legal and audit expenses; (v) custodian, registrar and transfer agent fees and expenses; (vi) fees and"
"2883","expenses related to the registration and qualification of the Fund and the Portfolio's shares for distribution under"
"2884","state and federal securities laws; (vii) expenses of printing and mailing reports and notices and proxy material to"
"2885","shareholders of the Portfolio; (viii) all other expenses incidental to holding meetings of the Portfolio's shareholders,"
"2886","including proxy solicitations therefor; (ix) a pro rata share, based on relative net assets of the Portfolio and other registered investment companies having Advisory and Service or Management Contracts with the Adviser, of 50% of"
"2887","insurance premiums for fidelity and other coverage; (x) its proportionate share of association membership dues; (xi)"
"2888","expenses of typesetting for printing Prospectuses and Statements of Additional Information and supplements thereto;"
"2889","(xii) expenses of printing and mailing Prospectuses and Statements of Additional Information and supplements"
"2890","thereto sent to existing shareholders; and (xiii) such non-recurring or extraordinary expenses as may arise, including"
"2891","those relating to actions, suits or proceedings to which the Portfolio is a party and the legal obligation which the"
"2892","Portfolio may have to indemnify the Fund's Trustees and officers with respect thereto."
"2893","</P>"
"2894","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	5.	The Services of the Sub-Adviser to the Adviser are not to be deemed to be exclusive, the Sub-Adviser being free to render services to others and engage in other activities, provided, however, that such other services"
"2895","and activities do not, during the term of this Agreement, interfere, in a material manner, with the Sub-Adviser's ability to meet all of its obligations with respect to rendering investment advice hereunder.  The Sub-Adviser shall for all"
"2896","purposes be an independent contractor and not an agent or employee of the Adviser or the Fund."
"2897","</P>"
"2898","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	6.	In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of obligations"
"2899","or duties hereunder on the part of the Sub-Adviser, the Sub-Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Advisor,"
"2900","the Trust or to any shareholder of the Portfolio for any act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering"
"2901","services hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security."
"2902","</P>"
"2903","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	7.	(a)	Subject to prior termination as provided in sub-paragraph (d) of this paragraph 7, this Agreement shall continue in force until July 31, 2013, and indefinitely thereafter, but only so long as"
"2904","the continuance after such period shall be specifically approved at least annually by vote of the"
"2905","Fund's Board of Trustees or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Portfolio."
"2906","</P>"
"2907","<P ALIGN=LEFT>(b)	This Agreement may be modified by mutual consent subject to the provisions of Section 15 of the"
"2908","1940 Act, as modified by or interpreted by any applicable order or orders of the Securities and"

"2915","such party, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval."
"2916","</P>"

"2918","written notice to the other parties, terminate this Agreement, without payment of any penalty, by"
"2919","action of its Board of Trustees or Directors, or by vote of a majority of its outstanding voting securities.  This Agreement shall terminate automatically upon the termination of the Management"
"2920","Contract between the Fund, on behalf of the Portfolio, and the Adviser.  This Agreement shall"
"2921","terminate automatically in the event of its assignment."
"2922","</P>"
"2923","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	8.	The Sub-Adviser is hereby expressly put on notice of the limitation of shareholder liability as set"

"3101","Portfolios:</P></FONT><FONT size=2>"
"3102","<P></P></FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia>"
"3103","<P>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Fidelity"
"3104","Select Portfolios: Fidelity Telecom and Utilities Fund as of and for the year"
"3105","ended January 31, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"3106","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust's internal"
"3107","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"3108","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"3109","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"3110","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"3111","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"3112","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's"
"3113","internal control over financial reporting.</P>"
"3114","<P>The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"3115","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"3116","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"3117","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"3118","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"3119","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"3120","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"3121","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"3122","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"3123","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"3124","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"3125","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"3126","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"3127","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Trust are being"
"3128","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"3129","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"3130","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a Trust's assets"
"3131","that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
"3132","<P>Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"3133","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"3134","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3135","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"3136","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>"
"3137","<P>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"3138","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"3139","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3140","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"3141","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"3142","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"3143","Trust's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"3144","on a timely basis.</P></FONT><FONT size=2></FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia>"
"3145","<P>Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting"
"3146","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3147","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"3148","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"3149","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"3150","deficiencies in the Trust's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"3151","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to"
"3152","be material weaknesses as defined above as of January 31, 2013.</P></FONT><FONT"
