"1537","Terms of new or amended securities"
"1538","(a)(1) High-Yield Municipal and New York Tax-Free"
"1539","each a series of the Registrant (the trust), began offering"
"1540","Institutional Class shares during the period, effective"
"1541","03/01/10."
"1542","(2) Tax-Free Bond, a series of the trust, began offering A"
"1543","and C Class shares during the period, effective 03/01/10."
"1544","Each fund is a series of shares issued by the trust, and shares of each fund"
"1545","have equal voting rights. In addition, each series"
"1546","(or fund) may be divided into separate classes. Additional funds"
"1547","and classes may be added without a shareholder vote. Each fund votes"
"1548","separately on matters affecting that fund exclusively. Voting rights"
"1549","are not cumulative, so that investors holding more than 50% of the trust"
"1550","(i.e., all funds&#146;) outstanding shares may be able to elect a Board of"
"1551","Trustees. The trustee undertakes dollar-based voting, meaning that the"
"1552","number of votes a shareholder is entitled to is based upon the dollar"
"1553","amount of the shareholder&#146;s investment. The election of trustees is determined"
"1554","by the votes received from all trustee shareholders without regard to whether"
"1555","a majority of shares of any one fund voted in favor of a particular nominee"
"1556","or all nominees as a group."
"1557","    Each shareholder has rights to dividends and distributions declared by the"
"1558","fund he or she owns and to the net assets of such fund upon its liquidation or"
"1559","dissolution proportionate to his or her share ownership interest in the fund."
"1560","Shares of each fund have equal voting rights, although each fund votes"
"1561","separately on matters affecting that fund exclusively."
"1562","    The assets belonging to each series are held separately by the custodian and"
"1563","the shares of each series represent a beneficial interest in the principal,"
"1564","earnings and profit (or losses) of investments and other assets held for each"
"1565","series. Shareholder rights are the same for all series of securities unless"
"1566","otherwise stated. Within their respective series, all shares have equal"
"1567","redemption rights. Each share, when issued, is fully paid and non-assessable."
"1568","    The A and C Class shares of the funds are made available through"
"1569","broker-dealers, banks, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries"
"1570","that provide various administrative, shareholder and distribution services."
"1571","The funds&#146; distributor enters into contracts with various banks, broker-dealers,"
"1572","insurance companies and other financial intermediaries, with respect to the sale"
"1573","of the funds&#146; shares and/or the use of the funds&#146; shares in various investment"
"1574","products or in connection with various financial services."
"1575","    Certain recordkeeping and administrative services that would otherwise be"
"1576","performed by the funds&#146; transfer agent may be performed by a plan sponsor"
"1577","(or its agents) or by a financial intermediary for A Class and C Class"
"1578","investors. In addition to such services, the financial intermediaries"
"1579","provide various individual shareholder and distribution services."
"1580","    To enable the funds&#146; shares to be made available through such plans"
"1581","and financial intermediaries, and to compensate them for such services,"
"1582","the funds&#146; Board of Trustees has adopted the A and C Class Plans."
"1583","    Pursuant to the A Class Plan, the A Class pays the funds&#146; distributor"
"1584","0.25% annually of the average daily net asset value of the funds&#146; A Class"
"1585","shares. The distributor may use these fees to pay for certain ongoing"
"1586","shareholder and administrative services and for distribution services,"
"1587","including past distribution services. This payment is fixed at 0.25% and"
"1588","is not based on expenses incurred by the distributor."
"1589","    Pursuant to the C Class Plan, the C Class pays the funds&#146; distributor"
"1590","1.00% annually of the average daily net asset value of the funds&#146; C Class"
"1591","shares, 0.25% of which is paid for certain ongoing individual shareholder"
"1592","and administrative services and 0.75% of which is paid for distribution"
"1593","services, including past distribution services. This payment is fixed at"
"1594","1.00% and is not based on expenses incurred by the distributor."
"1595","The distributor then makes these payments to the financial intermediaries"
"1596","(including underwriters and broker-dealers, who may use some of the proceeds"
"1597","to compensate sales personnel) who offer the A Class for the services"
"1598","described below. No portion of these payments is used by"
"1599","the distributor to pay for advertising, printing costs or interest expenses."
"1600","Payments may be made for a variety of individual shareholder services,"
"1601","including, but not limited to:"
"1602","(a)  providing individualized and customized investment advisory services,"
"1603","including the consideration of shareholder profiles and specific goals;"
"1604","(b)  creating investment models and asset allocation models for use by"
"1605","shareholders in selecting appropriate funds;"
"1606","(c)  conducting proprietary research about investment choices and the"
"1607","market in general;"
"1608","(d)  periodic rebalancing of shareholder accounts to ensure compliance"
"1609","with the selected asset allocation;"
"1610","(e)  consolidating shareholder accounts in one place; and"
"1611","(f)  other individual services."
"1612","Individual shareholder services do not include those activities and"
"1613","expenses that are primarily intended to result in the sale of"
"1614","additional shares of the funds."
"1615","Distribution services include any activity undertaken or expense"
"1616","incurred that is primarily intended to result in the sale of"
"1617","A Class and C Class shares, which services may include but are not"
"1618","limited to:"
"1619","(a)  paying sales commissions, on-going commissions and other"
"1620","payments to brokers, dealers, financial institutions or others who"
"1621","sell A Class and C Class shares pursuant to selling agreements;"
"1622","(b)  compensating registered representatives or other employees"
"1623","of the distributor who engage in or support distribution of the"
"1624","funds&#146; A Class and C Class shares;"
"1625","(c)  paying and compensating expenses (including overhead and"
"1626","telephone expenses) of the distributor;"
"1627","(d)  printing prospectuses, statements of additional information"
"1628","and reports for other-than-existing shareholders;"
"1629","(e)  preparing, printing and distributing sales literature and"
"1630","advertising materials provided to the funds&#146; shareholders and"
"1631","prospective shareholders;"
"1632","(f)  receiving and answering correspondence from prospective"
"1633","shareholders, including distributing prospectuses, statements"
"1634","of additional information,and shareholder reports;"
"1635","(g)  providing facilities to answer questions from prospective"
"1636","shareholders about fund shares;"
"1637","(h)  complying with federal and state securities laws pertaining"
"1638","to the sale of fund shares;"
"1639","(i)  assisting shareholders in completing application forms and"
"1640","selecting dividend and other account options;"
"1641","(j)  providing other reasonable assistance in connection with"
"1642","the distribution of fund shares;"
"1643","(k)  organizing and conducting of sales seminars and payments"
"1644","in the form of transactional and compensation or promotional"
"1645","incentives;"
"1646","(l)  profit on the foregoing;"
"1647","(m)  paying service fees for providing personal, continuing"
"1648","services to investors, as contemplated by the Conduct Rules"
"1649","of the FINRA; and"
"1650","(n)  such other distribution and services activities as the"
"1651","advisor determines may be paid for by the funds pursuant to"
"1652","the terms of the agreement between the corporation and the"
"1653","funds&#146; distributor and in accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the"
"1654","Investment Company Act."
"1655","Each shareholder&#146;s ability to purchase, exchange, redeem and"
"1656","transfer shares will be affected by the policies of the"
"1657","financial intermediary through which he/she does business."
"1658","Some policy differences may include"
"1659","    &#149;	minimum investment requirements"
"1660","    &#149;	exchange policies"
"1661","    &#149;	fund choices"
"1662","    &#149;	cutoff time for investments"
"1663","    &#149;	trading restrictions"
"1664","In addition, a financial intermediary may charge a transaction"
"1665","fee for the purchase or sale of fund shares. Those charges"
"1666","are retained by the financial intermediary and are not shared"
"1667","with American Century Investments or the funds."
"1668","    The funds have authorized certain financial intermediaries"
"1669","to accept orders on the funds&#146; behalf. American Century has"
"1670","selling agreements with these financial intermediaries requiring"
"1671","them to track the time investment orders are received and to"
"1672","comply with procedures"
"1673","relating to the transmission of orders. Orders must be received"
"1674","by the financial intermediary on the funds&#146; behalf before the"
"1675","time the net asset value is determined in order to receive"
"1676","that day&#146;s share price. If those orders are transmitted to"
"1677","American Century and paid for in accordance with the selling"
"1678","agreement, they will be priced at the net asset value next"
"1679","determined after your request is received"
"1680","in the form required by the intermediary."
"1681","    Unless otherwise specified below, the minimum initial"
"1682","investment amount to open an account is $5,000. Financial"
"1683","intermediaries may open an account with $250, but may require"
"1684","their clients to meet different investment minimums."
"1685","There is a $50 minimum for"
"1686","subsequent purchases. However, there is no subsequent purchase"
"1687","minimum for financial intermediaries, but financial intermediaries"
"1688","may require their clients to meet different subsequent purchase"
"1689","requirements."
"1690","    The Institutional Class shares are made available for purchase"
"1691","by individuals and large institutional shareholders such as bank"
"1692","trust departments, corporations, endowments, foundations and"
"1693","financial advisors that meet the fund&#146;s minimum investment"
"1694","requirements. Institutional Class shares are not available for"
"1695","purchase by insurance companies for variable annuity and variable"
"1696","life products."
"1697","    The minimum initial investment amount for Institutional"
"1698","Class shares is $5 million ($3 million for endowments and"
"1699","foundations) per fund. If you invest with us through a financial"
"1700","intermediary, this requirement may be met if your financial"
"1701","intermediary aggregates your investments with those of other"
"1702","clients into a single group, or omnibus, account that meets"
"1703","the minimum. The minimum investment requirement may be waived"
"1704","if you, or your financial intermediary if you invest through"
"1705","an omnibus account, have an aggregate investment in our family"
"1706","of funds of $10 million or more ($5 million for endowments and"
"1707","foundations), or in other situations as determined by American"
"1708","Century Investments. In addition, financial intermediaries or"
"1709","plan recordkeepers may require retirement plans to meet certain"
"1710","other conditions, such as plan size or a minimum level of assets"
"1711","per participant, in order to be eligible to purchase Institutional"
"1712","Class shares."
"1713","    If you sell C, or in certain cases, A Class shares, you may"
"1714","pay a sales charge, depending on how long you have held your shares."
"1715","Redemption proceeds will be calculated using the net asset value"
"1716","(NAV) next determined after we receive a transaction request in"
"1717","good order."
"1718","     	A fund&#146;s net asset value, or NAV, is the price of the"
"1719","fund&#146;s shares."
"1720","    However, we reserve the right to delay delivery of redemption"
"1721","proceeds up to seven days. For example, each time a shareholder"
"1722","makes an investment with American Century, there is a seven-day"
"1723","holding period before we will release redemption proceeds from"
"1724","those shares, unless a shareholder provides us with satisfactory"
"1725","proof that the purchase funds have cleared.  For funds with"
"1726","CheckWriting privileges, we will not honor checks written"
"1727","against shares subject to this seven-day holding period."
"1728","Investments by wire generally require"
"1729","only a one-day holding period. If you change your address, we"
"1730","may require that any redemption request made within 15 days"
"1731","be submitted in writing and be signed by all authorized"
"1732","signers with their signatures guaranteed. If you change your"
"1733","bank information, we may impose a 15-day holding period before"
"1734","we will transfer or wire redemption proceeds to"
"1735","your bank. Please remember, if you request redemptions by wire,"
"1736","$10 will be deducted from the amount redeemed. Your bank also"
"1737","may charge a fee.  In addition, we reserve the right to honor"
"1738","certain redemptions with securities, rather than cash."
"1739","    If, during any 90-day period, a shareholder redeems fund"
"1740","shares worth more than $250,000 (or 1% of the value of a fund&#146;s"
"1741","assets if that amount is less than $250,000), we reserve the"
"1742","right to pay part or all of the redemption proceeds in excess"
"1743","of this amount in readily marketable securities instead of in cash."
"1744","The portfolio managers would select these securities from"
"1745","the fund&#146;s portfolio."
"1746","    We will value these securities in the same manner as we do"
"1747","in computing the fund&#146;s net asset value. We may provide these"
"1748","securities in lieu of cash without prior notice. Also, if"
"1749","payment is made in securities, the shareholder may have"
"1750","to pay brokerage or other transaction costs to convert"
"1751","the securities to cash."
"1752","    If the redemption would exceed this limit and the shareholder"
"1753","would like to avoid being paid in securities, please provide"
"1754","us with an unconditional instruction to redeem at least 15 days"
"1755","prior to the date on which the redemption transaction is to occur."
"1756","The instruction must specify the dollar amount or number of"
"1757","shares to be redeemed and the date of the transaction. This"
"1758","minimizes the effect of the redemption on a fund and its"
"1759","remaining investors."
"1760","    If the shareholder&#146;s account balance falls below the minimum"
"1761","initial investment amount for any reason, American Century"
"1762","Investments reserves the right to redeem the shares in the account"
"1763","and send the proceeds to your address of record. Prior to doing so,"
"1764","we will notify the shareholder and give him/her 60 days to meet"
"1765","the minimum. Please note that shares redeemed in this manner may"
"1766","be subject to a sales charge if held less than the applicable"
"1767","time period.  The shareholder also may incur tax liability as"
"1768","a result of the redemption.  For Institutional Class shares,"
"1769","we reserve the right to convert the shareholder&#146;s shares to"
"1770","Investor Class shares of the same fund."
"1771","The Investor Class shares have a unified management fee that is"
"1772","0.20% higher than the Institutional Class."
"1773","    Within 90 days of a redemption of any A Class shares, you may"
"1774","reinvest all of the redemption proceeds in A Class shares of any"
"1775","American Century Investments fund at the then-current net asset"
"1776","value without paying an initial sales charge. At your request,"
"1777","any CDSC you paid on an A Class redemption that you are reinvesting"
"1778","will be credited to your account. You or your financial professional"
"1779","must notify the fund&#146;s transfer agent in writing at the time of the"
"1780","reinvestment to take advantage of this privilege, and you may use"
"1781","it only once per account. This privilege applies only if the new"
"1782","account is owned by the original account owner."
"1783","    You may exchange shares of the fund for shares of the same"
"1784","class of another American Century fund without a sales charge"
"1785","if you meet the following criteria:"
"1786","* The exchange is for a minimum of $100"
"1787","* For an exchange that opens a new account, the amount of the"
"1788","exchange must meet or exceed the minimum account size requirement"
"1789","for the fund receiving the exchange"
"1790","    For purposes of computing any applicable CDSC on shares that"
"1791","have been exchanged, the holding period will begin as of the date"
"1792","of purchase of the original fund owned. Exchanges from a money"
"1793","market fund are subject to a sales charge on the fund being purchased,"
"1794","unless the money market fund shares were acquired by exchange from"
"1795","a fund with a sales charge or by reinvestment of dividends or"
"1796","capital gains distributions."
"1797","    A signature guarantee - which is different from a notarized"
"1798","signature - is a warranty that the signature presented is genuine."
"1799","We may require a signature guarantee for the following transactions."
"1800","* You have chosen to conduct business in writing only and would"
"1801","like to redeem over $100,000."
"1802","* Your redemption or distribution check or automatic redemption"
"1803","is made payable to someone other than the account owners."
"1804","* Your redemption proceeds or distribution amount is sent by EFT"
"1805","(ACH or wire) to a destination other than your personal bank account."
"1806","* You are transferring ownership of an account over $100,000."
"1807","* You change your address and request a redemption over $100,000"
"1808","within 15 days."
"1809","* You change your bank information and request a redemption"
"1810","within 15 days."
"1811","We reserve the right to require a signature guarantee for other"
"1812","transactions, at our discretion."
"1813","Investment instructions are irrevocable. That means that once"
"1814","you have mailed or otherwise transmitted your investment instruction,"
"1815","you may not modify or cancel it. Each fund reserves the right to"
"1816","suspend the offering of shares for a period of time and to reject"
"1817","any specific investment (including a purchase by exchange)."
"1818","Additionally, we may refuse a purchase if, in our judgment,"
"1819","it is of a size that would disrupt the management of a fund."
"1820","We reserve the right to change any stated investment requirement,"
"1821","including those that relate to purchases, exchanges and redemptions."
"1822","We also may alter, add or discontinue any service or privilege."
"1823","Changes may affect all investors or only those in certain classes or"
"1824","groups. In addition, from time to time we may waive a policy on a"
"1825","case-by-case basis, as the advisor deems appropriate."

"1913","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1914","To the Trustees of the American Century Municipal Trust"
"1915","and Shareholders of the High-Yield Municipal Fund,"
"1916","the Long-Term Tax-Free Fund, the Tax-Free Money Market"
"1917","Fund, Tax-Free Bond Fund and the New York Tax-Free Fund:"
"1918","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1919","statements of the American Century Municipal Trust"
"1920","(the &#147;Funds&#148;)  as of and for the year ended May 31, 2010,"
"1921","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1922","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"1923","the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting,"
"1924","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"1925","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1926","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"1927","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"1928","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"1929","of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting."
"1930","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"1931","effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal control over"
"1932","financial reporting."
"1933","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"1934","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1935","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"1936","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1937","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund&#146;s"
"1938","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"1939","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1940","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1941","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"1942","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund&#146;s"
"1943","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1944","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1945","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1946","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"1947","the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"1948","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1949","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1950","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"1951","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1952","management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"1953","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1954","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1955","of a fund&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on"
"1956","the financial statements."
"1957","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1958","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1959","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1960","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1961","risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"1962","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"1963","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1964","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1965","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1966","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1967","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1968","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is"
"1969","a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1970","control over financial reporting, such that there is"
"1971","a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"1972","of the Funds&#146; annual or interim financial statements"
"1973","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1974","Our consideration of the Funds&#146; internal control over"
"1975","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"1976","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1977","all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"1978","reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"1979","standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"1980","Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"1981","deficiencies in the Funds&#146; internal control over financial"
"1982","reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"1983","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material"
"1984","weaknesses as defined above as of May 31, 2010."

"2088","distributor;"
"2089","provided, however, that a registered investment company that invests"
"2090","its assets exclusively in the shares of other registered investment"
"2091","companies shall not be a Primary Strategy Portfolio. Any exceptions"
"2092","to the above requirements shall be approved by the Board of Directors."

"2094","by the Investment Manager that is managed by the same Investment Team"
"2095","as that assigned to manage any Primary Strategy Portfolio that shares"
"2096","the same board of directors or board of trustees as the Company. Any"

"2099","(5)	An &#147;Investment Category&#148; for a Fund is the group to which the"
"2100","Fund is assigned for determining the first component of its management"

"2103","assignments for the Funds appear in Schedule B to this Agreement."
"2104","The amount of assets in each of the Investment Categories (&#147;Investment"
"2105","Category Assets&#148;) is determined as follows:"
"2106","a)	Money Market Fund Category Assets.  The assets which are used"
"2107","to determine the fee for this Investment Category is the sum of the"
"2108","assets of all of the Primary Strategy Portfolios and Secondary Strategy"
"2109","Portfolios that invest primarily in debt securities and are"
"2110","subject to Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act."
"2111","b)	Bond Fund Category Assets. The assets which are used to"

"2117","to determine the fee for this Investment Category is the sum the"

"2121","a Fund is the dollar amount resulting from applying the applicable"
"2122","Investment Category Fee Schedule for the Fund (as shown on"
"2123","Schedule A) using the applicable Investment Category Assets."
"2124","(7)	The &#147;Per Annum Investment Category Fee Rate&#148; for a Fund"
"2125","is the percentage rate that results from dividing the Per Annum"
"2126","Investment Category Fee Dollar Amount for the Fund by the"
"2127","applicable Investment Category Assets for the Fund."
"2128","(8)	The &#147;Complex Assets&#148; is the sum of the assets in all of"
"2129","the Primary Strategy Portfolios."
"2130","(9)	The &#147;Per Annum Complex Fee Dollar Amount&#148; for a class of"
"2131","a Fund shall be the dollar amount resulting from application of"
"2132","the Complex Assets to the Complex Fee Schedule for the class as"
"2133","shown in Schedule C."
"2134","(10)	The &#147;Per Annum Complex Fee Rate&#148; for a class of a Fund is"
"2135","the percentage rate that results from dividing the Per Annum Complex"
"2136","Fee Dollar Amount for the class of a Fund by the Complex Assets."
"2137","(11)	The &#147;Per Annum Management Fee Rate&#148; for a class of a Fund is"
"2138","the sum of the Per Annum Investment Category Fee Rate applicable to"
"2139","the Fund and the Per Annum Complex Fee Rate applicable to the class"

"2142","each class of each Fund shall accrue a fee calculated by multiplying"
"2143","the Per Annum Management Fee Rate for that class times the net assets"
"2144","of the class on that day, and further dividing that product by 365"
"2145","(366 in leap years)."
"2146","(d)	Monthly Management Fee Payment. On the first business day of"
"2147","each month, each class of each series Fund shall pay the management"
"2148","fee to the Investment Manager for the previous month. The fee for the"

"2150","Calculations for each calendar day in the previous month."
"2151","(e)	Additional Series or Classes. In the event that the Board of"

"3356","the Trust&#146;s principal executive office, or if published at least once"
"3357","in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where that office"

"3360","other means of written communication."
"3361","If any notice addressed to a shareholder at the address of that shareholder"
"3362","appearing on the books of the Trust is returned to the Trust by the United"
"3363","States Postal Service marked to indicate that the Postal Service is unable"
"3364","to deliver the notice to the shareholder at the address, all future notices"
"3365","or reports shall be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing"
"3366","if these shall be available to the shareholder on written demand of the"
"3367","shareholder at the principal executive office of the Trust for a period"
"3368","of one year from the date of the giving of the notice."
"3369","An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any"

"3373","Section 5.  Adjourned Meeting; Notice"
"3374","Any shareholder&#146;s meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may be"
"3375","adjourned from time to time by the vote of the majority of the shares"
"3376","represented at that meeting, either in person or by proxy."
"3377","When any meeting of shareholders is adjourned to another time or place,"
"3378","notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting at which the"
"3379","adjournment is taken, unless a new record date of the adjourned meeting"
"3380","is fixed or unless the adjournment is for more than ninety (90) days"
"3381","from the date set for the original meeting, in which case the Board"
"3382","of Trustees shall set a new record date.  Where required, notice of"
"3383","any such adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of"
"3384","record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance with"
"3385","the provisions of Section 3 and 4 of this Article II.  At any adjourned"
"3386","meeting, the Trust may transact any business which might have been"
"3387","transacted at the original meeting."
"3388","Section 6.  Voting"
"3389","The shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders"
"3390","shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the"
"3391","Declaration of Trust, as in effect at such time.  The shareholders&#146;"
"3392","vote may be by voice vote or by ballot, provided, however, that any"
"3393","election for trustees must be by ballot if demanded by any shareholder"
"3394","before the voting has begun.  On any matter other than elections of"
"3395","trustees, any shareholder may vote part of the shares in favor of the"
"3396","proposal and refrain from voting the remaining shares or vote them"
"3397","against the proposal, but if the shareholder fails to specify the"
"3398","number of shares which the shareholder is voting affirmatively,"
"3399","it will be conclusively presumed that the shareholder&#146;s approving"
"3400","vote is with respect to the total shares that the shareholder"
"3401","is entitled to vote on such proposal."
"3402","Section 7.  Waiver of Notice by Consent of Absent Shareholders"
"3403","The transactions of the meeting of shareholders, however called and"
"3404","noticed and wherever held, shall be as valid as though had at a meeting"
"3405","duly held after regular call and notice if a quorum be present either"
"3406","in person or by proxy and if either before or after the meeting,"
"3407","each person entitled to vote who was not present in person or by proxy"
"3408","signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to a holding of the"
"3409","meeting or an approval of the minutes.  The waiver of notice or"
"3410","consent need not specify either the business to be transacted or the"
"3411","purpose of any meeting of shareholders."
"3412","Attendance by a person at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver"
"3413","of notice of that meeting, except when the person objects at the"
"3414","beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because"
"3415","the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that"
"3416","attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to"
"3417","the consideration of matters not included in the notice of the meeting"
"3418","if that objection is expressly made at the beginning of the meeting."
"3419","Section 8.  Shareholder Action by Written Consent without a Meeting"
"3420","Any action which may be taken at any meeting of shareholders may be"
"3421","taken without a meeting and without prior notice if a consent in"
"3422","writing setting forth the action so taken is signed by the holders"
"3423","of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of"
"3424","votes that would be necessary to authorize or take that action at a"
"3425","meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on that action were"
"3426","present and voted.  All such consents shall be filed with the"
"3427","Secretary of the Trust and shall be maintained in the Trust&#146;s"
"3428","records.  Any shareholder giving a written consent or the"
"3429","shareholder&#146;s proxy holders or a transferee of the shares or"
"3430","a personal representative of the shareholder or their respective"
"3431","proxy holders may revoke the consent by a writing received by the"
"3432","Secretary of the Trust before written consents of the number of"
"3433","shares required to authorize the proposed action have been filed"
"3434","with the Secretary."
"3435","If the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote have not"
"3436","been solicited in writing and if the unanimous written consent"
"3437","of all such shareholders shall not have been received, the Secretary"
"3438","shall give prompt notice of the action approved by the shareholders"
"3439","without a meeting.  This notice shall be given in the manner specified"
"3440","in Section 4 of this Article II.  In the case of approval of (i)"
"3441","contracts or transactions in which a trustee has a direct or indirect"
"3442","financial interest, (ii) indemnification of agents of the Trust, and"
"3443","(iii) a reorganization of the Trust, the notice shall be given at"
"3444","least ten (10) days before the consummation of any action authorized by"
"3445","that approval."
"3446","Section 9.  Record Date for Shareholder Notice, Voting and Giving"
"3447","Consents"
"3448","For purposes of determining the shareholders entitled to notice of any"
"3449","meeting or to vote or entitled to give consent to action without a"
"3450","meeting, the Board of Trustees may fix in advance a record date which"
"3451","shall not be more than ninety (90) days nor less than ten (10) days"
"3452","before the date of any such meeting as provided in the Declaration"
"3453","of Trust."
"3454","If the Board of Trustees does not so fix a record date:"
"3455","(a)	The record date for determining shareholders entitled to"
"3456","notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be at the"
"3457","close of business on the business day next preceding the day on"
"3458","which notice is given or if notice is waived, at the close of"
"3459","business on the business day next preceding the day on which"
"3460","the meeting is held."
"3461","(b)	The record date for determining shareholders entitled"
"3462","to give consent to action in writing without a meeting, (i)"
"3463","when no prior action by the Board of Trustees has been taken,"
"3464","shall be the day on which the first written consent is given,"
"3465","or (ii) when prior"
"3466","action of the Board of Trustees has been taken, shall be at"
"3467","the close of business on the day on which the Board of Trustees"
"3468","adopt the resolution relating to that action or the seventy-fifth"
"3469","day before the date of such other action, whichever is later."
"3470","Section 10.  Proxies"
"3471","Every person entitled to vote for trustees or on any other matter"
"3472","shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more"
"3473","agents authorized by a written proxy signed by the person and filed"
"3474"," with the Secretary of the Trust.  A proxy shall be deemed signed"
"3475","if the shareholder&#146;s name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual"
"3476","signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission, or by electronic,"
"3477","telephonic, computerized or other alternative form of execution"
"3478","authorized by the Trustees) by the shareholder or the shareholder&#146;s"
"3479","attorney-in-fact.  A proxy with respect to Shares held in the name"
"3480","of two or more persons shall be valid if executed by one of them"
"3481","unless at or prior to exercise of such proxy the Trust receives"
"3482","specific written notice to the contrary from any one of them."
"3483","A proxy purporting to be exercised by or on behalf of a Shareholder"
"3484","shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise"
"3485","and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger."
"3486","A validly executed proxy which does not state that it is irrevocable"
"3487","shall continue in full force and effect unless (i) revoked by the"
"3488","person executing it before the vote pursuant to that proxy by a"
"3489","writing delivered to the Trust stating that the proxy is revoked"
"3490","or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or attendance at the meeting"
"3491","and voting in person by the person executing that proxy; or (ii)"
"3492","written notice of the death or incapacity of the maker of that"
"3493","proxy is received by the Trust before the vote pursuant to that"
"3494","proxy is counted; provided however, that no proxy shall be valid"
"3495","after the expiration of eleven (11) months from the date of the"
"3496","proxy unless otherwise provided in the proxy."
"3497","The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that"
"3498","it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of"
"3499","the General Corporation Law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,"
"3500","as if the Trust were a Massachusetts corporation."
"3501","Section 11.  Inspectors of Election"
"3502","Before any meeting of shareholders, the Board of Trustees may appoint"
"3503","any persons other than nominees for office to act as inspectors of"
"3504","election at the meeting or its adjournment.  If no inspectors of"
"3505","election are so appointed, the chairman of the meeting may and on"
"3506","the request of any shareholder or a shareholder&#146;s proxy shall,"
"3507","appoint inspectors of election at the meeting.  The number of"
"3508","inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3).  If inspectors"
"3509","are appointed at a meeting on the request of one or more shareholders"
"3510","or proxies, the holders of a majority of shares or their proxies"
"3511","present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1)"
"3512","or three (3) inspectors are to be"
"3513","appointed.  If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear"
"3514","or fails or refuses to act, the chairman of the meeting may and"
"3515","on the request of any shareholder or a shareholder&#146;s proxy,"
"3516","shall appoint a person to fill the vacancy."
"3517","These inspectors shall:"
"3518","(a)	Determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting"
"3519","power of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence"
"3520","of a quorum and the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies;"
