"881","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"882","Accounting Firm"
"883","To the Trustees of DWS Municipal Trust and Shareholders"
"884","of DWS Managed Municipal Bond Fund:"
"885","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"886","statements of DWS Managed Municipal Bond Fund (the"
"887","Fund), as of and for the year ended May 31, 2012, in"
"888","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"889","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"890","considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"891","reporting, including control activities for safeguarding"
"892","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"893","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"894","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"895","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"896","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"897","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"898","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"899","over financial reporting."
"900","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"901","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"902","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"903","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"904","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"905","A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"906","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"907","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"908","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"909","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"910","principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"911","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"912","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"913","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"914","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"915","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"916","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"917","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"918","and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"919","made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"920","management and directors of the fund; and (3)  provide"
"921","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"922","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"923","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"924","financial statements."
"925","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"926","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"927","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"928","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"929","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"930","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"931","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"932","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"933","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"934","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"935","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"936","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"937","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"938","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"939","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"940","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"941","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"942","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"943","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"944","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"945","all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting"
"946","that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"947","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"948","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies"
"949","in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and"
"950","its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"951","securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as"
"952","defined above as of May 31, 2012."

"954","of the Trustees, management, and the Securities and"
"955","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
