"2167","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"2168","Firm"
"2169","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"2170","SEI Daily Income Trust:"
"2171","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"2172","financial statements of SEI Daily Income Trust,"
"2173","comprised of the Government Fund, Government II"
"2174","Fund, Treasury Fund, Treasury II Fund, Ultra Short"
"2175","Duration Bond Fund, Short-Duration Government Fund,"
"2176","and GNMA Fund (collectively, the Funds) as of and"
"2177","for the year ended January 31, 2018, in accordance"
"2178","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"2179","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"2180","Funds internal control over financial reporting,"
"2181","including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"2182","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"2183","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"2184","financial statements and to comply with the"
"2185","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"2186","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"2187","Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"2188","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2189","Management of the Funds is responsible for"
"2190","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"2191","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"2192","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"2193","management are required to assess the expected"
"2194","benefits and related costs of controls. A companys"
"2195","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"2196","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2197","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"2198","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"2199","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2200","accounting principles. A companys internal control"
"2201","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"2202","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"2203","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"2204","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"2205","the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"2206","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2207","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"2208","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that"
"2209","receipts and expenditures of the company are being"
"2210","made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"2211","management and trustees of the company; and (3)"
"2212","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"2213","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"2214","disposition of a companys assets that could have a"
"2215","material effect on the financial statements."
"2216","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"2217","control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"2218","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"2219","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"2220","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2221","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"2222","the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"2223","procedures may deteriorate."
"2224","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"2225","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"2226","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"2227","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"2228","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"2229","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"2230","or combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"2231","over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"2232","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"2233","of the Funds annual or interim financial statements"
"2234","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2235","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"2236","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"2237","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"2238","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"2239","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"2240","standards established by the Public Company"
"2241","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However,"
"2242","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal"
"2243","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"2244","including controls over safeguarding securities that"
"2245","we consider to be a material weakness as defined"
"2246","above as of January 31, 2018."

"2319","Adopted Under Rule 17j-1"
"2320","While affirming its confidence in the integrity"
"2321","and good faith of all of its officers and"
"2322","trustees, each of SEI Liquid Asset Trust, SEI Tax"
"2323","Exempt Trust, SEI Daily Income Trust, SEI Asset"
"2324","Allocation Trust, SEI Institutional Managed"
"2325","Trust, SEI Institutional International Trust, SEI"
"2326","Institutional Investments Trust, Adviser Managed"
"2327","Trust, New Covenant Funds, SEI Insurance Products"
"2328","Trust, and SEI Catholic Values Trust (the SEI"
"2329","Trusts), as well as wholly owned subsidiaries of"
"2330","certain SEI Trusts incorporated in the Cayman"
"2331","Islands as excepted foreign companies for which"
"2332","SIMC serves as adviser (together with the SEI"
"2333","Trusts, the Trusts) recognize that the knowledge of"
"2334","present or future portfolio transactions and, in"
"2335","certain instances, the power to influence"
"2336","portfolio transactions which may be possessed by"
"2337","certain of officers, employees and trustees could"
"2338","place such individuals, if they engage in personal"
"2339","transactions in securities which are eligible for"
"2340","investment by the Trusts, in a position where"
"2341","their personal interest may conflict with that of"
"2342","the Trusts."
"2343","In view of the foregoing and of the provisions of"
"2344","Rule 17j-1(b)(1) under the Investment Company Act"
"2345","of 1940 (the 1940 Act), each Trust has determined"
"2346","to adopt this Code of Ethics to specify and"
"2347","prohibit certain types of transactions deemed to"
"2348","create conflicts of interest (or at least the"
"2349","potential for or the appearance of such a"
"2350","conflict), and to establish reporting requirements"
"2351","and enforcement procedures."
"2352","1.	Statement of General Principles."
"2353","In recognition of the trust and confidence placed"
"2354","in each Trust by its shareholders, and to give"
"2355","effect to each Trusts belief that its operations"
"2356","should be directed to the benefit of its"
"2357","shareholders, each Trust hereby adopts the following"
"2358","general principles to guide the actions of its"
"2359","trustees, officers and employees:"
"2360","a)	The interests of the Trusts shareholders are"
"2361","paramount, and all of the Trusts personnel"
"2362","must conduct themselves and their operations"
"2363","to give maximum effect to this tenet by"
"2364","assiduously placing the interests of the"
"2365","shareholders before their own."
"2366","b)	All personal transactions in securities by"
"2367","the Trusts personnel must be accomplished so"
"2368","as to avoid even the appearance of a conflict"
"2369","of interest on the part of such personnel"
"2370","with the interests of the Trusts and their"
"2371","shareholders."
"2372","c)	All of the Trusts personnel must avoid"
"2373","actions or activities that allow (or appear"
"2374","to allow) a person to profit or benefit from"
"2375","his or her position with respect to the"
"2376","Trusts, or that otherwise bring into question"
"2377","the persons independence or judgment."
"2378","d)	All of the Trusts personnel are prohibited"
"2379","from disclosing material nonpublic"
"2380","information to others or engaging in the"
"2381","purchase or sale (or recommending or"
"2382","suggesting that any person engage in the"
"2383","purchase or sale) of any security to which"
"2384","such information relates."
"2385","2.	Definitions."
"2386","a)	Access Person shall mean"
"2387","*	each director/trustee or officer of a"
"2388","Trust,"
"2389","*	each director/trustee, officer or"
"2390","employee of a Trust or any of a Trusts"
"2391","advisers or sub-advisers (or of any"
"2392","company in a Control relationship to"
"2393","the Trust or such advisers or sub-"
"2394","advisers) who, in connection with his"
"2395","or her regular functions or duties,"
"2396","makes, participates in, or obtains"
"2397","information regarding, the purchase or"
"2398","sale of a Security by each Trust or"
"2399","any series thereof (each a Fund), or"
"2400","whose functions relate to the making"
"2401","of any recommendations with respect"
"2402","to such purchases or sales,"
"2403","*	any natural person in a Control"
"2404","relationship to a Trust or any of a"
"2405","Trusts advisers or sub-advisers who"
"2406","obtains information concerning"
"2407","recommendations made to the Trust with"
"2408","respect to the purchase or sale of a"
"2409","Security by any Fund; and"
"2410","*	each director, officer or general"
"2411","partner of any principal underwriter"
"2412","for a Trust, but only where such"
"2413","person, in the ordinary course of"
"2414","business, either makes, participates"
"2415","in, or obtains information regarding"
"2416","the purchase or sale of Securities by"
"2417","the Fund(s), or whose functions"
"2418","relate to the making of"
"2419","recommendations regarding Securities"
"2420","to the Fund(s)."
"2421","b)	Automatic Investment Plan shall mean a"
"2422","program in which regular periodic purchases"
"2423","(or withdrawals) are made automatically in"
"2424","(or from) investment accounts in accordance"
"2425","with a predetermined schedule and allocation."
"2426","An Automatic Investment Plan includes a"
"2427","dividend reinvestment plan."
"2428","c)	Beneficial Ownership of a security is to be"
"2429","determined in the same manner as it is for"
"2430","purposes of Section 16 of the Securities"
"2431","Exchange Act of 1934. This means that a"
"2432","person should generally consider himself the"
"2433","beneficial owner of any securities in which he"
"2434","has a direct or indirect monetary interest."
"2435","In addition, a person should consider"
"2436","himself the beneficial owner of securities"
"2437","held by his spouse, his minor children, a"
"2438","relative who shares his home, or other"
"2439","persons by reason of any contract,"
"2440","arrangement, understanding or relationship"
"2441","that provides him with sole or shared voting"
"2442","or investment power."
"2443","d)	Control shall have the same meaning as that"
"2444","set forth in Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940"
"2445","Act. Section 2(a)(9) provides that control"
"2446","means the power to exercise a controlling"
"2447","influence over the management or policies of"
"2448","a company, unless such power is solely the"
"2449","result of an official position with such"
"2450","company. Ownership of 25% or more of a"
"2451","companys outstanding voting security is"
"2452","presumed to give the holder thereof control"
"2453","over the company. Such presumption may be"
"2454","countered by the facts and circumstances of"
"2455","a given situation."
"2456","e)	Independent Trustee means a Trustee of a"
"2457","Trust who is not an interested person of"
"2458","that Trust within the meaning of Section"
"2459","2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act."
"2460","f)	Initial Public Offering (IPO) means an"
"2461","offering of Securities registered under the"
"2462","Securities Act of 1933, the issuer of"
"2463","which, immediately before registration, was"
"2464","not"
"2465","subject to the reporting requirements of"
"2466","Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities"
"2467","Exchange Act of 1934."
"2468","g)	Private Placement means an offering that is"
"2469","exempt from registration under the Securities"
"2470","Act of 1933 pursuant to Section 4(2) or"
