       Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
The Prudential Investment Portfolios, Inc.:

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of
Prudential Asset Allocation Fund
(formerly Dryden Asset Allocation Fund)
(one of the series constituting The Prudential Investment
Portfolios, Inc., hereafter referred to as the
Fund), as of and for the year ended September 30,
2010, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we
considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,
including controls over safeguarding
securities, as a basis for designing our auditing
procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion
on
the financial statements and to comply with the
requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose
of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Fund's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Management of the Fund is responsible for
establishing and maintaining effective internal
control over
financial reporting. In fulfilling this
responsibility, estimates and judgments by management
are required
to assess the expected benefits and related costs of
controls. A company's internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control
over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the
financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A deficiency in internal control over financial
reporting exists when the design or operation of a
control
does not allow management or employees, in the normal
course of performing their assigned functions, to
prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial
reporting, such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a
material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis.

Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting was for the limited purpose
described in the first paragraph and would not
necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal
control that
might be material weaknesses under standards
established by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight
Board (United States). However, we noted no
deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over
financial
reporting and its operation, including controls over
safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a
material weakness as defined above as of September
30, 2010.

This report is intended solely for the information
and use of management and the Board of Directors of
the Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission
and is not intended to be and should not be used
by anyone other than these specified parties.

is in addition to any existing supplement
to the PAA Funds' Prospectus.

Note:  The Funds no longer utilize the old
versions of the Blend Indexes for
performance comparisons, and instead now utilize the
new versions of the Blend
Indexes.  The old versions have been discontinued
because they did not include the
Citigroup 3-Month T-Bill Index, while the new
versions of each Blend Index include
the Citigroup 3-Month T-Bill Index.  The
Citigroup 3-Month T-Bill Index was added to
reflect the recent addition of the Prudential Jennison
Market Neutral Fund as an
underlying fund investment for each of the three
Prudential Asset Allocation Funds.

"2668","4. Conservative Allocation Fund - Investments, Risks and"

second  paragraph is hereby deleted and
replaced with the following:
The Conservative Allocation Fund seeks to
achieve its investment objective by investing
primarily in Underlying Funds that invest in a
diversified portfolio of fixed income and
equity securities. The Fund under normal
circumstances will invest approximately 60%
(which may range from 55% to 65% of assets) of its total
assets in Underlying Funds that
invest primarily in fixed-income securities and the
remainder of the Fund's total assets in
Underlying Funds that invest primarily in equity securities.
The investment adviser will
monitor the Fund's investments in Underlying Funds on a regular
basis in order to
maintain the approximate allocation to each asset class.
The Fund may be appropriate for
investors who need to draw income from investments while
obtaining a measure of long-
term capital growth to offset the risk of inflation.
The Fund's focus on bonds for greater
stability of principal also may make it suitable for
conservative investors seeking income
and modest growth and those concerned about market volatility.
