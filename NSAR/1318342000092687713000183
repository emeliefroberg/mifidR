"560","<TEXT>"
"561","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"562","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"563","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"564","Investment Managers Series Trust"
"565","We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities"
"566","of the GaveKal Knowledge Leaders Fund  (the Fund)  a series of"
"567","Investment Managers Series Trust  including the schedule of"
"568","investments  as of August 31  2013  and the related statement of"
"569","operations for the year then ended  the statement of changes in net"
"570","assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and the"
"571","financial highlights for each of the two years in the period then"
"572","ended and for the period September 30  2010 (commencement of"
"573","operations) to August 31 2011. These financial statements and"
"574","financial highlights are the responsibility of the Funds management."
"575","Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial"
"576","statements and financial highlights based on our audits."
"577","We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the"
"578","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those"
"579","standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain"
"580","reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and"
"581","financial highlights are free of material misstatement.   The Fund is"
"582","not required to have nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its"
"583","internal control over financial reporting.   Our audits included"
"584","consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis"
"585","for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the"
"586","circumstances  but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"587","the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"588","reporting.   Accordingly we express no such opinion.   An audit"
"589","includes examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts"
"590","and disclosures in the financial statements.   Our procedures"
"591","included confirmation of securities owned as of August 31 2013 by"
"592","correspondence with the custodian and brokers or by other"
"593","appropriate auditing procedures where replies from brokers were not"
"594","received. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles"
"595","used and significant estimates made by management as well as"
"596","evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe"
"597","that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion."
"598","In our opinion  the financial statements and financial highlights"
"599","referred to above present fairly  in all material respects  the financial"
"600","position of GaveKal Knowledge Leaders Fund as of August 31"
"601","2013  and the results of its operations for the year then ended  and"
"602","the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period"
"603","then ended and its financial highlights for each of the two years in"
"604","the period then ended and the period September 30  2010 to August"
"605","31  2011  in conformity with accounting principles generally"
"606","accepted in the United States of America."
