"5703","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"5704","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"5705","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"5706","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"5707","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"5708","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"5709","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"5710","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"5711","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's"
"5712","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"5713","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"5714","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"5715","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"5716","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"5717","with policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"5718","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"5719","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"5720","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"5721","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"5722","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"5723","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"5724","Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"5725","detected on a timely basis."
"5726","Our consideration of Funds' internal control over financial reporting was for"
"5727","the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily"
"5728","disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weakness"
"5729","under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"5730","(United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Company's internal"
"5731","control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"5732","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material weakness as defined"
"5733","above as of February 28, 2010."
"5734","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"5735","Board of Trustees of Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"

"5817","Fund maintains investments. The Adviser will also furnish the Board with such"
"5818","statistical and analytical information with respect to securities in the Funds"

"5831","shall not relieve the Adviser of its responsibilities or liabilities hereunder"

"5833","sub-contract advisory responsibilities without the consent of the Trust. The"
"5834","cost of performance of such duties will be borne and paid by the Adviser. No"

"5844","transactions and the placing and allocation of brokerage orders as are required"
"5845","to be maintained by the Trust under the 1940 Act. The Adviser shall prepare and"
"5846","maintain, or cause to be prepared and maintained, in such form, for such periods"

"5854","authorized representatives, shall have access to such books and records at all"
"5855","times during the Adviser's normal business hours. Upon the reasonable request of"

"5877","by the Adviser, one or more Sub-Adviser(s) who are registered as investment"
"5878","advisers pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Sub-Advisers). Each"
"5879","Sub-Adviser's employment will be evidenced by a separate written agreement"
"5880","approved by the Board and, if required under the 1940 Act, by the shareholders"
"5881","of the Fund (unless the Commission or its staff has given authorization or"
"5882","issued an interpretation dispensing with the requirement of shareholder"
"5883","approval). The Adviser shall not be liable hereunder for any act or omission of"
"5884","any Sub-Adviser, except for failure to exercise good faith in the employment of"
"5885","the Sub-Adviser and for failure to exercise appropriate supervision of such"
"5886","Sub-Adviser, and as may otherwise be agreed in writing. The Adviser shall be"
"5887","solely responsible for compensating any Sub-Adviser for services rendered under"
"5888","any Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Adviser may, from time to time and at any time,"
"5889","terminate any Sub-Adviser and reassume the responsibilities assigned to such"
"5890","Sub-Adviser with respect to any Fund without obtaining the approval of the"
"5891","shareholders of the Fund."

"5894","         SECTION 5. CONTROL BY BOARD. Any investment activities undertaken by"
"5895","the Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any other activities"
"5896","undertaken by the Adviser on behalf of the Funds, shall at all times be subject"
"5897","to the direction and control of the Board."
"5898","         SECTION 6. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS. In carrying out its"
"5899","obligations under this Agreement, the Adviser shall at all times comply with:"
"5900","         (a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"5901","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"5902","         (b) the Registration Statement of the Trust, as it may be amended from"
"5903","time to time, filed with the Commission under the Securities Act and the 1940"
"5904","Act;"
"5905","         (c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it may"
"5906","be amended from time to time;"
"5907","         (d) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,"
"5908","applicable to the Trust or the Funds, and any rules and regulations adopted"
"5909","thereunder; and"
"5910","         (e)any other applicable provisions of state or federal law, and any"
"5911","rules and regulations adopted thereunder."
"5912","         SECTION 7. PROXIES. The Adviser shall have responsibility to vote"
"5913","proxies solicited with respect to issuers of securities in which assets of the"
"5914","Funds are invested in accordance with the Trust's policies on proxy voting."
"5915","         SECTION 8. BROKER-DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. In connection with the purchase"
"5916","and sale of securities for the Funds, the Adviser is responsible for"
"5917","broker-dealer selection and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The"
"5918","Adviser's primary consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to"
"5919","obtain the best price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute"
"5920","each particular transaction for a Fund, the Adviser will consider among other"
"5921","things: the best net price available, the reliability, integrity and financial"
"5922","condition of the broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in executing the"
"5923","order; and the value of the expected contribution of the broker-dealer to the"
"5924","Fund on a continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any"
"5925","transaction may be less favorable than that available from another broker-dealer"
"5926","if the difference is reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio"
"5927","execution services offered. Subject to such policies as the Board may from time"
"5928","to time determine, the Adviser shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or"
"5929","to have breached any duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by"
"5930","reason of having caused a Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage"
"5931","and research services to the Adviser an amount of commission for effecting a"
"5932","portfolio investment transaction in excess of the amount of commission another"
"5933","broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if the"
"5934","Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable"
"5935","in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such"
"5936","broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the"
"5937","overall responsibilities of the Adviser with respect to the Fund and to other"
"5938","clients of the"
"5939","                                       4"
"5940","<PAGE>"
"5941","Adviser. The Adviser is further authorized to allocate the orders placed by it"
"5942","on behalf of the Funds to brokers and dealers who also provide brokerage and"
"5943","research services within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange"
"5944","Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith. Such allocation shall be in such"
"5945","amounts and proportions as the Adviser shall determine and the Adviser will"
"5946","report on said allocations regularly to the Board, indicating the brokers to"
"5947","whom such allocations have been made and the basis therefore."
"5948","         SECTION 9. EXPENSES. All of the ordinary business expenses incurred in"
"5949","the operations of the Funds and the offering of their shares shall be borne by"
"5950","the Funds unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement. The expenses"
"5951","borne by the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage commissions,"

"5958","with membership in investment company organizations and the cost of printing"
"5959","copies of prospectuses and statements of additional information distributed to"
"5960","the Funds' shareholders."
"5961","         The Adviser shall pay its own expenses in connection with the services"
"5962","to be provided by it pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, the Adviser shall"
"5963","be responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the"
"5964","Trust: (a) to amend the Trust's registration statement or supplement the Fund's"
"5965","prospectus, and circulate the same, to reflect a change in the personnel of the"
"5966","Adviser responsible for making investment decisions in relation to a Fund; (b)"
"5967","to obtain shareholder approval of a new sub-advisory agreement as a result of a"

"6108","(i) it will use the words Wells Fargo as a component of its corporate name,"

"6117","by the Adviser, promptly take such action as may be necessary to change its"
"6118","corporate name to one not containing the words Wells Fargo and following such"
"6119","change, shall not use the words Wells Fargo, or any combination thereof, as a"
"6120","part of its corporate name or for any other commercial purpose, and shall use"
"6121","its best efforts to cause its trustees, officers and shareholders to take any"

"6126","success of any investment decision or strategy that the Adviser may use, or the"
"6127","success of the Adviser's overall management of the Funds. The Trust understands"
"6128","that investment decisions made for the Funds by the Adviser are subject to"
"6129","various market, currency, economic and business risks, and that those investment"
"6130","decisions will not always be profitable. The Adviser will manage only the"

"6132","delegated to it and which are held in the Funds' account(s) and, in making"
"6133","investment decisions for the Funds, the Adviser will not consider any other"

"7209","         SECTION 6. BROKER-DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. The Sub-Adviser is responsible"
"7210","for the purchase and sale of securities for the Funds, broker-dealer selection,"
"7211","and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Sub-Adviser's primary"
"7212","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain the best"
"7213","price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular"
"7214","transaction for a Fund, the Sub-Adviser will take the following into"
"7215","consideration: the best net price available, the reliability, integrity and"
"7216","financial condition of the broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in"
"7217","executing the order; and the value of the expected contribution of the"
"7218","broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the"
"7219","Fund in any transaction may be less favorable than that available from another"
"7220","broker-dealer if the difference is reasonably justified by other aspects of the"
"7221","portfolio execution services offered. Subject to such policies as the Trust's"
"7222","Board of Trustees may from time to time determine, the Sub-Adviser shall not be"
"7223","deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this"
"7224","Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a Fund to pay a broker"
"7225","or dealer that provides brokerage and research services to the Sub-Adviser an"
"7226","amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in excess"
"7227","of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"7228","effecting that transaction, if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that"
"7229","such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"7230","brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in"
"7231","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of"
"7232","the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund and to other clients of the"
"7233","Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser is further authorized to allocate the orders placed"
"7234","by it on behalf of the Funds to brokers and dealers who also provide research or"
"7235","statistical material, or other services to the Funds or to the Sub-Adviser. Such"
"7236","allocation shall be in such amounts and proportions as the Sub-Adviser shall"
"7237","determine and the Sub-Adviser will report on said allocations regularly to the"
"7238","Board of Trustees of the Trust indicating the brokers to whom such allocations"
"7239","have been made and the basis therefor."
"7240","         SECTION 7. EXPENSES OF THE FUND. All of the ordinary business expenses"
"7241","incurred in the operations of the Funds and the offering of their shares shall"
"7242","be borne by the Funds unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement."
"7243","These expenses borne by the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage"
"7244","commissions, taxes, legal, auditing or governmental fees, the cost of preparing"
"7245","share certificates, custodian, transfer agent and shareholder service agent"
"7246","costs, expense of issue, sale, redemption and repurchase of shares, expenses of"
"7247","registering and qualifying shares for sale, expenses relating to trustees and"
"7248","shareholder meetings, the cost of preparing and distributing reports and notices"
"7249","to shareholders, the fees and other expenses incurred by the Funds in connection"
"7250","with membership in investment company organizations and the cost of printing"
"7251","copies of prospectuses and statements of additional information distributed to"
"7252","the Funds' shareholders."
"7253","         SECTION 8. COMPENSATION. As compensation for the sub-advisory services"
"7254","provided under this Agreement, the Adviser shall pay the Sub-Adviser fees,"
"7255","payable monthly, the annual rates indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such"
"7256","Schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to time. It is understood that"
"7257","the Adviser shall be"

"7259","<PAGE>"
"7260","responsible for the Sub-Adviser's fee for its services hereunder, and the"
"7261","Sub-Adviser agrees that it shall have no claim against the Trust or the Funds"
"7262","with respect to compensation under this Agreement."
"7263","         SECTION 9. STANDARD OF CARE. The Trust and Adviser shall expect of the"
"7264","Sub-Adviser, and the Sub-Adviser will give the Trust and the Adviser the benefit"
"7265","of, the Sub-Adviser's best judgment and efforts in rendering its services to the"
"7266","Trust, and as an inducement to the Sub-Adviser's undertaking these services at"
"7267","the compensation level specified, the Sub-Adviser shall not be liable hereunder"
"7268","for any mistake in judgment. In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith,"
"7269","negligence or reckless disregard of obligations or duties hereunder on the part"
"7270","of the Sub-Adviser or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents, the"
"7271","Sub-Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Trust or to any"
"7272","shareholders in the Trust for any act or omission in the course of, or connected"
"7273","with, rendering services hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in"
"7274","the purchase, holding or sale of any security."
"7275","         SECTION 10. NON-EXCLUSIVITY. The services of the Sub-Adviser to the"
"7276","Adviser and the Trust are not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Sub-Adviser"
"7277","shall be free to render investment advisory and administrative or other services"
"7278","to others (including other investment companies) and to engage in other"
"7279","activities. It is understood and agreed that officers or directors of the"
"7280","Sub-Adviser are not prohibited from engaging in any other business activity or"
"7281","from rendering services to any other person, or from serving as partners,"
"7282","officers, directors or trustees of any other firm or trust, including other"
"7283","investment advisory companies."
"7284","         SECTION 11. RECORDS. The Sub-Adviser shall, with respect to orders the"
"7285","Sub-Adviser places for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities of the"
"7286","Funds, maintain or arrange for the maintenance of the documents and records"
"7287","required pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act as well as trade tickets and"
"7288","confirmations of portfolio trades and such other records as the Adviser or the"
"7289","Funds' Administrator reasonably requests to be maintained. All such records"
"7290","shall be maintained in a form acceptable to the Funds and in compliance with the"
"7291","provisions of Rule 31a-1 or any successor rule. All such records will be the"
"7292","property of the Funds, and will be available for inspection and use by the Funds"
"7293","and their authorized representatives (including the Adviser). The Sub-Adviser"
"7294","shall promptly, upon the Trust's request, surrender to the Funds those records"
"7295","which are the property of the Trust or any Fund. The Sub-Adviser will promptly"
"7296","notify the Funds' Administrator if it experiences any difficulty in maintaining"
"7297","the records in an accurate and complete manner."
"7298","         SECTION 12. TERM AND APPROVAL. This Agreement shall become effective"
"7299","with respect to a Fund after it is approved in accordance with the express"
"7300","requirements of the 1940 Act, and executed by the Trust, Adviser and Sub-Adviser"
"7301","and shall thereafter continue from year to year, provided that the continuation"

"8218","     SECTION 2. DUTIES OF THE SUB-ADVISER."
"8219","     (a) The Sub-Adviser shall make decisions with respect to all purchases and"

"8221","decisions, the Sub-Adviser is hereby authorized, as agent and attorney-in-fact"

"8226","and act for the Trust and instruct the Fund's custodian (the Custodian) in the"
"8227","same manner and with the same force and effect as the Trust might or could do"
"8228","with respect to such purchases, sales or other transactions, as well as with"
"8229","respect to all other things necessary or incidental to the furtherance or"
"8230","conduct of such purchases, sales or other transactions."
"8231","     The Sub-Adviser acknowledges that the Funds and other mutual funds advised"
"8232","by the Adviser (collectively, the fund complex) may engage in transactions"
"8233","with certain sub-advisers in the fund complex (and their affiliated persons) in"
"8234","reliance on exemptions under Rule 10f-3, Rule 12d3-1, Rule 17a-10 and Rule 17e-1"
"8235","under the 1940 Act. Accordingly, the Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that it will not"
"8236","consult with any other sub-adviser of a fund in the fund complex, or an"
"8237","affiliated person of a sub-adviser, concerning transactions for a fund in"
"8238","securities or other fund assets. With respect to a multi-managed Fund, the"
"8239","Sub-Adviser shall be limited to managing only the discrete portion of the Fund's"
"8240","portfolio as may be determined from time-to-time by the Board or the Adviser,"
"8241","and shall not consult with the sub-adviser as to any other portion of the Fund's"
"8242","portfolio concerning transactions for the Fund in securities or other Fund"
"8243","assets. The foregoing is in no way intended to limit the Sub-Adviser from"
"8244","serving fully in its capacity as administrator to the Dow Jones Target Date"

"8251","known by it to affect the Trust, the Fund and the Sub-Adviser, and on its own"
"8252","initiative will furnish the Board and the Adviser from time to time with such"
"8253","information as the Sub-Adviser may believe appropriate, whether concerning the"
"8254","individual companies whose securities are held by a Fund, the industries in"
"8255","which they engage, or the economic, social or political conditions prevailing in"
"8256","each country in which the Fund maintains investments. The Sub-Adviser will also"
"8257","furnish the Board and the Adviser with such statistical and analytical"
"8258","information with respect to securities held by the Fund as the Sub-Adviser may"
"8259","believe appropriate or as the Board or the Adviser reasonably request."

"8274","provided, however, that the employment of or sub-contracting to any such person"
"8275","shall not relieve the Sub-Adviser of its responsibilities or liabilities"

"8295","The Trust, or the Trust's authorized representatives (including the Adviser),"
"8296","shall have access to such books and records at all times during the"
"8297","Sub-Adviser's normal business hours. Upon the reasonable request of the Trust,"
"8298","copies of any such books and records shall be provided promptly by the"
"8299","Sub-Adviser to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives."
