"520","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"521","To the Shareholders and"
"522","The Board of Trustees of"
"523","Federated Fixed Income Securities, Inc.:"
"524","In planning and performing our audits"
"525","of the financial statements of Federated Municipal"
"526","Ultrashort Fund, a portfolio of Federated"
"527","Fixed Income Securities, Inc, (the Fund) as"
"528"," of and for"
"529","the year ended September 30, 2010, in"
"530","accordance with the standards of the Public"
"531","Company"
"532","Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"533","we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"534","financial reporting, including controls over"
"535"," safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"536"," designing our"
"537","auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"538","expressing our opinion on the financial"
"539","statements and to"
"540","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"541"," but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"542","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"543","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"544","express no such opinion."
"545","Management of the Fund is responsible for"
"546"," establishing and maintaining effective"
"547","internal control"
"548","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"549"," responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"550"," management"
"551","are required to assess the expected benefits"
"552"," and related costs of controls. A company's"
"553","internal"
"554","control over financial reporting is a process"
"555"," designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"556","regarding"
"557","the reliability of financial reporting and"
"558","the preparation of financial statements for"
"559"," external"
"560","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"561","accounting principles. A company's internal"
"562","control over financial reporting includes those"
"563"," policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"564","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"565"," accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"566","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"567"," provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"568","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"569"," financial statements in accordance with generally"
"570","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"571"," and expenditures of the company are being made"
"572","in accordance with authorizations of management"
"573"," and Trustees of the company; and (3) provide"
"574","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"575"," timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition,"
"576","use, or disposition of the company's assets that"
"577"," could have a material affect on the financial"
"578","statements."
"579","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"580","control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"581","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"582","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"583","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"584"," inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"585","the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"586"," procedures may deteriorate."
"587","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"588"," reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"589","control does not allow management or employees,"
"590"," in the normal course of performing their"
"591","assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"592"," misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"593","weakness is a"
"594","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"595","in internal control over financial reporting,"
"596","such that"
"597","there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"598","misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim"
"599","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"600"," detected on a timely basis."
"601","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control"
"602"," over financial reporting was for the limited"
"603","purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"604"," not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"605","internal control that might be material weaknesses"
"606","under standards established by the Public"
"607","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"608"," However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"609","Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"610","and its operation, including controls over"
"611","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"612"," material weakness as defined above as of"
"613","September 30, 2010."
"614","This report is intended solely for the information"
"615"," and use of management and the Board of"
"616","Trustees of Federated Fixed Income Securities, Inc"
"617"," and the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"618","and is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"619"," anyone other than those specified parties."

"630","LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"631","Since February 2004, Federated and"
"632","related entities (collectively, Federated)"
"633","have been named as"
"634","defendants in several lawsuits that are"
"635"," now pending in the United States District"
"636"," Court for the Western"
"637","District of Pennsylvania. These lawsuits"
"638","have been consolidated into a single"
"639"," action alleging excessive"
"640","advisory fees involving one of the"
"641","Federated-sponsored mutual funds (Funds)."
"642","       Federated and its counsel have"
"643"," been defending this litigation. Additional"
"644"," lawsuits based upon"
"645","similar allegations may be filed in the"
"646"," future. The potential impact of these"
"647","lawsuits, all of which seek"
"648","monetary damages, attorneys' fees and"
"649","expenses, and future potential similar"
"650","suits is uncertain. Although"
"651","we do not believe that these lawsuits"
"652","will have a material adverse effect on"
"653","the Funds, there can be no"
"654","assurance that these suits, ongoing"
"655","adverse publicity and/or other developments"
"656"," resulting from the"
"657","allegations in these matters will not"
"658","result in increased redemptions,"
"659","or reduced sales, of shares of the"
"660","Funds or other adverse consequences"
"661","for the Funds."
