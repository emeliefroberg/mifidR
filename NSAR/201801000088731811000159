"555","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"556","TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF"
"557","DIRECTORS OF FEDERATED MUNICIPAL"
"558","SECURITIES FUND, INC.:"
"559","We have audited the accompanying statement of assets"
"560","and liabilities of Federated Municipal Securities Fund,"
"561","Inc. (the Fund), including the portfolio of investments,"
"562","as of March 31, 2011, and the related statement of"
"563","operations for the year then ended, the statement of"
"564","changes in net assets for each of the two years in the"
"565","period then ended and the financial highlights for each of"
"566","the five years in the period then ended. These financial"
"567","statements and financial highlights are the responsibility"
"568","of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to"
"569","express an opinion on these financial statements and"
"570","financial highlights based on our audits."
"571","We conducted our audits in accordance with standards"
"572","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"573","(United States). Those standards require that we plan"
"574","and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance"
"575","about whether the financial statements and financial"
"576","highlights are free of material misstatement. We were"
"577","not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal"
"578","control over financial reporting. Our audits included"
"579","consideration of internal control over financial reporting"
"580","as a basis for designing audit procedures that are"
"581","appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose"
"582","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"583","Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"584","Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also"
"585","includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting"
"586","the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements"
"587","and financial highlights, assessing the accounting"
"588","principles used and significant estimates made by"
"589","management, and evaluating the overall financial"
"590","statement presentation. Our procedures included"
"591","confirmation of securities owned as of March 31, 2011,"
"592","by correspondence with the custodian and others or by"
"593","other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from"
"594","others were not received. We believe that our audits"
"595","provide a reasonable basis for our opinion."
"596","In our opinion, the financial statements and financial"
"597","highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material"
"598","respects, the financial position of Federated Municipal"
"599","Securities Fund, Inc. at March 31, 2011, the results of its"
"600","operations for the year then ended, the changes in its"
"601","net assets for each of the two years in the period then"
"602","ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five"
"603","years in the period then ended, in conformity with"
"604","U.S. generally accepted accounting principles."
