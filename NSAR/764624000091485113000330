"515","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"516","The Board of Trustees"
"517","Legg Mason Partners Income Trust:"
"518","In planning and performing our audits of the Western Asset Short Duration"
"519","Municipal"
"520","Income Fund (the Fund), a series of Legg Mason Partners Income Trust, as of"
"521","and for the"
"522","year ended October 31, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"523","Company"
"524","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"525","control over"
"526","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"527","basis for designing"
"528","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"529","financial"
"530","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"531","purpose of"
"532","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"533","financial"
"534","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"535","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"536","effective internal"
"537","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"538","estimates and judgments by"
"539","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"540","controls.  A"
"541","fund's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"542","provide reasonable"
"543","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"544","of financial"
"545","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"546","accounting"
"547","principles.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"548","policies and"
"549","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"550","detail,"
"551","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"552","of the fund; (2)"
"553","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"554","permit"
"555","preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted"
"556","accounting"
"557","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"558","in"
"559","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3)"
"560","provide"
"561","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"562","acquisition,"
"563","use, or disposition of the fund's assets that could have a material effect on"
"564","the financial"
"565","statements."
"566","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"567","may not prevent"
"568","or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"
"569","to future"
"570","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"571","changes in"
"572","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures"
"573","may deteriorate."
"574","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"575","design or operation"
"576","of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"577","performing"
"578","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
"579","basis. A material"
"580","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"581","over financial"
"582","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"583","misstatement of the"
"584","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"585","detected on a timely"
"586","basis."
"587","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"588","for the limited"
"589","purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"590","all deficiencies"
"591","in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"592","established by the"
"593","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"594","no"
"595","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"596","operation,"
"597","including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"598","material weakness"
"599","as defined above as of October 31, 2013."
"600","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"601","the Board of"
"602","Trustees of Legg Mason Partners Income Trust and the Securities and Exchange"
"603","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"604","than these"
"605","specified parties."
